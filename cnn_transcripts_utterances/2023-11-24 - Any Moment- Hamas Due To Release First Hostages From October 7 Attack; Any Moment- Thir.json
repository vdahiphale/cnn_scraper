      "sentences": "All right. The breaking news. This is the exact moment. We are expecting word that 13 hostages held by Hamas, all women and children, have been released by the terror group after 48 days of captivity.The time of release was expected to be 4:00 P.M. local time. That's 9 A.M. Eastern time, so we are standing by for information. Hamas agreed to free them in exchange for a pause in fighting, humanitarian aid, and Palestinian prisoners. According to Qatari officials who brokered the deal, Hamas will hand over these 13 hostages to Red Cross workers somewhere inside Gaza. They will then enter Israel through one of two places, either directly from Gaza, right here or further south from Egypt, down here. Once in Israel, they will be taken directly to hospitals by helicopter. Now, the larger agreement cause -- calls for a pause in fighting for four days, a total of 50 hostages of the estimated 236 being held will be freed. A U.S. official says Americans are not expected to be released today, but some are part of the four-day agreement that includes Abigail Adon, whose fourth birthday is today. She turns 4 today. She was kidnapped on October 7th by Hamas terrorists who murdered her parents. This morning, we have seen some aid trucks crossing through from Egypt, through the Rafah Crossing. Here are some images of that right there. This is part of the agreement. We have teams of reporters standing by at all the crossings and across the region. Let's get right to -- right to Kaitlan Collins in Tel Aviv. Kaitlan.",

      "sentences": "Yes, John. We are obviously watching all of this incredibly closely as we now hit the time when we heard from officials that they do expect the first release of those 13 hostages to happen.We are told by Israeli officials, including a senior advisor to Prime Minister Netanyahu, that as soon as those hostages are safely back here in Israel, that's when they will announce the list of the names of the 13 that are first in this group to be released and also that they have in confirming made it back here safely to Israel. Whereas you just laid out, John, they obviously have a very long process to go through, to reintegrate them after being held hostage for 48 days now by Hamas in Gaza. A lot of questions about what their condition is going to look like. We don't know. We've heard U.S. officials say that they are alive, but they are certainly not well given what they believe that they have been held in in these conditions. So there's major questions about that. And I should also note, it is 13 Israeli hostages that are being released. We have now just learned from the Egyptian side that they do expect 12 Thai nationals to also be released as a part of this today. Of course, those were several of the nationals that we know were kidnapped who have been working in a lot of the Kibbutzim. And so that is something we will be watching closely as well. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live at the Israel-Gaza border where we believe we could see some of these hostages start to come across. Jeremy, and obviously we're waiting for confirmation from the officials to tell us when exactly this exchange has happened both for the Israeli hostages and the Palestinian prisoners. What have you been hearing from officials and what have you been seeing from your vantage point?",

We'll continue to check back in with you. I also want to go now to CNN's chief international correspondent, Clarissa Ward, who is in Petah Tikva. That is in Israel at a children's hospital where, of course, we believe that they are preparing how to care for these people who have been held hostage for so many weeks. And, Clarissa, I think one thing that stands out is, you know, so many of these people, they -- we believe they've been held underground in these tunnels. They don't even know the full scope of what happened on October 7th. That's just part of this process of reintegrating them after they are released by Hamas.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Kaitlan. And that's why you've seen the Israeli Ministry of Welfare has put out some comprehensive guidelines for the IDF soldiers who will be the first Israelis to greet these hostages as they cross back into Israel.They have been told not to answer any questions about their loved ones. You can imagine the first question a lot of these children are going to be asking is, where's Mommy? Where's Daddy? Where's my sister? And in many cases, of course, their parents may have been killed. They may have been injured. It's obviously varies on a case-to-case basis. But basically, the IDF has been told not to answer those questions, to say simply, I can't answer that, sweetheart. But I'm taking you now somewhere safe where you will see people you know. They can give you more information. It's interesting, though, the Ministry of Welfare also said that it will be very important to tell these children very quickly what has happened and what did happen more broadly speaking on October 7th, because, of course, the minute they come back into Israel, the minute they have contact with other people, they have, you know, ability to look on their cell phones, depending on what age they are, they will start to put that puzzle together, if you will. And so it is important to deliver the news, bad news, if it is swiftly, but also in a very sensitive and humane manner. Soldiers have also been told, don't pick children up without asking their permission first. And so I think there's a very real sense that the children who were kidnapped and taken hostage on October 7th are going to be different children today as a result of the trauma that they will have inevitably endured, even if they were receiving what one might deem to be relatively good treatment. They have still been held, many of them underground separated from their loved ones for seven weeks. That has a tremendous toll. And that is something that when we talk to the hospital staff here at the Schneider Children's Medical Center that they are keenly aware of that they are trying to prepare for in the most sensitive way possible. There is obviously a growing number of journalists, a lot of them inside as well. But we are being held in a different area from where the hostages would be expected to arrive. And I should add something else, Kaitlan, which is that the hostages who are brought here, and it's expected that those hostages who have been held with their mothers, their mothers would also be brought here. There will be no separation of any families. So they will be brought here. They are expected to be the least injured, if you will. If there are hostages who have serious injuries or very serious medical attention, they will be brought to one of the number of other facilities that have been agreed upon. So a lot of anticipation right now. Members of the hospital staff telling us that they really haven't slept. They want to do everything in their power to make this as seamless as possible, Kaitlan.",

      "sentences": "Yes. They are monitoring every second of what is happening on the ground. They tell me that is by phone because they are not actively on the ground themselves, but they are clearly in touch with the stakeholders here, the parties that are integral to making this work.As part of this deal, there are very strict obligations baked in for both sides. And on the side of Hamas, the deal is that these hostages would be released around about this time today, 13 women and children to be released into the hands of the ICRC and then moved to the Israeli border. One of those border crossings that has been used before in these hostage releases. Remember, we've had two groups of hostages released earlier on in this conflict. So there is -- there is a proof of concept of how this works, but this is all being monitored from here with those who have been at the heart of this mediation. And I am told that things are going according to plan. Remember that we had a ceasefire, brokered to start at 7:00 A.M. local Gaza time, 12:00 in midnight, Eastern Time. That mostly went to plan. We did see a bit of activity until about 18 minutes past that hour, but things do look quiet on the ground. Part of the obligation was the secession of all hostilities on both sides. So that is going according to plan. A bit of a delay over the aid coming across the border. That's also very much part of this deal, this humanitarian pause for the Gaza Strip. Ninety trucks already have got through today, 200 expected. There was some delay. But, again, that is now moving. So this next stage is absolutely critical. This is the point at which we expect these hostages to be on the move. On the move out of Hamas' hands after 49 days and into the hands of the ICRC and subsequently into the hands of the IDF and to safety. This is extremely fragile. The members of this operations team working here around the clock. And they are anxious, I think it's fair to say. You wouldn't know that. If you spoke to them, they are absolutely focused on what is going on, but I know that this has been an incredibly intense time of negotiations. Incredibly complicated. They've made all the more difficult they tell me here in Qatar by the escalation in violence. So the obligations now are understood by both sides. A pause in fighting, the exchange of these hostages for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and the opening of that border for the efficient and effective movement of aid into Gaza. So we now have to wait and see whether this works, one hopes it does for the families who will now know which hostages are being released today, whether this works and whether those families, at least and those hostages, get some relief from this trauma.

And, Oren, we just learned, you know, we were talking about in Doha, how -- the officials who helped mediate this deal are watching very closely. We've also learned that Prime Minister Netanyahu, Defense Minister Gallant, they're also watching from a military intelligence room, watching. Essentially, it feels like everyone is so closely to see how this first transfer of these hostages goes, which we have not gotten word yet that they -- the hostages have made it here to Israel. What are you learning about how Israeli officials are monitoring this to see just how closely this is handled and how it goes according to the agreement that was struck between Hamas and Israel?",

They were asked that they were confident that this could be extended. And this spokesperson for the foreign ministry said, hopeful. Wouldn't say confident.So that gives you an idea of how much essentially belief there is that this can be extended, especially even before we've seen the first 24 hours go into effect. There is a hope that it can be, that more Israeli hostages can be released from Hamas captivity. More Palestinian prisoners can be released from Israeli prisons. But we have to get there first. And the Qatari foreign ministry said, on day three on day four, we can begin to have those conversations about extending this. It's also worth noting that the agreement covers the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners. But Israel put out a list of 300. So it seems from that perspective, they're also preparing for the possibility of releasing more Palestinian prisoners. If this is extended on that day- by-day basis with 10 Israeli hostages released on a daily basis.",

And the idea that some of these hostages may be coming home. You can even hear from families of other hostages who got a call from the Israeli government yesterday, saying, your loved one is not going to be in this first group of 13. They are still happy for the other families because these families have been spending so much time together. You often hear them say, you know, I have 240 other family members now. Other families that they've been spending so much time with because they're the only people who know what it's like, what --they've been going through the hell that they've been living through for these last several weeks as they are watching so closely to see if this deal does go through in the next hour.",

You're dealing with terrorist organizations, not only Hamas, but Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which on the continuum of, you know, Islamist Jihadi terrorist organizations, they're much further up the spectrum. So they've broken truces before, violated ceasefire that were not theirs, and they're Islamists. They, you know, are committed to destroying Israel. So they could ruin this for everybody and also was just reported. The communication to the local Gazan population, where they have to hold fast.
