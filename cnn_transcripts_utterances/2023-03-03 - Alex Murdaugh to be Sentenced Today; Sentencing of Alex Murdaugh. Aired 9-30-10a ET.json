      "sentences": "Yes, Erica, Jim, I also just saw Defense Attorney Jim Griffin arrive as well. So, proceedings are supposed to be getting underway any moment now. We do know the attorneys are here. So, that's usually a good sign that things are going in the right direction for them to begin.I spoke with Attorney General Alan Wilson, who was not the lead prosecutor on this case, even though it was his office. That was Creighton Waters. But Attorney General Alan Wilson did do some cross- examination during this, and he said that he was happy to allow Creighton Waters to do this. He had been diligent about this case for more than a year. He described to me sort of staying at the same hotel in Walterboro that all of us are staying at right now, this Hampton Inn, calling it almost like a dorm room life where they were all staying up to midnight, going over the case, revising how they were going to do things. And he said that - you know, he acknowledged, as they have the entire time, the defense trying to create this idea that there would be too much reasonable doubt because much of the case was built on circumstantial evidence. But Attorney General Wilson says that even though there were circumstantial evidence, Alex Murdaugh choosing to get on the stand, coupled with that video found on Paul's phone with Alex's voice putting him at the kennels minutes before the state says Paul and Maggie were murdered, is what he believes got them this guilty verdict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALAN WILSON, SOUTH CAROLINA ATTORNEY GENERAL: This was a circumstantial evidence case, but we -- what people have to understand, circumstantial evidence is just as powerful as direct evidence. You know, as you've heard, I think the kennel video hung him. And I think when he took the stand and they heard his voice and they heard him try to manipulate them -- remember, Alex Murdaugh is someone who is a master manipulator and liar and he had spent his career being very theatrical in front of juries, giving closing arguments and getting great verdicts for his clients. This was his closing - this is his closing argument in his own murder trial. And I think the jury saw what he was -- how he was trying to manipulate them, saw how he was lying, and they read through it, and they heard the kennel video and they made the right decision.

      "sentences": "Dianne Gallagher, outside the courthouse, thanks so much.Let's bring back Joey Jackson and Sarah Ford as we await the judge to enter the courtroom. Sarah, I do want to go to you because there's a broader issue here, the influence that the Murdaugh family had in these counties for more than 100 years. Former U.S. attorney for South Carolina, Bill Nettles, he said last night that with this case you have an example perhaps of the end of a situation where there were, in his words, no checks or balances on unbridled power. He described it as taking the foot of justice off the throat of those counties there. Can you explain that broader context? I mean did the Murdaugh family highly involved in this county for so many years with great influence on how the law was applied and here him facing justice.",

You know, from a family that were elected prosecutors for decades, a century, and then their son, their grandson, potentially being sentenced to life in prison today. It's tremendous.You know, it also goes to show how power and privilege, they're no longer unchecked in Colleton County and in South Carolina. And so often we see how folks with power and privilege are able to avoid justice, but I'm very pleased to see the result of this jury, how they listened diligently to all of the evidence and how they weren't influenced by the prestige and the power that the Murdaugh family held over Colleton county and the low county of South Carolina anymore.",

You know, a notice of alibi was filed in this case by council in November. And we conducted a hearing, a pretrial hearing, in which you claimed to have been someplace else at the time the crime was committed. Then, after all of the witnesses placed you at the scene of the crime, at the last minutes, or last minutes or days you switched courses and admitted to being there. And then that necessitated more lies and continued to lie. And - and I said where will it end. It's already ended for many who have heard you and concluded that it will never end. But within your own soul you have to deal with that. And I know you have to see Paul and Maggie during the nighttime when you're attempting to go to sleep. I'm sure they come and visit you.

And it's so unfortunate because you had such a lovely family of such friendly people, including you. And to go from that to this.You know, your license to practice law has been stripped away from you. You turned from lawyer to witness. And now have an opportunity to make your final appeal as an ex-lawyer. And it's almost - it's really surprising that you are waiving this right at this time. And if you opt to do so, it's on you.
