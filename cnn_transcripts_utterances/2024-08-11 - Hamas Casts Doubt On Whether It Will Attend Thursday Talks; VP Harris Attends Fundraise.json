Hamas has just issued a new statement expressing frustration over the continued violence against Palestinians despite ongoing mediation efforts. And now they say they want mediation based on previous ceasefire talks. This is complicating the situation big time. We have teams of our reporters covering the latest developments on these very high pressure negotiations. And I want to start with CNN's Jeremy Diamond. He's joining us live from Haifa in northern Israel for us. Jeremy, what's the latest you're hearing from Hamas and your sources?",

They say the movement demands the mediators to present a plan to implement what they presented to the movements and agreed upon on July 2nd, 2024, based on Biden's vision and the U.N. Security Council resolution, and to compel the occupation to do so instead of going for further negotiation rounds or new proposals. They say, Wolf, that they've arrived at this latest stance following an Israeli attack yesterday on a school in Gaza that killed at least 90 people, according to local officials. The Israeli military claims that it was targeting a Hamas compound but in images from the scene, you can see that there were many women and children among the dead and the injured. I'm also told by sources that Israeli officials were told by the Egyptian and the Qatari mediators in recent days that Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' political leader, does want a deal. He does want to get to a ceasefire, but the question, Wolf, as we are now learning, is exactly what kind of deal, which version of this framework proposal that President Biden has been talking about over the last couple of months does Hamas actually want to agree to. And the same question can be posed of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who publicly has also indicated that he is willing to get to a first phase of an agreement even as he indicates that the war will eventually resume in Gaza. I'm told Wolf that there are questions about exactly whether or not the Israeli prime minister wants a deal. Privately his allies are telling Israeli government officials as well as journalists that the Israeli prime minister does want to reach a deal, even if it upends his right-wing coalition government. But the Israel security establishment, which has been pushing the Israeli prime minister for weeks now to agree to a ceasefire agreement, they still remain skeptical of Netanyahu's intentions. What is clear, though Wolf, is that all of this is coming in the context of potential attacks by Hezbollah as well as by Iran with this summit on Thursday coming up in just a matter of days. And so will we even get to those negotiations? Will Hamas attend and even if they don't, you know, will these potential attacks by Iran and Hezbollah upend any potential progress that could be on the horizon? All of that, Wolf, are the key questions that officials here are very much watching over the coming hours and days.",

It would be a retaliation that could potentially kill civilians. Worse potentially than what we saw in April. Israel would respond. Hezbollah would also respond for the killing of one of their top officials at the same time as the Hamas official was killed in Tehran a week and a half ago.And that also could have led to an absolute escalation with Lebanon. And these things are still real. They're still potential, they still could happen. The notion that a ceasefire deal over Gaza could be moved forward and that Prime Minister Netanyahu might make concessions that he hadn't made before was really what last Sunday caused Iran to sit back and pause and take a beat. But it's becoming clear now that as we get closer to the potential for these talks this week that they may no longer have faith in what's on the table. Hamas is saying they're not going, that they feel that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not going to give them what they want. This is all, to a degree, posturing. The expectation I think through these tourists and speaking with the Jordanian foreign minister at that big meeting of regional foreign ministers in Jeddah, that was so important earlier on in the week. He stressed that it was important that there were concessions made on the Israeli side to keep Iran happy. And I put it to him. That's only going to be with the United States pressure. Absolutely.

And now to think that it has devolved into this morass of complete lack of leadership by the IOC and by the World Gymnastics Federation. It's appalling, it's awful, and the good news is that USOPC is on it. Some might have said, hey, why weren't they on it before? This appeal process went so quickly that no one really even knew what's happening. And of course the whole point is that they didn't appeal within the one-minute. Thats the word, that they were four seconds late. Well, I'm going to guess when we find out that there could be evidence that the appeal did happen within the one-minute time period because what's going on in gymnastics floor at that moment there's so much going on. You're looking, if you're watching on TV, at a specific athlete or coach, but that is an arena with lots happening and there's language barriers. And there's a clock on everything.

Two years later, they moved to Gwen's home state of Minnesota and eventually next door to Sherri Blasing. SHERRI BLASING, TIM AND GWEN WALZ'S FORMER NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR: Even as governor, you know, I know Tim is the governor, but Gwen has a lot to do with that.
