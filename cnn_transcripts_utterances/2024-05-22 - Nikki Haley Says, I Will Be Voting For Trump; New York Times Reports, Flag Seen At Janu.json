We're breaking down her announcement, and the timing as she's still siphoning support from Trump in the primaries.Also tonight, the judge in the Trump classified documents case holds the first hearings since delaying the trial, and a shouting match erupts, this amid new photos and revelations about the Mar-a-Lago search and the FBI investigation. And Sean Diddy Combs is facing another allegation of sexual assault, this time in a lawsuit filed by a former model. It's happening just days after CNN exclusively obtained a 2016 video showing the rapper kicking and dragging his then-girlfriend. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the Situation Room. First up tonight, the breaking news, more than two months after dropping out Of the Republican presidential race, Nikki Haley now says she will be voting for Donald Trump in November, even as she urges him to do more to reach out to her supporters. Let's bring in CNN's Kylie Atwood, who followed the Haley campaign during the GOP primaries. Kylie how is Haley explaining this?",

She made it very clear that she personally will be voting for him. And she also said that this is a situation where he's going to have to continue to earn the support of her voters.Now, we should note, Wolf, that when she dropped out of the race, she was running against the former president in the primary. She did not explicitly endorse former President Trump. And it got pretty heated between the two of them on the campaign trail. As you recall, at one point, she said Trump was not qualified to be president because of the way that he had talked about military families. She said military families couldn't trust him to keep their loved ones out of harm's way. So, there were some significant jabs that were traded between the two of them. They still have not spoken since she dropped out of the race more than two months ago now, but today, making it clear that she personally is going to be voting for him in November. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I've made that clear many, many times, but Biden has been a catastrophe. So, I will be voting for Trump. Having said that, I stand by what I said in my suspension speech. Trump would be smart to reach out to the millions of people who voted for me and continue to support me and not assume that they're just going to be with him, and I genuinely hope he does that.

I mean, despite the fact that Nikki Haley and Trump had this somewhat bitter and personal rivalry, I'll remind you that he called her names, at a certain point he made fun of her husband and his military service, now you see her really falling in line behind him, a pattern that we have seen from Republicans since 2016 with these feuds between Donald Trump and other Republicans and then them eventually saying that they would come out and vote for Donald Trump.Now, the interesting part here is, as Kylie mentioned, whether or not this actually moves the needle with these protest voters, with these Haley supporters. I will remind you, you know, we showed a list there of some of the states in which Haley really outperformed what she should have given the fact that she had dropped out of the race, Pennsylvania really being the key one. And this was over a month after she dropped out, Pennsylvania is a state that is considered completely purple. It is a battleground state and one that the Trump team wants. She got over 16 percent of Pennsylvania Republican voters. That is a huge number. Now, there are still Republicans who believe that these Nikki Haley supporters are critical for Donald Trump. There are even Republicans that are in Donald Trump's immediate circle who have suggested that he reach out to her, who have suggested that he even consider her for vice president. Now, that is something that he himself has almost completely ruled out. He said that on social media that he would not be considering her for vice president. We have yet to hear any reaction from Trump or his team on Nikki Haley saying she would vote for him. I will remind you, he's currently in Texas attending a series of fundraisers with these oil and energy executives, Wolf.",

I don't think there was anywhere else for Nikki Haley to land in this race if she wanted to preserve any kind of future in the Republican Party. It's Donald Trump's Republican Party and he's remade it in his image.So, I think the political calculation was always sort of inevitable that we'd get here, but I do think it is interesting because she said that Biden would be a catastrophe, and, yes, Trump hasn't been perfect on these things. That is very different from when she talked to Dana Bash in New Hampshire when she said, these guys are equally bad.

And you're amazing. CNN's amazing reporters have been on the ground talking to a lot of the folks who wanted to vote for Nikki Haley. Yes, some of them say, yes, I guess I'm going to think about voting for Donald Trump, but many more have said, there is no way in hell I will vote for Donald Trump if Nikki Haley is not the candidate.

It's not just that what she did in Arizona. It's what she did in Maricopa County. It's what she did in the Philly suburbs.

This time, it's this so called Appeal to Heaven flag. You're seeing it there, flown outside his home on Long Beach Island in New Jersey. Now it has a history dating back to the Revolutionary War, but it has recently become a symbol for supporters of former President Donald Trump.Now as for this most recent revelation, Justice Alito has not responded to these pictures published by the New York Times. We did hear from Justice Alito on Friday, he released a statement saying that the inverted flag outside his Virginia home that was placed there leading up to Joe Biden's inauguration in 2021, he said it was placed there by his wife in response to a spat with neighbors. As for this time, with the revelations of the flag outside his New Jersey beach home, our team has reached out to the court. We have not heard back. It's interesting and maybe important to note that our producer on Capitol Hill actually saw this same Appeal to Heaven flag flying outside House Speaker Mike Johnson's office just tonight. She talked to the speaker and he said, it's George Washington's flag. It goes back to the founders' era. I've always flown that flag. It has nothing to do with that, when asked about Associations with Stop the Steal or Donald Trump. Now, of course, we'll, you know, Speaker Johnson is a politician. Justice Alito is really supposed to be an impartial justice here, one of nine sitting on the country's highest court. And already from last week, we heard Democrats calling for Justice Alito to recuse himself from any cases associated with January 6th. And there are two that we are awaiting rulings on. One actually involves whether certain Capitol rioters charged with obstruction can still be charged under a particular federal statute. The other case, of course, is the big one, whether Donald Trump should be immune from criminal prosecution as it relates to his January 6th case. We have not heard any comment from Justice Alito about those calls to recuse, and we also haven't heard a statement from Justice Alito about this most recent revelation from The New York Times.

There were two hearings that the judge was presiding over, all of them having to do with motions by the former president and his co-defendants to try to dismiss these charges. The judge seemed skeptical of those efforts. She said that a lot of the arguments appeared to be things that could be handled before a jury.However, the she did seem sympathetic to the idea that she believed that jurors may have a hard time understanding some of the complexities of what she said this case presents. I'll read you just a part of what she said from the bench. She says it's going to be hard for someone to detect what's different with these counts. Now, that's part of the argument that the defendants have been making. They're saying that there's technical issues that were with the indictment of why they believe some of these charges should be tossed. There was also a heated part of the hearing where the defense -- there was a an attorney, Stan Woodward, who represents Walt Nauta, one of the co defendants. He accused prosecutors of essentially mentioning the fact that he was up for a potential judgeship as a way to try to get him and his client to try to cooperate with the investigation. That prompted a response from David Harbaugh, who's one of the prosecutors, and he said this was simple fantasy. Now, Wolf, at the end of these two hearings, the judge did not make a ruling. And one of the things we keep waiting for, Wolf, is for a potential new trial date. The judge had canceled the trial, which was supposed to get started sometime this week. She has not yet set, set a trial date, but, of course, as you know, Wolf, we have several more months before the election, and the judge has already scheduled multiple additional hearings for here in Fort Pierce.

Joining us now, Michael Cohen's lawyer, Danya Perry. Danya, thanks very much for joining us. Is your client, Michael Cohen, confident that the prosecutor successfully tied Trump to the alleged illegal activity in this case and met their burden beyond a reasonable doubt? DANYA PERRY, MICHAEL COHEN'S LAWYER: Look, the trial is still pending, so I'll leave his feelings aside and what matters here in the judge will so instruct the jury, not feelings, but facts, cold, hard facts. And Michael Cohen did lay out in what must have been excruciating detail for the defense many, many facts that, if believed, will establish the prosecution's case beyond a reasonable doubt, facts which were corroborated by some 20 witnesses and a mountain of evidence, phone records and, in fact, contemporaneous notes that whatever the defense wants to say about Mr. Cohen, he could not have made up. They were outside of his control, including a famous exhibit 35, which was Allen Weisselberg's contemporaneous notes about exactly how the illegal campaign contribution was going to be paid back as legal expenses to Mr. Cohen. So, look, I'll tell you what I felt. I felt that his testimony came in great, both on direct and cross and redirect and re-cross. But we'll see. The jury will have it in his hands on Tuesday.

And so I have every reason to believe they will take his instructions very, very seriously. And there are some serious matters that are under consideration. And so, while it's not the most scandalous or scintillating part of the trial for the press corps, in fact, it is of utmost critical for the jury, they've heard five weeks now of testimony and now they have to lay those facts onto this legal scaffolding and apply the facts to the law, as instructed by the judge.

TODD: The McKinney lawsuit comes just days after CNN obtained and aired exclusive surveillance video from 2015, showing Combs kicking and dragging his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in the hallway of the hotel. That attack was referenced in a civil lawsuit last year, that Ventura brought against Combs. Ventura alleged that Combs raped her and subjected her to repeated physical abuse over the course of their relationship. That lawsuit was settled. Combs' attorney said, at the time the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing, but after CNN released the attack video, Combs issued this video message. SEAN \"DIDDY\" COMBS, MUSIC MOGUL: I make no excuses. My behavior on that video is inexcusable. I take full responsibility for my actions in that video, disgusted. After the hotel assault video was released, Misa Hylton, the mother of Combs' eldest son, wrote on Instagram about Ventura, quote, I know exactly how she feels and through my empathy, it has triggered my own trauma. The complaint from Crystal McKinney is the seventh lawsuit in which Combs has been named in recent months, six of them containing allegations of sexual assault. Combs has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. This also comes on the heels of a raid on two of his properties by a Homeland Security unit that handles crimes, including human trafficking.
