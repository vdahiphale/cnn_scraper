Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has issued a statement one day after the Israeli military says it recovered the bodies of six hostages from an underground tunnel in the Rafah area. Netanyahu said, quote, \"Those who murder hostages do not want a deal. I say to the Hamas terrorists who murdered our hostages and I say to their leaders, your blood is on your head. We will not rest and we will not be silent. We will pursue you.\" The IDF has now identified all six, saying their families have been notified. They are Ori Danino, Carmel Gat, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Almog Sarusi, and Alex Lobanov. An Israeli military spokesperson says the six were killed just before troops could reach them.

The Prime Minister did a taped statement not facing journalists or people. The Prime Minister canceled his scheduled visit on the first day of school to go to a first-grade class. It just goes to show that this is throwing everybody off. All of us are feeling horrible. And the cabinet most definitely made statements that are very challenging. And I think in that sense that what we're looking at as Israelis right now, will the security cabinet that made the decision last week that they're going to stay on Philadelphi Corridor, will they change that decision?

But multiple times he's done exactly that. He's crossed those red lines, and the administration hasn't actually held them accountable for that. So I don't expect there to be a change in tact, certainly not before the elections in November.

And the question is, what will they do? Because they are reaching the conclusion that he wants this war to go on in order not just to cater to his political survival needs, but also to become an issue in the American election. He wants this to roll into November. And I don't know that the Biden administration is willing to go ahead with that and to go along with that. But what will they do? Well, given what they have not done in the last six or seven months, I don't know.

German leaders are watching closely as they eye the rising support for the far right and how it might perform in national elections in just over a year.Now, earlier this year, AfD was kicked out of the European Union's far-right coalition following incidents with the AfD leader Maximilian Krah. Krah told an Italian newspaper that he didn't view all members of the Nazi SS group as criminals. Now, despite that, the AfD managed to secure its best E.U. election result during the voting, securing the second highest share of votes in Germany behind only the center-right party, the Christian Democratic Union. Meanwhile, thousands of demonstrators took to the streets on Saturday to protest against the far right and the AfD. They marched in the capital of Thuringia, one of the state's holding elections, and if the AfD wins, it would be the first time a far-right party has held a majority in a German state parliament since World War II. And joining me now from Berlin is Matthew Karnitschnig, Chief Europe Correspondent for \"Politico.\" Thanks so much for being here with us.

There are other issues that these far- right parties have in common that they play on, including the war in Ukraine, their opposition to that. COVID policy surprisingly remains a very potent issue. There's a lot of lingering resentment around that, but also other issues that, you know, might surprise some people, such as the phase-out of the traditional gas-powered automobile is something that they also use to rile people up.

And they blame, many of these people blame the United States and NATO, which they say provoked Russia.And I think it's fair to say many of these people are more comfortable with the Russians than they are with the West. So in terms of relations with the U.S. going forward, I think this is going to remain an issue because, you know, they might only be in a couple of Eastern states after this election -- after these elections that we're seeing today. But five years down the road, you know, at the trajectory that we're on right now, they could have much more influence at the federal level.
