      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\". This Tuesday great to be back with you as Wall Street bulls enjoy a strongsummer rally investors hoping for signs of a Fed rate hike finale. Big tech earnings on tap and the AI gossip coming from Silicon Valley, and the IMF just out with an important global economic tally. In fact, the IMF's updated World Economic Outlook predicts growth of 3 percent this year. That's an upgrade, thanks in part to greater than expected resilience to challenges like inflation and the ensuing rate hikes though of course, downside risks remain. The end of the Black Sea Grain Deal and the climate crisis having the potential to reignite inflation and the IMF warning of fresh weakness in China's economy too. We've got all the details. But for now China's official so far failing to reignite growth via stimulus. But the message from the Politburo this week is get ready investors as you can see more than ready. The HANG SENG popping 4 percent during Tuesday's session, the Shanghai Composite also high up by more than 2 percent. We've also got word of a major leadership shake up too that will certainly influence economic policy as well as foreign. Beijing replacing its Central Bank Governor as expected but also Foreign Minister Qin Gang, who had been previously MIA for over a month more on all of this in just a moment. But for now more from stimulus anticipation to Blue Chip elation a mixed open expected on Wall Street with the DOW coming off its 11th straight winning session. We're actually around 5 percent, just 5 percent, I should say away from record highs now for the DOW. And you can see some green in Europe too, though mixed where the stocks have fed that elite July juice has a lot to do with the Powell prognosis and of course, the Lagarde long view. Both the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank will likely raise rates this week. The question of course, is what next? Inflation has of course come down sharply this year. But it remains far higher than Central Bank's target rates not just in those nations, of course or regions but around the world too much to discuss, as always. But we do begin in Israel where massive protests erupted after lawmakers approved the first of the government's controversial proposals designed to weaken the power of the Supreme Court. This drone footage shows protesters blocking a major highway in Tel Aviv Monday night, while police use water cannons to disperse the crowd. And today doctors and medical workers went on strike in protest too. Hadas Gold joins us on this, Hadas you can tell us more about that protest movement but what about the doctors and the medical workers? Is this a one day strike alone? Or could they continue too?",

But let's talk about what has happened over the last month because this is being described as a surprise shake up. The last time we saw Qin Gang was on June 25th, one month ago when he was with the leaders of Sri Lanka, with Vietnam and with Russia in Beijing, and then suddenly out of the public view. In fact, earlier today here in Asia, at a Foreign Ministers briefing, a reporter asked about his prolonged absence and the line that was given. No information to provide adding that diplomatic activities are being carried out as usual. Well, several hours after that we were sitting at our desks and we saw the news that he had been replaced. This is a man who has been one of Xi Jinping's most trusted advisors he has served as the Ambassador to the United States. He is the one who made some bold statements most rebuke after that spy balloon shoots down. And also was very involved with Antony Blinken's visit to Beijing yet in recent weeks out of the public view, in fact, missing visits by key U.S. officials such as Janet Yellen and most recently, John Kerry. But Julia, the point to be made right now is that the back-story, the narrative, the lines in between, it is still not clear, but what is clear. This is clearly a bold change in China's foreign policy roster.",

And still you have global economies that are moving forward here. But muddling through for some of those advanced economies you're right, because you look at those forecasts, the U.S. economy forecast to grow by about 1.8 percent this year, according to the IMF, UK, almost nothing really 0.4 percent and the German economy to actually contract by 0.3 percent. Also noting some risks to China and the Chinese outlook, it's got a debt laden, real estate market property market watching that space as well to see just how well China can continue to recover this year.

But it'll be very curious to see whether he says that they are going to continue to gun toward the 2 percent inflation target or whether there's some sort of indication that maybe they're comfortable with something a little bit higher than that in the near term if they think there is progress being made. So after the pause of the last meeting, I think 25 basis points are what the market is expecting. And you're absolutely right. What Jay Powell signals after that will be really critical, especially for markets that are sitting here? Just what one or 2 percent away from record highs for the DOW and the S&amp;P just a few percentage points away.

If you're looking on companies that incorporated that are related to tech investments in the tech sector, from the beginning of the year, the number is close to zero.

So they've made a comparison to the kinds of things we've been seeing this year, and the kinds of things that have happened in previous years. And as a consequence, they say that there's no question that humankind is definitely responsible. The carbonization of the atmosphere is definitely responsible for a great deal of the kind of extreme weather that we've been seeing. And they predicted some rather dire things, if the things if everything stays as it are that global temperatures remain 1.2 degrees Celsius over what they were in the pre-industrial age. If that stays the same, you could expect these kinds of periods of extreme weather in North America once every 15 years, in Europe once every 10 years and in China once every five years. However, the thing is, they are not staying the same, and the temperatures are continuing to rise.

So we're well off the highs that we did see the price move yesterday isn't perhaps surprising given that the port in question, as you say, is on the Danube River on the Romanian side of Ukraine. And increasingly, this port has become more and more important for Ukrainian exports, not least given the recent collapse of the Grain Deal, which would cover the much bigger ports like Odessa. Now this operational safety risk, if it continues at this port could put in jeopardy exports in terms of the shippers ensures that all have to help get those food exports out. And that could have an impact on global food prices. If you consider that before the war Ukraine accounted for around 10 percent of global wheat exports. And has critical importance really for many developing nations, particularly in Africa and Asia, who really rely on it for wheat and corn.

We have seen farming impacted by extreme weather just the last few months really from China, all the way to the U.S. Even last week, we had that story from India, which is actually limiting exports of rice as a result of the extreme monsoon season which would have caused prices to spike within India. They are limiting exports that have a huge impact. India represents about 40 percent, I believe of rice exports around the world.

And there are too many smaller players that are spending a lot of money in what is a very cash burn industry particularly with the innovation level and the speed of innovation. At this moment, the hope is to have some kind of national champion and force consolidation in this industry so that it's more efficient, arguably.",

And globally, our competitors are consolidating. And when I have high level discussions with my colleagues and other folks in the industry, there's a general consensus that this is a good opportunity for partnering and for more efficient use of these really precious resources. But trying to gain real momentum has been a little bit of a problem. And so our sense is that by working with JICC, we can really start a compelling story to shift kind of the yes, it's a good idea, but not now, not us to kind of a more people to be more assertive in engaging in that discussion. And my sense is, and this kind of typical for Japan, in my opinion, once you start to gain momentum, you can have a big impact. So my sense is that will drive a competitive kind of set of activity. And other folks will also understand that, you know, now is the time to start to move on partnering or trying to drive real efficiency gains in this space.",

In fact, JICC will be judged by how well they do financially on this investment. But I think it's important to note that we have customers globally. And our opportunity continues to be to do the very best that we can to support those customers, wherever they are. And, of course, there's going to be policies that are driven by national agendas. And we have to be very sensitive. And you know those are grabbing the headlines. And you know, for good reason, a lot of people want to talk about those. But there are so many more opportunities that are outside of those specific kinds of restricted spaces, that I think it's really important for us to embrace. And I'm biased, of course, because I'm the CEO, but JSR really has differentiated ourselves on our ability to partner very closely with our customers, doesn't matter where they are.

Can I ask, just in your mind, and I know, it's early days, but you do have to think sort of 3, 4, 5 years ahead is that as a CEO of a company, particularly when six months in this kind of industry is a light years?
