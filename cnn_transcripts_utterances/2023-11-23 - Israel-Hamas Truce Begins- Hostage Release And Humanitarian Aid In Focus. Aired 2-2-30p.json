He's in Tel Aviv, Israel, where right now we're just 10 hours away from an expected truce between Israel and Hamas. After a one-day delay to a truce deal, the fighting is set to stop temporarily at midnight Eastern time. About 9 hours later, Hamas is set to begin releasing 13 women and children who've been held captive for nearly 50 days.Right now, the Israeli government has a list of those hostages and says that it has notified their families. But it's unclear if any Americans are included. President Biden is saying that his fingers are crossed that 1 of them is Abigail Adon Wolf, a three-year-old American toddler.",

A short time ago, the Israeli defense minister said he expects it to last another 2 months at least. But the Qatari government, which played a truly critical mediating role in these talks, said, it is hopeful hostilities will stop with this deal. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARi, QATARI FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: We are hopeful. I don't know if I should say confident, but we are very hopeful. And as I said, the commitment we have seen from both sides leads us to be very positive, to deal with this very positively. We are seeing a good level of commitment over the agreement itself, the details hashed out. The first, you know, glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel, this crisis. And this is why we needed to succeed, and we are hoping and working towards it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's not altogether clear, because obviously it's very difficult, lots of moving parts. Logistically, it's going to be quite difficult. But the thrust of it at the moment is that they're expecting, and they've got the list of 13 Israeli hostages in front of them, who they expect to be released tomorrow at some point, probably in the afternoon tomorrow here at local time.What the Israelis are now saying is that they intend to release 3 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails for every one Israeli hostage. We've reported on that before. But that comes to 39 if all 13 Israeli hostages are released, as is expected. So, 39 Palestinian prisoners. But they're not going, this is what I've just got this evening, they're not going to be releasing those Palestinian prisoners, they say, until such times as the Israeli hostages are in Israeli hands. And so that's a slight difference from what we were hearing earlier. But now they're saying they're going to wait to see what hostages come out before they even start the process of releasing those Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.",

But there are obviously going to be people that they haven't spoken to. And that must be absolutely awful for them. We don't know who's on the list yet, officially, at least. And if we did know, we wouldn't be able to report it anyway.

It appears to be coming from the area around the Jabali refugee camp. You may have just seen a flash just then. And we know that Israeli forces have told us, Israeli military has told us in recent days that their forces have been encircling the Jabali refugee camp and continuing to fight Hamas militants there. That is one of the areas that Israeli forces have been focused on in recent days. And we are hearing heavy activity coming from that direction. You saw that flash just then at this very moment. All right.All throughout the day, Wolf, we have been hearing heavy explosions inside of Gaza. We've been hearing machine gun fire and continuous military activity. This, as the Israeli military makes clear, that they will continue to fight inside of Gaza up until they get the order to stop. Up until that 7 a.m. truce that is expected to go into effect in order to allow for the release of hostages over the next several days. But this is certainly the most sustained bombardment that we have been hearing all evening, what we are witnessing at this point in time. And we are hearing heavy explosions inside of Gaza. We have been hearing - at this point in time, it's very similar to what we have seen at this point on Twitter. very moment. After this pause in fighting ends, Israeli officials, Israeli leaders in particular, the prime minister as well as the Defense Minister making very clear that this war is not over yet. This is not a permanent ceasefire, and the fighting will resume. In fact, tonight, the Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, saying that fighting will continue for at least, he said, at least 2 more months in order to achieve the military aims of this war, which are not only to secure the release of all of those nearly 240 hostages, but also to eliminate Hamas from its power in the Gaza Strip. A very significant statement from the Israeli Defense Minister, indeed. Jeremy, thank you very much. Matthew, thanks to you as well. The Israel-Hamas hostage deal also means critical humanitarian aid can be delivered to Gaza. A convoy of aid trucks has lined up at the Rafah border crossing from Egypt into Gaza, ready to bring desperately needed food, water, and medical supplies. The International Rescue Committee says it welcomes the 4-day pause in the war, but warns that that's not enough time to address the dire humanitarian crisis that continues in Gaza. CNN's Eleni Goikos is in Egypt for us. Eleni, let's begin with CNN's Nada Bashir. She's joining us from Jerusalem. I'll get to you in a moment. But, Nada, the IRC says this four-day pause should be used to increase supply deliveries and that a massive, sustained effort is needed inside Gaza. You've been doing a lot of reporting on this. How essential is this aid?",

      "sentences": "What we have been learning over the last 24 hours an enormous amount of activity at el - Arish going towards the Rafah border. Our teams on the ground have been describing seeing dozens and dozens of trucks heading towards that border crossing in anticipation for this 4-day truce and much needed aid that Nader was describing that needs to get into Gaza immediately. International aid organizations are frankly ringing alarm bells.We have been hearing from the United States and the United States and the United States and the U.S. about the situation in terms of the dire situation playing out within Gaza. And I just want to reiterate what Martin Griffiths from the U.N. said yesterday. He said that they negotiate daily with the Egyptians as well as with the Israelis to get aid into Gaza. But when it comes to the number of trucks, the amount of fuel in terms of food and water and opening those safe passageways, Wolf, it all comes down to negotiations with Israel. But Israel has the final say. With this, of course, truce that we're seeing, which of course is priority to try and get hostages out, this is opening an enormously important corridor to get aid into the region. And you've got to remember the macro picture here. If you are in Gaza right now, the only way you can get out is if you're a foreign national or you're a dual passport holder or you have a critical injury that can get you on a list and into Egypt. For the rest of the people that are in Gaza right now, for the Palestinians there, they are facing acute, huge shortages, as well as water shortages. And then the hospitals themselves have been describing harrowing scenarios of difficult decisions that doctors are having to make on a day-to-day basis because they cannot keep generators on and also lack of anesthesia.",

Israel, as you know, has notified the families of these first 13 women and children who are there risks in doing that and not holding on to that information until these people are actually out of Hamas's hands.O'SHEA:  100 percent. I can just tell you, being on the coordination of over 400 kidnaps in Iraq, the very last thing you do is try and give families hope because nothing is certain, especially in these environments, until that hostage is safely and securely brought into harm, you know, out of harm's way. Anything -- anything could go wrong. And that is the biggest challenge because it's a very tenuous situation. And I think it's a very tenuous situation. And I think it's a very tenuous situation. And I think it's a very tenuous situation. And I think it's these families have been, they've been going through hell. It's been a nightmare for the families in addition to what the hostages themselves have gone through. So, you don't want to give undue hope for folks because if something goes wrong, then the level of anger and outrage the families will respond with will be a lot to handle.",

Of course, they're Iran-backed. And there have been a lot of quiet warnings, including, we think, from the Chinese going to the Iranians about keeping that part secure. But, you know, just to build on what Dan said, I think part one of our concern is obviously tomorrow and a smooth start to this.The bigger mystery to me, Wolf, is what happens at day 4 and 5 and 6. So obviously, if this goes well, there'll be a great interest in extending it, trying to see if you can get more hostages out. But the price for those, particularly for the men, for members of the military, that will go up considerably. And then the Israelis are going to face a very hard choice, because if they decide to go resume the war, as Prime Minister Netanyahu has said they would, it could choke off further hostage releases. Remember, Hamas will still have nearly 200 in hand. And then, of course, the next part of that is, Israel will face a fair bit of condemnation for restarting the bombings, assuming they do that, after you've had a period of 4 or 5 or 6 days of relative peace.I'm not sure they've politically quite figured out how they're going to go handle that.",

First and foremost, every hostage is going to be, victim is going to be seen by medical staff and checked out physically. And of course, addressing some of the injuries we know some of them had. But the most important is going to be the mental health. These challenges and the lasting repercussions of what, especially these young kids who are not, -- no one is, --  these kids have been held in probably a tunnel for the last 47 days. There could be a lifetime of issues for these young children and the shock and trauma of what they've been through.

And you're now seeing the shift, assuming that this comes ahead tomorrow, toward getting the hostages out. But President Biden has been pressing Netanyahu in 13 phone calls, at least 13 that we know about, to begin to think much more heavily about the long-term costs of whether or not the bombing of the Palestinians at this level, with this level of casualties, is in Israel's long-term interest.And on that, they have just a fundamental disagreement. Now, the U.S. has not come out publicly to go denounce them, other than Secretary of State Tony Blinken's phrases that there have been far too many Palestinians killed. But that's been the source of tension here. As President Biden says, please help us help you to get to a longer-term solution. And so, you've heard President Biden talking about this to get to a 2-state solution. You have never once heard Prime Minister Netanyahu utter that.
