And we don't anticipate any others as we mark our way down to Zinke. That's nine people who are, as of now, not voting for Speaker Johnson. If -- even if the six abstentions come back on board, Charlie Dent, that's three noes. They could change their votes before they gavel it down. But the likelihood is that Speaker Johnson is not going to win on this first ballot. CHARLIE DENT, (R), FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: Absolutely.

But again, this speaks to the nihilism of some of the members who just simply want to blow the place up. They want to disrupt for the sake of disruption. Now, I like to know, though -- Patrick, you would know the answer to this, but you we're a chief deputy whip. You know, ordinarily, you know, you should be telling the leadership where you're going to be before the vote. And as a courtesy, even if you're going to be against them, tell them. But I'm sure that didn't happen here with a few of these votes. PATRICK MCHENRY, (R), FORMER SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE: Well, don't be certain of that. Don't be certain of that.

That is the design of these House Republicans. They know this. This is a math question. This is not a question of social -- social psychology. They know what they're doing.
