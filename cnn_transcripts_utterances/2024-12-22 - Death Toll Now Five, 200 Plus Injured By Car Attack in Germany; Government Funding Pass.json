As a nation mourns, investigators in Germany share new details about the suspect in a deadly attack on a Christmas market. How a far-right party is now using the tragedy to push its political agenda. A congressional crisis is over, but it's left Donald Trump on the back foot, where he's focusing his energy following the debt ceiling debacle. Plus, Syrian refugees are heading back to their home country by the thousands. We'll speak with an American in Hama about the long road to recovery. We're learning more about the man accused of driving a car into a crowd at a Christmas market in Germany. Police say he was in court late on Saturday, where a judge ordered him held in pretrial detention. He's charged with five counts of murder, along with other counts of attempted murder and dangerous bodily harm. Meanwhile, police have increased security at Christmas markets around Germany, as you'd expect. On Saturday, a mourner's placed flowers in front of a church next to the Christmas market. Later in the day, these anti-immigration protesters marched in Magdeburg. The Christmas market attack has some concerns that it might boost the appeal of Germany's anti-immigration, far-right, Alternative fur Deutschland, or AfD party. Germany's holding snap elections in February, and the AfD is second in national polls, behind the center- right Christian Democrats and Social Democrat Alliance. I want to dig more into this, so let's bring in CNN's Barbie Latza Nadeau, joins us live from Rome with more. Barbie, let's just get into this a bit more. Can you give me a bit of a recap of what we know? And for anyone just waking up, just turning on their TV, what is going on?",

You know, that could increase the death count. That was something that the German chancellor said yesterday when he visited the scene.But let's focus just for a minute on the suspect. We know he's a 50- year-old Saudi Arabian national who's been living in Germany for 18 years, and he doesn't fit the usual profile that one might expect when you think about previous types of attacks. Let's listen to what the public prosecutor had to say and then discuss it a little more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HORST NOPENS, MAGDEBURG'S PUBLIC PROSECUTOR (through translator): As per the current information we have, it would seem that the backdrop to this attack is -- might be -- how can I put this, dissatisfaction with the way that Saudi Arabian refugees in Germany. It could be that. That's possible. But what sits behind that, anything more deeply rooted, is the subject of the investigation. We need to examine that and ascertain it more thoroughly.

So let's turn now to -- we're speaking to CNN's asking the Editor-in-Chief of Germany's WELT TV, Jan Philipp Burgard, about the impact this attack might have on immigration.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAN PHILIPP BURGARD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, WELT TV: I think we will see a debate on migration. Since the start of the migration crisis in 2015, the majority of German society has been very open-minded and helpful. But part of the truth is that the country is reaching its limits. And after attacks such as those at the Christmas markets in Berlin in 2016 and now in Magdeburg, many Germans are asking themselves, do we even know who exactly we have let into the country? Do our police even have the means to monitor potential threats? And have Chancellors Merkel and Scholz done everything they can to protect our country? And these questions will also play a role in the heated phase of the general election. So far, most well-known politicians have been reluctant to comment and have only expressed their condolences, presumably because much of the background is still unclear. But in the next days, I think either side could try to instrumentalize the attack for themselves. The right-wing populist party, AfD, could see the attacker as a migrant who has become radicalized for everyone to see on the Internet and to whom the security authorities have not taken out of circulation. And the left could see the attacker as a critic of Islam, who even sympathized with the right-wing populist party, AfD. So I think this attack, therefore, has the potential to further polarize the country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Mr. Netanyahu is currently embroiled in a corruption trial which has divided Israel.OK, let's turn now to Syria where for the first time in many years hope is not in short supply. But as people celebrate the fall of the Assad regime, some harsh realities are starting to sink in. After 13 years of a brutal civil war, 90% of the population is below the poverty line. The U.N. says 7 million Syrians are internally displaced on top of at least 6 million others who fled the country. Tens of thousands are already coming back and the United Nations expects a million others to return home in the first six months of next year. But close to 17 million Syrians already need humanitarian assistance and the mass return could make the humanitarian situation even bleaker. So the big question is how does the country move ahead?

I spent a lot of time in many of these countries, in Germany, in Sweden, in Turkey. These are countries that open their doors and generously welcome Syrians, and Syrians have been well integrated, including members of my family who now have citizenship and contribute to the economy, and their children have been born and raised there. But I'm surprised at just the speed in which these countries have decided to, you know, to start to indicate that they want these people out. And I'm afraid that the events of this week, for example, what we saw in Germany, don't help the Syrian case, and that the discrimination continues to be rampant. It continues to fuel insecurities about the migration situation in these countries. But Syria is not ready to receive these people. It will take time developmentally and infrastructurally for the society to be rebuilt again and then also to heal.

There has to be what's called an aggravated circumstance.And that, in his case, is a murder and furtherance of terrorism. So terrorism in New York, like anything else, has a definition.

It can be a case like this where there was maybe a broader message than just a personal vendetta. And in order to establish that, prosecutors will have to establish motives. So they're actually taking on additional burden. But with the manifesto, the messaging on the bullets, the monopoly money. All of that is being put together to say that this was something bigger than just a one-on-one vendetta. This was something about the insurance industry. This was making a message to influence policy about insurance and health care in general. And so that's what prosecutors will be charged to prove when they get into the courtroom.",

So if we're looking at Mangione's public profile, this is not a surprise to anyone watching this program. It's not a surprise to you, not a surprise to me. He has blown up the Internet. I mean, he's everywhere.Even when I'm scrolling through X, you know that bit on your feed where it's not even people you're following. All it is has been talk about his good looks, about the fact that people are in support of his actions, which is obviously really shocking. But there have been talks about concerns of jury nullification or at least the difficulty the defense and prosecution will face in finding a balanced jury. I mean, I'm not seeing any balance on social media. So how are they going to do that? Can you just talk us through that process?",

So to your point, it's certainly something the prosecutors are going to be grappling with. And right now we're talking about one venue being federal court, the other venue being state court, both proceeding on a parallel track.Jury nullification is certainly a problem. And that means that jurors may make a decision not based on whether or not they believe someone to be guilty, but based on a social justice type concern or something else outside of the evidence in the courtroom. Also, everybody is going to have to watch out for the stealth juror. That's a juror who hides their true feelings, hides their true opinion about a case during the voir dire process when jurors are being selected for the purpose of influencing the case one way or another. So in a case like this, depending on which venue you're in, federal court's going to have different parameters than state court. But it's going to be a very laborious voir dire process. You're going to see jury consultants. You're going to see deep dives on every prospective juror on social media. And that's the way that both sides, because we talk about a stealth juror during nullification. The defense also has to get a fair trial as well. So it's to get individuals who they're going to know about the case. You have to be living under a rock not to have heard of it. But people that can put their opinions aside and make a decision on the evidence and not what they're reading on social media.",

Clemson made this game a little interesting late, but Texas had a season-high 292 yards rushing, including this 77-yard score from Jaydon Blue that put the game away. Texas beat the Tigers 38-24 to move on to face Arizona State in the Peach Bowl.Penn State, meanwhile, got two pick sixes in the first half against SMU. They would blow out the Mustangs, winning 38-10. They now move on to face Boise State in the Fiesta Bowl. Now, the first-ever home playoff games certainly were fun atmospheres, but in the end, they were all blowouts, so here's hoping the quarterfinals on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day are more competitive.
