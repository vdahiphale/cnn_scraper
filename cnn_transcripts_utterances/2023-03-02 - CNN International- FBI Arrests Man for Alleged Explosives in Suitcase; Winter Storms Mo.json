According to the FBI this is what they found. They found powder that was in a plastic wrap, they found fuses, the powder appears to be from commercial grade fireworks, and so the question is, you know, what was he doing with this. The airport tried to page him while he was still at the airport. He left and he was later arrested later that evening on Monday by the FBI. Now the court documents that were released today by the U.S. attorney in Philadelphia don't mention any indication of extremism or his ties to terrorist groups or anything like that. This is something obviously the FBI was focused on over the last couple of days. Nothing like that appears to have emerged in that investigation. This is a very serious thing obviously. If you read the court documents, the FBI says that this powder that was included in this compound was susceptible to ignite from heat and friction and pose a significant risk to the aircraft and passengers.

      "sentences": "Well, Max, it's off to the races but unfortunately, it's for all the wrong reasons. We have already doubled over two times our average number of tornadoes we would see to date. 218 tornadoes since the start of the year and we continue to add to that number. On the overnight as a strong line of storms moves across the Tennessee River Valley. But it's really later today that we're more concerned with a more robust severe weather outbreak across eastern Texas, portions of Louisiana and southern Arkansas.We have a level 4 or 5 from the Storm Prediction Center. This is direct wording from the SPC, tornadoes some of which could be strong, widespread damaging winds and large hail possible within these regions. So, let's break it down for you. Focus on the chances of tornadoes. You see that hatched area we've kind of indicated? Well that's the greatest probability of a strong tornado. But right here where that shading of red is located, if I was to draw a dot near let's say Texarkana or just east of Dallas, there is a 15 percent likelihood of a tornado occurring within a 25 mile radius of that dot. Now talking about severe wind potential, this is the greatest area of severe wind, we could see winds in excess of a category 1 Atlantic hurricane, that is just incredible. Expect a very tumultuous day across the Deep South. And on top of the severe weather threat, there is a flash flood threat as well. In fact, 1 to 3 inches of rain, locally higher amounts, maybe up to a halve a foot. That's why the National Weather Service has hoisted flash flood watches. This is the system, it's gathering energy from the Gulf of Mexico, but look what it does in the future. It moves to the northeast and it dumps a belt of snow across the Great Lakes all the way to northern New England. We could see over half a foot of snow for Chicago, my hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan. And look at that upstate New York into let's say New Hampshire as well as Maine, you could see over a foot of snow. Speaking of multiple feet of snow, look what's happening out West. This is Yosemite National Park. Those are homes that have been completely buried. Palisades -- that's one of the ski resorts near Lake Tahoe -- has received over 7 feet of snow in the past three days. Well guess what, there's already winter storm watches across the region for additional snow that's going to enter into the equation by the weekend. This is the current storm moving across the great basin and the four corners region could produce another half a foot to a foot of snow across the northern portions of Arizona and New Mexico. That departs and then our next storm system again starts to enter the West Coast by the end of Friday and into the day on Saturday. Max, just a very, very busy and active weather pattern to say the least. Back to you.",

On Wednesday, the Biden administration said that it approved a potential $619 million weapons deal for Taiwan, this would include hundreds of missiles for F-16 fighter jets. Principal contractors include Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, to American companies that had previously been sanctioned by China for previous arms deals with Taiwan.And this afternoon we heard from the Ministry of foreign affairs spokesperson who slammed the deal while adding this -- let's bring it up for you, quote: Stop arm sales to Taiwan and military context with the United States and stop creating tensions across the Taiwan Straits. China will continue taking firm and forceful measures to safe guard its sovereignty and security interests. Unquote. Now Taiwan's defense ministry welcomed its purchase. It issued its own statement earlier in the day quickly adding this, quote: The provision of defensive weapons to our country is the basis for preserving regional peace. Unquote. Now, some key context here, this is not the largest U.S. arm sale to Taiwan. That happened in September of last year in a deal totaling over $1.1 billion U.S. the last U.S. arms deal to Taiwan took place in December of last year. But this latest one will certainly deepen the already diplomatic rift between the U.S. and China -- Max.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think we're seeing a step up certainly from Russia and its allies to intensify this relationship with China certainly as we see more pressure coming from the West in terms of its aid for Ukraine. More pressure from U.S. over its concerns that China might be providing military aid or consider providing military aid to Russia.So, Lukashenko is in China right now at the G-20 summit in India. Lavrov's first bilateral was with the Chinese foreign minister -- that's the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He called Russia and China a stabilizing factor in the whole system of international relations in the world and promised to intensify their cooperation based on the summit of February 4, 2022, which was of course the summit between Putin and Xi where they declared that this was a low limits partnership. He also took aim at the West saying that the West has turned the G-20 into a farce -- this is according to TASS. Blaming Russia for the failures in the economy. So, I think, you know, there's two key things really here, the big picture is that the fault line in the world created by this war in Ukraine is only deepening. We are seeing that in the G-20. The G-20 finance ministry for example could not agree unanimously on a statement a few days ago condemning the war in Ukraine. China and obviously Russia abstained from that. And the second part is this relationship with China, the U.S. I think will step up the pressure on China potentially over its plans that they think are in place to deliver weapons to Russia even though -- and this is not a good sign -- Secretary Blinken does not plan to meet either with his Chinese or Russian counterparts at the G-20.",

It was approved despite objections from some lawmakers and civil liberties advocates who argue the proposal threatens online speech. The measure still needs to receive a vote in the House and on the Senate floor as well. Meanwhile TikTok is introducing a new policy aimed at preventing teens from endlessly scrolling. Every user under 18 will soon have their accounts by default having a one-hour daily screen time limit. Once reached teens will have to enter a passcode if they want to keep swiping. The idea is having to actively choose to keep using the app will result in better well-being for the users. The default limits can also be turned off. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That it was well-known that the Greek railway system was archaic, it needed to be modernized, there weren't safety systems in place. Clearly when you have two trains traveling towards each other for over 15 kilometers at high speeds, no one picked that up.I just heard from the Greek fire department on local media, 46 people now have lost their lives. A herculean task and were seeing some of those right now playing out just outside of Larissa where they are trying to work through the melted metal in those first two carriages. And we said this, a fire broke out reaching temperatures of over 1,300 degrees Celsius. They say that they've pulled out seven more people, seven more bodies that were badly burnt. DNA testing is basically the only way they say to be able to identify the people that lost their lives. Greece, Max, is in mourning today. I think in shock. There's a somber mood. I've spoken to a few people there. It's so tragic because this is also very important week, it was carnival weekend, it was Ash Monday, people had moved around the country to visit family. Mostly university students are some of the victims. I want to show you some of the front pages on Greek media and some of the headlines have really struck me. One of them was like, \"This is not a mistake, it is a crime.\" The other headline, \"The dead is waiting.\" \"Why?\" Just one question, why? And one that really got me, because my mother says this all the time, \"Call me when you get there.\" And of course, those calls for so many people just didn't come through. The transport minister resigning yesterday. Also basically admitting to the fact that they had tried to upgrade, the efforts weren't sufficient.

There's a value chain that occurs here. So, say the station manager made the mistake. Why wasn't there any other, you know, default safety mechanisms that would have kicked in at some point.And the Greek media is saying and some of the passengers are saying, you can check on your phone to see how far the food coming, you know, when you order food online but you don't know where the trains are going, like there's no system or electronic system that came into effect.
