      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Pamela Brown in New York.Major breaking news this morning. We just got an update from the National Hurricane Center. Hurricane Milton, it's still a Category 4 storm. But we're keeping a close eye on it because things are changing minute by minute. Outer bands have already reached Florida and brought a tornado threat with them. This one right here, take a look. This was spotted in Alligator Alley near Naples as people are trying to flee. See the roads there, cars on the road. We're just hours away from the massive Category 4 storm making landfall. And the window for people to evacuate is closing fast. One official in Tampa saying -- quote -- \"I have never seen anything of this magnitude.\" We have team coverage with CNN's Randi Kaye standing by in Sarasota. But, first, let's go to meteorologist Derek Van Dam. What do we know right now, Derek?",

      "sentences": "All right, Pamela, we're getting that 11Still a Category 4 storm, although there has been some observed weakening. I do want to stress that this storm and the storm surge potential will come on shore very consistent with a Category 5 hurricane, even though the winds may not say so, because of the amount of energy that this has pushed up from the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Nonetheless, an impactful storm is bearing down on Florida and we're already feeling the outer effects of the rain bands from Hurricane Milton. This is also new with the 11:00 a.m. Update, a Category 3, but there is explicit language within the National Hurricane Center's discussion that we are just getting now that this will be teetering on a Category 3/Category 4 strength as it makes landfall still overnight tonight. So that is going to complicate the scenario here as this will be, of course, during the dark of night, making it that much more difficult for anybody who decided to actually ride out the storm to deal with surge and the wind impacts and the tornado threat as well. This is ongoing. You saw the image that Pam flashed on the screen a moment ago of these tornadoes that have been popping up across Southern Florida, some of which have been rather large, and they have been confirmed not only visually, but on radar as well. There it is on your screen. That is an impressive tornado. In the language from the forecast discussion at National Hurricane Center, they're saying tornadic supercells have been spawned over Southern Florida and will continue to do so. And you can see several warnings ongoing, with a tornado watch valid through 9:00 p.m. tonight anywhere from Tampa Bay southward all the way to Miami-Dade County. Now, one fact that we want to hammer home here is that there will be a lot of rain that will fall from the sky. So not only do we have this very rare high risk that's only issued 4 percent of the time, but 40 percent of fatalities and 80 percent of damages comes out of that area. We kind of learned what happened with Helene two weeks ago in North Carolina. But this is going to work against the storm surge that will be pushed in from the ocean. So the water has nowhere to go but up. This is the current wind gusts that are actually taking place across the western coastline of Florida. And they're edging closer and closer to that tropical storm force. And the reason I bring that up is because there are so many bridges that line the barrier islands here. And those will be shut down once this becomes sustained tropical storm force. So the window is narrowing for anyone who decided to actually ride out this storm that they want to leave now, because the worst of the storm is going to start to really settle in, and catastrophic wind with a Category 4 hurricane bearing down on Central Florida as we speak, Pam.",

And I did speak to the mayor, as I said here, and she said that even for people who stay, they should have one week's worth of water, one week's worth of food, because they just don't know how long it will take first responders to get to them, when it will be safe for first responders to head out to the areas -- Pam.",
