And it is a clear sign that GOP support for the measure has continued to be steady and even grown in recent days. But even if the Senate passes the bill, and it is all but certain it will, its fate in the House very uncertain as many Republicans stand strong in their opposition to more Ukraine aid.Joining us now, Democratic congressman from Colorado, Jason Crow. He's member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and was just in Ukraine last week. And, congressman, that's actually where I want to start because I'm looking at pictures of your bipartisan CODEL to Ukraine to meet with -- you met with President Zelenskyy, you met with US officials there as well. Mike Turner, who is a powerful chairman in the House Republican Conference, there was French Hill, who was also a veteran, senior member of the House Republican Conference. If you put this bill on the House floor, at minimum, it gets 300 votes, probably more. And I'm not sure it's going to get put on the floor. REP. JASON CROW (D-CO): Yes. That's right, Phil. There's still overwhelming support for Ukraine and the House of Representatives. And if it was put to a vote today, it would pass overwhelmingly. And we have a procedural challenge that's been designed by largely the House Freedom Caucus, you have a few dozen House Freedom Caucus members. And these are the most extreme MAGA Republican members of the House Conference who have really held hostage the entire House. And as a consequence of that our allies, our partners, Ukraine, who are fighting for their very survival, don't have the weapons and equipment that they need. So it's terrible, but there is a group of us who are leading are pushing hard to force about essentially, and there are mechanisms to do that.",

And he's shown himself over and over again, to be that type of person.And, of course, over the last couple of days, actively encouraged Russia to attack our allies, in places where there are tens of thousands of US troops and their families stationed.

And you can have policy disagreements with somebody like that and actually be productive. So it's not good for the country. It's not good for the Republican Party that you're rational smart, a sober-minded professionals are deciding that there's no place for them in this conference right now.

Even stuff that wasn't shown on the broadcast, they were showing everyone from, you know, Paul Rudd is a huge Chiefs fan. We had Blake Lively, of course, was there with Taylor Swift.And Leonardo DiCaprio was shown on the Jumbotron. He didn't know he was on the Jumbotron, and he was kind of digging for gold a bit. And the whole stadium kind of went to. So embarrassing moment for him in the '67,000that were in there. But yes, absolutely star-studded event. Every wants to be part of it, especially in the first ever Super Bowl in Las Vegas. I mean, this place has been rocking all week long. Not a lot of sleep happening for any of the fans and most reporters as well as we're burning the candle at both ends. But those Chiefs they're still out there partying right now at what are we, 500-550 in the morning and they're still rocking celebrating the back to back championship.",
