What a way to begin the new year, right?I mean, how did -- you know, what's the secret behind how McCarthy eventually got the votes that he needed? EVA MCKEND, CNN NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER: Well Fred, essentially he had to convince those hard-liners, those conservatives, those never Kevin lawmakers to vote present. That is ultimately how he got over the finish line in the 11th hour. I don't even know if you could call it that. Probably past the 11th hour to convince those Republicans. But also it was key concessions that he had to make. You know, something that actually both Democratic and Republican rank and file members lament is that they don't have enough time to read the bills. One of the things that he agreed to was really to stick to that 72-hour rule to allow to read a bill. He's also going to put some of his detractors, some of these hard line conservatives on the powerful House Rules Committee. And then also important, Fred, now it just takes -- it will take just one member to call for a vote to potentially oust the speaker. You know, Matt Gaetz, one of his key detractors said that he wanted to -- if Kevin McCarthy ultimately secured the speakership he wanted him do so in a straitjacket. And you can see what these many concessions how essentially that is exactly what his tenure is going to look like. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Because what's also important is the absence of cellular information during that timeframe of the killings that you mentioned. So to have your cellphone ping around that area when you don't live in that vicinity, his vicinity at WSU would have hit on a different cellphone tower.12 pings in the timeframe leading up to the killings, in the months leading up to the killings, that's significant. So what's also significant is that there was no cellphone activity for two hours. WHITFIELD: Is it your suspicion that there was some sort of interaction? I mean, you are, you know, using the word \"stalking\". There was some interest that he allegedly had in these victims. Do you feel like it may have been precipitated by some interaction? I mean how would you examine the evidence to discern that?",

You know, had he had any interactions just in terms of liking things on their social media or vice versa.I do believe, and I have always kind of aspired to this theory and agreed with this theory, that he came into contact, but it was most likely brief. It may not have even piqued the radar of the victims. And I believe that's probably how he selected one, two, or all of them as his targets. So social media would really come into play there as well as witness testimony of any interactions.",

And I recall hearing from many who have looked at a lot of the Instagram, there was a lot of information there. There is a lot of activity that has been posted by these victims.So police say Kohberger, he also cleaned his car very carefully and also took care of disposing of trash at his parents' house. So we know that he had been studying criminology. What does all of this tell you about his awareness, you know, perhaps using information he has learned as a student, I mean, preparing himself for not just the crime allegedly, but for afterwards?",

And it's surprising to me how much he didn't learn necessarily.The reality is, and we teach all students, trash becomes public property once it's out there on the street because the fact that he was trying to circumnavigate that and place it into neighbors' trash cans is a bit shocking to me, quite frankly. And then also the fact that he was doing so in the reports I read on CNN, you know, at 4:00 a.m., you know, FBI, myself included, we run surveillance all hours of the day. So he had to have known or suspected that he would have been watched had he done something like that. I do believe that he is arrogant and has an ego big enough to think that he is smarter than everyone else and that he had outsmarted the system.",

Obviously, that is something that you would learn, too, as a student of criminology, all of the things that would be indicators that eventually can be evidence of your whereabouts and how he probably should have known that but I guess didn't.So a roommate in the house identified by the document as DM said a masked person walked right past her. She opened up the door and, you know, she recalls the bushy eyebrows, but that he didn't harm her but that it was described that she kind of froze.

So in my opinion, that's what happened there.But I do believe Kohberger was probably familiar with the house in that he had to go all the way to up the third floor for two of the victims.",

ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGISTand again and again because you've got multiple rounds over the next five to seven days of different storm systems that will be pushing in to pretty much the same spots. Right now we've got the rain, it's across areas of northern and central California but also some portions of Oregon and Washington also getting some rain and yes, some heavy snow. The long-term concern is, obviously, going to be flooding because not only have we had a tremendous amount of rain the last two weeks, but now we are adding more to it. So that ground is already saturated. We've got this red area here indicating a moderate threat and the yellow area a slight threat for excessive rainfall not just today but likely for the next several days. That first system pushing into the area today. The focus here is going to be Oregon, northern and central California. That system begins to exit a tiny little bit of a break in the first half of the day Sunday. But by the time we get to Sunday night the secondary system now begins to move in and the focus there is going to be across northern and central California. Overall, when we talk about rain amounts, a lot of these areas widespread 4 to 6 inches of rainfall. That is on top of in some areas 10 to 12 inches of what they have had in just the last two weeks. Snowfall amounts even higher. We're going to be measuring in the Sierras of 1 to 3 feet total. So that's why you've got these winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories. This is going to make travel incredibly difficult if not impossible if you were going say between San Francisco and Reno. But the long-term concern is certainly just going to be all of the rain. Not just today, but also Sunday and Monday. We have additional excessive rainfall threats across many of the same areas. The thing to note, too, is when that ground is already saturated it doesn't take a very strong wind to bring down trees or knock down power lines. So Fred, that's the thing. The winds may only be 40 to 60 miles per hour, but with that ground already saturated that is plenty to bring down additional trees and cause additional power outages.",

Two individuals now executed by hanging earlier this morning -- young men.We had Mohammad Mahdi Karami, a 21-year-old Iranian-Kurdish karate champion, and Seyyed Mohammad Hosseini, just 22 years old, a volunteer coach for children. Both are said to have taken part in the ongoing protest movement which has swept the country since September and they were convicted in November by the Iranian judiciary for allegedly killing a member of the Basij, that is Iran's paramilitary force. Now we have heard from rights groups and legal advocates who say that the Iranian authorities used forced confessions as evidence against these two individuals and have reported of course mistreatment and torture faced by these two individuals while in detention. We heard from one lawyer who has been advocating on behalf of one of those who was executed today saying that he was on a hunger strike from Wednesday, a dry-food hunger strike, rather, in protest against the Iranian authorities' refusal of legal representation and that he had been denied the final rights of speaking with his family. We heard from Karami's parents back in December in a video message pleading for their son's life. They have reported according to Amnesty that he faced torture while in detention. But as you laid out, the concern now is that there are dozens more as CNN understands it who could be facing execution by the Iranian authorities for their participation in this protest movement. The U.N., E.U. and other international bodies calling on the Iranian regime urgently, to bring an end to these executions, Fredricka.",
