The prosecution is using a witness right now to show how Donald Trump's hand reached to every aspect of the scheme to buy the silence of adult film actress Stormy Daniels. That is the allegation that the prosecution is trying to prove. Jeff McConney, the accountant, detailed how he was told Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump signed off on paying Michael Cohen, how he didn't send an invoice to the legal department, something against normal procedure.",

I should note she's a counsel to a firm that represents Michael Cohen, but she doesn't have contact with him and doesn't work on her case and can speak about it freely. We also have Paula Reid here with us. And we are entering an interesting moment in this testimony where right now the prosecutor is showing McConney, who is a top official of the Trump Organization for a long time, an invoice from Michael Cohen. These are obviously the payments where Donald Trump was paying Michael Cohen back for paying Stormy Daniels the $130,000. And they're getting to an interesting moment here, Paula, where they're basically walking through how he had to send these checks. He said this is a whole new process to Washington because they were coming out of Trump's personal account, not his trust account. And he was saying how they did figure out how to get these checks to the president of the United States so he could sign them and send them back to them.",

They're scribbling some stuff down on a piece of paper about Michael Cohen's griping about his bonus. There's $130,000, there's some tax concerns. They kind of come up with this way to pay him back. And then when it comes to the idea that this was somehow a retainer, McConney testified that he hadn't seen any retainer agreement. Retainer is usually what you give money to a lawyer to retain them for their services. That's what Michael Cohen said part of these payments was for.McConney said he didn't see any evidence of that. They did go a little outside the norm by not going to the legal department to check. But then after that, it's McConney who puts in the ledger that this was for legal services. And so far in this testimony, Kaitlan, we have seen no direct link to the defendant. So you're still waiting for the prosecution to establish that somehow in this alleged conspiracy that they're falsifying business records here, that there is a direct link to the defendant? We haven't seen that yet. And that should be right now that is a problem for the prosecutors.",

And he was kind of taken aback. And then Trump got off the phone and said, you're not actually fired. But basically, my bottom line is not looking as good as it is. You're just paying all these bills instead of trying to negotiate them and questioning where the money is going.And it seems to be, prosecutors say if there's not that, you know, direct line DJT signed on this, they're trying to say Donald Trump is someone who paid very close attention to where this money was going.",

And, Adam, as we look at this and you're hearing what they're testifying, basically, he is saying that he was following the invoices that Michael Cohen sent him as he was putting this in the ledger and what this was looking like.And I should note right now, they're reading and showing the jury an April 2017 e-mail that says, Allen, happy holidays, referring to Allen Weisselberg says, I'm attaching the April invoice for processing. Thank you, Michael D. Cohen. So Michael Cohen is sending these invoices to them, and then they are in turn creating these checks, sending them to the White House and having Trump send them. What's the significance of this testimony because it seems to be getting at the root of this entire criminal case? ADAM KAUFMANN, FORMER EXECUTIVE ASST. D.A., MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: Yes. So, you know, one concept to keep in mind is what the law calls accomplish liability or acting in concert. And that's the idea that if one person -- if two people agree to commit a crime and one does something and they share the same intent, both are held criminally liable for what the one did. Now, if I'm the prosecution here will probably argue that, you know, Michael Cohen created those false invoices, but they reflect the agreement that he made with Trump to do it this way. And so the fact that we haven't heard anyone detail, and I agree, it's to this point, it's something of a weakness. No one has detailed Trump's direct involvement in making these entries. But to the extent that Michael Cohen, this derives from Michael Cohen's false invoice, that the invoice had false information on it and that the people who received it were just inputting the same false information that can go back to Donald Trump on a theory of acting in concert, that he and Michael Cohen were doing this together. And so he should be criminally liable for Michael Cohen's invoices as well as for the entries in his ledger.",

We've talked about that a few times. So, yes, ultimately, the defense is going to say, this is all about Michael Cohen, and you can't take his word because he's a scoundrel and a liar. The prosecution is going to say, look at all the paperwork, look at the documents that corroborate what Michael Cohen is telling you and the independent witnesses.

But I also think, again, that a lot of witnesses, the defense hasn't need to go out of their way to destroy. No lengthy cross examination is setting up key points to try to destroy the witnesses because, you know, as I just said, a lot of what the witnesses are saying, the defense is adopting and trying to marshal into their own arguments.

It's really about the hush money payments that were an in kind campaign contribution that should have been disclosed. And the focus has been on the fact that Donald Trump's records are falsified, that he made or caused false entries in those records.What the DA didn't charge to me is very interesting. And what the DA didn't charge was that same law falsifying business records can also cover situations where someone has an obligation to make a record and they omit to make that record. So you're obliged, you have a legal obligation to make some type of entry and you don't do it. That's the same crime as causing a false entry to be made. And it's been very curious to me throughout that the DA never charged the omissions, right? If Donald Trump should have made this entry, then he should have made the entry in the records of the Trump campaign. And if that entry wasn't made, that would be an omission. And to me, in many ways, that would have been the stronger case. It's not what was charged here. And so, you know, I think the case is going in well, but I think there is this sort of gap. Donald Trump did what he did. The question is whether this is sort of captures the essence of it, which is the illegal campaign contribution.",

The prosecution's mission this morning is to try to draw a direct line between the payments to Michael Cohen from the Trump Organization and the boss, the former president of the United States. I want to add Bryan Lanza to our conversation. He worked for the Trump campaign in 2016, which is how I first met you. I remember going back to these days about how small the team was, how, you know, connected you all were to each other and to the boss as Michael Cohen and maybe you also called him. As we're listening to when watching this testimony right now from somebody who worked on the books inside the Trump Organization, can you just kind of give us a sense of how you view what's happening given the fact that you were actually there inside the Trump campaign at the time?BRYAN LANZA, FORMER DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP-PENCE CAMPAIGN: Yes. First of all, thank you for having me. You know, with respect to how the transactions are going in this place. I mean, it's not uncommon in Trump roll, even in 2016, where you had a lot of people sort of acting independently to try to help. Oftentimes they didn't help. Oftentimes we stumbled upon, you know, them trying to help. You know, we stumbled upon, I guess at some point, Don Jr., you know, meeting with some Russians because some third party thought it was a good idea. So that was not uncommon. So it's not uncommon for Michael Cohen to sort of act as a free agent. You know, in my experience in 2016, he often came down to the campaign, sort of gave directives of what needed to be done. But then when we circled back with President Trump, it was completely contrary to what President Trump had wanted. So for us, you know, we oftentimes we refer to Michael Cohen as 2 percent because you could only count on him being truthful 2 percent of the time. And so I suspect this is just an extension of what we've seen from 2016, even probably an extension of how Michael Cohen has done most of his business in the Trump Organization, acting out as his independent agent, checking in when it's convenient, and sort of keeping his distance because there's -- it tends to be a lot of outside, advisors say, you know, don't do those things.",

She suggested that, to your point, that he was rogue at times, things contrary with the campaign wanted.
