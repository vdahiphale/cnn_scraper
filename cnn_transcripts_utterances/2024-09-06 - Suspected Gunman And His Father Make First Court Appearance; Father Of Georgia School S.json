And it's really hard to wrap your head around what happened here this morning. We're talking about back-to-back father and son court appearances for a mass shooting that has gutted this community and appalled the nation. The families of some of the victims were in the courtroom crying at different moments during the proceedings. It was just very difficult to watch the son. The 14-year-old Colt Gray appeared first. His arms were shackled and he was wearing a green top and tan pants. The 14-year-old remained virtually motionless other than shaking loose hair out of his face when he first sat down. The younger Gray replied to questions by the judge by saying, yes, sir, in a very respectful manner, as he was informed of his rights under the law and the charges that he faces. Let's remember, Zain and Bianna, that he has been charged as an adult with four counts of felony murder. Some of the victims' families were attending the hearing as well, which made the hearing even more emotional and somber. After initially saying that the suspect faced the death penalty, Judge Currie Mingledorff corrected himself saying that he's only eligible for a life sentence given that he is a minor. District Attorney Smith made it clear, more charges are entirely possible. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And then, of course, behind them just feet away, the family members of those victims just two days after their loved ones were taken from them. We know Colin Gray is now the latest example of prosecutors really holding parents responsible for a school shooting. We were talking about the novelty of this and perhaps the precedent it sets earlier last year in Michigan, where we saw Jennifer and James Crumbley being the first parents to be convicted in a mass shooting. What is your take, specifically given that his father bought him this gun? JEFF SWARTZ, FORMER MIAMI-DADE COUNTY COURT JUDGE: Well, I look at these circumstances. They are considerably different in my mind, although they are similar to the Crumbley case. I was critical of the prosecution of the Crumbleys, just simply on the facts that were presented in that particular instance. I also have a problem with the idea of involuntary manslaughter being charged against parents because I'm trying to find the causation, the exact direct causational link between the parents and the ultimate result as a result of the children using these weapons. But it seems to be that that is something we have seen a number of cases of over the last four or five years. It looks like this is something that the community wants, that the public wants. And they want parents held responsible for the acts of their children. I've always been concerned just how far down the criminal ladder that we're going to follow as to the responsibility of parents. But in any case, it's tragic when you have a 14-year-old child and a 14- year-old is still a child going into a school and shooting it up and killing people. And probably just immediately saying, I did it like. This is something he's just going to be punished for. And it's really difficult. That's why the court, some time ago, did away with the death penalty for juveniles and did away with life without parole for juveniles.

Here in Georgia, it is in the sound discretion of the prosecutor. This is you. It's not as unique as you would think. For lesser offenses, it happens all the time. But you're seeing it really play out on something that has national interest and people are looking at it. I, for one, understand the reasons for it. If they can have a hearing by a court, I think that would be more appropriate to determine whether this child is irredeemable or can be sentenced as a juvenile and redeemed and rehabilitated, but they're not going to do that.

In court, we don't know what the three judge panel of the Second Circuit Federal Court is going to decide here whether they will uphold that $5 million damages verdict and how the other appeals Donald Trump is bringing to the court will go. But the arguments today, there were questions about whether the trial was properly presented. If the jury should have even heard from some witnesses and heard the Access Hollywood tape of Donald Trump showing how he treats women or the pattern that he uses. That was the argument of E. Jean Carroll that it's all a pattern for him. And so now, we wait to see what happens next as far as what the appeals court does. And if there is a response from E. Jean Carroll on this. At the same time, he also called the judges that he has faced in New York, in civil lawsuits, and in his criminal case, hostile, very hostile toward him. He said that at his press conference, and today is the day that we will learn from Judge Juan Merchan in Donald Trump's criminal hush money case where he's been convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records, if he will be sentenced on those charges by Judge Merchan on September 18th.
