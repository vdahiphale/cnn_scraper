Around half a million Israelis live in west bank settlements which are considered illegal under International Law.

It looks back at the four years of Trump's first term in office when he moved the embassy to Jerusalem, recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights.And there were talks at the time, between the prime minister and the president, about the prospect of annexation, or Israel's application of sovereignty, also in the West Bank, territory that is still disputed ever since Israel conquered that land back in 1967. So the right wing in Israel definitely feels like there is a windfall and there's an opportunity right now to try to gain some of these benefits.

He feels that now, with a conservative movement and the Republican Party now coming into office, there's an opportunity for them to be able to work together and meet, maybe achieve some of these objectives.It's important to remember, Anna, that there are members of the Trump administration who might be coming in, definitely of the past administration. We saw that, for example, with the former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, big advocates and proponents of Israel's presence in what is referred to as Judea and Samaria in the West Bank. So there is a hope in that side, in small church's circles, that there will be people who will come back to office and hold similar views. But I think that Israel, and at least the prime minister for the time being, has his eyes set on, I don't call it necessarily the bigger prize, but yes, the bigger prize, which is Iran. And a way to align opinions and views between Jerusalem and Washington on how to confront Iran, we saw that Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that he's already spoken with President-elect Trump three times over the last few days. Maybe the most any foreign leader has spoken with the President. He's dispatched his Strategic Affairs Minister to meet with Trump. They sat for a couple hours just the other day. So there's a lot of alignment and dialogue that's taking place right now between Israel and, not just the Biden administration but also the incoming Trump administration. And I would argue that it has a lot to do more with Iran than anything to do with the Palestinians at the moment.",

And on the one hand, Israel was very supportive of that.Prime Minister Netanyahu a couple months afterwards boasted that it was because of his convincing that Donald Trump pulled out of that deal back in May of 2018. So the vacuum, though, that was created, that's where things get a little more controversial. Was it good? Did it allow Iran to plow forward with its nuclear program or did it help stop Iran? But now there's an opportunity, and I think that Israel definitely feels that there's an opportunity to align with the Trump administration. We're seeing some hawkish appointments there of different officials who are hawks definitely on Iran. And Israel feels that this might be an opportunity to crack down with more, what has been called crippling sanctions on the Iranians. But also if needed, maybe military action. We've seen just last month Israel's strike against Iran taking out its surface to air missile systems, the famous S300 that had been supplied to the Iranians by the Russians. Basically, Iran is more vulnerable today than it has been in the past when it comes to defending its own nuclear facilities. And I think that Israel feels that there is an opportunity to coordinate very closely with the incoming administration, and take advantage potentially of this opportunity with Iran on the ropes, maybe get it to finally, once and for all stop its race towards a nuclear capability.",

Marco Rubio is well-known here in China.In fact, if we look back to 2020, he was actually sanctioned along with some other lawmakers by the Chinese government for, \"behaving badly\" on Hong Kong related issues. And as you know from being in Hong Kong, the changing political landscape of Hong Kong and the Chinese influence has been a very contentious point. It is not clear at this point that if this moves forward, and he is sworn in as Secretary of State, if Beijing will lift those sanctions. But that's a question that is looming. But if we look at Marco Rubio and some of his statements, and his actions over the past decade or so, it is clear that China is a part of the world that he has studied.

Visitors will also have to buy personalized tickets with their names on them, in an effort to stop travel groups from buying up tickets to sell at higher prices. The changes are part of an effort to make important tourist destinations like Pompeii sustainable by focusing on the quality of the experience for the visitor, rather than on the quantity of tickets sold. Pompeii was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D.",
