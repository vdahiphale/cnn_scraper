In all, the U.S. has committed more than $32 billion to Ukraine since the start of the war more than a year ago. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins us now from Wilmington, Delaware, where the president is spending the weekend. Priscilla, what do we know about this new aid package? PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER (on camera): Well, this is essentially more ammunition and support equipment. And it actually marks the 33rd drawdown of U.S. inventories for Ukraine. So, what is it include? It's a mix of artillery rounds, demolition munitions, equipment for obstacle clearing, as well as vehicle repair equipment. So, all of this as part of that security assistance that the U.S. has been providing to Ukraine, as it remains a top priority in this second year of war. In fact, just yesterday, President Biden met with German Chancellor Scholz, where the two of them discussed Ukraine. Administration officials just ahead of that meeting had said the two were expected to talk about coordination with Ukraine. Now, recall, Scholz has been a crisis leader in Europe as this war has unfolded. He's also been a critical partner to the United States. So, two of them, as you see there talking at length yesterday about Ukraine and the continued support for the country as it launches into that second year. And, of course, as there are concerns about another Russian offensive on Ukraine. And as intelligence suggests that China is considering providing lethal aid to Russia. So, that meeting happening against the backdrop of all of that. And, as you know, Fred, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy has said there shouldn't be no delay in getting assistance to the country. He's also asked for F-16 fighter jets. When it comes to that, President Biden has said he's ruling it out for now, but in the interim, the Pentagon continuing to provide that assistance with this latest $400 million package. Fred.",

There are standards and rules and regulations in every country. And the women have an important role in Iran. And they gained to that role after the victory of the Islamic Revolution in Iran.

Some other people have said that we've heard from the former speaker of parliament, Mr. Larijani, who at the beginning said, do we really need to make all this chaos over a hijab? So I want to know whether you accept it because it's also traditional women, older women who've gone in the streets, it's men, it's young. It's very different than previous protests. Do you accept that women can have peaceful demonstrations for change and for their own rights? Do they have the rights? You say that it's the most developed democracy?
