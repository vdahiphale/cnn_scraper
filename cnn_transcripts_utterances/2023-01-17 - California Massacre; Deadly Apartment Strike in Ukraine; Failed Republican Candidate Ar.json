So they go back up to the apartment. And Shane Osborne is there. And he says:  I have been really sick. I was asleep. I had no idea he went outside. I have never brought a gun into this apartment. My cousin has kept his gun here when he's not feeling mentally stable. But I don't know there's a gun here. And so he authorizes and consent to a search. They look everywhere. There it is. They find the gun in a roll top desk. The officer immediately takes out the bullets; 15 bullets were in that gun. But it did not go off because there was not one bullet in the chamber. He has now been charged, Osborne, with neglect of a dependent. His first court hearing is on Thursday. Arresting charges at this point. We will have to see, Erica, what prosecutors do.",

      "sentences": "I mean, there's so much of that, Jean. I know you're going to stick around with us. Because, as we look at this, and this story, there's a lot here when it comes to the discussion about access to guns in this country, and children. So let's take a look first at the numbers; 4.6 million kids live in a home with at least one unlocked loaded gun.Nationwide, more than half of gun owners say they don't lock their firearm securely. And, frankly, in many states, they don't have to. Just 23 states and Washington, D.C., have gun storage laws. Only eight mandate that they be secured. And we know there are a lot of guns in this country. The numbers bear that out, more than one for every person in the U.S. And we also know that most gun owners in the United States, they favor sensible regulations because they know what keeps them and it keeps others safe. But the recent headlines tell us there's a lot of work to do. In Texas, a 14-year-old girl is now facing murder charges after allegedly shooting an 11-year-old boy over the weekend. Now, she was reportedly aiming at another teen, but that young bystander was killed. Two teens in Atlanta also facing murder charges after a November shooting that killed a 12- and 15-year-old. And a first grade teacher in Virginia still recovering after a 6-year-old brought a gun to school and shot her. CNN senior law enforcement analyst Charles Ramsey is joining Jean and me now. So, Commissioner, when we look at this, I think it's important to note these are all very different scenarios. But at the end of the day, each one in each scenario, a child was able to get their hands on a gun. In your experience, what we're seeing now, is it easy for a kid to get a gun?",

He committed a mass shooting at his high school. And he pleaded guilty to everything. Precedent-setting, his parents, James and Jennifer Crumbley, are charged with involuntary manslaughter, which has a number of years in prison, saying, you caused the death, because you purchased this gun for him when he was not mentally stable, and you should have known that. You violated a duty. But it's with the appellate court now, because the defense said, this should not go to trial. You don't have the evidence to show that the parents caused the death.",

And this may be the way that they are choosing to deal with a situation, which I think raises an important question as to whether or not we, as a country, as a society, are ready to deal with that, to deal with the fact that kids see guns all over the place, right, whether you're a toddler, a 6-year-old, a teenager. But the message that we are sending as a country, as a society, in many cases is that the way to deal with your issue is to do it through violence, and, in some cases, a gun. The chances that we actually have that real conversation, Commissioner, what do you think?",

But it's going to happen over and over and over again. But our elected officials lack the courage to sit down, have a conversation and come up with something reasonable that will keep the guns out of the hands of individuals, not just toddlers and young children, but teenagers and others that should not have guns. It is not going to happen because we don't have the guts as a country to really have that kind of conversation and then take action. And so I don't see anything changing, personally. But, again, hold people accountable. Parents, they need to be prosecuted if they're allowing their children to have access to those guns because they're not safely maintaining them. I was a police officer. I raised the son. I kept my gun in a locked box. I mean, I did not just let my gun just lay around, even though I'm a law enforcement officer. I mean, I obviously had a right to have a gun and it was part of my equipment. But I was careful with that gun. Now I have a grandchild. Same thing. I keep it locked up.

      "sentences": "Yes, Erica.And this is exactly what federal law enforcement has been warning about for the past few years. And that is, there is a segment of society out there, when they hear these election lies, some of them start to believe it, internalize it. And for those who may be predisposed to violence, that could lead to actual attacks. So, it appears early on in this investigation that that could be what is to play here. This official, Solomon Pena, this is a -- as you mentioned, someone who ran for the state House in New Mexico as a Republican. He lost in a landslide. But we're hearing from witnesses and from police that he apparently made visits to some of these officials that were ultimately allegedly targeted with gunfire, telling about his grievances, saying that he believed that he actually won the election. Now, he was arrested yesterday by the Albuquerque SWAT team. Police say that he conspired with four other men to shoot at the homes of four Democratic officials. It's worth pointing out we have attempted to reach Pena for comment. These shootings occurred between December 4 and January 3. And, in the latest shooting, police say that Pena himself actually pulled the trigger. Now, we have been going through the arrest warrant affidavit that was just released. It is chock full of very chilling detail. In one example, there's actually a cooperating witness who agreed to help police who said that the co-conspirators originally targeted above the windows in residences, but Pena allegedly told them that, no, he wanted them to get more aggressive, to shoot lower, to shoot at a time of day when these people wouldn't be asleep and laying horizontally, so just chilling details. And we're going back and looking at his social media presence as well, getting some insight into his mind-set. I will show you a couple of his tweets. And one of them, this was in response to Representative Hakeem Jeffries, who's now the House minority leader, who was slamming election deniers. Pena responds that: \"New Mexico elections are absolutely rigged.\" He says: \"We will pursue justice.\" In another tweet, he says that his own election was rigged, saying: \"I will fight it until the day I die.\" Now, we're still waiting to hear what is going to happen to those other four individuals. Police continue to investigate. They don't yet know if those men even knew who they were actually shooting at or if they were just hired to fire at random at these targets. A lot more investigating yet to be done, but certainly a chilling story there in New Mexico, someone who was seeking public office and it appears, because he didn't like the way the election went, decided to pick up guns and actually go after those Democratic targets. Again, that's something that we have been hearing from our law enforcement sources for some time now that they continue to be worried about. It's not hypothetical. It's not academic.

The responders worked around the clock since the missile struck, honored and themselves paying respect to the victims, a gaping hole where dozens of families once lived. (on camera):  As you can see here, this building was completely annihilated all the way down to the ground floor. And the Ukrainians say the reason why the damage is so extensive is that the Russians used a cruise missile called the Kh-22. That is designed to destroy whole aircraft carrier strike groups. And when it hit the building, the building just completely collapsed and buried dozens of people underneath. (voice-over):  A miracle that anyone survived at all, Ukrainian authorities say. Kateryna Zelenska was pulled from the rubble by rescuers hours after the strike, but her husband and 1-year-old son remain unaccounted for.

More air defense systems are the only thing that can save our civilians in our cities.\" The Ukrainians say they had no chance of stopping this missile that crashed into the building.
