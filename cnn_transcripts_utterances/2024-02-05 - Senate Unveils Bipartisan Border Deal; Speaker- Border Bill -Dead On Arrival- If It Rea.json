Donald Trump this morningstrengthening his opposition to this bipartisan bill, saying it would be \"a great gift to Democrats\". President Biden, however, saying I`m ready to secure the border. The president is in Nevada ahead of the state`s Democratic primary tomorrow. Biden faces no real opposition in that contest, and his campaign focused squarely on Donald Trump. Plus, we are less than three weeks away from the South Carolina Republican primary. I`ll speak with Lieutenant Governor Pamela Evette about why she supports Donald Trump over his own state`s former Governor Nikki Haley. Good day, everyone. I`m Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching across the world. It is 11 a.m. here in Washington Monday, February 5. There are just 19 days until the South Carolina Republican primary, 273 days until Election Day. This is today`s State of the Race. All right. We now have the details of a much anticipated bipartisan border bill that was negotiated by senators in both parties. The $118 billion package includes roughly $60 billion in war funding for Ukraine and another $14 billion for Israel. The Senate is set to take action on it this week. But, even if it passes, Speaker Mike Johnson says the bill is dead on arrival in the House. The border crisis, of course, at the very center of this presidential campaign. Donald Trump doing all he can to shut the deal down, not wanting to hand President Joe Biden a political win on this issue. Here is what Trump said on Friday before the bill was released.
