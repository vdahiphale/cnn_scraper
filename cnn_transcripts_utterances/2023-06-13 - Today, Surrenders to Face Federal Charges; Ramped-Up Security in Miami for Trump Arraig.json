Trump will be under arrest, the first and only former president to ever face federal charges.This morning, we're learning new details about Trump's legal team. Todd Blanche and Chris Kise are expected to represent the former president today. We also just learned last night Trump ended up having dinner with his co-defendant, Walt Nauta, along with their attorneys. Sources say a number of senior political advisers were also at the table at his Doral resort. Here's how we expect today's event to play out. The former president will arrive at the court by car. It's a quick drive, about 12 miles. Sources say he'll be taken under the building and will enter from there, largely avoiding cameras and the press when he actually walks in. His appearance is scheduled for 03:00 P.M. Eastern today. But once he's inside that building, Trump will be officially under arrest. It is expected that he will be fingerprinted. However, we're hearing that he will not have a mug shot taken and no cameras are allowed in federal court. That is the rule. The former president has maintained his innocence, and we do expect him to plead not guilty to all 37 counts being brought against him. Let's get right to CNN Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid, who is outside the court in Miami. It doesn't look like a lot of things have changed since earlier today. What are you seeing now?",

But that's just about the most excitement we've seen so far. But that could all change in a few hours when former President Trump is expected to travel from his Doral golf club here to federal court in downtown Miami to surrender.Now, as you noted, he's going to travel here by car. He'll head into a garage under the federal court building behind me, so it's unlikely that we will see him. But, Sara, once he's inside the building, he is under arrest, and he will be processed more or less like any other defendant. As you noted, he will be fingerprinted, but he will not get a mug shot. And part of the reason is because mug shots are used to identify people, usually if they go on the lamp. Former President Trump is arguably one of the most famous in the world, so they really don't need that here. But then the hearing will get underway before a magistrate judge. The charges that have been filed by Special Counsel Jack Smith and other prosecutors will be read to Trump, and he will have the opportunity to enter a plea. Now, he previewed what he's going to say on a radio show. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

This is interesting, again, because, as we have noted, there were a lot of questions as to what exactly their relationship would look like after Walt was named as a co-defendant. And, clearly, they are in lockstep as of now.The other thing to watch today as they appear together at the courthouse, we know that in New York, Walt was there in a body man capacity for Trump. He was behind him at all times. We saw that on camera. He's not going to be there. And there is no one playing that role today. So, this is an interesting dynamic. The other thing to watch for is the interaction between Walt Nauta and the former president tonight at Bedminster. Is Trump going to talk about Nauta at all? Is Nauta going to make any kind of remarks? Is he going to be seen at the club? Right now, that is still unknown. Rahel?",

He will have a separate attorney, but under a similar defense team. The reason this is so significant, of course, is because people talk about the expectation to flip this particular person. I hear a lot about this notion of flipping someone, as if you always have to try to get the biggest fish in the pond. But it's essential to think about the indictment. It says Trump employee number two as well, to corroborate sometimes what they have about Walt Nauta. And, remember, the fact that they are conspirators allegedly, having them together on the same indictment does not preclude them from having any correspondence from here on out, and the judge won't order them to be separate.",

Can you imagine the voir dire already of this process about trying to get an impartial group of jurors who can be impartial in this instance and have the same witnesses, same presentation of evidence, all because you prefer something different?

That's going to be litigated. The motions practice will be litigated. These aren't necessarily slam dunks for the defense to raise them, but they're going to try to raise these with an eye towards saying, let's stretch it out. We'd like to have more information. We want to figure out if they're going to allege misconduct by the prosecutors. They don't have winning arguments, according to what we know right now, but they may want to delay because Trump has said he can fundraise off this.

She is a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School. She worked for a reputable law firm afterwards, served time in the U.S. Attorney's Office, and has a reputation as being tough on criminal defendants. There's no reason to believe that after she was reversed by the 11th Circuit and instructed that Donald Trump is not to be treated any differently than any other defendant who's a criminal defendant in the United States. I think she's learned her lesson, and the odds are with everybody's eyes on her, she's going to do a good job. And at the end of the day, the best person to try Donald Trump, if he's convicted, is a Trump appointee, because that will tamp down all of this concern about politicization of the judiciary, of the DOJ.

Because we know, Sara, that the threat posed by protests that turn violent, particularly those that are set off by the presence of domestic violent extremists, that can happen anywhere. The nation's capital is not the only site, the only kind of sensitive site for that sort of activity. We've seen all sorts of armed protests take place in different statehouses across the country. We've certainly seen acts of domestic terrorism take place all over the country.
