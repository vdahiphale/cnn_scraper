But we asked the question, has Joe Biden's actions regarding his son's investigation, have they been appropriate or inappropriate?We got a close matchup here, but inappropriate takes the cake here with 55% compared to appropriate at 44%. But, of course, just because they view them inappropriately, it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to change their vote choice come 2020. So, change in the chance of voting for Joe Biden after the claims against his son here we see clearly 57% say no impact. You do see 34% say less likely, but the vast majority of those are Republicans. So, look, they see Joe Biden's actions as inappropriate, but the idea that's going to change their vote for 2020 just doesn't bear out in the numbers.",

I don't know if it's bluster if he would actually testify in that trial, but you contrast that with four indictments.But now Biden's son, for the first time in American history, has also been indicted. Very different charges but it just is sort of this can you just put this in context for us once again? Never before happened in American History in any moment.",

If you go back to the first impeachment, if you go back to things that we have heard him say on the record, he was saying he just wanted some rough equivalence.He wants to try and neutralize all of the criminal allegations against him. And now this gives him some kind of equivalents that he can go out on the campaign trail and say, \"Oh, you're accusing me of wrongdoing? Well, let's talk about the \"Biden Crime Family\" and try to impute to the Sitting president something that his son might have done five years ago.\" So that's really all Donald Trump wanted. It's the politicization of an act of government, in this case, the indictment of Hunter Biden, and that's all it has ever been. That is why he instructed his followers and supporters in the Republican conference to say something, to start some kind of impeachment. They said that they would do it before they even took power. And the point, again, was not to come up with any real information or pursue truth or justice or anything like that, but simply to give Donald Trump what he considered an important talking point, so that when he goes on the campaign trail, he can say, everybody's got corruption charges. I've got corruption charges. And so does my opponent, Joe Biden.",
