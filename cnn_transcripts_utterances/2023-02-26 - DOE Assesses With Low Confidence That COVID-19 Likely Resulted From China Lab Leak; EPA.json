An updated classified intel report saying that the U.S. Department of Energy has assess that the source of the COVID-19 pandemic likely came from a China lab leak. But there is one major caveat. Sources at the Department of Energy tell CNN that the report has, quote, \"low confidence\". CNN's Natasha Bertrand has been reporting on all of this and she's joining us right now on the phone. Natasha, I mean various U.S. intel agencies have been split on this issue for years now. And this is from the Department of Energy, low confidence -- what does all this mean?",

      "sentences": "Yes Fred. So this is essentially another data point. The intel essentialycommunity has been examining this really closely for the last two years, ever since President Biden tasked them with investigating the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic shortly after he first got into office.And back in 2021 the intel agencies, roughly 18 of them -- they could not come to a definitive conclusion about where this virus actually originated and that is still the case. So what we're now seeing is that the Department of Energy has collected some new intelligence, according to our sources, that has led them to come to a conclusion that the lab leak theory is plausible and that it likely did come from a lab. Now, of course, that major caveat noted that that assessment is low confidence is very important because low confidence assessment generally means that the information that has been obtained by the intel community is not reliable enough or too fragmented to make a more definitive judgment or there's simply not enough information available to draw a more robust conclusion about the origins of this pandemic. But bottom line here is that this really adds to the divide in the U.S. government over whether the pandemic began in China in 2019 as the result of a lab leak or whether it emerged naturally. There are, along with the Department of Energy, other agencies that also believe that this could have emerged from a lab, including the FBI, which has medium confidence in that theory. However, the major intel agencies, for example like the CIA, they still do not know definitively where this pandemic originated. And so there's still a lot of work to be done, we're told, before they can come to any kind of real analytic conclusion about this. And we should note there are many people inside the U.S. government that don't believe that we may ever know for sure where this virus came from, Fred.",

And essentially what we're told is that they had enough to update at this point. Then this D.O.E., Department of Energy update, came as part of a broader report that the entire intelligence community sent to Congress recently. So this is part of that kind of regular updating process; when they next have more information to update, they will do so.

And I wanted to make sure he knew about what I saw on the ground. Both in terms of the administration response and that is something that has been really well coordinated.

The claim that they have taken several villages north of the city of Bakhmut in an attempt to encircle it. Ukrainian forces say that they're standing their ground in the face of intense Russian assault. Now Fred, over the course of the past few months, this fight has evolved from a longer range battle with artillery, tanks, and mortars to a much closer fight, urban warfare in the city with fighting street to street, building to building. Now, there is no talk yet of surrendering the city on the Ukrainian side. But President Zelenskyy has softened his stance on that saying that he will not fight to keep it at any cost if it means everybody is going to die. Meanwhile Fred, as this second year of the war starts, there is no indication that President Putin is softening his stance that he plans on changing course or that he plans to pull back or sit down for any kind of negotiations.

But the Biden administration openly warning China that there would be consequences if they decided to go down that road. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations saying that that would be a red line because it would be a significant boost for Russia in this fight. Meanwhile, Iran appears to be poised to be getting help with their missile program from Russia according to Bill Burns. That it's something that they've long sought. And Russia is also apparently considering sending fighter jets to Iran. So that relationship between Iran and Russia -- and Iran has been sending Kamikaze drones and ammunition here to the Russians in Ukraine. That relationship deepening in a fast and disturbing way, Director Burns said, Fred. WHITFIELD: All right. Alex Marquardt, thanks so much in Dnipro. Let's talk more about all this. Let me bring in retired U.S. Army Major Mike Lyons. Major, so good to see you. So the CIA director saying, you know, Putin is pursuing military aid from China and possibly even Iran. What's your point of view here? MAJOR MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, he needs two things. He needs ammunition. 152 mm shells coming from China would go a long way with Russia as they want to fight an artillery war right now. There's a stalemate along that front and he needs a lot more ammunition. The second thing he needs is more people if he wants to go on this offensive. There's a natural boundary between the forces right now and it exists with the Dnipro River there. You saw the Chinese, for example, hand over one of their proposals of trying to make peace, basically Russia has everything to the east of that Dnipro River. So I wouldn't be surprised if the Chinese end up doing those two things, drones and ammunition. That would really escalate the opportunity for Russia to go on the offensive.",

And then watch them start to bought out. That's the wind that we're watching develop through the midnight hours. That's 10:00, midnight, 2:00 in the morning. Now, it's starting to push in through Missouri and up through the Ohio Valley. Still holding on to that severe threat tomorrow, through parts of the Ohio Valley in the Midwest, just not as great as it once was like it is through the overnight hours today. Now, we're watching that and of course, bringing in the flooding threat. Not only dealing with the flooding and the severe weather, but severe storms -- yes, strong winds, but the whole system itself causing many concerns with winds gusting over 40 to 50 miles per hour even when it's all over.",

The media companies want access to the same footage that new House Speaker Kevin McCarthy recently handed over to Fox News host Tucker Carlson. The Republican speaker gave the conservative TV host about 44,000 hours of police footage from the insurrection.

That's a question with whoever gets a hold of this.It's just such a foolish and improper thing that Kevin McCarthy has done apparently to curry favor with Tucker Carlson who has been very critical of him at times. WHITFIELD: All right. Shifting gears now, let's talk about documents that are found in lots of places, including at Mar-a-Lago. It turns out prosecutors have interviewed a Trump aide who copied classified materials onto a laptop and thumb drive, reportedly not knowing they were actually classified.

And the reason they had to do that was because of the danger of Donald Trump taking these documents with him and refusing to turn them back over despite being asked again and again.And the thought -- you know, when I was ambassador I had our nation's highest security clearance, supervised hundreds of people who worked with classified documents all the time. The thought that these documents would be copied by somebody who doesn't have the proper security clearance -- some documents would be copied -- and put on a laptop, that magnifies the danger. Once it's on a laptop, it can be copied again and again, it can be hacked. Laptops can be lost or misplaced or accessed. It's a tremendous security threat to our country, and I believe an unlawful one.",

In fact, there is a study by the American Psychological Association conducted during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, it surveyed over 15,000 educators. So, these are teachers, administrators, psychologists, social workers and other school staff members. And what it found was one-third of teachers reported being victimized, so this is verbal and violence threats from students.Support staff, so school resource officers, aides like the one we're seeing in this video and bus drivers, they're the most likely to report physical aggression with 99 percent of the aggressors actually being students in that case. The survey found 29 to 34 percent of educators showed interest in quitting or transferring schools because of the school climate because of these safety issues. So, this really highlights a much bigger problem. In this case the student is facing felony aggravated battery with bodily harm. He's since been turned over to the department of juvenile justice.",

We don't know when the results will be announced because they have to announce the results from the 36 states in Nigeria and the federal territory. They only announced one and they're convening tomorrow in about l2 hours or so. So this might take a couple of days until we know who the next president of Nigeria will be.Their big task will be dealing with insecurity. That's the top of voters' minds according to one survey. Corruption is another one and the economy. A third of Nigerians are unemployed. Why am I here? You see a lot of security back here, because this is one of the collection centers, which is where they're counting and putting the votes together from Lagos state. Lagos is the commercial capital of Nigeria. That's where the largest number of voters at 7.1 million. And so, it's a highly contested part of the country and that back there is where they're putting that together, waiting to announce. The reason why there's so much security here probably is because there's people who didn't get to go and we'll speak to some of them that are agitated because they feel disenfranchised by polling station that just didn't open. They were there yesterday on election day. They're told them back today to vote and didn't happen. Listen to some of them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
