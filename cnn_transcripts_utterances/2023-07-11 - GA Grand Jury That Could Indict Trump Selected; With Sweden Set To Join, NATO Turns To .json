I think they tried to do it in a pretty ham-handed way in this motion. They definitely kind of threw -- they kind of threw everything out there at the start. Usually, the way that defense attorneys get delays is they use all the tools in their toolbox. There's -- they have requests for additional discovery and there's more motions and all of this conflicts with another case in their schedule, maybe in Georgia or Manhattan. And they can delay a little over little -- little by little. Here's the guy throughout from the very beginning that they -- you know want to delay this. I think that they were doing that to put a marker down because the prosecution is really trying to move this quickly. But if they are able to successfully do what I think they will be able to do, in other words, push this past the election, what does this mean for our democracy, for our constitutional system of government, it is completely unprecedented. And it is very fair to say that the people who wrote our Constitution many, many years ago, did not contemplate a situation where the President of the United States, for example, is currently facing criminal indictment and could order the attorney general of the United States to dismiss those charges or a situation where, for example, he is ultimately convicted and then one other branch of government, the judiciary is trying to get the executive branch to enforce punishment against the head of the executive branch.

This would be a challenge for any judge to manage. And I think any judge to schedule because, of course, you have two defendants here. And ultimately, what a judge wants to do is they want to avoid an appeal. So, usually, they're bending over backwards to try to make sure that the rights of the accused, in this case, Donald Trump and Walt Nauta, that they are respected. Here, in this case, for the first time ever, we have this countervailing concern about an election, about what this could mean for our democracy, avoiding a constitutional crisis. That is not something a judge is really ever considered in the past. And it's not the sort of thing a judge would typically consider. I think for any judge, that will be a challenge to consider.

Now, they say they don't have to complete that process because they already have proven that they have done certain political economic reforms -- legal reforms necessary to join NATO. But the question still remains especially for Zelenskyy of a clear timeline of when Ukraine will actually be able to join NATO. And the question, of course, remains if NATO is only agreeing to allow Ukraine to join the alliance after the war with Russia ends. Does that then incentivize Russian President Vladimir Putin to continue the war in Ukraine? This is something that President Zelenskyy has been emphasizing. Saying that this shows weakness to President Putin. And that if the NATO alliance was serious about bringing Ukraine. And then they would have included stronger language in this communique, saying that they have a timeline and a clearer picture of when Ukraine is actually going to be able to join here.
