Just one week from today, former President Donald Trump and President Biden are going to go head to head in Atlanta on the CNN debate stage.It's going to be historic. It'll be the first debate ever between a sitting president and a former president, and it could potentially define a race that still has no clear front-runner. Right now, we're learning new details on how both candidates are preparing, and, as you might imagine, it's in very different ways. Today, President Biden is traveling to Camp David, where he's going to huddle with a tight circle of advisers for several days of intense discussion and preparation, including mock debates. Former President Trump, on the other hand, taking a less formal approach. He's holding -- quote -- \"policy discussions\" with some of his vice presidential contenders and other Republican allies. Let's get the latest now from CNN's Alayna Treene. And, Alayna, we just learned that, by virtue of a coin flip, Donald Trump is going to be speaking last at the debate.",

      "sentences": "Well, you mentioned that President Joe Biden is doing mock debates. Donald Trump's team is not. They have no plans to do any sort of role-playing or mock debates, even though, in the past -- and it's traditional of presidential candidates to have mock debates.Donald Trump in the past has had Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie stand in for his opponents. They are not doing this. You're right. They are dubbing his debate as policy discussions. I'm told that he's met with vice presidential contenders, senators, policy experts. We know, earlier this month, Senator J.D. Vance, a top person under consideration for his running mate, they met at Mar-a-Lago and talked about the economy, trying to sharpen his message on inflation. We know last week he met with Senator Marco Rubio, another V.P. contender, and Senator Eric Schmitt. They talked about his handling of the January 6 Capitol attack and democracy overall. So, in my conversations with Trump's team, they say that these meetings are really about sharpening his rhetoric on certain messaging, talking about and framing some of the more tough issues that Donald Trump is going to likely have to confront, things like his conviction, his guilty verdict in his Manhattan trial, all of that taking place behind the scenes. Now, one thing I also just find very interesting that I know his camp is wondering about is the expectations. For months, we have heard Donald Trump and his team painting Joe Biden as someone who can barely stand up for more than an hour, who has mental and physical problems. Now they're going into a debate, and it's a very low bar for Joe Biden to clear. So that's also some of the discussion that has been happening behind the scenes.",

He has worked for multiple presidential candidates, including John McCain, Mitt Romney, and George W. Bush.I'm curious what you think each of these candidates has to do, Joe Biden and Donald J. Trump. What do they have to accomplish in this debate? BRETT O'DONNELL, REPUBLICAN DEBATE COACH:  Well, both of them have to make this debate about the American people. It's very clear from the polling data that the American people are feeling like their lives are in chaos, whether it's their personal finances, the world, the border. All of those things seem out of control to them. And so both of them have to make the case that they would be the best one to bring their lives back some order, whether it's financial stability or order in the world, not about each other. But, for Joe Biden, he has to make this election a choice between him and Donald Trump. For Donald Trump, he's got to make this a referendum on Joe Biden and his policies. And I think those are the primary tasks. If they do that, they will stay focused on the American people, rather than each other.",

And there is an expectation that we're hearing from reporting that Trump may fire back by focusing on Hunter Biden's conviction.Do you think there are risks to Trump doing that? O'DONNELL:  I think there are risks for both of them. I think, if Biden were to attack Trump over his conviction, I think that risks taking the focus off of voters and putting it on the personal, which I don't think voters have a big appetite for right now. The polling data doesn't suggest that the conviction is doing Donald Trump much harm. So I'm not sure what benefit it would be for Biden to focus on that. The same thing is true for Donald Trump and the Hunter case. I'm not sure what advantage that gives President Trump, except to say, we both have legal troubles in our families. And I think that what that does is remove the focus of the debate from where voters really want it to be. That's on them and what these candidates are going to do to fix the problems in the country. For Biden, it's a much bigger risk, because he's got a record to defend, and the public right now don't think that record is very good. KEILAR:  Yes, I mean, I can totally see your point in that. I will say right now the legal problems are in Joe Biden's family, but, for Donald Trump, it is for him, although I think we would expect that Trump would expand it and try to cast aspersions on Biden, and we'd certainly see that. Brett, it's great to have you. Thank you so much for your insights. O'DONNELL:  You're very welcome. Great to be with you.",

Two different wildfires in the areas around this mountain village have burned more than 23,000 acres since Monday, but that rainfall is also causing another set of problems. That rain has fallen on the burn scar along the along these mountain ridges and canyons. And that has triggered flash flooding intensely in some areas, also mudslides and that sort of thing. So it's really becoming a treacherous situation in some places for these firefighting crews that are in this area trying to combat this fire. But the good news is, is that, as this local official mentioned, that the spread of the fire seems to have slowed down a bit. And, hopefully, those rains will continue to help extinguish these dramatic fires that have caused so much pain and devastation. Officials here have also announced the death of a second person. They have not identified the victim, but the person was found in their car presumably trying to escape from the wildfires. And the first person that was announced as a victim was 60-year-old Patrick Pearson. He was in the Swiss Inn Chalet, a hotel where he lived. But his family says he had recently broken his leg and was unable to drive. And his family is talking about how painful this moment is for them.",

But you can see that the bay has eaten the streets here, eaten the parking lot.Normally, this is a beautiful beach that people enjoy with their families. Well, that is not happening today. And what we have been doing actually is moving up and up and up to higher ground. We were live probably about maybe like half-a-mile here to my left. But you can see that all of that is underwater. We also saw the Texas A&amp;M Task Force 1 roll into this area. We have video of this. They rolled in. We talked to a few of the members. They told us that they were doing welfare checks. They were making sure that the people that live in this community were OK. I asked them if these were rescues or if they were evacuating people, and they said that these were just welfare checks, people who wanted to leave the area could leave the area. I have called the city of Corpus Christi to get more details. I'm waiting to get more information on that. But that just gives you a sense of the situation here in Corpus Christi, given the fact that we are hundreds of miles of where the thunderstorm or Tropical Depression Alberto now hit in Mexico. We're very far away from that area, and yet we're still seeing these effects. Now, we also have video of sun -- Surfside Beach here in Texas, because this scene is duplicated all along the Texas Gulf Coast. You can see those dramatic pictures. These are homes that are on pilings. They're designed for the water to roll underneath, just because these people are used to the water rising, especially during thunderstorms or other weather events. But, Brianna, that just gives you a sense of the situation here, even though this storm is hundreds of miles away from where we are, and yet we are still seeing water rising here -- Brianna, back to you.",
