And even in city streets, people are being taken away from buildings, going through water that is well above their waist.So Beijing is a city of more than 20 million people. It has impacted, as you mentioned, the airports. One airport, in particular, has dealt with some flooding. Train service has been impacted. Even some well- known landmarks in Beijing have dealt with this flooding. There is a venue from the Winter Olympics in 2022 that is dealing with damage. There's a brand-new shopping mall that has a big hole in front of it where the earth basically sank in because of all of this water. In addition, a new hotel is also dealing with damage. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has been speaking out about this, really talking about the need to get forces together to deal with these infrastructure issues, to get transportation back on track, and to make repairs as soon as possible. I should point out where I am right now, in Tokyo, if you go to the south to Okinawa here in Japan there is the threat of yet another typhoon -- another severe weather threat. Depending on how things transpire, Omar, it could be a problem not only here in Japan but, really, across Asia.",

About 1,000 U.S. troops stationed in Niger are being restricted to their military base this morning nearly a week after President Mohamed Bazoum was ousted. Coup leaders have now arrested six senior members of his party and accused France of planning to free Bazoum. France is getting ready to evacuate French and EU citizens from Niger, including its embassy staff. CNN senior editor for Africa Stephanie Busari is in Lagos, Nigeria for us. Stephanie, what's the latest here? STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SENIOR EDITOR, AFRICA:  So, Omar, as you say, we're hearing that the French is planning -- French embassy is planning to evacuate its citizens and staff from the country. They said is because of attacks on the embassy. A few days ago, the anti- French protests that we saw in the aftermath of this coup that happened last week and people just gathering outside saying \"Down with France.\" And the anti-French (audio gap) and they're responding swiftly to get their citizens out. And ECOWAS, the regional body, has said that it is going to -- it's threatening force if the -- if the coup leaders don't reinstate President Bazoum and his administration. This is the first time that the ECOWAS body has threatened this kind of force. There have been coups in this part of Africa, of course. Burkina Faso and Mali -- neighboring countries to Niger had coups recently. So people are wondering why this -- why this has happened now. Why has ECOWAS taken such a hard line? And -- but Niger is a very strategic country in this region. It's allies to the U.S. and the U.K. They both have military bases here -- there and they're helping to fight the Islamic extremism that we're seeing in this region. So Niger is a very, very strategic country and needs this -- needs to be aligned with the Western -- the allies in this region. So that is perhaps why the ECOWAS body has responded so swiftly. But Marli and Burkina Faso say if this happens it's a declaration of war, and nobody wants to see a war in this region, Omar.",

Because this bill was one of Israel's -- or is now one of Israel's so-called basic laws, which is the closest this country has to a constitution.What we do know for now is that the Supreme Court judges -- all 15 of them, as you say -- for the first time that this many judges have gathered -- all of them in one go -- all 15 of them to hear these petitions. We know that's going to begin on September the 12th. What we don't know is how long their deliberations will take and we don't know what the result of those deliberations will be. Now, we heard in the interview with Wolf Blitzer -- between Wolf Blitzer on CNN and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Netanyahu refused to commit to abide by a Supreme Court decision were it to strike down this bill. He was asked again on NBC yesterday. Again, he refused to commit to abiding by a Supreme Court decision that would strike down this bill. Because if the Supreme Court were to do so it would be the first time that it has struck down a so-called basic law -- one of these quasi-constitutional laws. So it's a very big deal and eyes will very much be on September the 12th. We don't know how long these deliberations will take but the result will have profound implications -- the protests for the government's judicial overhaul plans, and, of course, the balance of power between the government in Israel and the Supreme Court -- Omar.",

A Portugal goal this morning and the U.S. would have been out of the Women's World Cup, and they were inches away from that happening in the 91st minute. Portugal's Ana Capeta gets loose here and a strike right off the post, though. The U.S. had six shots on goal but they were unable to score in this one. And this was just the fifth time in 52 World Cup matches that the U.S. fails to score. But a 0-0 draw good enough to get second in the group and advance to that knockout round. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

All right, how about some baseball? The Orioles were up 4-2 against the Blue Jays. They had two runners on in the bottom of the ninth. Left fielder Austin Hays, though, a potentially game-saving catch. What a grab there robbing Whit Merrifield of a hit. The Orioles would hold on to beat the Blue Jays 4-2. Baltimore 65 and 41. They've got the best record in the American League on August first for the first time since 1997.

It's very true. However, this is not something that's going to leap you, what, 37 points or something behind like he is. Because it's buoyed by his inability to do retail politics. His inability to connect with people. We've seen time and time again where DeSantis also won't take comments from the press. It's obviously not why GOP voters don't like him but it shows that he's not being forthcoming when these voters do want to kick the tires about these various policy proposals.
