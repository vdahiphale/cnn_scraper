      "sentences": "Donald Trump expected to skip what is arguably his most important legal proceeding yet. The Supreme Court will hear argumentstomorrow on whether the former President can be removed from the ballot over his role in the January 6 insurrection. Plus, Nikki Haley often says both Donald Trump and Joe Biden are too old, saying that politicians over 75 should take mental competency tests. We'll discuss how she talks about aging. And is she risking alienating possible supporters? And in just a few hours, the Senate will vote on advancing the border security bill that includes Ukraine and Israel funding. President Biden warning that Republicans will pay a price in this election year if they vote against it. We're going to get a live report from Capitol Hill, just ahead. Good day, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching across the globe. It is 11 a.m. here in Washington, Wednesday, February 7. There are just 17 days until the South Carolina Republican primary, 271 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. The courtroom as a campaign stop, Donald Trump has perfected that. But, tomorrow, when the Supreme Court hears arguments over Colorado's decision to remove him from the Republican primary ballot, the former President won't be there. Justices are reviewing the landmark ruling from Colorado's High Court that says Trump should be disqualified from running for the White House again on constitutional grounds because of his role in the January 6 insurrection. A source close to Trump's legal team tells CNN this about the change in strategy. \"There is no upside to him attending these arguments. Trump understands how serious this is. The stakes could not be higher.\" All right. Let's welcome in our panel, including CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent, Paula Reid. We also have Washington Post Reporter Paul Kane, and Republican Strategist Doug Heye as well. Paula, this is incredibly high stakes. It's the Supreme Court. We know what our political team is reporting about the strategy here. What are the kind of unique circumstances about what we're going to find out yesterday that might impact the decision here from Donald Trump?",

The strategy fortomorrow is to what we've seen over the past few weeks and months with the civil cases and even the D.C. Circuit. They are clearly taking a much more traditional, more disciplined approach to tomorrow's oral argument, and you see that manifesting in several different ways. The first is, at this point, Trump is not expected to show up. A source telling me, look, he knows that this is serious. The stakes could not be higher, and there is really no upside to him turning up. Now, that is also a tacit admission that bringing the Trump campaign to the courtroom may not have yielded the benefits that they had hoped over the past few weeks in New York and D.C. We're also seeing, even if he won't be there, right, he is represented by a lawyer. And Jonathan Mitchell, he is a very experienced litigator before the Supreme Court.

I'm the victim of an unfair judicial system. We are the victim of an unfair judicial system.

We would be surprised if the justices even took it up. But, the strategy is really about delay. And it's interesting. Even though the Circuit took a month to give us the answer that we all expected, they tried to kind of pen them in, fence them in to not take too long with their appeal. So, they're saying, look, you have to go to the Supreme Court and tell them what you're going to do. They'll appeal by Monday. But, there were supposed to be an intermediary step. You have the opportunity to ask the full circuit to hear your case. Again, they don't think they're going to win, but that would stretch it out. So, I'm curious to see what they're going to do, how they're going to get around this. But, delay, delay, delay is the expectation.
