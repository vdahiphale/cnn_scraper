For the first time since 2008, an African leader has been welcomed to the White House on an official state visit. Kenya's President William Ruto is in the midst of a three-day trip to Washington as the two countries aimed to boost ties. The U.S. has designated Kenya as a major non-NATO ally, the first for a sub-Sahara African nation. Kenya has long been a counterterrorism partner for the U.S. It's set to lead a multinational security force, largely funded by the U.S., to help stabilize Haiti, which has been in turmoil since the assassination of their prime minister in 2021. The visit proving critical for U.S. president Joe Biden, who in 2022 declared he was all in on Africa and vowed to travel to the continent within the year. While that trip never materialized, Biden is using this state visit as an attempt to counter not just Russia, but China's influence in Africa as well. The two presidents held a joint press conference earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And what President Biden did today, he signed this vision, they're calling it the Nairobi-Washington vision that will sort of lay out plans for debt relief, for better, you know, leveraged debt through international organizations.

Turning now to the Supreme Court as we near the end of its term, we're getting some significant rulings from the bench, including one today with ramifications for November's election, voting rights, and potentially the balance of power in the House of Representatives. In a 6-3 ruling along ideological lines, the court's sided with a Republican drawn congressional district map in South Carolina, which civil rights groups say relied on racial gerrymandering and the lower court ruled counted to bleaching of African American voters. Justice Samuel Alito wrote the opinion, published as Alito himself is facing scrutiny from Democrats and others. \"The New York Times\" today reporting on another flag flown outside one of his homes, mirroring flags wielded by insurrections on January 6th.

And it will be this positive.And so this odious practice of sorting citizens built on racial generalizations and exploiting racial divisions will continue. Does she have argument there?

Russia's forces are getting closer. They want to get close enough to fir artillery and we were in the last 48 hours in a key town that frankly Ukraine has to hold and Putin urgently needs if he gets it, then his artillery can start firing on Kharkiv. Here's what we saw. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice-over): Some towns, they can never let Putin take. And this, Lyptsi is one of them. Destroyed artillery on the streets. Homes aflame from an airstrike. But they can only move at night. Lights off. It's a perilous grip they keep, but lose here, and Russian artillery will be in range of Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv. You can still smell the smoke here from an airstrike that landed just in the last hour or so. This is life under the drone.
