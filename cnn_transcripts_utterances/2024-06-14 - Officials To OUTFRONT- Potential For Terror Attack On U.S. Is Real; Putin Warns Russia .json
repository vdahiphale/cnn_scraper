This as CNN learns more about the eight men with links to ISIS who entered the United States through the southern border. Plus, an OUTFRONT exclusive tonight: on board a Russian warship off the coast of the U.S., capable of firing a hypersonic missile in more than 6,000 miles an hour. We're going to take you on that ship tonight. And new details tonight about Trump's VP search. His number one question: who's best on TV? Well, we'll also tell you who's reportedly playing hard to get to win over Trump. Let's go OUTFRONT. (MUSIC) And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we begin with the breaking news, a 911 wake-up call, a major terror warning coming into OUTFRONT tonight from multiple officials who have been on frontlines are protecting America. The new warnings prompted by the arrest of eight men in the United States with possible ties to ISIS. Former CIA Director Leon Panetta tells OUTFRONT tonight, quote, this is a real terrorist threat that must be taken seriously by law enforcement. The goal of ISIS is to attack the U.S. and they will recruit and train those who have conducted successful and failed attacks around the world. This is a 911 wake-up call. And the former director of national intelligence, James Clapper, tells us that these arrests of the people from Tajikistan are, quote, a stark reminder that the terrorist threat to this country hasn't gone away. We cannot take our eyes off this ball. And then there's the former secretary of homeland security, Michael Chertoff. He tells us tonight: Groups like ISIS and Al-Shabaab are growing membership and financial strength, even increasing territorial control. Our own homeland security depends on taking effective steps. Well, these warnings all coming into night, come after those eight men with ties to ISIS were arrested in major cities across the United States, specifically, Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia. All of them, every single one of the eight men, entered the United States through the southern border. And sources tell CNN that some of the men expressed extremist rhetoric on social media or in direct private communications. And we are learning tonight that the discovery of these men's extremist views set off a flurry of emergency actions by federal agencies. One major your concern for officials is that these men are all from Tajikistan. Now, why is that important? It is important because it was ISIS members from Tajikistan that attack that Moscow-area concert hall in March, 140 people, more than 140 people were killed. They're building burned and the worry tonight is, is that if they could do that in a country won by a paranoid former spy, a police state obsessed with terrorist threats and coup attempts, maybe they could do it here. It's a warning that the FBI Director Chris Wray issued just days before those eight men were apprehended in the United States. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We're talking about Zaporizhzhia region, Kherson region, Donetsk and Luhansk as well. He said he wanted Ukraine to basically denounce any ambitions or renounced any ambitions to join NATO, eventually. And, of course, he said he wanted Western sanctions on Russia to be -- to be lifted.

And it comes as the U.S. military in a rare move has announced its own fast-track nuclear-powered submarine is now nearby at Guantanamo Bay, arriving there our just morning. So, Patrick Oppmann is there, OUTFRONT, in Cuba and you're going to get to go on the destroyer now. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Several hundred Cubans wait in the boiling sun to tour a Russian warship. Russian diplomats told me the public would be allowed to visit the Admiral Gorshkov, one of the most modern warships in President Vladimir Putin's navy, capable of firing hypersonic missiles, the traveling more than 6,000 miles per hour. It's the first of three days the ship will receive visitors, a rare opportunity for people here to see he up up-close a frigate belonging to Cuba's cold war era comrades. We're going to get in line and see if we'll be able to get aboard. After nearly three hours waiting, having my Cuban resident ID card run through a database by police and passing through metal detectors, we're told to board the Gorshkov. Just next to us is the nuclear nuclear-powered submarine Kazan, the first of its kind, to come to port here. The visit of the four Russian ships, the largest Russian convoy in Cuba in years, is not a threat to the U.S., both Russian and Cuban officials say. But the U.S. is closely tracking these ships and their movements. A sign in English by the gang plank to the Gorshkov says the ships, quote, main purpose is combat operations against enemy surface ships and submarines. Although none of the vessels were currently carrying nuclear weapons, the Cuban armed forces ministry saying that. Hello, I say in rudimentary Russian to the sailors aboard the Gorshkov. We are only allowed on the main deck and Russian sailors watch our every move. A deck above us were sophisticated communications equipment is visible.  A soldier armed with an assault rifle keeps guard. These sailors could be fighting in the war in Ukraine and seemed to enjoy the peace and tranquility of the Caribbean. Sailors show me anti-rocket defense systems and a cannon they say can fire 23 kilometers, nearly 15 miles. After only the briefest of tours, we're told it's time for us to disembark. We say our goodbyes to our Russian hosts. As we leave, this Russian sailor count us one-by-one, to make sure no one stays behind to learn the secrets of a Russian warship stationed just 90 miles from the U.S. coast. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So this is sending a very powerful, not very subtle message, both to Cuba, about Vladimir Putin's intentions and as well, of course, to the most important intended audience here, the West, the United States, the Biden administration, about the fact that if the West can put lethal weapons on the doorstep of Vladimir Putin, well, he can do the same to them.",
