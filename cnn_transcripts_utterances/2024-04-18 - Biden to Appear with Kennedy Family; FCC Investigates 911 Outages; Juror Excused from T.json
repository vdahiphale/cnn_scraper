      "sentences": "A huge surprise. This is the most storied family in Democratic politics. But the intrigue really comes with the backdrop of the third party candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He's, obviously, a Kennedy family member himself, but his campaign has already been rejected by so many of his relatives who are alarmed at some of his more controversial views, but also fearful that he could syphon off votes from President Biden from Democrats who might see the Kennedy name on a ballot, tick the box without necessarily knowing some of his views. And in an election which will have the narrowest of margins, that could, in their own fears, tip the election to President Trump.And so what you'll see today, in Philadelphia, is 15 members of the Kennedy family joining with President Biden. He'll be introduced by Kerry Kennedy, who is RFK Jr.'s sister. And I've seen some of her remarks. She's really going to try and lay out the stakes of this election, Biden versus Trump. And she did preview a little bit of what she would say earlier this morning. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KERRY KENNEDY, SISTER OF ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR.: Well, I think, you know, when it comes to carrying on the legacies of John Kennedy, and Robert Kennedy, and Ted Kennedy, He's spent his whole life working on behalf of working people, of good workers. He marched with the UAW, and it helped to end that strike early. He's an extraordinary leader. So, I think there's no competition with him. We need to ensure that he's elected. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He'll be introduced their by another member of the clan, Joe Kennedy III, who is Biden's special envoy to northern Ireland. Afterwards, members of the Kennedy family will make phone calls, knock on doors on Biden's behalf.Now, President Biden has long espoused his love for the Kennedy family. He has said that RFK Sr. was a political inspiration to him. He has a bust of RFK Senior in the Oval Office. And the Kennedy family has telegraphed its support for a while. You'll remember, they all posed with Biden in the Rose Garden on St. Patrick's Day without RFK Jr. there to join them. So, certainly today, and attempts to demonstrate that RFK Jr. doesn't necessarily represent the Kennedys' political brand and certainly President Biden very eager for their endorsement.",

What they could do is, they could get text messages from 911 callers using cell phones. They could see hardline phones in houses calling, but they couldn't answer those calls. But because they captured the data, they were able to call them back on hard lines and say, did you call the police? So, they worked around it. But the question is, what happened to multiple 911 systems at the same time across the country? Now, one thing that we've learned this morning is that the same provider, the same technical company, provides 911 service for Las Vegas Metro and South Dakota. So, one logical question, were they doing a systems update overnight to correct some of the glitches from before? Did the system crash? It's exactly what we saw with AT&amp;T, you know, going back a couple of months where it was an internal thing. Or two, as we've seen the warnings from DHS, as we saw in Ed Lavandera's reporting yesterday about Russian hacking into a Texas water system, command and control of critical systems has been under attack by hostile foreign powers. Now that's a giant leap, and they have a lot of sorting out to do, going through logs, going through records within that system to figure out what occurred internally, whether that was generated by the system, generated from outside the system, or generated from outside the country.",

This oncology nurse, this woman, came into the courtroom today and told the judge that she wanted to be dismissed because she was feeling that she wasn't going to be fair and impartial as the judge, of course, has requested for this monumental trial.And in a discussion with Judge Juan Merchan, she basically told the court, the aspects of my identity have already been out there in the public. Yesterday alone I had friends, colleagues, and family push things to my phone questioning my identity as a juror. That coming from our colleagues inside the courtroom watching this happen in real time. And essentially because of that, the judge sort of reminded everyone that this needs to be an anonymous jury, that members of the media and elsewhere really cannot get into very detailed things about descriptions of these people because of this reason. And said basically that, you know, we probably lost a very good juror right there. So, again, this is - this - this is the hurdle, one of the hurdles that - that could happen and did happen when it comes to trying to seat a fair and impartial jury for a trial that involves a former president, like Donald Trump. Obviously, a lot of media attention around it. A lot concerns for the people that have, you know, been called into this jury pool as prospective jurors. It's what we have seen throughout this process. You know, we have reported on Monday and Tuesday, as these perspective jurors went into the courtroom, concerns from some of them, even from some of them who were picked and empaneled, you know, them looking down, biting their lip, feeling nervous about the fact that they are going to take on this trial as a jury member. So, here we are. Yes, we had seven as of just a few minutes ago, and now we are down to six. So, the task at hand today and into tomorrow and maybe even further than that is to find six more jurors now. Sara.",

But really to limit access beyond that.Now, if a judge is going to start doing that, holding some of these conversations perhaps in chambers or trying to bar the media, you're going to then run into very serious First Amendment rights. I'm sure we at CNN and other media organizations would object to that. So, it's a difficult spot for the judge.

And the judge has now made it clear that those details will not be discussed publicly. They will be redacted from any court transcript. And it's important, obviously, because these people are nervous about, in some cases, serving on this jury. So, she has been dismissed from this jury. We had seven as of just an hour ago, less than that, and now we are down to six jurors. Currently going on in court quickly, I would like you to know, that the prosecution has again brought up the fact that they believe Donald Trump has violated a gag order with a recent tweet where he quoted a Fox News anchor about the jury pool and weeding it out. I won't go into exactly what he said. But essentially, they're discussing whether or not he again violated the gag order several times and remind the viewers that on Tuesday there is going to be a hearing about whether or not Trump has violated that gag order in this trial, and whether or not he should be fined.

I'm reading from my colleague Lauren Delavi (ph).

So, that juror, number four, was supposed to be in court today by 9Now, it's unclear what's going to happen with this situation as that juror doesn't appear is in the courtroom just yet but has been summoned to the courtroom.

Now, to have two jurors seated who you might lose, or potentially might lose in the very first day after that, that is extraordinary.Now, here's what happened. This juror was seated. He went through the entire process. The judge said, I don't see any problems with his partiality. Both sides elected not to strike this juror, not to remove this juror, and hence he landed in the jury box. He was one of our what was seven and now as six, and who knows if that is going to reduce further. But he was in the box. He was going to be a juror on this case. Now, it sounds like the DA's office, the prosecution, went back and did more research on this juror, and it sounds like they're saying to the judge that either he was not fully forthcoming or he misled us, or he lied about something in his background. It also sounds like, according to Brynn's account, there was an arrest of this juror. An arrest does not necessarily alone bar someone from sitting on a jury. But certain types of convictions could. So, the judge needs to dig in on this and figure out, first of all, are those allegations correct? Did this juror mislead the court or give incomplete information? And, second of all, does that necessitate the judge to remove this juror from the jury pool? Now, I do want to say this, it is much easier legally to remove somebody from the pool at this point, before the jury has been sworn in.

Now, this juror was summoned to the court to be here at 9:15 to speak with the judge, and that person has not shown up yet. So, it's unclear what's going to happen next. The judges did offer to immediately strike this juror, take them off the panel, but it appears that the attorneys want this person to show up and have these questions actually happens. So, what's happening right now in the courtroom is those 96 jurors, prospective jurors who have been sworn in already, that they are coming into the courtroom.
