Of course Seamus Power, absolutely brilliant. He's from Waterford in Ireland. When you shoot a hole in one here you get some Waterford crystal. So he's very familiar with that.Nothing cuter than seeing all the kids running around. getting in the way of the golfers, their dads who are trying to play you know, kids in bunkers playing in there like in sandpit. Kids, that can barely stand high fiving the patrons, that was absolutely awesome. But the child's play is now over, as you say the serious business of this tournament gets going really, really soon. In just over three hours' time, Tiger Woods plays, the five time champion. We all know what he's been through. It was this time last year that he was trying to come back from that devastating car accident. He's hardly played since then. Is he going to be any good? We're about to find out. TIGER WOODS, 5-TIME MASTERS CHAMPION: I can hit a lot of shots. But the difficulty for me is going to be the lock and going forward. It is what it is. Whether I'm a threat to them or not, who knows? People probably didn't think I was a threat in 19 either, but it kind of turned out OK.",

This is a very hilly place and walking for him is the hardest thing. A lot of people are expecting that Scottie Scheffler is going to do it. He's the world's number one the defending champion.It will be historic if he could do it though only three guys have ever successfully defended their title here. And the last guy to do it Tiger Woods but Scottie Scheffler, a really, really hot pick here this week, guys.",
