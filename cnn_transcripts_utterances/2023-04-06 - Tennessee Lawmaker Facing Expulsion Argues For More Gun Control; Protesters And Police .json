He is there in Nashville just outside of this legislative session that's going on right now. Ryan, what have you been seeing and hearing from people? Because there were thousands of protesters gathered and now have pushed into the statehouse there.RYAN YOUNG, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Actually, they want to be in the statehouse because they want to be heard. A lot of people who showed up here, Sara, are teachers or parents who have kids in school. And they're concerned that nothing's being done to address the situation that's going on. Yes, what's happening with these lawmakers is top of mind for a lot of people. But the parents who were here feel stressed about the idea that they could have this legislative session happen without any long- term solutions to the problems they see affecting people in schools all across America. I actually talked to a woman who said she identifies as a Republican, and she understands why lawmakers might want to use this as an advantage to get rid of these three members. But she says even though she believes in the Second Amendment, what she wants to see is change when it comes to protecting kids in school. When you look on the inside here, you can hear the passion of the protesters who have shown up. They braved the rain. They've been standing out here for hours because they want their voices heard. They want something that happened and they believe lawmakers are using this other distraction with these three members to not really have a substantive conversation about what they want to see stepping forward. Sara, in the last half hour, since we last saw each other, a lot more state troopers have appeared from the bottom of the building and have surrounded the state capitol to add another sort of layer. And you can see some of the men in green who are here to sort of protect the outside. I can tell you there's been no pushing or shoving and no one has sort of got angry at each other. There's been no screaming in that sense, except for the protesters wanting their voices heard. There's even a band here that's been playing music because they said they want to drown out the lawmakers on the inside until their voices are heard and something has changed. So, you can just feel that passion as it reverberates through the state capitol area.",

We've also noticed as we've been watching this, as the speeches go on, these are about different issues, not the expulsion for right now. But we've been seeing that there are some protesters, some parents, some teachers, some students who have made their way into the chamber are sitting there with their signs so that they are not only going to be heard on the outside of the chamber but seen on the inside. Do you have any sense of how long this expulsion vote might take? I understand that the resolutions are one after the other, 63, 64, and 65.",

The news that has been breaking all morning, a tense faceoff between police and protesters there that is turned violent at times. We've seen smoke bombs, we've seen tear gas, we've seen a cafe set on fire briefly not to mention broken glass and all kinds of debris.This is the 11th straight day of protests in Paris as people there demonstrate against pension reform. The government of Emmanuel Macron wants to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. He's going to do it, it seems without parliamentary approval, and now we've had 11 straight days of these protests. And today, and really over the last few days, they have tended toward the violent with these direct confrontations between police and protesters. Let's go right to Melissa Bell, who is on the streets of Paris. Melissa, you were telling us that as nighttime approaches, these protests become even more tense or have a tendency to. What are you seeing as we're what, about an hour or two hours away from nighttime where you are? MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): That's right. It wouldn't be very long. In fact, the marches occasionally stopping but slowly getting to where it's intending to go, which is the Place du Tertre just up ahead. We've done the lion's share of the march so far. And it is up ahead again, John, there we're seeing again, the police, charging places where small fires have been started where protesters have had to try and light up barricades. And there's riots. Police really are trying to clear the area. Now, what we've seen over the course of the last couple of weeks, as the intensity of the violence at the head of these protests has increased is also a much more confrontational approach from the police. There are some 45 inquiries underway into allegations of police violence. And so, this crystallization of all that anger that you're seeing once again today, at the head of this march, really an expression on one hand of the difficulty that police are having in trying to keep these events calm in a way that remains constitutional and by which they abide by their standards of conduct. And that minority are very determined -- usually, far less protesters, determined to turn what had been fairly peaceful marches into a much angrier confrontation with the police. Really, their aim is that these things get so vital and the street -- country is so paralyzed by the strikes that the government be forced to the negotiating table. I have to say, John, even as they become more determined to see this movement through and carry on until the government backs down, we're hearing from the government a more and more determined sense that they intend to push this performed through whatever happens. It's a question of who's going to decide to call off the hostilities first. No sign of that. This Thursday afternoon as we head towards the Place du Tertre where once again, there are fires being lit. And as you see the last couple of weeks, paving stones being thrown and a lot of tear gas used by riot police as they try and clear the protesters away, John.",

And a security assessment is now underway by the Israeli military as officials there say at least 34 rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel. And in that video, you were seeing 25 of those were intercepted by the Iron Dome.You're also seeing there some of the damage on the ground from those rockets. This is a huge escalation in the region. And this also comes after days of tensions over Israeli police operations at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. CNN's Hadas Gold, back with us on the phone now from Israel. Hadas, what's the latest you're picking up from there? HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Yes, Kate, one of the reasons we're on the phone which is because we are getting on the road to get to the north to the scene of where these rockets fell. As you noted, 34 rockets were launched by somebody in southern Lebanon towards Northwest -- towards Northwest Israel. 25 of them were intercepted. But some of them as we are seeing did fall into populated areas. And we are seeing the damage caused to things like cars, as well as shops. We're seeing what seems to be windows completely blown out from certain shops and restaurants in northern Israel. So, still damaged. But luckily, only two people have been lightly injured by shrapnel, that according to Israeli emergency services. But still, there's a lot of questions, for example, who launched these rockets, where do they exactly come from, and who is ultimately responsible and who then will the Israeli military potentially target in response. We haven't seen a barrage of rockets like these since 2006 when there was a major war between Hezbollah and the Israeli military. Now, from experts that we've been speaking to in the last few hours, THESE are, you know, former generals, these are former security officials who say that neither Israel nor Hezbollah wants to see this escalate into something bigger. But it has the potential easily, you know, if one thing goes wrong, something happens. And then you can easily end up into a full-blown war. So, right now, we're waiting to see what will the full Israeli military response be. Who will they specifically target? And we haven't, as far as I understand, seen an official response from Hezbollah or claim of responsibility, specifically from any sort of militant groups, although the place where these rockets were launched from is from an area where there's a lot of Palestinian refugee camps. So, it's very possible Palestinian militants are behind this. But the Israeli military eyes nothing happens in southern Lebanon without Hezbollah's at least tacit approval. So, there'll be a big question of whether the Israeli military will target Hezbollah, in addition to whoever else they may target as a result of this barrage of rocket.",
