There was no grand prize winner in last night's $1 billion power jackpot -- however, nine players won at least $1 million apiece. Your next shot at the big bucks will be this Saturday. The jackpot, an estimated $1.23 billion, the fourth-largest in Powerball history.And the award goes to Caitlin Clark. Not a surprise. She's been named the 2024 Naismith Player of the Year. This is the second year in a row Clark has earned the honor. Last month, she became the NCAA's all-time scoring leader, breaking a previous record held by Pistol Pete. Clark and the Iowa Hawkeyes will take on UConn tomorrow night in the Final Four. All right, thieves in California making off with as much as $30 million in cash on Easter Sunday, one of the largest heists in the state's history. The L.A. Times now reporting that \"experienced crew\" broke through the roof of the facility that stores cash for businesses across all of Southern California. They got access to the vault without triggering the security system somehow. The LAPD and the FBI currently investigating this insane robbery -- Kate.",

A startling new report out from the American Cancer Society reporting a real threat that the world could see a major spike in cancer cases, and soon, finding that cancer diagnoses could rise 77 percent by 2050.

And two, as a society, we're growing.And this report shows that in the year 2022, there were about eight billion people around the world. That number is projected to rise to 9.7 billion by 2050. So as we have more people in the world and more older people because we're aging, we can expect to see more cancer. And this report found that lung cancer was really the leading cause of cancer death in 2022 and it causes the most cases as well. But when you look at data by country and by men versus women, you see interesting trends. Like, on this map here, here's the cancer incidence among men around the world. You see prostate cancer, in green, is very prevalent. There's also lung cancer in blue, which we see a lot of in European and Asian countries. And then when you look at cancer incidence among women around the world, breast cancer is the most prevalent. You see breast cancer there in pink. But we also see cervical cancer in orange, which is prevalent in African countries. And then, lung cancer, in blue, prevalent in Asian countries. So these trends are very, very important to follow. They show that cancer isn't just a public health concern here in the United States but all around the world. And it's estimated that about one in five people will develop cancer in a lifetime. So these are numbers that are important to follow, especially as we think about what the future could look like, Kate.",

Ten people, we've now learned, are reported to be dead and more than 1,000 people have been wounded. And dozens were rescued overnight, thankfully, including workers stranded in a quarry.

      "sentences": "Let me set you straight. Actually, we -- science can learn so much during these events. Most famously, Albert Einstein, in 1916, floated a theory that gravity is the result of time and space bending sort of like a fabric of the universe. Like a bowling ball on a trampoline. And you'd be able to prove this by planets or stars being in the wrong place. A different perspective changing. Three years later during a 1919 eclipse, they proved the theory of relativity.And these days, scientists are most obsessed with the corona. Not the Mexican beer or the virus but the corona is the atmosphere of the sun, which is 10 millions of degrees hotter than the actual surface of the sun. And one of the enduring mysteries is why as the sun gets hotter and cooler over these 11-year cycles -- why that maintains a consistent temperature? So they're going to fly these rockets -- WB-57 -- or, I'm sorry, not rockets, airplanes -- WB-57s -- high-flying airplanes. They got to 60,000 feet, twice as high as your flight to grandma's house. And they're going to take pictures of the corona and measure it -- and do this and fly in the path of the eclipse. It can stay up there for a lot longer and gather a lot more information. But then you also need an instrument that's between the airplanes and satellites to study the ionosphere. And that is the layer that protects us from the vacuum of deep space. It's these charge particles that protect us and contain Earth's livable habitat. And that fluctuates as the sun goes around the Earth rotates. It gets stronger during the day and then later at night. And now, with the eclipse, they can send these rockets up before, during, and after the eclipse to measure how those charge particles fluctuate. How they affect communication on Earth between radio transmissions and satellites. There's a bunch of citizen science going on with ham radio operators sort of sending pings and then recording how long it takes to hit a certain area and come back. And there are balloon experiments happening in Colorado. Satellite stuff everywhere. So much attention in the science world paid to what's happening. BERMAN:  It is incredibly cool. Chances that only come once a generation or so.",
