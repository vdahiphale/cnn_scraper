And following that, we heard from both Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu and the Defense Minister, Golan, both ruling out. And the wording was either a temporary ceasefire or a pause. And the wording, to a certain extent, is quite important in this because, you know, there is a humanitarian pause in diplomatic terms. Then that sort of escalates to a cessation of hostilities and then to a ceasefire. So, you know, Antony Blinken had come with the push for a pause that is being ruled out by the Israelis. And here's why. They say until they know the hostages will be released, they will not pause. They say that only through more military pressure will they get the release of these hostages. From the mediators and those familiar with the talks, what they need is a period of calm, they say, in order to get these talks over the line, which would then lead to, they say, they hope, success in releasing the hostages. Israel has also talked about all the hostages and as we understand it at present, the priority is still women and children and more fuel into Gaza, by the way, which the Israelis have also ruled out. So, I think what's going on at the moment, I think it's quite clear that there was an awful lot of diplomacy to be going on behind the scenes, but at present, there is no breakthrough in those negotiations -- because there is no breakthrough despite the U.S. pressure on Israel's part to say you know, until we know that these hostages are coming out, we will not reduce the pressure on Hamas. Let's see what happens. Anthony Blinken now on his way to Jordan or will be on his way to Jordan shortly and let's see what comes out of that. We know the Jordanians are going to push once again for an immediate ceasefire in these hostilities. Zain.",

This boy cries. We did nothing wrong. The living conditions in these shelters are unbearable but families come here for safety. That too is gone. Bring me my son. Bring me my son. This father screams. It's unclear if his child is dead or alive. Three straight days of airstrikes in Jabalia have brought horror and bloodshed. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the latest attacks. Israel says it is targeting Hamas infrastructure in this densely populated residential area and says it killed a senior Hamas commander with its strike on Tuesday. But with scores of civilians believed killed, the U.N. Human Rights Council warns what you see here are disproportionate attacks that could amount to a war crime. Gazans don't understand why the world can't stop this. We keep pulling out bodies, small children, women. It is a catastrophe, this man says. If the countries of the world had any shame, we wouldn't be in this situation. And more suffering is all but certain. Israeli troops are inching closer. And as ground forces, backed by near constant air raids, move towards central Gaza, the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians hang in the balance. The IDF has warned all residents in the north of the strip to leave, an order deemed inhumane and impossible by the United Nations. So many remain in the crossfire. Where's the world? This woman screams. Our children are being torn up before our eyes. And with the death toll mounting, pressure is growing on the U.S. and Israel to stem the violence. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, we are rapidly lowering down on our stocks, particularly of wheat flour in Gaza. The second issue is really water. Now, water in Gaza relies upon fuel. Now, with the fuel reserves that we have been able to access that were in Gaza, we've been able to keep desalination plants operating. We've been able to support the pumping of groundwater. A, that's not enough water to support the population. We've got to remember that in south of Gaza, the population has effectively doubled in the space of a week. So, there's not enough drinking water. And secondly, we are very concerned that the reserve that we've been accessing that sits within Gaza probably has 100,000 liters left in it. We are one or two days away from using that reserve. We need to ensure that fuel comes into Gaza -- water. The municipal services of Gaza, a pumping sewerage that are pumping water around Gaza rely upon fuel. So, really, we're focused right now on food and water.",

And this is what I suspected all along, is that, you know, the actions that organization has been undertaken against the Israelis is to more than anything else challenge the Israeli military operations against Hamas, not so much open another front to force the Israelis to allocate more resources to the northern front, which would in many ways help Hamas, you know, survive and conduct its own operations against the Israelis. So, look, if I were to rate this on a, let's just call it an escalation scale, this from one to 10, this is a five.

And so, a number of media outlets have come here to set up positions to watch the activity, the military activity that has been happening behind us in the Gaza Strip. And just moments ago, we actually had two rockets make impact very close to our positions. One of those landed in the courtyard of a kindergarten, which is right next to us. I want you to watch. But in particular, listen the video that was shot by my photojournalist, Matias Sohm, just moments ago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Wealso saw the crater that was formed by at least one of those rockets and several nearby vehicles had their windows blown out, shrapnel hitting some of those vehicles, as well. And so, this just kind of reminds you that Hamas has been obviously indiscriminately firing rockets against Israeli cities, not picking out particular military targets, but hitting -- but targeting civilian areas of these cities. The Iron Dome system, which Israel has to protect from these rockets, is very effective, but it is not 100 percent effective. And some rockets do indeed still make it through, and this incident moments ago was certainly a reminder of that very real reality.",

The next stage is to start taking care of ourselves physically and mentally. But for now, we're dealing with pure evil.
