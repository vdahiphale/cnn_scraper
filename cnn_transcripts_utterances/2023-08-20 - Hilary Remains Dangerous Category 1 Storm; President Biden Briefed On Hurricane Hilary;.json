So, continuing to show signs of weakening now down to 80 miles per hour and still a category one hurricane and that forward speed still at 21 miles an hour. So, it is going to start to likely make landfall here likely somewhere in the northern Baja California region in just the next few hours. And then cross into California as we head later on into this afternoon.But again, it's going to continue to weaken because it is still going to slide into some of those cooler waters. So, we do anticipate that we can sound to a tropical storm before it moves in to portions of California. High winds are going to be a concern. You've got high wind warnings all here in the red color, and then wind advisories where you see the orange shaded color. But the biggest concern, by far, is going to be the rainfall with this storm. You are already starting to see the moisture surge into California, Nevada and Arizona and other states. The heavier rain will start to push in by this afternoon and especially into the evening hours. We've already had two separate rainfall records broken already, one for Las Vegas, the other for Bishop, California. Those were for yesterday, but likely going to see more communities begin to have some record-breaking rain as we start to get those heavier bands pushing back in. Overall, widespread rainfall totals are likely 2 to 4 inches, but we are going to have some spots the pick up, six, eight even ten inches of rain before all of this finally pushes out on Monday. And so, here's a look at that time line. Again, by this afternoon, you're going to start to notice more of the yellows and the oranges on the radar, indicating that heavier rainfall. Then it's going to spread up into Nevada and other areas. By the time we get to late Monday, that's when you are finally going to start to see a lot of that moisture retreating from portions of southern California areas of Arizona and really starting to move into the northern states. Now, we will have a more tight breakdown of exactly what to expect with a lot of this rainfall, and any other concerns going forward going up in about 20 minutes.",

So, let me -- the challenge, as you note, is actually twofold.So, one is that the population is just simply not acclimated to this kind of rain, this kind of wind, and the kind of hurricanes that you would see in Atlanta or in the gulf coast. Populations can get used to climate disasters in the sense that they know what to do and they have provisions and they know how to listen to emergency managers, and they know what an evacuation is like. You simply don't have that in Los Angeles or the surrounding areas. The second challenge with these climate disasters that are, you know, so new is emergency responders cannot measure, have no history for what the impact will be. And so they were just, as we were reporting, prepositioning a lot of materials and assets that will help when the destruction comes, but because these are all such a historical events that we have no history, so to speak, to figure out okay, these areas are more likely to be damaged and these are not. So, it is -- as, you know, these climate disasters are common now, but they are so unique that we just cannot measure impact very well.",

I mean, that is honestly the most important thing in a disaster and I think that Los Angeles County and the state have been very aggressive and getting information out to residents, which is, we don't care what the number is one hit sure, because we are seeing that Hilary is losing some steam. The surge and impact is going to be like nothing that you have ever seen before.The easy thing here is that though Catalina, some islands like Catalina is being evacuated, all people need to do is stay put. That is all that you need to do if you can. And therefore, if you can't, for example, those without homes, trying to get them to shelters at the stage. So that's the most important thing is telling people what to do once we know what the damage will be like. On the prepositioning of assets, that is basically the city, the state, and the federal government being ready to essentially save people. I mean, this is -- this is your biggest challenge. People might be isolated, and they might be unable or there might be plenty and so they have to evacuate their homes. And that's just going to take a lot of communication in terms of where are those populations that need to be saved immediately versus those that are just inconvenienced that have to stay inside, maybe they get a little bit of water. That is going to be the challenge of sort of figuring out where we're going to deploy those resources. California obviously, Los Angeles for a variety of reasons, a very, very sophisticated emergency management offices. They know what to do. This is just a unique moment for them, and so they are dressed, they are getting ready and hopefully people will not let their guard down simply because Hilary is losing steam.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, the money, I'll be honest with you. The history of this is that the money always comes because the politics of the sort of demands the money. So I think that McConnell is right that FEMA will be replenished and we have to keep the pressure on.I think that the challenge as we head to hurricane season which has now been upgraded to a more violent season than originally thought is exhaustion, is populations just sort of -- as we saw with Maria, with first responders, and that by the third hurricane, people are just -- you know, resources are spent. But I, you know, study disasters as you know. This is not sustainable. In other words, whatever you think the reason is for these changes, climate change is I do, or you can forget the politics, you can call it whatever you want. This is not sustainable as a nation to have this many billion dollar disasters one after the other recurring, harming citizens and populations, and then just thinking that we can write a check and then we'll just get back to normal. We have to take a much more holistic view about how we're building, where we're building. Communities that we are putting at risk, because this is going to continue. This is going to continue to happen and our measure of success is going to be -- our things less bad as a standard and less bad by protecting populations in a world in which we are suffering these things. BLACKWELL: And I know that's certainly part of the conversation with the passing of the infrastructure legislation is where do you build, how do you build for communities to be more resilient, and to prevent some of what we've seen over the last month or so.

And now, there is a renewed and growing debate amongst legal scholars, both liberal and conservative, on whether Donald Trump may already be disqualified from holding office, even without a conviction. They are referring to a Civil War era provision, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, that reads in part: No person shall be a senator or representative in Congress or elector of president or vice president, who having previously taken an oath as an officer of the United States to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. Gloria Browne-Marshall is a constitutional professor -- law professor and she is joining us now. Good morning to you, Gloria. Thank you so much for joining us. So, we've heard this debate before. It's coming up again because you have two legal scholars who by the way are conservative legal scholars at the University of Pennsylvania law review who concluded that Trump is ineligible to serve as president again because of his attempts to overthrow the 2020 election. This is, obviously, unprecedented territory. How would it is provision even be enforced? That's a central question, right? GLORIA BROWNE-MARSHALL, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR: It is. And the sweep and the force of Section 3 is the law review article, but we also had the article in \"The Atlantic\", both of these articles speak to the issue of the provision. But as you said, the enforcement of it then as on the secretary of states, and these secretary of states across the country have to decide who's allowed to have their name, who's eligible to be on the ballot, and I think that's going to be an issue. But I think it's also one of concern regarding what is an insurrection, what is a rebellion, and how is that defined? Must one be convicted of being a participant in an insurrection or rebellion before you can apply this provision? So, that's another question.",

Once a challenge is made on the ballot, or he is prevented from being on the ballot and he brings a challenge. And then, that challenge then goes up to the U.S. Supreme Court. And the U.S. Supreme Court must decide. Of course, we have a super majority of conservatives on the U.S. Supreme Court, three of whom are directly related to Donald Trump's political choices, and the vetting of conservatives. So that's going to be a question by itself, and pretty dramatic as to whether or not there's going to be a Bush v. Gore type situation in which the Supreme Court is going to decide who's going to be president of the United States.",

And we have already heard Trump's lawyers, and, of course, some critics, you know, who are legal scholars, arguing that the events of January 6th did not even rise to the level of an insurrection.So who would determine that? BROWNE-MARSHALL: Well, that's one of the concerns because if he is not charged with participating in a rebellion or insurrection, then it's going to be up to something that Mitch McConnell is saying, each person to decide what constitutes a rebellion or an insurrection. And then, determining if he did participate, did he lead it, or was a participant in it? He still claims that all he did was say, let's go to the Capitol. You know, and that was the extent. We know there was much more to that because it was very much circumstantial, and some direct, but not direct enough, to clearly, I would think, charge him with that. But once again, as you pointed out, once he is charged, then there has to be conviction to determine that it was a rebellion or insurrection. When this was created, these, this 14th amendment back in 1868, it was very clear that these states had participated in a rebellion and instruction. It was the civil war. And since then, of course, Congress, and other conservatives within Congress during the time have debated whether or not that disabilities remain in place, or was there amnesty of some sort. That is in the law view article that's coming up from the University of Pennsylvania. But I do think that at this point, whether or not there is a challenge by Donald Trump for being left off of the ballot, or being put on, and being challenged by the people. In the end, it's going to the U.S. Supreme Court.",

What's noticeable about the MCC here is that it previously housed the likes of drug lord, Joaquin El Chapo Guzman, of course, Jeffrey Epstein and then eventually closed not long after his suicide. However in that letter that was submitted by the administration of Eric Adams earlier this month as part of this sort of legal back and forth because of the Right to Shelter Law, the city asked for permission not just the mcc, but also other federal facilities that are going unused to house asylum-seekers. However, there are still many, many obstacles before the city can even actually consider this as a viable option. I reached out to the Federal Bureau of Prisons. A spokesperson there couldn't confirm not deny that they're engaged in conversations with the city to open up this place as a shelter. However, did say that they have not established yet the long-term plans for the facility, that those have not yet been finalized. Then there's also the firestorm of criticism that we have heard from the migrant community because of the conditions inside this facility leading up to its closure a couple of years ago. Certainly many of these pro migrant groups would not like the city to use this space to accommodate asylum-seekers. And then the city still has to actually to move forward with this if they reach that juncture. We said to one city official who said -- I asked this individual if it's likely that the city would actually use the MCC to house asylum- seekers. Their answer -- no. However, they do want to keep all options on the table as the number of migrants who've arrived in New York City since last spring exceeds 100,000 -- Amara, Victor.",

He had already undergone physical therapy, occupational therapy, and despite the early improvements, he was stable. He wasn't improving anymore. DR. GUPTA: That's why Dr. Andre Machado, a neurosurgeon of the Cleveland Clinic, offered something to Stan that was a first to humans -- a deep brain stimulator. That's what you see there. Now, you may have heard of these for Parkinson's Disease but this was being placed specifically to help Stan recover from his stroke. Stan had weakness but was able to walk with his left leg.
