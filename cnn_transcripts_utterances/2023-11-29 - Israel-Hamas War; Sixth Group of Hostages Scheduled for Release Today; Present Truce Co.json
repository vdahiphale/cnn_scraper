Katie Bo Lillis, thank you so much for your reporting this morning.Kate. KATE BOLDUAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  And joining us now is CNN Global Affairs analyst Kim Dozier. It's good to see you, Kim. The Qatari foreign ministry, just this morning, said that they're hopeful that they're going to be able to announce a truce extension in just the coming couple of hours, is how they put it. But moving beyond the current parameters, of the current agreement between Israel and Hamas, really becomes a big question. How do they do that? How do they move past, you know, past only women and children being released and into civilian men and military personnel?",

      "sentences": "Well, at this point, according to Israel's prime minister spokesman, they have about 35 women left, at least four children under the age of 14, and then just under a dozen hostages who are over the age of 75. So, all of those are possibly covered under the current agreement.But the question is, once you get to what Hamas considers members of the Israeli Defense Forces, whether or not they were captured in uniform, they consider men of military age who are Israelis to be potential combatants. And the fear among U.S. officials, Israeli officials, Qataris is that Hamas will raise the price for releasing those. And that is when Israel, which is -- the current government is essentially looking for a reason to get back into its fight to defeat Hamas. That's when Israel would likely start fighting again and insist on negotiating under fire as it did for this first round of releases.",

Let me play for you, Kim, what the spokesman for the Qatari foreign ministry told -- said this morning, told Kaitlan Collins about what they're looking at in terms of the negotiation that goes beyond women and children. Listen how he talks about it. Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI SPOKESMAN FOR MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS: We are moving towards civilian men being released and then having the longer discussions over the soldiers. I think there is also a parallel line of discussion over thinking how we can reach a sustainable truce to have longer discussions over the release of all hostages. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There's another issue that might encourage Hamas, at least, to release some of the male hostages. It takes a lot of resources, manpower, supplies to keep hostages healthy, alive, undetected by the Israelis, so they may want to reduce their numbers. That might help get us to a few dozen hostages being held before fighting restarts. But there's pressure on the Israeli government because far right members of Netanyahu's cabinet have threatened to pull out if the fighting doesn't restart soon.",

That cancellation of this very important meeting, the climate crisis is such an important issue for him in the last 10 years since he was elected to be Pope.But he did attend his Wednesday audience. This is an audience he gives every single Wednesday in person. And he attended it this morning here in Rome, inside an auditorium. And he arrived on foot, which is actually rare. He usually comes in on a wheelchair. So, there was a little bit of defiance. But he was very, very weak. He wasn't able to actually deliver his prepared remarks because he said his voice was too weak from the flu that he's fighting. He isn't a man in good health. He's been in the hospital three times in the last two years, the latest was in June for an abdominal surgery, you know. So, we're talking about multiple different types of health issues. And you think about a man that age, 87 next month, of course people are worried about him. And I think this is especially important right now coming up to the busy, busy Christmas holiday schedule that he's got in front of him, that he's going in and not such good health, Sara.",

Remember that he has been in hospice himself for a very long time, but he has managed to make it to her funeral. We're looking at a live look inside their family church in Plains, Georgia where the service is set to begin in just mere minutes.Former First Lady, Rosalynn Carter, passed away on November 19th at the age of 96, just days after joining her husband in hospice care. Yesterday's memorial service in Atlanta drew every living First Lady and hundreds of other people mourning her loss and her incredible humanitarian legacy. Joining us now is Kate Andersen Brower who has written several books about the White House, including one on the role of first ladies. Can you tell us -- just give us some sense of who Rosalynn is? How she transformed what it meant to be a first lady? KATE ANDERSEN BROWER, AUTHOR, \"EXPLORING THE WHITE HOUSE\", AUTHOR, \"FIRST WOMEN\", AND AUTHOR, \"FIRST IN LINE\":  Well, she cared so deeply about helping people. She was very compassionate and empathetic. I think that came from her childhood with -- where she grew up with very little money. She had to raise her siblings, basically, after her father died when she was 12. I think there's one story about Rosalynn that really sums up her life's work because, you know, she -- yesterday, Kathy Cade at the funeral said she gave voice to the powerless and persuaded the powerful to listen. And she did that when the Carters hired a woman named Mary Prince, who had been a black woman, who had been unfairly convicted of murder in Georgia in 1970. And they saw that this was unfair and they brought Mary to be their daughter Amy's nanny in the White House. And they had the conviction overturned. Jimmy Carter was Mary's parole officer. I mean, they were not afraid to speak up for people who they felt were voiceless because of, you know, racism, because of poverty, whatever it was. They spoke out in support of them.",

And that was such a big and interesting case that they were heavily involved in getting her out because she was wrongfully convicted.I did want to just mention, we were watching just there, the motorcade that is rolling up to the church as you see her casket, Rosalynn's casket under guard there from the state police. Their daughter also read a letter that Jimmy wrote 75 years ago. I mean, this is really a true and deep love story between these two people, Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn. She had such an impact on Carter's presidency, but also on his post presidency, which has been one of the most remarkable post presidencies, I think, we have ever seen in American history. Can you give us some sense of how their relationship helped shape his time in office and afterwards?",

It was her idea to actually bring the president of Israel and the president of Egypt to Camp David for the historic peace accords there. She also campaigned tirelessly for him. But to your point, in the decades after they left the White House, what they did with the Carter Center is unprecedented. And, you know, they've nearly eradicated guinea worm disease, which used to kill many people in Africa.And she teared up. I interviewed her a couple of times, and when I asked her what one of her greatest accomplishments was, she said was making sure that children didn't have to die from that horrible disease anymore. [10:55:00] So, they lived -- you know, they practiced what they preached. And you see here in the church this was their heart, their home. People in that community would lay down their lives for the Carters. And, you know, the Carter's home is just a regular ranch style home. They can see their burial site from their home kitchen, which I think speaks a lot to who they are. They are at peace, I think, with death because of their deep Christian values that we saw play out, you know, especially after they left the White House and what they did was truly phenomenal.",
