As for motive, there's a key theory that is emerging. Law enforcement sources telling CNN Card recently broke up with his girlfriend, the bowling alley and Schemengees bar were two places they liked to frequent. His ex-girlfriend was apparently signed up to play in a tournament at the bar the same night as the shooting. HARLOW: We do have some of the names of the victims to share with you this morning. These are six of the victims' names who have been identified by family members: Bryan MacFarlane, Joseph Walker, Tricia Asselin, Tommy Conrad, Peyton Brewer, and Arthur \"Artie\" Strout.

This is where seven people were found dead of the 18 total.And this is where police say 40-year-old Robert Card first began shooting before, minutes later, making his way to the bar and grill. That said, the sun is getting ready to rise on what is now a second day with the main suspect in both of these mass shootings still on the loose. Lewiston mayor, along with emergency alerts we got on our phone, they're telling residents to shelter in place, to continue sheltering in place for a second day. When it comes to the search itself, they are expected to pick it back up in the Bowdoin area East of here, searching through some of his known addresses. It was outside of his last known address that many people, we were all paying attention to increased police activity there. They had a spotlight on the house. They were saying over the speakers to come up [SIC] with your hands up -- come out with your hands up. Well, state police say that is -- was essentially just standard search warrant procedure when executing a warrant, and they did not find him there. They did find a vehicle associated with the suspect elsewhere. And they found a gun inside, though unclear if that gun was the one used in these shootings. And that vehicle was found at a boat launch. And it's part of why you mentioned the -- the variety of sources that are helping search here. It's part of why the Coast Guard is assisting with the search by air and by water, just to make sure they've got all of their bases covered. And we're a long way from finalizing any motive, but the working theory, as sources have told our John Miller, is that the suspect recently broke up with his girlfriend, and that part of why these two places were targeted were places they used to frequent. But it's all part of an investigation that is happening at the same time as a critical manhunt and as residents continue to ask the question, when will this person be caught?",

The aircraft can get pretty high and still focus on an area.The suspect might not know that they're there. And then, he won't be able to take measures to conceal himself. There are ways you can beat that technology. And he probably knows them, being in the military. But if you get the plane up high enough, and he doesn't know it's there, they might be able to find them. That makes it so much easier for the officers.

CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: It really matters, Poppy, because what you're dealing with here is the need for the United States not to get involved in the situation between Hamas and Israel.

And as Jim and you have outlined, it's very clear that what we're trying to do here is maintain a presence in the Middle East and, of course, go after ISIS and other terrorist groups, but not get involved in anything related to Gaza, at least not directly. So that's really what we're dealing with is the -- an issue where the United States is trying to make it very clear to the Iranians that they should not be attacking U.S. forces in any way or in any -- any form.

And that really will matter in terms of, you know, force protection for the naval assets that we have there, for the air assets that are in that region.
