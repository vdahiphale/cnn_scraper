It is 11:00 p.m. now in Seoul, 09:00 a.m. here in New York. I'm Erica Hill in for Becky Anderson, this is \"Connect the World\". Ahead here as well, the Syrian army withdrawing from a key city as opposition forces enter Hama. Heavy damage and anger, meantime, where returning residents in Southern Lebanon are also looking to find some hope amid the fragile cease fire. And a massive manhunt continues in New York after CEO is brazenly shot dead. The stock market here in New York set to open about 30 minutes from now. The indices, as you can see, looking for a little direction after the DOW actually closed above 45,000 for the first time on record in the previous session. So, we'll keep an eye on those futures as well and on the markets again, set to open here in just under 30 minutes. Syria's rebels have entered the strategically important City of Hama, forging, forcing, rather, the army to redeploy outside, that is, according to a Syrian military statement. We have some new video as well that we can show to you an activist celebrating as rebels enters the city. Losing control of this strategic city of Hima would be a massive blow to the Syrian regime, opposition fighters recently, of course, we took Aleppo reigniting Syria's civil war. The main rebel commander was seen touring Aleppo's ancient citadel, a symbol of control over northern Syria. CNN's Ben Wedeman is closely following these developments, and of course, has reported on Syria for a number of years, and knows the situation there quite well in terms of the rebels now being in this city, which you and I have discussed for the last two days. What does this now change?",

And these are two cities on the main M5 highway that links Aleppo with Damascus, which means that it's going to be ever more difficult for the regime to launch a counter offensive to take Aleppo, let alone Hama. And also, Hama is really at the center of the country, and whoever controls Hama really has the ability to cut off Damascus, potentially, from the coast, the Mediterranean coast, where there is a Russian Air Base, a Russian naval base. And it's also, of course, the homeland of the Alawite minority which dominates the regime of Bashar Al Assad. And he, of course, is a member of that minority. In addition to that, Hama was the scene in 1982 of a massacre under the regime of his father, Hafez Al Assad, of anywhere According to Amnesty International, between 10 and 25,000 people during an uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood. So, for this city to fall, which hasn't fallen to, I mean, the regime has been in control of it since the beginning of the war in Syria in 2011 really represents a massive domino falling for the regime of Bashar Al Assad. We're not seeing the sort of strong Russian attempt to bolster his regime, along the lines of what we saw in September 2015 when the Russians massively intervened. This time, they're using their air force to bomb rebel targets. But it doesn't seem to be enough to blunt this offensive, which only began a Wednesday before last and it was only last Friday that the rebels took Aleppo. Here we are Thursday, the following Thursday. Now they're in control of Hamas. So, these are massive developments, and certainly a very bad sign for an embattled regime in Damascus, Erica.",

      "sentences": "So that is really the question, Erica, and I think that Ivan makes such an important point on whether or not thisimpeachment vote is going to happen, because the dynamic that we're looking at here, the National Assembly needs eight members of President Yoon Suk Yeol's party to sign off on impeachment before an impeachment proceeding can happen. And today we heard the leader of the Yoon Suk Yeol's party, who we just heard from in Ivan's piece, saying, you know what, the president should leave the party, but we're not going to vote for impeachment. So, if that happens, Erica, you can expect to see this weekend, throughout Seoul. Huge protests from all corners of the city, because there's public polling that's out saying that upwards of 70 percent of citizens across the country want impeachment to happen. There is still trauma that lingers, not so deeply underneath South Korean society. It's still fresh, not too far beneath the surface of how we all operate our daily lives, remembering what authoritarian rule was like in the 60s, 70s and 80s, right up until the end of 1987, 1988. So, impeachment not a sure thing as of yet. As for Yoon Suk Yeol it seems as though he's trying to do some cleanup and try to justify what happened. Erica, a couple minutes before we came on the air, we have a new statement from the presidential office, where his office says martial law was taken as a measure to regulate political activity. Now a measure to regulate political activity. I think the critics and most people across the country would say regulating political activity through martial law, that's what a dictator would do. At the end of the statement, it says all of these measures were taken within a legitimate framework. This is a president who is a former prosecutor. If impeachment does happen, expect him to be up for this fight. We haven't heard anything from him, Erica, since the one-minute statement that he gave as soon as he was rescinding his order of martial law. He did not apologize, but we're waiting to see what if anything he says to the country that is still wondering why he went down this path and what his exit strategy was, Erica.",

Another one is an old timer from the center of the political chess. His name is -- There could also be more to the left a former prime minister called Bernard Cazeneuve. But frankly, the real issue whoever President Macron decides to choose. The issue is how to govern, because what Michel Barnier showed with a lot of good will, frankly, is that both extremes have become very radicalized. It is true of the far right with Marine Le Pen, but it's certainly true of the far left. And in fact, both extremes would like to actually really shamble the whole calendar and to have an earlier presidential election. Our next presidential election is scheduled in 2.5 years' time, but both extremes would love to have even further political chaos, and they imagine that would compel Emmanuel Macron to resign.",

So, Macron's calculus was to try and shake up that didn't work. As a result, we now have a very fragmented and very fractious parliament, National Assembly, and that's what makes -- that's what made -- an impossible job to try and govern. And it will obviously be the same.

He also, of course, regularly attacked journalists with similar language. Jeff Bezos, his other company, Amazon, meantime, hit with a new lawsuit. The Attorney General of Washington, D.C. is now accusing the company of excluding two predominantly black neighborhoods from its fastest delivery option while still charging people for that option in their prime membership. The lawsuit alleges that Amazon actually made a secret internal decision to service two regions of the nation's capital with third party delivery services, and in doing so, was also misleading those customers with misleading advertising about the delivery speeds.

And along the way, deceiving 48,000 residents into paying for those fast delivery benefits that they actually were not receiving. The lawsuit says that Amazon decided two years ago to no longer send those Amazon branded vehicles that we've all kind of become accustomed to seeing into those neighborhoods, and instead, they relied on the postal service and UPS. And as you would imagine, this had a significant impact on delivery speeds. The lawsuit says that the percentage of packages that arrived in two days in those impacted zip codes was just 24 percent whereas the rest of D.C. was getting those prime packages delivered within two days, 75 percent of the time. And here's the kicker, the lawsuit says that when Amazon was confronted about this from customers, they were not forthcoming about it, saying that Amazon quote, concealed the exclusion and misled the consumers to believe it was a coincidence. Now the Attorney General of Washington D.C., wants Amazon to stop what they're describing as unfair and deceptive practices, to refund customers and to pay penalties, Erica.",
