Before we get to that, I want to show you the five men you will see in those videos.All were fired from the police force and on Thursday were indicted on numerous charges, including second degree murder and kidnapping. All of them have since bonded out of jail. The first arraignments are set for next month. Meanwhile, funeral services for the 29-year-old victim are being planned for next Wednesday at a local church. And as we are about to show you, some of Nichols ' final words were calling out to his mother as he was being beaten. Now she is pleading the loudest for nonviolence as the videos drive home the enormity of her son's tragic death. What you are about to see and hear is extremely difficult to watch. There are four clips we are going to show you, each taken from a different police camera. But together, showing the killing of an unarmed man and the police officers' disregard for him afterwards. Again, these images are graphic and they are disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There are emotions that are high. But they have been nothing less than peaceful. They have just stopped the traffic flow.

CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, tells us more about the possible injuries Nichols might have suffered.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it is just horrific to watch even as a trauma neurosurgeon myself. I've never seen anything quite like that. You don't -- you often see patients who are brought into the hospital but you don't see that, that sort of just horrific beating that he took over those several minutes. When you, when you look at this sort of thing, there's obviously so many different injuries that he could have sustained at the time. GUPTA (voice-over):  I think one of the areas that people probably paid a lot attention to was just all these blows he took to his head and to his face. He was restrained at one point, taking fists to the face and he was being kicked in the face when he was on the ground. What can happen sometimes is that the brain is the one organ in the body, that when it's starting to swell, it really has no place to go because it's encased by the skull. Every other organ in the body can swell a little bit more easily.",

I watched the videos alongside medical examiner's from around the country and that was the area that they really pointed to was these, these blows to the head.But it's also worth noting that he's a pretty skinny guy from we understand. And there were kicks to the body, to the torso, to the chest, as well. And any of those organs may have actually sustained damage and started bleeding as well, could have been suffering from internal bleeding at the time that all this was happening. GUPTA (voice-over):  And that brings us to the to the next point, which I think is critically important. When you look at sort of the timeline of what was happening there. It was around 8:33 or so 8:34 when you see this last kick that he sustained and then he was handcuffed and dragged over to the car. And then it's eight minutes later before we see EMS even arrive but it's not until around 9:02. So 20 minutes after that, 21 minutes after that almost half an hour in total before you see a gurney arrive. So you have a critically ill man who's lying on the sidewalk, sustained all these injuries, hard to say, the extent of the injuries or even how serious they are at that point. Obviously, they are serious but what exactly is the most serious is difficult to ascertain. And it's a full half an hour before he's really assessed. You hear at various times that it's going to take a while for the ambulance to get there. And that's, that's obviously very problematic.

There's been no claim of responsibility by any of the militant groups just yet.You've outlined the details of the shooting itself. It was at 8:15 pm, after evening prayers for the Jewish Sabbath had ended. The gunman pulled up in his car, got out, began shooting, got back in the car and then as people, approach he fired more shots. He drove about 300 meters away, was intercepted by police. They exchanged more fire and they pursued on foot and then shot him dead. In terms of the wounded, the situation there, a 15 -year old boy who is now recuperating, he is in moderate condition; a 24-year-old man in hospital, who's on a ventilator, he is in serious condition. A 60- year-old woman, whose condition is moderate also in hospital there as well. That is the current aftermath. We heard from Benjamin Netanyahu in the wake of this attack last night, sending out his condolences, saying some measures had already been taken but that the Israeli government would decide on what more measures, and would outline those measures, in a cabinet meeting, due to take place at the end of the Jewish Sabbath. That's in about 8.5 hours time. Netanyahu also implored Israelis not to take the law into their own hands, saying Israel has police and security forces and the army, which will act on the orders of the cabinet.

Islamic Jihad in the Gaza Strip, launching rockets into Israel; retaliatory airstrikes. Alongside the combination, we heard from secretary of state, Antony Blinken, we also heard from the U.S. urging de-escalation.

So that culture results in people using excessive force and not being held accountable like in this particular case.There is a sense that these officers must have not felt that they were going to be held accountable because they knew they were being videoed by camera. They have body worn cameras, there are speed (ph) cameras, undoubtedly felt that there was not going to be any accountability. So lack of accountability on the part of supervisors and command staff of holding officers accountable, that creates this atmosphere that you can do these kinds of things and get away with it. It's horrible. Rodney King was really, really bad. We don't have as many of those kinds of beatings but we still have beatings because now we have video cameras and cell phones that really show that. But notwithstanding that, there is a culture in a department that, if it condones beating, crossing the lines, officers pick up on that. And it's a generational thing that can occur within a department. So it's not an easy thing to break up. But it certainly does show that departments allow certain kinds of brutality to occur.",

But in its brief lifetime, there's already a history of tension between SCORPION officers and the community. Attorneys for Tyre Nichols' family say the unit goes around in unmarked cars and is sometimes unnecessarily aggressive. Family attorney Ben Crump relayed one account that a local man had also described to media outlets of his encounter with SCORPION. BEN CRUMP, NICHOLS' FAMILY ATTORNEY:  There's a brother who said four or five days before this happened to Tyre that same SCORPION unit confronted him while he was in his car going to get pizza and he said that they used all counter profanity against him. They threw him on the ground, talking about where the drugs and where the weapons. TODD (voice-over):  And Crump said the officers pointed a gun at the man's head. CNN has reached out to the Memphis police for response to that account. We haven't heard back.

Henri had to be evacuated from the airport by patient special forces. Government officials say that the protesters are angry at the spiraling violence taking place in Haiti. Gang violence has cost the lives of as many as 10 police just in the last week. And some of the protesters were actually police. Police say the government is not giving them the resources they need to fight the gangs, that are often better equipped than the police. And the police say that the government is setting them up for failure, that the gangs are simply more powerful than they are and that too many police are losing their lives. Haiti is facing an increasingly dire situation. As the different gangs swallow up more and more territory. In Haiti, the government is not able to combat them. The Haitian government has asked the United States and Canada to send forces to essentially quell the gang violence. Send armed forces to bring the gangs under control. But those countries, so far, have resisted that idea. And they've agreed to send aid to Haiti but so far, have not agreed to send forces because there is the fear that that would only fire up the violence. It would only create a more unstable situation. At this point, advisers to Ariel Henry say that he is safe. But they're not disclosing his location. He is essentially in a safe house at this point because it is too dangerous for him to announce where he is in his own country -- Patrick Oppmann, CNN, Havana. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
