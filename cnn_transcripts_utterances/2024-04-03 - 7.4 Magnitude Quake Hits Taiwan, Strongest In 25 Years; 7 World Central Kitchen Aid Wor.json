Taiwan experiences its strongest earthquake in a quarter century.Mourning the World Central Kitchen team killed in Gaza. President Biden says Israel isn't doing enough to protect aid workers and civilians. And retaliation, Ukraine responds to a deadly Russian strike with an attack on a Russian oil facility. And we are tracking breaking news out of Taiwan where a powerful earthquake has brought down buildings and killed now at least four people. Dozens of others are injured. The 7.4 magnitude quake struck about 8:00 a.m. local time. And we're hearing it was the strongest quake to hit the island in nearly 25 years. There are reports of people trapped in some of the dozens of buildings that have already collapsed. Taiwan's defense ministry has deployed troops to the disaster zone. The quake struck off the east side of the island and led to tsunami warnings and evacuations for not just Taiwan, but also people in parts of Japan and the Philippines. All of those warnings, thankfully, have since been lifted. CNN's Hanako Montgomery has been following all of this for us from Tokyo, and she joins us now. And Hanako, obviously, some terrifying moments there for so many as they woke up. Having said that, what more are you learning about the extent of the damage and also how first responders are getting to those who still remain trapped?",

So we know that this earthquake, the epicenter of this earthquake, was very close to Hualien County, which is on the eastern side of the island and where we're also seeing a lot of the damage take place. Now, Hualien County is known to be a very popular tourist destination. It's also a rural area and where most of Taiwan's earthquakes actually take place. And we also know, like you mentioned, that this is the biggest earthquake to hit Taiwan in at least 25. The last time was back in 1999 when an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.7 killed more than 2,400 people.Now Taiwanese authorities said this morning that the earthquake killed at least four people, has left at least 57 injured. This is a developing story, so we might have more updates in the coming hours. We also know that some roads have been partially destroyed. Homes and buildings have collapsed. Roofs have caved in. We're also seeing landslides take place. Really terrifying footage there as well. We also know that more than 91,000 households are without electricity and people are still stuck underneath these collapsed homes and buildings. So the Taiwanese defense ministry is dispatching military troops to assist local governments and try to get people out of these collapsed homes and buildings to try to get them to safer locations, safer places. Hualien County has suspended all school and work for today because we're seeing such powerful aftershocks and so many aftershocks after that first initial earthquake. The Taiwanese government has warned that we could see aftershocks for the next three to four days with magnitude ranging from 6.5 to seven. So still very, very powerful. And you know, Paula, living in Japan, a very seismically active country, I can tell you that these aftershocks are really, you know, something to be taken seriously. They're very terrifying. You never know when it's going to hit or when it's even going to stop. Now the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida today has also issued his condolences to Taiwan. He noted how Taiwan was very helpful to Japan when Japan experienced that very dreadful and devastating March 11, 2011 earthquake. He said that Japan is willing to assist Taiwan with any help that they might need in trying to get those people to safety, Paula.",

And I can tell you know, on January 1, when were reporting about theNoto earthquake in Japan, right, on New Year's Day, we still saw many aftershocks actually near the epicenter. And they were very terrifying for people. They actually brought down some homes and buildings. So we could still see a lot of damage in Taiwan caused by these aftershocks.

Hanako Montgomery will continue to follow this story for us. Really appreciate it.The deaths of seven aid workers in Gaza has sparked international outrage and brought an apology from Israel over what it's calling a grave mistake. The World Central Kitchen identified the seven killed in an Israeli airstrike Monday, saying, these heroes, you see them there, were just returning from a full day's mission. Most are foreign nationals. Now, a Palestinian team member killed in the strike was laid to rest Tuesday. The organization says it's now pausing its operations in Gaza and will assess its future there. U.S. President Joe Biden says he's outraged and heartbroken over the deaths of the aid workers and in a statement expressed his frustration, saying, quote, Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians. Israel has also not done enough to protect, pardon me, civilians. Israel's president apologized and says he has apologized, in fact, directly to the founder of World Central Kitchen for the tragic loss of his team members. The chief of staff of the Israeli military is also apologizing for the deadly strike. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GEN. HERZI HALEVI, CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: I want to be very clear. The strike was not carried out with the intention of harming WCK aid workers. It was a mistake that followed a misidentification at night during a war in very complex conditions. It shouldn't have happened. Israel is at a war with Hamas, not with the people of Gaza.

And as U.S.-China relations had hit rock bottom last year and as officials on both sides are trying to defuse some of those tensions, the two leaders said to have discussed a myriad of issues, including the wars that are ongoing in Gaza and in Ukraine, some issues that have strained historically the U.S.-Chinese relations, including the situation in Taiwan and provocations that we have seen recently from Beijing in the South China Sea. Also discussed areas of potential cooperation between the two countries, including countering narcotics and the issue of artificial intelligence. According to a readout that we received from the White House of the call, it said the two leaders welcomed ongoing efforts to maintain open channels of communication and responsibly manage the relationship through high level diplomacy and working level consultations in the weeks and months ahead. Now, you'll recall earlier this year that CNN had exclusively reported that when the two leaders saw each other last fall, Chinese President Xi had told President Biden that China had no intention of interfering in the 2024 U.S. election. But interestingly, a senior administration official telling reporters ahead of this phone call, I don't think we ever really take the Chinese at their word when they say they will or will not do something. It is about verifying. Now, the last time that President Biden and President Xi met in person in November, again, U.S.-China relations had pretty much hit rock bottom. And the coming out of that meeting, the two leaders had basically agreed that what they wanted to do going forward was to be able to pick up the phone and call each other more and try to avoid situations that could be dangerous in terms of misunderstandings that could take place between these two superpowers. So, certainly a significant phone call and a continuation of an attempt to rebuild and strengthen communication between these two countries. MJ Lee, CNN at the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The classmate and the boy has now been remanded in custody, but he will be questioned by social services rather than the police, given the age of the boy in question. It is not clear just yet what exactly the motive is behind this and the police are still trying to establish that. The Finnish prime minister who spoke publicly about this particular incident described it as being deeply shocking, and that the authorities are still working to determine the story behind this tragic event. But he also acknowledged that one incident is one incident too many even in a country like Finland, which it incredibly rarely sees incidents like this compared to other nations in the world such as the United States. Finland's last school attack or school shooting of this type came in 2008 where a student who was slightly older turned weapon -- turned a weapon on his other classmates.

And I will ask you what people in Massachusetts can expect.But before I do that, listen Miles, I want to try and tackle this from both ends, right? So let's speak first about those who really think this is a big deal, can't wait. Why are people so worked up about it? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AEROSPACE ANALYST: I got to tell you, Paula, up until 2017, I would have been similarly blase about it. I had seen an annular eclipse back in the early 90s, which means that the moon's orbit was such that it was a little farther away. And so you see that kind of ring of fire around it. But I saw the total eclipse in 2017 and I was kind of blown away by it. It surprised me how much it sort of took me, it struck me in an emotional way. Things get quiet, it gets cold (ph), sort of a silence. Theres an eerie kind of darkness and it's a reminder for me of a couple of things. First of all, it's amazing we can predict them down to the second, kind of a testament to how smart we are as humans, but also a reminder of what tiny little specks we are in the universe. So it's all at once humbling and also encouraging about humanity.",

You know, there are about 32 million people living underneath the so-called path of totality. That's about 170-kilometer- wide band. It extends from Mexico all the way into exiting out of the North American continent in Newfoundland. So people underneath that band don't have to do much except go to their backyard and take a look up with precautions, we'll tell you about that. But there are many, many more millions of people that are within a couple of hundred miles of that path of totality. So I suspect we're going to see quite a mass travel event on Monday as people attempt to see this.",

And already communities like the Canadian community in the Niagara region, calling for a state of emergency because they are in the path of totality and they expect quite a spectacular view, obviously, over at Niagara Falls.I want to ask you though as well about catching this on TV. I mean will people still be on the edge of their seats or their couches, or do you think you really have to step outside even if you're only getting a partial eclipse. O'BRIEN: I invite you to step outside. It's ok to do both. Watch it for a little while on TV. But as it gets to the point where you're reaching the maximum amount of eclipse wherever you may be, it's an opportunity to go outside and take this all in and remove the electronic filters, so to speak. There's an experience that occurs. But I will say this. A partial eclipse is ok; a total eclipse is a very moving experience. So if you can get to that path of totality get there. Do it.",

While the moon is partially obscuring the sun, looking at it is not a good idea. So you want to wear those mylar glasses or get a hold of some welder's glass number 14 or greater, or you can create kind of a pinhole camera kind of setup. But do not look at the sun with your naked eye until that moment of totality, at which time, take off the glasses and savor that beautiful corona around the edge of the sun. You know, it's a million times fainter than that the sun itself. And so we don't see it until we get this natural light show from nature.",
