If every person who is ahead right now went on to win, what are we looking at? We're looking at 222 for Republicans, 213 for Democrats. How are Democrats going to boost that number up by five? Well, let's take a look at the uncalled races at this particular point. And I actually want to take you to Arizona, to a seat right now where Democrats hold the advantage, because I think it sort of gives you an idea that these seats are still uncalled for a reason. Right now, I want you to look at this margin in Arizona's sixth congressional district. Kristen Engel up by. Get this. Do the math. It's 70 votes. It's 70 votes. When I was preparing this segment earlier on today she was trailing. She was trailing. So, it flipped. It flipped. These seats could still flip. Where are some seats that could flip? Well, let's go out to the great state of California. Go west, young man, go west. Let's take a look. We're going to go up to central California. We're going to go right here to the 13th district. Why is this important because right now what you see is the Republican ahead by a little less than three points? But look at the vote remaining in. It's or the vote only already in, it's only 48 percent. Only 48 percent of the vote is in. That means a majority of the vote is still out. And given that we haven't called this race and its less than three point margin, you could definitely see the Democrat overtaking here. Let's go down a little bit further. This is a seat that we always look at where there are a ton of late votes. Look at this only 52 percent of the vote has been counted there. That's another one. I'll go to one last one. We're going to go all the way up to Alaska right now. The Democratic incumbent is trailing. But this is a seat in which there's a lot of vote by mail left to be counted. It's also a seat where they have runoffs and instant runoff situation that goes on. So the bottom line is there are still some seats where Democrats could potentially take control of the House.

I hope he keeps his promise. Ryan Goodman is OUTFRONT. So, look, you've looked extensively at what Trump has said about pardoning the rioters.
