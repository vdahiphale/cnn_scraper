And we begin with a shakeup at the White House.President Biden's chief of staff, Ron Klain, is expected to step down in the coming weeks. His departure marks a rare moment of turnover for this administration at a time when the president is dealing with a classified documents saga and questions about his 2024 ambitions. Let's get right to CNN's Arlette Saenz. She joins us from Delaware where President Biden is spending the weekend. Arlette, what more do we know?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, this will mark a significant shift in the leadership at the White House as CNN has confirmed chief of staff Ron Klain is expected to step down from his post in the coming week. Sources saying that that is expected to happen after the State of the Union address which is currently set for February 7th, but that Klain would stay on for a bit of a transition period as they work towards his replacement.Now this comes as Klain has steered the ship at the White House since the beginning of Biden's presidency. Seen accomplishments such as steering the country and getting COVID-19 relief passed up on Capitol Hill. There was also that massive infrastructure bill, as well as historic investments when it comes to climate change initiatives. Of course there have also been a host of challenges facing this administration that Klain has overseen including the withdrawal from Afghanistan, some low approval ratings for President Biden, as well as the issues involving the economy and the inflation. But this comes as really there has been relatively low turnover in this White House. Klain is perhaps the most high-profile official so far who could be leaving in the coming weeks. Of course this is a very grueling job. Sources have said that he has talked for quite some time about the possibility of stepping down. It is very rare for a chief of staff to stay in this position for all four years. And pretty soon, the topics of conversation will start to shift on who -- to who exactly will be replacing him. Officials have quietly been speaking about this, and a few potential replacements on the table include Steve Ricchetti, who's served as a longtime adviser and counselor to the president. Also Jeffrey Zients who led the COVID-19 response at the White House before leaving within the last year. There is also Anita Dunn, another longtime adviser to the president. And then two Cabinet secretaries who could also be considered, that's Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, and also Marty Walsh, the Labor secretary. So much of the focus as the White House is preparing for Klain to possibly leave in the coming weeks will be focused on who exactly that replacement will be.",

Keith, this kind of turnover is not anything new when it comes to administrations. We've seen this happen time and again.

He's helped to steer through important legislation through Congress, got the COVID relief bill, the infrastructure bill, the Inflation Reduction Act, the prescription drugs reduction, you know, all these things are really important and wouldn't have happened without Ron Klain's leadership.He's someone I've admired and respected for some time. I worked with him back in the Clinton administration back in the '90s. So it's going to be hard to fill his shoes, I think, to be able to replace him. But having said that, you know, I think this is not unusual, as you said. It's not surprising to have a turnover at this point after two years. At this point in the Trump administration, I think they're already on their third chief of staff. So having one chief of staff last this long is pretty impressive. And I'm not sure who the replacement will be, but I'm hoping that it'd be someone who is not a white man, honestly, because every chief of staff in the history of this country has been a white man at the White House. And it's time I think for the other 70 percent of the population to be represented.

But, you know, they're heading into a likely campaign season, and when that happens, look, I can see why there's a change.I mean, who knows what Ron Klain would do on the outside. I'm sure he's going to stay in the Biden orbit and probably very involved with his re-election campaign. So there's going to be moving some people around I suspect. I'm not surprised, it probably makes sense if he is, in fact, going to run for re-election. But I suspect the move, it was largely due to the fact that this is a brutal job and he's done his two years. He has a lot that he can say that he accomplished, and that's why he's moving on.",

He did his rounds when he needed to, but he wasn't the most visible voice in the administration. I think that that's got to be a model I would think -- depending onthe personality of the person who follows up but I would think that would be a useful model for this administration, especially given the Republican-controlled House because I think they're going to self- destruct. I think it's the job of the White House to sort of let them self-destruct, you know, from a political point of view. Let them continue to be obstructionist. Let them investigate issues that aren't there. Let them make fools of themselves while the White House is busy doing people's work.

I suspect there are plenty of members who wanted seats on that committee, but then it looks like two of the -- two of the rebels were rewarded with seats on the plum committee like that.And of course, it's inexplicable to me how Marjorie Taylor Greene gets on the Homeland Security Committee. You know, I was one of the first members after 9/11, a couple of years after 9/11. We stood up the standard committee on homeland security. It was an honor to be on that committee. And, you know, we were dealing with the aftermath of 9/11. And it's almost unfathomable for me to think that somebody could be on that committee who questioned the fact that planes crashed into the Pentagon. I mean, this is -- you know, the world is upside down. But I have to think that that is a -- you know, it's a terrible look for the party. And there are other -- and there were three actually appointed by the speaker or who will be appointed to the Rules Committee. Three Freedom Caucus members. Again, I think that is going to make governing extraordinarily difficult for the speaker himself. I mean, it's almost a self-destructive act.

And certainly you need accountability. But I think there's a distinction between someone acting in a way that's civilly, civilly from a civil context, is potentially negligent, and then turning that to a criminal element which is entirely different. And so yes, someone's dead, and that needs to really be accounted for in some way. But to go after someone criminally when you're an actor -- look, an actor's role certainly is to perform, and it's to do and put on the best performance you can. But generally in any job, Jim, you operate as a team. And someone has the ability and should reasonably rely upon their counterparts to do what they do. Now you're going to compel actors to be looking and checking guns potentially that they have no knowledge about? And so yes, while someone is dead, and I think that civilly there should be and there have been lawsuits. To criminalize this I just don't think is the right call.

To see the image of a toddler wearing a diaper waving around a handgun, what goes through your mind? FRED GUTTENBERG, DAUGHTER KILLED IN PARKLAND SCHOOL SHOOTING &amp; AUTHOR: Two days ago, my friends, Kristen and Mike Song, celebrated their son Ethan's 20th birthday at a cemetery. Their son was killed within about a month of Jaime because he went to play at a friend's home with an unlocked gun. And what's on my mind is this. They have spent the years since tirelessly pushing politicians to just simply do something about irresponsible gun owners and the need to lock up guns. The gun safety group, Brady, has an End Family Fire program. They have worked tirelessly to encourage people across this country to safely lock up their guns. So what goes through my mind is how annoyed I am at the politicians, who when we talk about safely locking up guns to prevent this, call people like me a gun grabber, tell people like me I hate the Second Amendment.
