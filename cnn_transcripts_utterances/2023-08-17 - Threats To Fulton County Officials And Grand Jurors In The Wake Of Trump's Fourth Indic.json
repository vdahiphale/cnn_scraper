      "sentences": "Good evening, everyone. I'm Abby Phillip, and welcome to CNN PRIMETIME.There are doxxing threats against the grand jurors in Georgia and a death threat against a federal judge in the wake of Donald Trump's four criminal indictments. Meanwhile, he's now proposed a date for one of the multiple trials that he faces, this one, Jack Smith's federal election subversion case, and that is April 2026. Yes, that is more than two and a half years away. And it comes as he's negotiating his surrender over in Georgia on charges that he and 18 co defendants orchestrated a criminal enterprise to overturn Joe Biden's election victory. I'll talk to one Republican who says the RICO charge in Georgia is, quote, a nuclear bomb where a bullet would have been appropriate. And we've got much more on all of this to come. Plus, imagine that you're on a flight to Cancun. And just 27 minutes into your trip, you see this outside of your window, smoke and flames shooting out of the right engine. And tonight, I'll talk to two of the passengers who were on that flight. And a shocking mistrial in the case of a father and a son charged with the attempted murder and chasing of a black FedEx driver who was making deliveries in a Mississippi neighborhood. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) D'MONTERRIO GIBSON, FEDEX DRIVER WHO SAYS WHITE FATHER AND SON CHASED AND HOST AT HIM:  YOU there was a guy standing in the middle of the road holding a gun in my vehicle telling me to stop, which I did not do. They essentially just chased me out the city. And I had to file a police report after that. Shots were fired into my van as well. I feel it's my responsibility to speak up because my operator didn't survive to speak up for itself. So, I want to take that upon myself to do that for me and him as well. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, John, I want to start with you about this doxxing incident with the Fulton County grand jurors. It's not just on its own. It's part of what seems to be a pattern here. It's that there's also a Texas woman. She's being charged with threatening the federal judge in Washington, D.C. handling that election interference case. And now we're also learning that the Fulton County officials, they're working with the FBI on some of the threats that have been aimed after those grand jurors. How dangerous, from a law enforcement perspective, is this climate that we're in right now?",

You see people making threats on other chat rooms and message boards, generally.And I have a little experience in the threat assessment world from the NYPD, where we investigated a lot of these. The doxxers aren't breaking the law. They're getting publicly available information. And the threateners are usually not the people who carry out the threat. What Fulton County officials and the FBI are really on the alert for is that person who's reading through all that, who's not one of the people out front who's going to go do something. On the other hand, the prosecution of the woman from Texas who threatened a judge, she's being held without bail. Going after the people who are putting these threats out to grand jurors is all important because you've got to set those examples that you cannot instill fear and panic and concern in people's homes and family lives and not be accountable.",

And I think that's just terrible of any defendant to go through that process.I think the Republican Party will survive this. I think that we have a strong message when it comes to running against Joe Biden's record. And I think that other candidates are going to be able to step up and really assume that mantle. We have strong candidates. Vice President Pence did the right thing on January 6th. He has shown himself to be a man of integrity. President -- I'm sorry, Governor DeSantis has done the right thing when he was helping Florida get through this COVID pandemic and crisis.

BUCKproblem is Donald Trump is getting all of the press as a result of these indictments and other actions out there.

I mean, Christie will miss Trump because Trump is the great white whale to Christie's Captain Ahab. And his whole -- the premise of his candidacy is I'm the guy who's willing to say the emperor has no clothes. So, his strategy will have to change. He will still go after Trump, but it will have to change.For the others, look, I think part of the problem with Trump is he sucks out all the oxygen from the room even when he's not there. This whole race has been dominated by him. And what these other candidates have to do is they have to burnish a message that means something to people, and they have to burnish whatever their comparative advantage is to animate that message. And this is an opportunity to do it. But, Abby, when you're preparing for these debates, you have to recognize that most of the people won't be watching it. And so you also have to figure out how to land a moment, a moment that will become viral that is on your message. I mean, we've seen candidates in the past, Kamala Harris did this. She landed a great line. It caused a sensation, but there was no follow-up to it in 2020. I guess it was '19 then. So, those are the things that I'd be thinking about right now. What's my message? What is my comparative advantage? How do I come up with lines that will live and that will give people, people who don't watch the debate a sense of who I am? PHILLIP:  So, David Urban, in that very spirit, The New York Times had obtained this really fascinating internal memo that seemed to reveal debate advice from a pro-DeSantis super PAC. So, the memo said that he reportedly needs to, quote, take a sledgehammer to Vivek Ramaswamy, the political newcomer who's been rising in the polls. He should also, quote, defend Donald Trump when Christie inevitably attacks him. And he needs to attack Joe Biden and the media no less than three to five times. What do you make of --",

What happens is before trial, whether it be criminal or civil, civil involving money, criminal involving criminality, as this trial is, you turn everything over.And so, what the prosecutor does is they speak to their detectives, they speak to their police, they glean what information is available. Are there videotapes, are there statements, are there police reports, are there phone records, or is there surveillance? Whatever it is, you hand it over to the defense. Right? At the same time, the defense counsel has reciprocal discovery obligations. What that means in English is, hey, we have stuff, too. You give it to the prosecution. And the reason that's valuable, not only to ensure justice, right, because you have a better and a fairer trial when you have all the material, but it also helps to determine whether there's going to be a trial because if you get the information and it's so compelling against your client.

The question is, when will that be? In terms of how the evidence stacks up, listen, whenever you're chasing someone who apparently was in, he's a FedEx driver, he wasn't in a FedEx truck, wasn't marked that, apparently was marked Hertz, but why are you shooting at that person? Generally, when you shoot at someone, you're in immediate fear of death or serious injury. You have to respond proportionate to whatever threat they pose. So, what threat did he pose? And you have to act reasonably. And if those three elements are not met, it wasn't immediate threat, your force was disproportionate, you're shooting, right?
