So that's creating a sense of frustration and concern. As you mentioned, that heat continues to tick up. The latest numbers we have is that about 1.6 million customers are still without power along the southeast gulf coast and that also in Texas. And that also includes about one 1.3 million who used the utility company known as Center Point, which services the area around Houston. The company had said they'd hoped to get that down by a million by the end of the day today. It's not clear if that's going to happen. So state officials are offer -- continue to say that they're pushing these companies to work faster and offering empathy to millions of people along the southeast Texas coast. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV. DAN PATRICK (R-TX): When you don't have power, when it's pitch black at night, when it's hot as Hades during the day, you don't have access to food that you'd normally had, it's a miserable situation. And you need to know that we care about that. We're working on that. And there is hope to move through this as quickly as we can. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, that's the issue here.I mean, the heat index today, 105, and it's not going to change much tonight. Currently, right now, Houston has a heat index of 100 and that's only at the 1:00 advisory. So still more hours of this to go. It does cool down slightly, possibly, so maybe not 105 tomorrow in Houston but somewhere in the upper 90s. Back out to the west, significant heat again out there. Significant heat in the northeast, from the eastern part of Beryl and the spin from the old low pressure is now creating the threat of tornadoes and Upstate New York, Pennsylvania, and eventually even into New England later on today. We have tornado watch in effect until later on tonight. So yes, if you see a storm here, it could be spinning. And look at all these little pink boxes. Those are all tornado warnings going on right now. So if you're in Corning and places like Bath and Waverly, this is the area that, if you see a storm to your west, it's time to get out of the way, get away from the windows, get inside, maybe the lowest level you have. The heat does go away after this front goes by, but this could be a very dangerous day for the people of Upstate New York, Pennsylvania. And, of course, even into parts of northern New England -- Boris?",
