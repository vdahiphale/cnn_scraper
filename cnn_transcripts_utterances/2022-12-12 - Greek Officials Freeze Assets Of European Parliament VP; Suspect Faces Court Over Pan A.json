The question is half a percentage point, and that's certainty, in a sense, is what the market is looking for. The markets and the events of the day: Accusations of corruption at the very heart of the EU. There are four arrests, and that includes a member of the European Parliament. We will have some facts for you. The Lockerbie bombing suspect is due in a US Court, for the first time, 34 years, almost to the day after the horrific attack. And scientists make a giant leap towards the Holy Grail of clean energy. Tonight, we give you the gist of the matter and what it means. We are live in New York. It's Monday, December the 12th. Together again, I'm Richard Quest, and in New York as always, I mean business. Good evening. We begin tonight with the EU's credibility at stake as Belgium Police look into alleged corruption within the European Parliament. Greek officials have frozen the assets of Eva Kaili, one of the Parliament's Vice Presidents, and Belgium prosecutors say they suspect a Gulf country tried to buy influence over the Parliament's decisions. Now there are now several reports, which is naming Qatar, as the country involved. Qatar to be clear, Qatar specifically is denying the allegation. However, the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU must meet the highest standards. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So he has also said that he set the timer on this device. So, he has implicated himself as being directly involved. The catch on this is, he told this to a Libyan law enforcement official back in 2012. The FBI didn't get wind of it until 2017. The FBI didn't get to talk to that Libyan law enforcement official until 2020, and there is a question how did Mas'ud, as he is being called in FBI documents, how did he end up suddenly, one minute being in jail in Libya, and the next being about to be in a courtroom in Washington?",

He wanted access back to the international community, giving up two men, not the whole story was part of the way to do that. So I think it's been a very, very painful process for the families, and I indeed remember that night when the bomb went off on the plane, trying to scramble and get teams up there to cover it. It was a huge event at the time. I mean, a complete shock in the UK, right on the eve of Christmas, when we thought and you witnessed the pain and suffering for those families at Christmas, while waiting to welcome home loved ones for Christmas.

So, what we're talking about here is this process and not to get too scientific here, but it is this process of taking two hydrogen atoms and using these very powerful lasers, which we have the video while, that's the laser that they are using. This laser is shooting out its beam, multiple beams simultaneously on the same target and the pressure and the heat from that laser is what essentially creates this energy. This is done, as we said, using hydrogen atoms. So, what does that mean? It does clean. You don't have to worry about a carbon footprint, and that is why people are so excited here, because as you know, we've been talking about this climate crisis and this need to pivot away from those dirtier energy sources, this is an example of that. Hydrogen is limitless. So not only would this be a limitless source of energy, but it would be a completely clean source of energy. But you know, we should put this all in perspective, Richard. You know, one scientist said to me, we have an embryo now, but it's like, we're asking when will it graduate from Harvard?

And that is what they were able to do at this Department of Energy lab, and that is why everyone is so excited. Because before it was a concept, and it was science that they were trying to figure out how to do this. And as one researcher said to me, now we know this is actually viable.
