And even if it does, Speaker Mike Johnson has made very clear that this has zero pathway in the House. And so, what you have is Senate Republicans who are very reluctant to back this deal because they know former President Donald Trump is against it and they don't want to vote against it and have him bashing them. They also know it's going nowhere in the House anyway, and that has caused a ton of frustration inside the GOP. Just listen to Kevin Cramer, who is normally someone very closely aligned to Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.

John, it's always good to see you, and I have been honestly eager to talk to you about this because every time I think about the high crime and misdemeanor standard, you know, over time, especially in this instance, it has been questioned as to whether it meets it.

So, this is a very cynical ploy to simply blow up the deal to benefit Donald Trump who, of course, is stirring the pot here. He doesn't want a deal. He thinks it helps Biden.

I think Nikki Haley is already attacking Donald Trump over this. So, I think this is a mistake.But the bigger issue then becomes, what happens if there is a failure in Ukraine, if Putin prevails? Well, the Republicans own that just as Biden owned the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan. This is the problem that the GOP faces. It's a very cynical ploy. A lot of Republicans in both the House and the Senate want to fund Ukraine.

And so, this wing of the Republican Party that you're talking about, it's up to Republicans to get them out because they are dysfunctional and they are preventing any type of governing from happening.Democrats should go hard at some of these districts, particularly districts. Some of them are super red and will never flip. But the majority in the House is so slim that if Democrats play their cards right, they might be able to take the House back. Now, the Senate is a whole another thing. The map is a lot harder. But when you have people -- this is a split government. We have the Democrats having the White House and the Senate, but Republicans have to take some responsibility, and they are not trying to -- the overwhelming majority are not trying to find a solution. And the final thing I'll just say on this is Republicans often say Joe Biden is so radical. He's so to the left. Charlie just pointed out, this is a pretty conservative bill. It's not like that the progressive wing of the Democratic Party are running laps of victory, but he is realizing he only has so many levers right now he can pull because it is a split government.

What I don't like is the response that a congressman made, saying -- calling her husband a thug, saying that basically she was quiet, she wouldn't need so much security.That kind of language is inappropriate. It is not one that people who hold the title congressman should have, but also not something that a human being should be saying to another human being. I think that, you know, we need people in our elected offices who have a little more integrity with their words than that.",

Jean Carroll and her legal team led by Robbie Kaplan did a masterful job of being able to handle all that. They just didn't pay any attention to any of that. They just kept on pursuing their case. I think Tish James in New York, the New York A.G. has also done a great job of that, not paying any attention to the counterattacks and the clown show that shows up with a lot of these cases.And that's really a lot of the key to beating him, is you can't let him make it about something else. You need to focus on your facts, your law, argue the case in front of the court. Just keep pushing, don't give up, don't get distracted, and you see what the outcomes are that we're now getting.

This is the dean. The dean had reason to know and see that there was a photo, there was a gun on the photo, there was blood on the photo.Sir, you had an opportunity to stop this. You saw and noticed that photograph, didn't you? You have the ability to see that bag. You have the ability to rummage through that bag. This is the photo here. You sat on the stand. If you learned about a gun, it would have changed the equation. Did you ask that question? Should you have asked that question? Could you have asked that question? And so, on the one hand, it's the school deflecting blame and saying, hey, no. On the other hand, you're the school, you're the dean, and you should know. And these are going to be the arguments. And, you know, Laura, as we see the photo there with respect to the bullets and the house and everything else that we're looking at, this also cuts both ways. In terms of the, you know, the photo we were looking at just before with the bullets and the pictures, the reality is that we are a big Second Amendment country. People have a right to bear arms, not 15- year-olds. But the reality is that people hunt, people use weapons, et cetera. If you have something in your home which reflects bullet casings or the fact that you went to the shooting range and shot up different things, so what? The reality is people do that. Is that indicative of a person who is going to go to a school? And is it foreseeable that just because you shoot with your family as a hobby, you're going to do that? So, these are things that certainly are fair game to argue. The prosecution will argue it for its purposes. The defense will say it was our right to do that. And, you know what? She just had no idea that her son was capable of this, and that's what you're seeing.",

You used the term \"deflection\" in this instance. And we've seen a little bit behind the scenes as to whether or not she was on notice, that she could expect this behavior.Jennifer Crumbley's former boss testified, discussing these texts with her on the day of the shooting. Joey, here is what Crumbley said. Quote -- \"I need my job. Please don't judge me for what my son did.\" What do you think about that text making its way into evidence in terms of how the jury might see this?

To what extent if you have a gun that a child has, is it reasonably foreseeable that a child would do this? You can argue it is. To the issue of notice, were you not on notice of your son's maladies and did you do enough? You were. But did the school do enough? And then you get to the issues of the text that you just showed, that will cut both ways also.On the one hand, the jury could say, how selfish of you? You're thinking about your job and the reality is that your son just engaged in such carnage, that the school for precious lives of children are lost and you're worried about your job? Really? How dare you? On the other hand, people know and understand that self-preservation is important. People need jobs to survive, to live, to support themselves and should not be judged, right, by what their children do.
