The Conservative Party previously said that it had disciplined some of the people involved.Conservative cabinet minister Michael Gove was also asked about this video on \"Sky News\" today and said it was completely out of order and terrible, in his words. Now the gathering was organized by the campaign staff of London conservative mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey who previously apologized and resigned as the chair of a committee that he led at city hall. Oddly enough though, Bailey was just given a peerage this week, meaning he has a lifetime appointment to the House of Lords, the U.K.'s version of the Senate. The man who made that appointment is Boris Johnson. Now the video's release also comes just days after a parliamentary committee report found Johnson deliberately misled Parliament about his own separate lockdown parties. The report found that Johnson gave an unsustainable interpretation of the rules that he helped to write. For example, he insisted and continues to insist, in some cases, that the parties were essential for work purposes. Now, Parliament was scheduled to vote Monday on whether to accept the findings of the report which could have landed him a 90-day suspension. But since Johnson resigned as an MP in advance of the report's release calling it a witch hunt, they will now debate whether he should even get the customary former members' pass to enter Parliament at all.

But he himself was not starving nor were his senior leaders of that church in the forest. In fact, the way he put it is the children should starve, then the women, then the men and finally him as the man who he said was God's messenger on the issues of these end time prophesies.One striking detail and the hold that he had on his members, last week, more than 60 members of the cult who had been held in an undisclosed location in an area where they've been getting counseling are still refusing to eat. I spoke to a doctor at the main hospital there, who said many of those who were desperately ill and highly malnourished didn't want to be fed because they didn't want to miss out on their chance to arise to heaven.
