But it also comes in response to really outright attacks from the former president to the general, saying that he committed treasonous actions, suggesting that that would have been something punishable by death. It is bringing it kind of a partisan tilt to the military that really historically has not been there. The idea that the military is supposed to be beholden to whatever leader/party is in charge.

And as a result, he argues, that Google is able to collect an unprecedented level of data over its competitors, like Microsoft, that it will be use -- able to use to train its AI algorithms.

This is a big problem, by the way, with things like diet and weight loss pills.The problem is, the FTC is not fully equipped to be able to tackle every single AI-generated ad and image. Now the tech platforms have gotten pretty good if you think about Meta, Google, identifying when somebody is using AI to doctor a famous person. Where it's going to become more challenging, Phil, is when regular, everyday people, who upload their own photos to social media, have their own videos and photos be used to doctor AI.
