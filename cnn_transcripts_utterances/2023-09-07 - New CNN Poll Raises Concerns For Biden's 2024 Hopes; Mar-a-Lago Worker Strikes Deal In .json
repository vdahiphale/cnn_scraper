But he sounded pretty skeptical about the possibility of the district attorney's office getting what they want, which is to put all of these 19 defendants in the case, including Donald Trump on trial in October this year. He said, it seemed a bit unrealistic. You know, he raised the issue about Mark Meadows and other defendants who are trying to move their case to federal court. We also learned from the district attorney's office a better sense of what their case could look like. They said that it would take at least four months to lay out this case that's excluding jury selection, and it would include roughly 150 witnesses. So a sprawling case at trial to go along with what was this sprawling indictment.

Understood to be, in context or reference to Mr. Trump. So he doesn't appear to have had direct communication with Trump, but he does offer evidence of communications that would likely be admissible in court, as a statement of a co- conspirator of the president against him. And I think the fact that he's cooperating now really strengthens the special counsel's hand vis-a-vis Nauta and Oliveira. Because although it was clear from the superseding indictment that Mr. Taveras was providing information that was used in that superseding indictment, the fact that he's now entered into an agreement shows that he's working in a more cooperative, steady, consistent fashion with the special counsel. And the special counsel has agreed not to prosecute him if he continues to cooperate. So he's now more sort of solid witness for them, and he helps because of that increase the odds that perhaps one of the other two defendants named with Trump might themselves flip.

He's able to walk on his own, and he is right now at base camp, and that is still more than 3,000 feet from the surface. And it's a real logistical challenge to get him out of there. There are more than 150 rescuers and personnel from Turkey from its Emergency and Disaster Management Agency, AFAD, and rescuers from countries including the U.S., Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Croatia, and many others that are involved in this complex rescue effort. Mark Dickey, according to his own bio, is a very experienced caver. He's been caving in 20 U.S. states and 10 countries since the 90s. He's a rescuer himself and a rescue instructor and the chief of the New Jersey initial response team focusing on cave cliff and abandoned mine rescue. The Turkish Caving Federation says it takes 15 hours for an experienced caver to reach the surface in ideal conditions. And this cave has really narrow and winding passages, making it hard for them to get him out on a stretcher, and they're consulting with doctors on moving him out. They expect that this effort could take days. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Sara, truly astonishing video right there. It was a shock to many of us when we first saw it yesterday afternoon. Sara, since Cavalcante escaped the Chester County prison behind me last week, there have been two big questions. First, of course, where did he go? But second, how did he escape? And then yesterday we got that answer again and more than we expected.So let's go through this video that we've been playing for you all morning. This was released by local law enforcement. You can see Cavalcante has his arms pressed against one side of the wall, his legs against the other, and he crab walks right up to the roof. He then ran across that roof. He actually pushed through multiple layers of razor wire, and then ultimately escaped the prison. And Sara, you mentioned that tower guard. Well, law enforcement officials said yesterday the tower guard did not see or report the escape, which is why law enforcement officials say Cavalcante got about an hour head start on the run once he got out of that prison. Sara, there's also another important note here, though. This escape, law enforcement officials said, is actually very similar to another escape at this very prison that happened four months ago back in May. Well, prison officials said that after that escape, they put in security measures to prevent any future escapes, but clearly that did not work. So now to that second big question, where is Cavalcante at this time? Well, in short, police are still searching the area that they've been searching in this area of Chester County, has expanded even into parts of neighboring Delaware County. It's been challenging for a number of different reasons, certainly, the terrain. But listen, Sara, this manhunt is still ongoing and police are hoping that it gets to a peaceful outcome and that they don't have to use violence to take this inmate in. Sara?",
