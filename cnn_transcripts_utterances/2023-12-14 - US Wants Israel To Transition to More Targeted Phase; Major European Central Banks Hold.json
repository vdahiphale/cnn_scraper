Now, whether the Israelis are willing to abide by that, that is a different question because, of course, the US still says, look, this is their operation, this is their decision. So we are advising them to shift to a lower-intensity phase of this war, one that is more targeted, one that includes perhaps more focus on high-value targets instead of trying to root out the entirety of Hamas inside the Gaza Strip, which is extremely difficult and causing a number of thousands, in fact, of civilian casualties.",

Yoav Gallant, the defense minister, said it could take more than just a few months to wrap all this up.

The US is in this unique position of being Israel's closest partner and, as a result, it does have a certain amount of leverage on Israel.

And Knight Frank warns that people who get variable loans are still taking a risk. William Beardmore-Gray is a senior partner and group chair at Knight Frank Real Estate Group. He's with me now from Winchester in England. Good to see you, sir. A good example, classic example, I have a U.S. mortgage taken out 20 odd years ago, it's about 3 percent or something. I have a U.K. mortgage taken out roughly the same time and that's now back over 7 percent because of it. The need for rates to come down, to stimulate the housing market, would you agree? WILLIAM BEARDMORE-GRAY, SENIOR PARTNER AND GROUP CHAIR, KNIGHT FRANK REAL ESTATE GROUP: Well, as you said in the opening there, Richard, the fact is that what we now have is some certainty. And that is the fact that people are now looking for rates to come down rather than go up again. It will give people a confidence next year to get back in the market. As you said at the start, the five-year fixed mortgage just now below 4.5 percent. And that expectation that we are over the worst is definitely being felt by buyers and sellers.",
