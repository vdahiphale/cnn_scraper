Now, of course, we want to show you this video of that truck taking that turn down the road here. Of course, there was a car that was trying to block it.

We just heard moments ago from the FBI office here in Houston saying that about ten minutes ago they wrapped up the search of the property that they have been doing here since yesterday afternoon. It wasn't until late last night that they got the court order to be able to go inside the premises. So, overnight, investigators here in Houston have been searching the home believed to be connected to the suspect in the New Orleans attack. So, they have spent here hours and hours going through that. We have no information beyond that as to exactly what has been found here. The FBI statement this morning does say that there is no threat to the residents and the neighbors who live around the property that they have been searching. But this is an area where this has become a great deal of focus on the background of this suspect. In a YouTube video that the suspect posted back in 2020, he talked about being born and raised here in Texas, in the city of Beaumont, which is just in southeast Texas, along the Texas and Louisiana border. And also in court documents and public records that we have been able to comb through in the last 24 hours, we've learned a lot about essentially the life of financial struggles that this suspect had gone through. There is a - he was sued by the mother of two of his children for child support. And in those documents he talked about being in heavy debt, credit card debt, as well as businesses that had lost nearly $30,000 as well. So, financial struggles as he worked in - in IT and real estate here in the Houston area.

Now, the police vehicle being there is what's known as a blocker car, right? So, the blocker car would be there to block the street. But to have now this gap there, they're going to have to, you know, figure out like why was there a gap. Could they have put something else there? Maybe a temporary cement barrier perhaps that would just block off the sidewalk area itself, which is what we would do in New York.

Did this guy plant them himself before going back to the vehicle and planning - and executing this attack? Or did someone else, working with him, plant them around the French Quarter?Now, they'll be probably viewing a lot of videotape and trying to see who - and yesterday we had some erroneous reporting in the beginning that there were three men and a woman that were seen maybe planting those. They're trying to determine who planted those devices, because that's the connection to other people, I think. And the only thing they made public that could be a connection to other people right now. They may have more that they haven't released. But right now, the only thing we know about that could have been connected to other people are those other devices planted around. So, they're trying to determine - they're probably viewing videotape at the same time the FBI SOMEX, which is the Social Media Exploitation team, is looking at his online life and seeing if he connected with anybody. This kind of thing has to have planning. And planning is usually not in person anymore because people are so spread out.
