      "sentences": "Good morning, everyone. You're live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Alisyn Camerota in for Jim Acosta today.At any moment, the scientist who guided the government's response to the COVID pandemic faces a grilling on Capitol Hill. Dr. Anthony Fauci will be questioned again by lawmakers on that response and on the origin of the virus that has now killed nearly 1.2 million Americans. Fauci will also face questions about email exchanges involving one of his senior advisers. A subpoena from the Republican-led committee turned up those emails in which Dr. David Morens appeared to be trying to avoid public record laws. Let's talk about this. We have CNN's Lauren Fox for us on Capitol Hill, CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Jonathan Reiner also joins us, and so does CNN Medical Correspondent Meg Tirrell. Okay, great to see all of you. Lauren, hasn't Dr. Fauci already faced lots of congressional questions? How is today different?",

I mean, he has faced questions from lawmakers during a series of hearings back during the coronavirus pandemic, but this is the first time that lawmakers are going to hear from him since he retired back in 2022.Now, they met with him behind closed doors back in January, but this is public testimony, an opportunity for them to air some of their grievances with him before an audience and before, of course, the American public. Now, Democrats are arguing that this is just a rehashing of conspiracy theories, they say, that Republicans have been trying to put out there for years now. They argue that Dr. Fauci has done nothing wrong, that he did not lie about the origins of COVID, that he was not responsible for the origins of COVID. In fact, they released a new staff report this morning on Capitol Hill laying out a rebuttal of those Republican talking points. Here was Representative Jamie Raskin earlier this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  This investigation of Dr. Fauci shows that he is an honorable public servant committed to public health, and he is not a comic book super villain. He did not fund research to create the COVID-19 pandemic. He did not lie to Congress about gain of function research in Wuhan. And he did not organize a lab leak suppression campaign to cover his tracks. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Trump administration rejected that and pushed back, and so we ended up with six, but they could have rejected six if they had wanted to. I mean, all of this, you know, Meg, look, hindsight is 20/20. And in the middle of a pandemic, it's hard to know exactly what to do, but these are some of the things that they're going to be asking Dr. Fauci now to look in the rear view mirror about. We know that there will be some -- here's what we expect, okay, in terms of the questions, origins of COVID, the COVID era policies, like the six feet of distancing, as we're saying, and vaccine mandates travel restrictions.But in terms of what Dr Reiner was just talking about, what medical questions will we have answered today?",

There is a lot of cynicism about whether either the point of this hearing. It's, you know, purportedly this subcommittee exists to examine the origins of the pandemic and to better prepare for potential future threats. But there is, you know, a potential threat out there right now in terms of H5N1, bird flu.We are not hearing about that at all. Now, most people say that that threat right now is very low, but, you know, you think, you know, you have Dr. Fauci there. Would we hear any questions about that? And I'm not hearing from anyone that that is expected to be the topic today. So, we did see a Republican staff memo. Based on the transcripts of the interviews with Dr. Fauci behind closed doors back in January, two straight days of questioning of him, and they did say they're going to focus on COVID origins, COVID era policies and things like that. I think specifically, we're going to hear a lot of focus on the origins of the pandemic and grants given to a specific group, EcoHealth Alliance, and any oversight Dr. Fauci had of that, and that, as we were hearing from Lauren, is really the political football right now.",

KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTERBut this is a case that on the gun issue, it's been hotly contested. Hunter Biden has a very experienced set of trial lawyers representing him that they tried to cut a lot out of the prosecutor's case here. There is not going to be any politics that's going to be brought into the courtroom outside of jury selection and just asking the jurors if they know the Bidens, things like that. But as this case progresses forward in court, there are going to be a lot of active lawyers. We should expect that just because of what we know about this legal team.

      "sentences": "Well, we're watching the Israeli prime minister try every which way to reframe this latest Israeli proposal for a ceasefire and hostage deal after President Biden framed it on Friday very much as a way to end this war. And that's problematic for the Israeli prime minister with his right wing governing coalition.It's why we've seen Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, two far right ministers in Netanyahu's governing coalition, threatened to leave the government and force its collapse if Netanyahu follows through with this proposal laid out by the Netanyahu government. And the main reason is because they believe that it will lead to an end to the war without this quote, Absolute victory over Hamas, which the Israeli prime minister himself laid out as one of the main objectives of this war at the beginning. And so what we've been witnessing over the last few days is the Israeli prime minister insisting that he has not agreed to a permanent ceasefire as part of this proposal. And it is true that as part of this proposal in the first phase of the agreement, a six-week ceasefire, which could be extended for weeks and weeks and weeks, as long as these two parties are negotiating, they will be negotiating that permanent ceasefire. And so the Israeli prime minister is really trying to emphasize that he hasn't yet agreed to a permanent ceasefire. And the reason he's trying to do that is because he's looking for a way to avoid confronting a choice that he may soon have to make, and that is choosing between the survival of his government or choosing this hostage deal, which his own government has come up with and now presented to Hamas. And that is not a choice that the Israeli prime minister, of course, wants to make, particularly at this stage. So, ultimately, the question, though, is will Hamas force him to make that choice? Because, so far, we've heard Hamas say that they have, quote, positively responded to President Biden's speech, laying out the terms of this proposal on Friday, but we don't yet have an official response from Hamas. And their response, if they choose to agree to this, the ball will then be back in the Israeli prime minister's court and we will see what he chooses to do.",
