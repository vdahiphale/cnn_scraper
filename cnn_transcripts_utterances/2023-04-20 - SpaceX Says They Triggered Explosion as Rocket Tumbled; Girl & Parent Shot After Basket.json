And you saw the video there in the last moments of this flight, several - about three minutes or so into the flight the rocket ship was clearly tumbling. SpaceX says it was losing altitude and now the company is confirming that it initiated what is called the \"flight termination system\" onboard the booster part of the rocket as well as the rocket itself.And obviously this had to be done because it was spiraling out of control. They had clearly lost the ability to control the rocket system. And that becomes a much more dangerous situation. Also remember these rocket launches are done with the blessing of the Federal Aviation Administration that gives the clearance to open up the airspace for these kinds of launches. The FAA says it was - it is looking into and will oversee this mishap and that future flights will be determined and allowed based on ensuring public safety. So clearly, a great deal of work now has to be done to make sure that nothing goes horrifically wrong here in the future. And as you mentioned, the force in the power of this rocket was stunning to see in person who we're also hearing from people who lived about five to seven miles west of the launch site and the wind was blowing off the Gulf of Mexico inland and residents there were describing several minutes after the launch of the rocket that a wave of - it was \"raining sand\" for many people inland. That really speaks to the power of all of this, but for thousands of people who came here to South Padre Island to witness this historic moment in-person, it was a mourning they will never forget.

Fetterman is that there is a link between that stroke that he had and possibly with depression. We see that. Depression occurs after a stroke in one in three patients. So what we're seeing here is the possibility that the stroke may have caused the depression or deepened a depression that may have been there, because of the neurotransmitters, because of dying tissue in the brain from the stroke or also that there is a depression that comes in finding out that you are now on a road to recovery, but it is an extremely long road, Boris.",

In other words, a sort of a brain damage where the person has difficulties processing and producing speech.
