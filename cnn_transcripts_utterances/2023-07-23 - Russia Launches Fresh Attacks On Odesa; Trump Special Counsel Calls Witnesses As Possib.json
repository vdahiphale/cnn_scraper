More than 20 different architectural sites were damaged according to a local official including the Transfiguration Cathedral which sustained the most damage. One person was killed, a security guard at the house of scientists. This attack was very hard to defend against. Nineteen missiles, fivedifferent kinds and experts say and officials say that that is what makes it so difficult for the air defense systems to shoot those missiles down, the variety of missiles. Now, we have President Zelenskyy vowing retaliation and says that Russia will feel that retaliation. And, Victor and Amara, this comes as Ukraine is struggling to make progress on the battlefield during this counter offensive. We have recently spent time on the front line with the 42nd mechanized brigade which is leading the fight on the southern front. We saw some of the new equipment they just got from the west, including American Bradley fighting vehicles and we spoke to a number of soldiers and each one to a man emphasized how difficult this fight is.

Tral is a sapper who just got back from a mission. We need to break through the mine barriers he said so that equipment and infantry can pass. The enemy uses constant artillery and mortar fire. It's hard, he says, very hard. Everyone here, soldiers and generals alike, admit that over a month into Ukraine's counteroffensive, progress is slower than they would like. They argue that the Russians had months to dig in and prepare. But Ukraine was preparing as well. Soldiers like this team getting weeks of Western training and all kinds of new equipment. Like this American armored Bradley fighting vehicle, rarely shown to the press. The Bradley team leader named Kach is just 19. He shows us inside which is also used to carry troops across the battlefield. I feel very protected, he says. We know we're safe because it can withstand a lot and has a very thick layer of armor and has been tested in battles. Why do you wear the American flag? Kach is just four months out from American training in Germany. His U.S. flag patch, a parting gift for good luck from his U.S. trainer. The first day of fighting was the most difficult, he tells us. We didn't know what to expect, what could happen, how events would unfold. Early setbacks on this front had meant that Ukraine has had to change tactics, moving more on foot, after many of the newly required vehicles were damaged or destroyed. The team camps out in a narrow tree line, trying to hide from Russian drones. When their next order to assault will come, they don't know. But soon, they will be back in the fight. This is the life here, the team's gunner says. You live by the fact that you're preparing for the next mission. (END VIDEOTAPE) MARQUARDT (on camera): And, Victor and Amara, that team among many others will continue to have many more missions before this counter offensive is over. Ukraine officials do acknowledge they're behind schedule. They're not where they want to be right now but they do remain optimistic about the progress that they hope to make in the near future. President Zelenskyy has said this was delayed, this was supposed to be a spring offensive, but they didn't have enough equipment, enough ammunition and enough weaponry to go ahead with it so the offensive was delayed. And in that time, Zelenskyy says Russia was able to prepare, putting down defenses, laying those mine fields. But, Zelenskyy argued better not to Russia and try to save as many lives of Ukraine soldiers as possible -- guys.",

It is not been a secret on what happened or on the pressure. That is a public thing that happened and some statements are in the public record. The importance is that Kemp, as governor, would sign what is called a certificate of ascertainment certifying the election and getting the electors listed. So I'm sure that special counsel wants to know did he feel pressure from anybody, was there an effort to do this? Who did he hear might be moving a secondary slate of electors. That is the belt and suspenders around the case and whether or not the effort to overturn the election was just in Georgia, we know it is in other states.

How would some of the information that they're trying to get pertain to the three statutes that were mentioned in this target letter that Trump could be charged with. MOORE-- as one of the statutes that they talk about. And that is a provision that said that you have a right to vote. It is a guarantee protection by law and by the Constitution and the special counsel has been interested in that. He's been interested in false statements and destruction and as well as to failing to certify the election and pressure on various states. So, the statutes are there as a framework. Doesn't mean that he's wedding to every particular thing or that he has to give a case, but to give a punitive defendant notice of the things that he's facing so that that defendant could make a decision about appearing before the grand jury and to know that he's in some legal jeopardy or legal peril as the case goes on.",

That tells me that is a big case.On the Trump side, is said there is no possibility that this case gets tried before the election. Any time you have any case of a magnitude, you have something that's particularly complex, then you're going to find motions, you're going to find the need for a defendant to prepare for trial. Think about how long this investigation has been going on. So you're now having, if you the indictment comes down, you now have Trump or anybody else named in the indictment, saying, look, I also need time to prepare.

So trial dates are really just set to be moved unfortunately. There is an effort by the courts to keep things on track.But oftentimes they get moved because you need to have something in the record to shoot at.

That's a research firm who estimates that a 10-day UPS strike would cost the U.S. economy over $7 billion. One of the biggest sticking points in thi8s contract negotiation, which by the way, both sides have agreed to about 95 percent of the contract, one of the biggest sticking points is part-time workers. They make $16.20 as a starting wage and we've heard from leadership here that that is not a livable wage. That number used to go to above $20 to start. The average part-timer making $20. Meanwhile, full time workers making roughly $95,000 a year. Here is what else the general president of the union had to say about negotiations.

So we think he's in good shape barring something catastrophic. But it's far from over, thanks to the Spain's Jon Rahm, the two-time major champ had a round for the ages at Royal Liverpool yesterday, shooting an 8 under par 63 including seven birdies on the final nine holes setting the record for the course during the open. And still Rahm finds himself six strokes back of Brian Harman. The 36- year-old from Savannah, Georgia displaying incredible resilience after those bogeys that you mentioned. Two of the first four holes but he answered with four birdies the rest of the way on the way to a 2-under 69 and his putting was lights out. He's 12 under 5 shots clear of fellow American Cameron Young who carted a 5 under 66 on Saturday as well. What a major league debut for Brewers Rookie Sal Frelick. 6th inning, down one against the Braves. He's leaping and robbing extra bases from Marcel Ozuna. And look at his family, all smiles after this. This is the start of something really special. After his family is checking that out, two batters later, he does it again. In fact, it is even better, crashing into the wall at full speed here, taking one away from Orlando Arcia, flashing the leather a little bit, delivering at the plate as well (INAUDIBLE), Frelick hitting  a liner to right just deep enough for Willie Adames to beat the throw from Ronald Acuna driving in the go-ahead running (INAUDIBLE) after he had the game- tying hit in the 6th. So the Frelick family going absolutely wild as Sal goes a perfect 3 for 3 with two rbi and those two red gems as the Brew crew wins 4-3. Just remarkable.

So this ad depicts French men's stars like Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappe scoring all of these spectacular goals only to actually reveal who is truly responsible for these incredible highlights. So this is the first time we've seen a commercial like this where this deep fake A.I. technology has been used but it is actually the women on full display in this commercial. What that felt was so interesting and really thought provoking because Victor and Amara, you know, you're mind is kind of trained to think that this would be highlights from a male roster and oh, by the way, this really creative advertisement says uh-uh, these highlights are from the women team.
