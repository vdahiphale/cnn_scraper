      "sentences": "And we're back now with our breaking news coverage of former President Trump's criminal hush money trial. White House aide Madeleine Westerhout is on the stand now testifying to details of a White House meeting that she arranged between the president and Michael Cohen in the first few weeks of the Trump presidency.But the day started with the cross-examination of Stormy Daniels by the Trump team. The defense using Daniels's work in the adult film industry to try to discredit her. One exchange reading, quote, this is Necheles, Susan Necheles, Trump's attorney. You have a lot of experience of making phony stories about sex appear to be real. Daniels responds, wow, that's not how I would put it. The sex in the films is very much real, just like what happened to me in that room. She's referring to the room with Donald Trump. The sex is real, that's why it's pornography. And at another point, Necheles seemed to insinuate that Daniels wouldn't feel upset by seeing a near-naked Trump because she is a porn star. Necheles saying, You acted and had sex in over 200 porn movies. Daniels, 150. Necheles, Necheles, but according to you, seeing a man sitting on a bed in a t-shirt and boxer shorts was so upsetting that you got lightheaded, the blood left your hands and feet and you almost fainted. Joining me now is jury consultant Leslie Ellis. Leslie, we're monitoring this testimony right now from Madeleine Westerhout, but certainly we were monitoring this testimony earlier from Stormy Daniels, where the defense was trying to discredit her, trying to basically say she was a porn star extortionist, picking apart her past statements as well about this alleged sexual encounter. I wonder how different jurors might react to that. LESLIE ELLIS, JURY CONSULTANT: It's interesting because you -- in any group of 12 people, you're going to have people from all different backgrounds, opinions, experiences, and those all color and affect how people take in and weigh evidence and how much credibility they give it. So I think you're exactly right. There will be different reactions to that. I think, you know, a lot of people talk about whether men and women might see something differently. I think that's even too broad of a generalization. One thing we often see is that older women who might be from more quote-unquote traditional households might see evidence like that differently from young professional women. Again, a generalization, but that's sort of a differentiator that we sometimes see and how people react to evidence like that. We also see generally people do like to see -- jurors like to see participants in a trial treat each other with respect. They understand that there have got to be criticisms, but they prefer those criticisms to be relevant and substantive. They do like to see participants treat each other nicely and respectfully and civilly. So I think that could also, the tone of some of those questions, I think could have struck different jurors differently as well.",

Among these checks, no doubt, and I think we'll come to in later testimony, the checks that were sent to Michael Cohen as reimbursement allegedly in this hush money payment.So the jury, Leslie, was pretty engaged in watching the Stormy Daniels testimony. I guess, not surprising, it was pretty engaging, right? But less so according to our Jake Tapper who was there in the courtroom. When they were listening to testimony from the Trump Org employee who had sent those reimbursement checks that I was talking about there from Trump to Michael Cohen down to the White House to be signed by the then president.

He likes golfing, he's clearly going to keep using it. Which seems like he's paying attention.He's obviously getting these checks. Westerhout's testifying in terms of how that actually happens.

Did things change after he won the election?Yes, they did. Was it more chaotic? He said, to say the least. I mean, he was really trying to paint a portrait of pure chaos at some point. Now, I assume what we're going to start seeing in the cross- examination of Madeleine is the other side of that. Them asking her, what was it like at the White House at that time? The defense asking, was it chaotic in the White House? Was there a lot of people coming in and out? Was he sitting there signing these checks meticulously, or were there people in and out of the room? They're going to try to build all of what was happening around this as so chaotic that it would be impossible for him to be actually paying attention and knowing exactly what he was doing as he was trying to, one, learn how to be president, because as we know, the former president did not know or think at that point he was going to end up being the president back in 2016. And that was what they were really focused on. Now, of course, whether or not they can actually paint that picture remains to be seen, but that's what they're trying to do here, is to create a different reality than the one of Donald Trump having his hand in everything, meticulously going through line by line.",

When, of course, there was at least one meeting inside the Oval Office that I have a feeling they're going to really focus on.But right now, the fact is that this case, proving it beyond a reasonable doubt, a direct link between the defendant and falsifying business records in 2017, that will rest on the shoulders of Michael Cohen. Otherwise, there is no direct link. The only other direct link is Alan Weisselberg. He is in Rikers. He is not expected to testify. So all of this leads up to Michael Cohen. He is, without a doubt, the most complicated witness in this case and also the most consequential.",

After hours of heated testimony from adult film star Stormy Daniels, prosecutors are now questioning Madeleine Westerhout. Pardon me as I am looking to the ticker here to see what she is saying here.But as we understand, Westerhout just got upset on the stand. She teared up and cried on the stand when she talked about how she had lost her job. She had really been providing a lot of context about how checks were coming into the White House, how she was setting up meetings with President Trump and Michael Cohen not long after he began his presidency. But then she was asked about how she had lost her job in the White House after being very close to the president, even as a junior age, someone who was very much a gatekeeper. The judge, Juan Merchan, handing Westerhout a tissue. Let's talk about this now with our panel. Audie, this is --you know, this is reminiscent of the Hope Hicks testimony that we saw last week.",

And she was supposed to be at this off the record dinner with reporters. And she was talking about the president's family. But we see right there, President Trump forgave you. She said he did. So this was she was young. She was a young RNC staffer. I remember she worked in Trump Tower during the transition period, and she was really got to know the president at that point.

But it's easy to forget that witnesses are human beings and being in court is incredibly intense.And sitting in that quiet, silent room where you can literally hear a pin drop and every eye and these intimidating jurors and a defendant you used to work for are staring at you. You know, I've seen witnesses break down before, even answering almost mundane questions. It's a very intense moment. And I think to Jeff's point, you know, you hit on all of the main reasons for her testimony here. She's establishing that February 2017 meeting with Michael Cohen, which I'm certain we will hear about in the, you know, in the days to come. This idea of chain of custody of the checks, where they came in and where they went and the link to the Trump Organization. And also the former president's attention to detail, which is something that prosecutors are going to use to establish that it defies reason to suggest that he would not have been aware of what the checks were for. So even if she's not Michael Cohen or Stormy Daniels or one of these witnesses that that's incredibly high profile, she, she sort of links together a few important points. KEILAR: Here in cross examination Trump's lawyers asking about the Access Hollywood tape, which she'd been asked about in direct Madeleine Westerhout and notes there was consternation about it at the RNC.
