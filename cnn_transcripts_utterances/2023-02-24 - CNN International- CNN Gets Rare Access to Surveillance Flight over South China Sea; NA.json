And then tensions between China and the West continue to grow even after Beijing releases its plan to end the conflict. Plus, CNN speaks to witnesses of a deadly Israeli raid in Nablus this week that report just ahead.Well, it's been a year since Russian tanks rolled across Ukrainian borders triggering a war that killed thousands of civilian's force millions to flee and upended countless lives. Tensions are high and extra security measures are in place in cities and towns throughout Ukraine as the country braces for potential Russian attacks. World leaders, meanwhile, are expressing their solidarity with Kyiv. The Polish Prime Minister met with his counterpart in the capital city to mark the occasion.

Tank columns were heading towards this capital from the North. Russia had landed paratroopers at an airport nearby this capital. The idea was to take this capital and decapitate the leadership. But as you can see, President Zelenskyy and his army are still standing. And he paid tribute to those very soldiers who have been maintaining the resistance defending and creating counter offensives over this past year, and also to the civilians who have by and large all turned into overnight soldiers all resisting this invasion by Russia, which yes, it is its first full scale year, but it's been going on in the East since 2014.So this country has been suffering significant losses 15,000 before this war started, this current one, and now who knows tens of thousands of dead and wounded in support of this country. However, they remain, by and large, optimistic that with the support of their allies, who you just saw in vigils, and moments of remembrance, in Europe and other capitals. They remain optimistic here that with that continued support, their resistance will continue as well, Max.",

There have been enormous losses on both sides' incremental gains by the Russian side including today they claim and we can't verify it, but they claim that they have taken a suburb of Bakhmut, to the Northwest of the city. We spent yesterday in Vuhledar to the south where Russians had been trying to push forward. That would be a key launching off point for them to move deeper into Donbas. We know that the Russians are trying to mount their offensive they have been pushing forward in several areas, including Vuhledar and Bakhmut without much success. Of course, Max, the violence is not limited to those front lines. We have seen missile attacks, drone attacks all across the country, including here in the City of the Dnipro over the past few weeks. So the fighting does continue very actively along those fronts. The attacks do continue in cities and towns all across the country from the air. And then Max, in the coming weeks, we are expecting the Ukrainians to mount their own counter offensive to go on the attack to try to claw back territory from the Russians relatively soon, Max.",

Well, in the face of growing international pressure over its relationship with Moscow, China, is making new calls for a political settlement to the Ukraine conflict. Following a visit by Beijing's top diplomats to the Kremlin, China's Foreign Ministry has said it's willing to play a constructive role in helping resolve issues but provided no details.European leaders are urging a sense of caution. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who you heard from earlier, said China's proposal needs to be looked at in the context of its relationship with Russia, while Germany says Beijing should talk to both Moscow and Kyiv. Nic Robertson has been trying to make sense of all of this. Interesting here, what Fred was saying there about, you know where Russia goes from here, in terms of resources. I mean, there is talk about China providing military resources to Russia. We heard the head of NATO saying that there's intelligence to suggest that might happen.",

But they have to be on Ukraine's terms. And there's nothing about that in the language that the Chinese have used so far. And it's interesting what the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had to say today about the Chinese proposal, which was, you know, this is, OK, we see this, but it doesn't really have much on it. He said, look, China appears to be sort of putting a public face of neutrality, but actually they're not neutral in this. They're polite; they're giving non-lethal assistance to Russia. They're an important outlet for Russian goods, specifically, energy products. And they're the biggest country that's behind Russia at the moment, and there's the possibility that they may provide that lethal aid. So I think what we're seeing around the China 12 points is a healthy dose of skepticism, but saying, OK, if you've got something, let's move forward with it, but it's got to be achieving what both countries want.
