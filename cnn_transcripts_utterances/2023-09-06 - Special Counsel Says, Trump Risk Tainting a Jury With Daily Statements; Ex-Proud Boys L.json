In Tuesday's hearing, Kelly said former Proud Boys Chairman Enrique Tarrio was motivated by revolutionary zeal. What happened that day did not honor the founders. It was the kind of thing they wrote the Constitution to prevent, the judge said. Before being sentenced for seditious conspiracy and other charges, Tarrio apologized for the, quote, pain and suffering that was caused. Quote, I am not a political zealot. Inflicting harm or changing the outcome of the election was not my goal. Tarrio also adding, I held myself morally above others and this trial has shown me how wrong I was. Tarrio was not in D.C. on January 6th, having been arrested days before and ordered by a judge to leave the city for burning a D.C church's Black Lives Matter banner and bringing high capacity rifle magazines into the district the previous month. But the judge said even though Tarrio wasn't there, the Proud Boys leader, quote, had an outsized impact on the events of the day. During the months-long trial, prosecutors showed evidence that Tarrio was readying for a revolution and helped create a command structure within the Proud Boys in the run-up to the insurrection. Make no mistake, Tarrio told other Proud Boys on January 6th, we did this. During Tuesday's sentencing hearing, the prosecutor called Tarrio the leader of this conspiracy that targeted our entire system of government, Tarrio's attorney, promising an appeal. NAYIB HASSAN, ENRIQUE TARRIO'S LAWYER:  We respectfully disagree and we respect it. There will be a day and a time when an appeal will come and we expect it will come soon. (END VIDEOTAPE) MURRAY (on camera):  Now, Tarrio's attorney also said the sentence caught them off guard even though Tarrio now faces the longest sentence of any of these defendants we've seen. It's still well below what prosecutors asked for. They had asked the judge to put Tarrio behind bars for 33 years. Poppy?",

Americans are headed back to school, headed back to work after the summer, getting caught up on the news. Having the secretary of state in Ukraine sends a very clear signal that the Biden administration is still prioritizing this war. It's also at a moment when there's going to be this funding fight, again, in Congress with the president putting forth $24 billion in proposed new funding for this war to Congress. And there has been some criticism continued in Congress about new funding. And it also comes as the U.N. General Assembly is later this month in New York. And as you guys know, that's when world leaders from around the world are going to convene. And according to a senior State Department official, this is an opportunity for the secretary of state to meet with the Ukrainians ahead of that pivotal meeting in New York and to really align as to what their message is going to be. Now, when it comes to the counteroffensive, obviously, that has been a grinding, really troublesome, also with moments of breakthrough for the Ukrainians in recent weeks, in the south and the east. But the secretary of state, according to a senior State Department official, wants to be on the ground there to assess what the Ukrainians are actually seeing, what they are hearing, what their plans are in the coming weeks and months on the counteroffensive. And we should also note that he's expected to announce about $1 billion in new U.S. support for Ukraine, humanitarian support, economic support, military support, so all of these things, while he is on the ground there. He will be meeting with President Zelenskyy. As you guys said, that should be coming up soon. He'll also be headed to lay wreaths at a cemetery for fallen Ukrainian soldiers. And so there's a number of things that he's going to be doing there, meeting with U.S. diplomats who have been on the ground and really learning what those on the ground are seeing and what the future of this war could look like.",

The other thing that's striking is that Trump's support is under the rubric of I support his policies, which is something we've heard a lot.

And I think this was the error in Merrick Garland's initial approach. What did he always used to say? We're going to start at the bottom and work our way up.That was never going to work, because what we have here is multiple conspiracies separate from one another, but with a similar goal. In other words, Enrique Tarrio never conspired with Donald Trump. They never met, they never spoke. They never had any even indirect connection. Donald Trump was running his own conspiracy to try to steal its election, most of which happened before the actual date of January 6th. Then you have these other people clearly acting on his behalf, at his urging. He lit the spark who went in and stormed the Capitol. And that was sort of the way I viewed it from the start. I will say the way that it's been charged has played that out. And so when this judge says Enrique Tarrio was the ultimate leader, or whatever he says, I think that means of the Oath Keepers, of the people who physically stormed the Capitol. But Trump still absolutely was the spiritual leader.",

That's not the kind of evidence you're going to find anyway. I do think they want to get people out of this case for the logistical reasons that we discussed. You can't do all of these trials.
