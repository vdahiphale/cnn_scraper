The cold air is trying to push that warm air back down. That clash is the same.Now, the winter or the fall severe weather season is not nearly as strong as the spring season. But 18 tornadoes reported yesterday. And as the weather service goes out and finds out how big they are, some of the pictures that I saw live from storm chasers were easily EF3 in size. So, 150 or more miles per hour. Maybe not this one here in Sulphur Springs that you've alluded to. But this was the beginning of this storm as it moved to the North end and even across the Red River into Oklahoma. These were long live tornadoes. They were on the ground a very long time. And many of them were maybe quarter to a half a mile wide at the base. So, this is the damage we're seeing this morning. Obviously, the tornadoes down to the south, but there was golf ball size hail in Madison, Wisconsin yesterday from the same real system. Now, that threat of tornadoes has gone away. At least most of it has. Now, the threat is a wind threat. It's more of a squall line. It's the line that's going to push wind ahead of it, just moved through Jackson, Mississippi just now. Still moving through the parishes of Louisiana down here to the south. So, we still have the potential for damage because a 60 or 80 mile per hour wind gusts can do damage not like a tornado can but it can still affect your life. The chance of severe weather today, significantly less than yesterday, but there will be very heavy rainfall. And something else we have going on today. An awful lot of people are going to be outside as this is college football Saturday and there are some very big games in the way of some of these storms that will be coming on through later on this afternoon. Notice here, we're all the way into the afternoon and into tomorrow. Some of this weather even gets into the Northeast for tomorrow afternoon. Now, not a lot of severe weather here with this, but obviously the potential is there for it. Mild in the West. Still a lot of rainfall in the Pacific Northwest and they'll take it with all those wildfires out there. Boris.",

I don't think we're going to not win, keeping the House. So, I'm optimistic. I really am.(END VIDEO CLIP) WRIGHT: Now, those optimistic remarks from the President come as Republicans appear to be gaining some momentum heading into this last stretch, but President Biden has been trying to blunt that momentum from Republicans using really two different arguments. First, he says, that really warning Americans that democracy is under assault because of some Republicans and election deniers on the ballot. And then secondly, he's reframing the election as a choice between those two parties instead of a referendum on his party that controls Congress. Now, of course, he's basically making the argument that it may not be the best under us when it comes to the economy, but it would be worse under Republicans.

So, make no mistake, the momentum is still with Kathy Hochul. The sheer numbers really dictate that Democrats are going to do well. On the other hand, yes, it has gotten closer. And the issue that her opponent Lee Zeldin has really stressed over and over again, has been crime, and specifically crime in big cities, crime in New York City that has driven really his entire campaign. That is a warning to Democrats around the nation about what this issue can mean for them at the polls.Now, will she pull it pull it out? We'll find out on Tuesday.

One is more likely to get people excited. And that's really what the campaign has been.I mean, Kathy Hochul is right to a certain extent. The campaign on crime has been really more about panic than policy. It's been more about, hey, there's a problem here. And if you don't like what's going on, you have to change the leadership.

In fact, they were extended by an additional day which angered North Korea even more. North Korea has called these exercises a rehearsal for an invasion. So these exercises, called Operation Vigilant Storm, they started on Monday involving thousands of military personnel from the U.S. and South Korea and hundreds of aircraft. So, in response on Wednesday, North Korea fired the most missiles ever in a single day. Then they followed up with a suspected ICBM launch. Then, on Friday, South Korea went scrambling for fighter jets after they detected a large number of warplanes coming from North Korea. So, a lot of activity this week.

But I mean, the timing of all of this just happening a few days before election day here in the United States. We know how big a role misinformation has played in elections over these past few years in the U.S. Twitter had teams in place that didn't always necessarily do an amazing job. But they had teams in place to counter a lot of the election conspiracy theories that we have been hearing over the past few years, particularly, you know, on election day when we normally have seen videos of people saying this voting machine is malfunctioning or people not allowed to vote, et cetera. Often times, videos like that go viral on election day. But when they are later fact-checked after they have millions of views, they turn out to be false. I spoke to Jason Goldman, who is a former Twitter executive, he was actually on the founding -- he was on the team that founded Twitter way back. And here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And a lot of his free speech protestations aren't really about protecting free speech, it's really more about trying to put his thumb on the scale for a particular type of political preference that he and some of his cohorts have. And I think that's -- and I think that is dangerous. (END VIDEO CLIP) O'SULLIVAN:  So really just a lot of concern, a lot of questions of how this is all going to impact what is happening here in the U.S. in the weeks ahead, when undoubtedly, we are likely to see people push election conspiracy theories and how they might now be amplified on a platform that isn't -- doesn't have the guardrails in place than it had even this time last week.
