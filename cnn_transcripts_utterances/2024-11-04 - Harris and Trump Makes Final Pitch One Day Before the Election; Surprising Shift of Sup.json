U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are making their final campaign stops in the presidential election. That's while a new poll from Iowa shows a surprising shift of support from Trump to Harris. It's a state Trump has won twice before.And crowd throw eggs at King Felipe of Spain as he visits the area hit hard by deadly floods. Good to have you with us. A final push and a final pitch from both campaigns as we enter the final day before the U.S. presidential election. Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and her Republican rival, Donald Trump, have focused on key battleground states ahead of Tuesday's vote. And in the coming hours, they will both hold rallies in Pennsylvania. On Sunday, Harris and Trump fanned out hitting other key states like Michigan, Georgia, and North Carolina. Both are trying to reach undecided voters amid a tight race whose outcome remains very uncertain. But one poll out of Iowa suggests a shift toward Harris, in a state that had been considered solidly Republican. Among likely voters in the Des Moines Register/Mediacom Poll, Harris is at 47 percent and Trump is at 44 percent. Now, that is within the poll's margin of sampling error, meaning there is no clear leader. Already more than 75 million people have cast their ballots for president. That's thanks to early voting of course. And ahead of Election Day the vice president is looking to draw a sharp contrast between herself and Trump offering voters optimism and speaking about the power they have in their hands.

When I talked to a number of his allies, they were frustrated. They at one point, one of them said, how hard is it to get up there on stage and just say Kamala broke it, I'm going to fix it. They are eager for him to stay on message. They do believe that he can still pull off this race, that he can win the race. But in order to do so, he's got to stop talking or at least stay focused on things that these Republicans believe matter, particularly the economy, inflation, immigration and crime.

He claims the poll is heavily skewed and inaccurate, but pollster Anne Selzer says Trump's reaction is nothing new. She says the same methodology was used to conduct polls in both previous elections showing Trump could win Iowa. CNN's John King explains what the takeaways from this poll could mean.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Does that mean Kamala Harris is going to win Iowa? No, it doesn't mean that. And Ann would say that in a heartbeat. There's a margin of error. Sometimes you're pulling in a snapshot of time. So what was going on the news when you're polling, and would be the last one to say it means Harris is going to win, but she'd be the first one to say her data, which is good date says this is something, in a very competitive phrase in battleground Iowa, which was not competitive. That's what eight points back in 2020. Fifty-seven percent of independent women say they're for Harris to 29 percent for Donald Trump. So that's a big swing among women. Remember, this is the first presidential election post the Dobbs decision. This is the first presidential election after the last Iowa poll, which you mentioned was pretty close. Trump was ahead in the last Iowa poll, but that was narrow too. Since just before that poll, the Iowa six-week abortion ban kicked in so it is now been the law of the land if you were in the state for months. But is that having an impact in this race or something Trump has said in the last few days. I can tell you the last time -- I've been in Iowa three times this year. First -- mostly around the caucuses. Then I went back and visited our Trump voters right before the Democratic convention to see what they thought of Harris. Our focus then was on Trump voters, but while we were in the state, we ran into a lot of Democrats who said do not forget us. We are energized by the vice president's pick and this is going to be a lot closer than you think. Maybe they were right. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Why am I sure that Harris is going to win? Because it's only close on the polls. And my system ignores the polls, the horse race polls, doesn't listento pundits who have no scientific basis for their opinion. The polls are snapshots and the margin of error is much larger than the plus and minus three percent. That's pure statistical error. Add on to that, people don't respond to pollsters. They lie. They change their minds and they have to guess at who the likely voters are. That at least doubles the margin of error. The keys to the White House are different. They tap into how American presidential elections really work as votes up or down on the strength and performance of the White House party. And whether you want to say nine of 10 or 10 of 10, I've basically been right since I predicted Ronald Reagan's reelection in April 1982, nearly three years ahead of time when 60 percent of Americans said he was too old to run again and his approval ratings were historically low. That would not be the first time my predictions went against the polls. In 2016, when all the pollsters and pundits assured us, Hillary Clinton was going to win, I stuck with my prediction of Donald Trump, which did not make me very popular in 90 percent plus Democratic Washington, D.C., where I teach at American University.
