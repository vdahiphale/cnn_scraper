The judge rejecting his legal team's request to push the hearing until next week. Tonight, a defiant Trump sounding off.Plus, trench warfare. We're going to take you to the front lines to see how one Ukrainian soldier is risking his own life in order to bring comfort to the families of the fallen. It is a special report that you will see first here OUTFRONT. And the suspected Gilgo Beach serial killer is now refusing to provide his DNA to investigators. Why? The sheriff in the case will be OUTFRONT. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, rejection. Trump losing his effort to delay a court hearing in the January 6th case. The judge shutting down Trump's efforts to move the hearing to next week, saying that it will happen this Friday at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. Now, this puts Trump's team in a Florida court for a hearing in the Mar-a-Lago case Thursday, and then Friday in Washington for a January 6th hearing. And even though Trump himself doesn't have to be at these hearings, he is saying that his court calendar is blocking him from running his campaign for the White House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But, you know, you heard him use the expletive, right, bull. The crowd went on to chant it after Trump said that, to chant it again and again. And of course even as Trump is using these indictments to rile up these crowds, he's pumping his poll numbers. Legally, the reality is that winning the 2024 election could be his best bet to avoid prison time. The frontrunner in the Republican presidential field is currently facing 78 criminal charges in three separate criminal cases. And by the way, that's just those three, the possibility of a fourth indictment in Georgia is looming any day. And as Trump's indictments step by step move towards actual trials, the special counsel is not slowing down on more investigations, which involve Trump. Today, we know that the grand jury met for the first time since handing up that election indictment against Trump in the January 6th case. The fact that they're meeting, investigating raises questions about what they're looking at, in part, about the six alleged co-conspirators listed in that indictment that it don't appear to have been charged at this time. Perhaps they too could face federal charges. But it all comes as a defiant Trump lashed out at the special counsel for trying to limit what Trump can say about the 2020 January 6th case.

You know Jack Smith, hired him. How do you respond to these accusations? LANNY BREUER, FORMER HEAD OF DOJ CRIMINAL DIVISION; HIRED JACK SMITH: Erin, the president is just plain wrong. The truth is Jack Smith is a remarkable public servant. He has devoted decades of his life to fighting violent crime in New York, public corruption in New York, corrupt police officers, corrupt contractors and the like. He's been a war crimes prosecutor to help people who have faced the greatest devastation and held war criminals in Kosovo to account. And now, once again, he's doing the work of the finest public servants in this nation. Jack Smith is a man of tremendous integrity. He's someone you'd be proud to have as a friend, a brother, a son. It's outrageous to call him anything but what he really is, a man who has not cared about money, has time and again turned down making lots of money to serve the public year after year.",

And everything it sounds like from President Trump and his team is they don't want to be anywhere near the courtroom, they want to continue to demonize people, not talk about the facts, and label people so that the crowds that you were playing before just get more and more upset and aren't spending any time thinking about what are the real facts, what is the real law, and what should really happen in a courtroom.",

But the reality is that's sort of his permanent posture. And the challenge therefore is that he in, denigrating and in diminishing the institutions, it gins up his base. The concern that I have is that -- and I work with a lot of students, a lot of young people, and Democrats really need them in 2024, that have similar concerns about this nation's institutions. They're concerned about the lead errors on the right but also on the left in terms of their mendacity, are they telling us the truth? Are they real and going to support us? So while Donald Trump is doing this to, you know, motivate and mobilize his base, I think the burden on Democrats is to make sure -- and I think Joe Biden has done this as president -- is to make sure that our core constituencies, young people, African Americans in particular, are aware that it's these institutions that have been a source of political social and economic power, certainly seeing the proxy of that in Ohio with this vote on an issue like reproductive rights that is a mobilizing factor for so many Democrats.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Even saving the dead can be lethal work. It is dawn and freshly overrun Russian positions on the southern front where the assault is on trench networks spread out in the open. This is rare footage letting us see the point of view of a Ukrainian soldier and body collector. His unit tasked with bringing back the fallen, their own, but also Russian dead. This Ukrainian body seeming to have almost melted into the ground. The heat speeding up decay, another factor in this grim, grueling work where they are often guided to their targets by the smell from which the masks aren't protection enough.",

So, General, you just heard Ukrainian soldiers in that piece, from Nick Paton Walsh's reporting there, wondering why the Russians fire on them when they're recovering the remains of fallen soldiers, many of whom are Russian. They say that Russia knows this. Russians firing on them know that they are in there recovering the bodies of dead Russians. They choose to fire on them anyway. What do you make of that? LT. GENERAL BEN HODGES, FORMER COMMANDING GENERAL OF U.S. ARMY EUROPE: So, Erin, thank you. The U.S. Army also has what we call a graves registration team. And these are professional soldiers who are out there to help recover remains of our soldiers who have been killed in combat. This is an important part of how we do things. Soldiers know that if they fall on the battlefield, that there is a whole system that will bring them back. And this is the important part of the moral component of warfare. And what you just showed in this excellent report by Nick, how the Russians view their soldiers versus how Ukrainians treat their soldiers. I don't know if you could find a starker difference than what we just watched.",

He says there's no special need for them, and he points out that the United States has not sent those cruise missiles to Ukraine either. We've talked about them a lot, the ATACMS.

The United States has also failed to make the decision to provide this long-range capability to Ukrainian forces.Look, the key to success here is the liberation of Crimea. And the way that happens is by making Crimea untenable for Russian forces, where the Russians can't sit there and use the port of Sevastopol, which is inside the range of ATACMS missiles. So I don't understand how anybody, especially after watching the report you just showed, how anybody can say that there is no need to provide Ukraine with the ability to strike long-range with precision against Russian bases, against Russian artillery, against Russian headquarters. That's how you neutralize the only advantage that the Russians have. So, to say there's no need is terribly poor judgment. But this goes back to the administration's either failure or unwillingness to say we want Ukraine to win. When they say that, then all these excuses will fall away.",
