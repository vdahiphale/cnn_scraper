For their part, that committee says that Pence is misrepresenting the scope of their investigation. CNN's Sunlen Serfaty is live in Washington. She's following this. It's good to see you, Sunlen.

And he really details his own personal experience on January 6 at the Capitol, the anger he says, the sadness that he felt in the moment. He also talks about the lead-up to that day, the extent of the pressure campaign that Trump and Trump's allies put on him not to certify the results of the election.Now, all these details, the personal anecdotes in this book that he revealed at \"CNN TOWN HALL\" last night, certainly essential information for the January 6 committee who has been trying and negotiating with him to try to get him to testify. But the former vice president was pretty definitive last night when he said he doesn't believe that's going to happen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We've all -- we're also getting some new details about what happened that night though it almost complicates the picture even further. Two roommates were in the home at the time of the killings, but the police chief is not calling them witnesses. He did confirm though that they were not hurt. Authorities say those roommates are cooperating fully with the investigation.We're also learning new details today about the deadly shooting at the University of Virginia that killed three football players. The suspect bought two guns on two different occasions after being denied twice before. That's according to the gun store where the alleged shooter made the purchases. Yet, it's still not clear whether either of those weapons purchased were used in last weekend's shooting. The university is planning a community Memorial this weekend to honor the victims, Devin Chandler, Lavel Davis Jr., and D'Sean Perry. Joining me now is Michael Haggard. He's a family friend of D'Sean Perry. He's also an attorney representing the family. Michael, thank you for coming on. This is -- this is just horrible with you -- what these families are going through. How are D'Sean's parents and his family doing right now? MICHAEL HAGGARD, FRIENDS AND ATTORNEY FOR FAMILY OF D'SEAN PERRY: They're not doing well, you know. They're up in Charlottesville right now you know, a place where they dropped him off full of dreams. He truly was the American dream of what he had, where he's from, and what he made it to. And yesterday, they were cleaning out his apartment and cleaning out his football locker. And you know, just to think that they had dropped him off there a couple of years ago with every bit of hope in front of him and now for it to end this way is just brutal and they're trying to endure it the best they can.",

I want to play for everyone, I'm sure you've heard this though, Michael, what his high school football coach said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EARL SIMS, HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL COACH OF UVA VICTIM D'SEAN PERRY: He was like a son to me. He was a gentle giant who added value and purpose to my life as well as to others. He will truly be missed. But we'll make sure that his legacy lives on. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

You know, he came from a tough neighborhood, and his parents, you know, worked incredibly hard, put everything into their children like we all tried to. And he had made it. And that is what is so heartbreaking about this is that he had made it to one of our top universities.And he was already about giving back, giving back to younger kids, giving back to people in his community to try to help others to advance like he -- like he had. You talked about his humility, his sense of humor, coach Elliott talked about that. He was just a true gift to all of us in this world.

They weren't even there. D'Sean wasn't even at the University of Virginia. And I know another player who transferred him was also not there. So, it doesn't make any sense.

It's like -- it's like cancer. Every family will experience gun violence unless we do something. And -- you know, and that stuck with me.And I hate -- I hate to say this is one of the worst things I say to parents, but your kids are at risk if we don't do something. Whether they're at school, whether they're at a concert, whether they're in a mall because we've seen mass shootings everywhere in our society, and it's something that you now have really hit home even though I'd represented hundreds of victims of gun violence. But you know, when you know the kid, it just makes it that much more personal. And it is -- it is very difficult for thousands of kids across the country right now who knew D'Sean.

Harvard Law is tied for number four.Joining me right now is Heather Gerken, she's the dean of the Yale Law School, to talk about this. Dean, thanks for your time. In your announcement, you say that you -- the U.S. News rankings -- about the U.S. News rankings.

And it's made it harder for law schools to bring in low-income students into their mitts and provide them the support they need.
