They're valuable, they're interesting, but they're not the main event.

Everyone did marvelously well. The people supported the -- people supported him. People supported the Kremlin. The reality is, there are big questions out there. Not only the whereabouts of Sergey Surovikin, who knew Prigozhin, the Wagner mercenary boss, when they both served in Syria for the Russian military. Prigozhin back then was providing services for the Russian military. Surovikin was a Russian military commander in Syria. They knew each other back then. In fact, Prigozhin thought Surovikin was one of the best, if not the best general, the only one worthy of a story, a star in the Russian military. But this is where the mystery deepens over the weekend. The last we've seen, and you're seeing him here now, is Surovikin speaking to the camera, looking incredibly uncomfortable, appearing perhaps to read from a prompter or a message held up in front of him telling Prigozhin to stand down. This is, you know, sort of questionable at best, and it becomes more questionable when you realize a second senior Russian officer made a similar on camera plea to Prigozhin at the same time. This guy was the deputy head of the Russian military intelligence. And guess what? They're both filmed against a very similar background. The wall looks almost identical. So it just raises more questions. Were they under duress? Were they being held when they made those features? And of course, the whereabouts of Surovikin right now. I mean, let's face it, these guys don't always appear on camera all over the place. But Surovikin in that video looked under duress and he is somebody who strongly been rumored to sort of be fairly close to Prigozhin. And Prigozhin certainly thought he was.",
