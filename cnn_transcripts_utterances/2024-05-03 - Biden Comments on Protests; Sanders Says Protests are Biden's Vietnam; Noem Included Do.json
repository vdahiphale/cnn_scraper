And he needs to understand why he's in danger. What everyone gets is if these camps - if campuses were shut down by people waving confederate flags, that thing would be over in 30 seconds. When campuses are shut down by people waving Hamas and Hezbollah flags, universities get paralyzed. Now, that's a statement about the weakness of certain liberal institutions. Now, obviously, everyone understands that President Biden doesn't have any sympathy with this. But the question people have is, is -- the question they have about a Republican president is, does he care? And the question they have about a Democratic president is, is he week? So, we're watching liberal institution show weakness in the face - and hypocrisy and double standards and caving to violence, allowing people to have wristbands that say, if you don't agree with our protests, you can't use the library. But if you do use it, you can't - wear the wristband you can. Meaning the Jewish students can't go to the library at UCLA. You see violence and we see the collapse of the university administration. And the question is, is the president strong or is the president week. And so Biden has to speak and speak firmly and clearly and say, this is not 2020 repeating itself. I will be firm in support of law and order.",

This has been, as we've said, a disputed but central part of the January 6th Committee's findings on the president's actions that day. Trump had tried to refute testimony from former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson when she claimed that Trump lunged at the Secret Service driver who refused to take him to the Capitol. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Remember the person that said I attacked a Secret Service agent in the front of the car. It's not my deal. I'm a lover, not a fighter. This is crazy stuff. I sat in the back. And you know what I did say? I said, I'd like to go down there because I see a lot of people walking down. They said, sir, it's better if you don't. I said, well I'd like to. Better if you don't. All right. Whatever you guys think is fine. That was the whole tone of the conversation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I think that is - we have seen it play out before. We should be on alert. We should make sure that election workers, everyone that is going to play a role in this election are protected. They're able to do their jobs. That voters are able to go and cast their vote, and that whoever wins, let the voters decide. And whoever wins.And I will say, I think it is going to require Americans to stand up to Donald Trump finally, not just Democrats and not some Republicans, but people in the Republican Party to say, we love our country and our Constitution and our democracy more than this man.
