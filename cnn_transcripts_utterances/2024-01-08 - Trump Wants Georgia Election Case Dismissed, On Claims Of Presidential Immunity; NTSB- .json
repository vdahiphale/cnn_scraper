I'm Kate Bolduan with John Berman and Sara Sidner. This is CNN News Central.And new this morning, Donald Trump is asking a judge to throw out the case against him in Georgia. Attorneys for Trump had filed a motion seeking to have the entire case dismissed arguing that he's protected from prosecution by presidential immunity. That should of course sound familiar. He's made similar claims in the federal election subversion case against him. CNN's Nick Valencia has much more on this outside the Fulton County Courthouse in Atlanta. Nick, what are you learning about this new move from Trump's legal team?",

And as you mentioned, very similar to the legal argument that he's making in his federal case, a hearing for that will be held tomorrow and he is expected to be there in person. But this is what he's saying in part of this 140-page legal filing here in Georgia, his attorney Steven Sadow writing here that the indictment in this case charges President Trump for acts that lie at the heart of his official responsibilities as President. He goes on to say, the indictment is barred by presidential immunity and should be dismissed with prejudice.They're also going on to say that a state, the state does not reserve the right to charge a president that is something that should be delegated to them. This filing, we're still going through it over 140 pages. But frankly, as I mentioned, one that we had been anticipating him to argue here it comes among a slew of motions that he's presenting today. They're also compelling the DA to try to get some evidence from the January 6th Select Committee that they believe is out there and that they would like to see. But the most significant filing, of course, is this dismissal or push to dismiss his case here in Georgia because of presidential immunity. Kate?",

The NTSB has confirmed that Alaska Airlines set up certain flight restrictions for the Boeing 737 Max 9 jet because of warning lights. In the days leading up to this terrifying flight, a pressurization warning light lit up three separate times on this particular aircraft.Now, it is important to note the NTSB says this may not in the end be related, but they are certainly looking into it. And we lead off with CNN aviation correspondent Pete Muntean and CNN's Mike Valera, who is outside the airport in Portland. Mike, just stand by for a second for us. I want to start with you Pete.

The good news, we have found the smoking gun, the piece that violently ripped off of at this Boeing 737 Max 9 has been located, discovered in the backyard of a Portland school teacher named, Bob. The part is known as a door plug. It fills a spot where an optional door could be installed at the Boeing factory. The NTSB is retrieving it right now. They will bring it back to Portland International Airport, match it up with the plane and then send it to NTSB's metallurgy lab here in D.C.Finding this is key because it will hold some major clues. Was this a mechanical failure? Was this a manufacturing defect by Boeing or its contractors? One thing that is missing from this investigation, the audio from the cockpit voice recorder. It automatically overrides every two hours and the circuit breaker that would have stopped that override simply was not pulled by Alaska Airlines in time to keep anything good. The communications between the pilots, the noise of the explosion, the alerts on the flight decks, all of that sound is now lost. And NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy tells me that is a really disappointing development. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So Sean decides to take a lovely Sunday afternoon walk in the search zone of Cedar Hills, Oregon about 15 minutes from where we're standing right now.

And when you install those new interiors with all the seats and that sort of thing, that door does come off and used as a service access, so you can use that to move seats in and out and that sort of thing.So it's highly possible that someone else touched this before or after it was delivered.

MARK KIMMITT, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Well, first of all, I think it's surprising that Israel has gone into Lebanon, not only to kill Hamas senior leader, but in this case, Hezbollah leader, but Hassan Nasrallah remains the canary in the coal mine. He be at this point continues to talk about solidarity with Gaza. He now is using words like limitless, which seems to be more propaganda than reality. But I think as long as Iran is holding Hezbollah back, I think we'll probably see this tit for tat exchange.
