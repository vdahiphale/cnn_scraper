Welcome to all of you. Thank you so much for being here. Julia, let me start with you in terms of big picture. You know, as I was talking to Democrats and other sources throughout the evening, the general sense was he came out of the gate with that misnaming his own vice president, that caused an incredible cringe, collective cringe. But then he did go on in many of their view to have a stronger performance, particularly fluid on foreign policy issues, China Ukraine, other things. But the bottom-line question is, is it enough to fundamentally change this conversation? What is your reporting about whether it did?",

Their minds are not changed. That argument was not convincing enough. There was actually some tempers flared in that meeting, we're told from sources. So not just the NATO press conference last night, but the totality of the week on Capitol Hill, the Biden team did not do enough to sort of quell concerns on Capitol Hill.",

But for members of Congress though, if you have Nancy Pelosi and also the former president, Barack Obama, sort of getting involved in pulling the strings there, that puts pressure on them. I think Nancy Pelosi is someone who really has her finger on the pulse in term where are the electorate is, how to move forward strategically, but also she's someone who's sort of been in this position before.

Also not so much to say Zelenskyy one, but that Harris one because he called -- he referred her -- Kamala Harris as President Trump, but he didn't correct himself, which in a way people on the radio this morning analyzing that, saying actually that's more worrying that he didn't even notice that he had said it.

So that's worrying. In terms of the money is a new $225 million aid package, a lot of money, obviously, and it's new. So that was really positive and it's these Patriot missiles which are vital, but also the air defense systems as well, which are vital. You know, the overriding message from Zelenskyy yesterday in terms of policy was, you know, thank you for those, but can you please give us permission to fire them into Russia? The currently, they're not allowed to do that. He didn't make much progress on that, but it doesn't feel as if he can win the war unless its on a level playground, which is that Russia can fire into Ukraine therefore, Ukraine should be able to fire into Russia.",
