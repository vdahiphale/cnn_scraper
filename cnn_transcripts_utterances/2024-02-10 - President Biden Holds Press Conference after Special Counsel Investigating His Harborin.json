And the face-to-face flop -- I'll break down Tucker Carlson's so- called interview with Vladimir Putin, and you don't want to miss it. The panel is here and ready to go. So sit back, relax, and let's talk about it. Up first in the category of things you don't see every day, the president of the United States called a snap news conference the other night to show he still has his marbles. Here is how that went.

And I found that to be very compelling because you have now two potential candidates who have memory issues. One is, of course, Donald Trump, who is the kind of malapropisms and says things all the time that are not exactly correct. And then, of course, we've seen President Biden. I've got to tell you, I think, of course, it was incredibly damaging. I think it was a really political hot potato for him. I think we're going to be discussing this all the time.

So how does he dig himself out of this?REIHAN SALAM, CONTRIBUTING EDITOR, \"NATIONAL REVIEW\": This is extremely difficult. I don't envy him, and I don't envy the folks in his White House staff. He has one advantage, however, which is that when you're looking at his White House staff, when you look at his advisers, in many cases they are to his left. They are in a position that is less popular with the broad American public. The perception that is problematic for him is the perception that he is not there, it's \"Weekend at Bernie's,\" that he's essentially a kind of puppet. If he were to back away from trying to, for example, denounce Israel rather than Iran, if he were to take a position that's more firmly in line with the broad American public, if he were to embrace oil and gas and not say I'm going to shut off LNG exports, then he could demonstrate, hey, I might make a flub here or there, but I'm in charge, I'm a moderate, I'm with you, the broad American public.",

Read the book \"We Need to Talk about Kevin,\" turned into a movie with Tilda Swinton. I'm sure Jennifer Crumbley is going to be living with horrific guilt for the rest of her life, whether it's in jail or not.But the question of justice is very different. My colleague Megan Stack made what I thought was a very important point, which is that Ethan Crumbley was tried as an adult and put away for life. But the mother is being tried on the grounds that Ethan Crumbley was a child. So which one is it? If you're going to try Ethan as an adult, then you have to treat him legally that way. I don't think this is going to have much of a deterrent effect, but many parents will struggle with children who go through phases, and then they end up just as phases. They have difficult teenage lives and then emerge from it. In a handful of cases it turns into horrific tragedies. But those cases should not be turned into legal precedents. GARCIA-NAVARRO: But that wasn't what happened in this particular case. In this particular case what really was an issue was how the gun was provided to the disturbed child and the negligence with which that was treated, and all the signs that were there that the child was disturbed. And so that's why I bring the actual gun issue. This isn't about -- yes, there is, of course, a limited amount sometimes that parents can do when their children are suffering and in pain and act out.
