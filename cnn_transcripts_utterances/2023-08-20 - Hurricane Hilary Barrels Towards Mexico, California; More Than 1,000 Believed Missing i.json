(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is a weather event that's created a lot of questions for people in Southern California because they have never seen a tropical storm warning. And the last time a tropical storm made landfall in California was more than 80 years ago. So a lot of people are wondering what exactly they should do. Officials have said a lot of the preparations that folks would have made for winter storms and flooding months ago apply here asking people to please take advantage of the sandbags that are being given out to bring materials indoors, to not go outside or drive in the weather on Sunday and Monday if they don't have to. Officials have also been very proactive and going to outdoor areas where there are encampments of unhoused people trying to convince them to take shelter inside before the storm really comes through the most intense of which is supposed to be Sunday afternoon at least through the San Diego area with very strong rains and winds. We are seeing a lot of events being canceled or postponed. In fact Major League Baseball move their Sunday games to Saturday. There are concerts like ones at the Hollywood Bowl being canceled. The U.S. Navy has even temporarily moved their ships and submarines away from San Diego just during the storm at least until it passes through. Catalina Island in Los Angeles County has been warned for people to -- they're strongly encouraged to leave that island that they're likely to get hit. A lot of high-water rescue vehicles pre-positioned. A lot of personnel out there ready to act as soon as this weather comes through. It has been more than 80 years again since Southern California has seen a tropical storm make landfall. So a lot of people nervous here but officials telling them to just be prepared.

The match, which is of course being billed as the most important of their lives so far.In terms of team news, interestingly, Sarina Wiegman has opted to stick with Ella Toone. Of course Ella who scored that brilliant first goal for England's against the Matildas on Wednesday night. She is starting it in place of Lauren James who starts on the bench despite the end of her suspension. For Spain 19-year-old Salma Paralluelo who has been such a superstar. She's written so many of the headlines, hasn't she, particularly over the last couple of matches, scoring those two goals in two matches. She is starting interestingly for Spain ahead of her Barcelona teammate Alexia Putellas so despite the fears yesterday there was some concern that she might have some slight injury but she does start. And this one is all set up to be the most fantastic encounter. Two sides neither of whom have had the earth easiest journey to this final England. Of course with the injuries even before the tournament started then to Keira Walsh, then to the suspension for Lauren James. Spain, well, it was only a couple of weeks ago they suffered that what was billed as the humiliating 4-nil defeat to Japan. There's all the talk of the unrest in their camp. But their coach Jorge Vilda despite what other people are reading into the body language and the speculation swirling around the team, he says this is a unified team. He's very aware that they are in the biggest match of their lives, of their careers up to this point before this tournament. Spain had never actually won a major tournament or knockout game.

Now, some context on Huwara, it is a Palestinian village that sits on a major roadway that connects many of the Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank with Palestinian villages. And it's actually a place where many people both Israelis and Palestinians go to get things like cars fixed or cars wash because it's often cheaper there than elsewhere. And this father and son duo were not reportedly settlers, they were actually from the city of Ashdod in Israel that's been confirmed by the city there and they had come to Huwara just to run some errands and get their carwash. Now CCTV video that Israeli media has been reporting on appears to show the alleged incident. You see a man wiping down a car then you see a figure approaching people behind the car, shooting them at essentially point-blank range before leaving the scene. Now, Israeli medics say that they tried to resuscitate the two victims, but they were not able to do so. And as we noted the Israeli military now having a very heavy presence there. Hamas and Islamic Jihad have both praised the attack but neither of them have claimed direct responsibility. The Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is sending his condolences, and saying that security forces are working diligently in order to find the murderer, he said, and to bring him to account. Now, Huwara has also been the scene of some significant violence between Israeli settlers and Palestinian villagers, especially in the wake of such attacks. There was a deadly event what they're called Revenge attacks from Israeli settlers towards Palestinians last winter. And there was some concern that this attack would see the same sort of behavior but the Israeli military has stepped up in their enforcement while there are some reports of Israeli settlers throwing things like stones at cars and damaging some cars. There were no reports of major injuries or damages as previously has been in the past. The Israeli military reporting that they actually shot and injured a masked suspect that turned out to be an Israeli who was allegedly throwing something at Palestine, or at Palestinian vehicles. That person is reported to be moderately injured came, this has already been one of the deadliest years for both Israelis and Palestinians across Israel and the occupied West Bank and we're not even close to the end of the year yet.

And then in this latest unprecedented wildfire, her dad's house burned down and he barely escaped with his life. And so yes, the crisis is now is happening already and it's only going to get worse and that's why these youths are taking these actions and taking the government to court.",
