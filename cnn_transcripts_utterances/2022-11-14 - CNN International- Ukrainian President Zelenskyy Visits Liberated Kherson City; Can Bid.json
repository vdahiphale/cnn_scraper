We of course are expecting here in Bali for President Biden to give formal remarks and even take questions from reporters.But as you just played in that found there, when the two leaders were first meeting earlier tonight, you saw that there was a kind of warmth and familiarity, as the two leaders both talked about the fact that they've known each other for a number of number of years. And they said it is going to be important for the two countries to preserve their bilateral relationship and keep open lines of communication. Now, this is all pretty remarkable. If you think about the context here, the context being that we are at a real low point in U.S. Chinese relations, not least of all, because of how Speaker Nancy Pelosi's recent visit to Taiwan. That was certainly expected to be one of the big issues and possibly a contentious one that Biden and she were going to discuss again, we'll see exactly what the readouts are and how they describe those conversations. But I can tell you that ahead of this meeting, U.S. officials had really set expectations and saying that there were no specific deliverables that the U.S. side was going for, they said that there certainly isn't going to be a joint statement, which tells you so much. And they said that they are going to consider this meeting a success if the two leaders can agree to continue to communicate. And one official said the only thing worse than having contentious conversations is not having conversations at all. So obviously what we just saw is the beginning of those conversations between the two leaders. Obviously, again, we are going to see exactly how the two sides sort of spin exactly how those conversations went tonight.",

And the Russians are there, they've taken up positions on the other side of the river. And the Ukrainians are still firing shells across the river towards the Russians.So far, the Russians haven't returned fire on this city, which is striking in of itself. But that could change at any moment. And I think that's something that really concerns the residents here. They are now quite literally, a frontline city. They are short of a lot of things because Russia has destroyed the phone service here the internet connection, the television tower, they topple that, that they've cut the electricity cut the water supplies. So people here are pretty much desperate for everything at the moment. It's obviously cold at night, its winter. So people are freezing at night and trying to find water. By day, there's a humanitarian trunk that arrived here just behind me the first humanitarian truck since the city was liberated, it's bought water, bread, candles, things like that. But I think for people here, there is that sense of liberation and freedom overrides at the moment, those are much of the fears and concerns about the future. And the concern about the stability and safety is obviously big. And that's part of what you heard President Zelenskyy saying here, look, we're moving the line forward, we're going to keep moving forward, we want peace, but for all of Ukraine. And that means rejecting what President Putin wants, which is to be at a key part of Ukraine. But he also said he wanted to come here to help Kherson reconnect with the rest of the country. And just today the government has managed to get up a temporary cell phone tower to do just that to allow people to be able to call relatives in the rest of the country. But the government does warn about mines about booby traps that are still in the region. People are getting injured, so of course, a very much an ongoing concern, Max.",

The two leaders sat down for the first face to face today. This was surely one of the very toughest issues on the table. This is when they met for the first time as leaders. You know, there's tension there. So it's extraordinary to think, isn't it that this is probably the most important relationship in the world is at a low, we all have a stake of it. Going better, frankly, we'll get the results of that in the next half hour or so when Biden speaks to the cameras. What's he said about Taiwan recently? Well, the closest we got was this interview with CBS Scott Pelley asking, so unlike Ukraine, to be clear so U.S. forces U.S. men and women would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. Biden responded very clearly, yes. This is what Xi said more recently. We will never promise to renounce the use of force and we reserve the option of taking all measures necessary. That was very stark language on the issue, volunteered by him during their recent congress, so very different perspectives on this. Let's bring in CNN's Selina Wang; she's live for us in Beijing this hour. So what do you think Selina? What does Xi want from this meeting?",

They don't want war that came through very clearly in the opening statements from this bilateral meeting, when you heard both sides address the fact that they have a responsibility to the world to responsibly manage that relationship and stop it from veering into open conflict.Ultimately, what Xi Jinping wants is he wants the United States to treat China as an equal and to stay out of what China calls its internal affairs and that includes Taiwan. But it's hard for the relationship to move forward from here because both sides are essentially pointing fingers at each other blaming the other side for the current dire state of U.S. China relations. Washington views Beijing as America's most consequential geopolitical challenge viewing the country as trying to supplant, the United States place as the world's dominant power. Meanwhile, Beijing is convinced that Washington is trying to keep China down trying to contain and suppress its rise. They point to the recent sweeping export restrictions from the Biden Administration that chokes China's access to these critical, advanced semiconductor chips that not only Max impacts its military development, but also its economic and technological goals. But again, the point of agreement is that China needs and wants stability right now, especially given all of the economic challenges that they're dealing with at home.",

And the interview was wide ranging over 20 minutes, and the peg was philanthropy. And something really interesting was that he told me that he does plan to give away the majority of his wealth in his lifetime.So he has never come out and said whether or not he will sign the giving pledge, which some of the most powerful people in the world have signed. But this is the closest he's ever come to talking about that. We also spoke about space travel and how he's trying to combat climate change. He told me that he does believe that in his lifetime, space travel will be attainable to everyone. And he believes that this is very akin to what the Wright brothers did with airplanes. And that's what he truly believes. So he thinks that, you know, I will be one day going to space with my family on a trip and so Lauren Sanchez, his girlfriend, his partner, and the Vice Chair of the Bezos Earth Fund, who you see there. She plans next year to do an all-female trip to space. So of course, they asked her, would you bring Dolly Parton? Who are you going to bring? She didn't say anything about that. And then we also spoke about the NFL, is he going to be buying the Washington commanders, he was a bit coy about that. And at one point, he got emotional with me talking about his grandfather and the impact that his grandfather had on his life. But for more of this interview, you can check it out on cnn.com. And we'll be playing more portions of it throughout the day. But look, there's a lot of ground to cover. And obviously, we also spoke about the current economic downturn and what his thoughts are on a potential recession.",

Like I said, Lauren Sanchez is the Vice Chair of the Bezos Earth fund. She's also involved with several others of his philanthropic endeavors, but she had a large part in choosing Dolly Parton. So it's going to be interesting to see who else they choose along the way, what else they tackle. And again, it was a really interesting window into this very private couple's life.",

There is a trail of beer all throughout the area, though these haven't been officially claimed by Banksy, like the scene of a child flipping a man in a judo uniform, who some say looks like Russian President Vladimir Putin. Another mural in European shows a gymnast performing a ribbon routine despite wearing a neck brace.
