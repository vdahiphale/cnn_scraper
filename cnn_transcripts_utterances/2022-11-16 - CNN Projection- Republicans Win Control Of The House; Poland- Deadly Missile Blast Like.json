He is about 30 votes shy right now.He needs to earn 218 in the first week of January in order to become Speaker. It is unclear if we can get there as he is confident he ultimately will be, but there are Republican members on the conservative flank demanding some concessions. And then there is a question about the Republican agenda, which is still being formed. They are expected to have a narrow majority, which will make governing incredibly difficult. Even passing messaging bills that have no chance of passing the Democratic Senate will still require a compromise between the conservative and moderate wings of his conference. And also major issues like raising the national debt ceiling next year, extending government funding to avoid a potential shutdown. Those are big ticket items that will be on his plate in a Republican majority. And already, Anderson, they are also talking about a very heavy investigative agenda. That is one thing they can do in the Republican majority. They will have subpoena power. They have the Committee chairmanships and the ability to drive those investigations forward. One of which will be looking into Hunter Biden and the Biden family's overseas business dealings, and tomorrow, Anderson, we expect two Committee chairmen, expected Chairman Jim Jordan and James Comer to announce how they plan to proceed on that front.

There was that. There were 16 Republican members who were, of the 48 who were present, who voted to delay the election. That was not enough to succeed. And then there was the vote to replace Mitch McConnell with Rick Scott, the Florida Republican senator as leader of the Senate GOP campaign arm. He had 10 Republicans vote in his favor, 37 voted for Mitch McConnell, as the two and their allies went back and forth over McConnell's leadership over Scott's leadership of the Republican Senatorial Committee, and ultimately McConnell prevailed in that secret ballot election.

So, this is a White House that has been gearing up for a long time preparing for this possibility of a Republican takeover of the House, and is now confronting that reality. Officials say that they're ready for it. One other thing Anderson is they're also looking to see how this narrow majority affects all of that.

And what does it mean for the way things are going to operate for the next two years? ABBY PHILLIP, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT AND ANCHOR OF \"INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY\": I think it's really important who holds the gavels in the House especially, it really determines, as Jeremy was saying, what kind of, you know, investigations that President Biden is going to have to contend with. It can determine the nature of bills that get passed into law, I think it's really important. But the last point that Jeremy brought up, which is the size of the majority matters almost as much. I think that Kevin McCarthy is going to be dealing with a really difficult situation, and in some cases, that might actually mean more problems for President Biden, McCarthy is going to be forced to give the right flank of his party more than he would like to give them, empowering them in ways that can make leading closer to the middle, much more difficult, and will make life a little bit more difficult for the White House as well. So, I think that both of those dynamics, just the fact that they have power is going to be one thing, but how he has to wield that power, balancing a caucus that is not fully behind him is going to be very, very challenging for him.",

Even simple things like that may be difficult, but there is no question that governing in the next era is going to be difficult unless some people come together and some coalitions come together, just sort of accept the message that voters sent and get something done. We heard Senator Mitch McConnell say that today. He thought voters send a loud and clear message that they want something to be accomplished. So all of these House members stand for reelection in 2024. President Biden also stands for reelection in 2024, many senators do as well. So there is an impetus to try and get something done. I'm just not sure how likely that is.

It is essentially what led to the demise of Speaker Boehner and Speaker Paul Ryan, just the threat of this hanging over the speakership. So, this is something he wants to avoid, but some House Freedom Caucus members want it to be imposed. That's just one small example of some concessions he has to potentially make as well as Committee assignments and other things. Abby is right. There is no one who has emerged as a leader. There is no one who has emerged as a credible alternative, but we have seen Speaker elections in years gone by not that far, in recent history here, so we aren't sure actually, if he is going to be the Speaker. After Newt Gingrich, for example, when he was deposed, Bob Livingston was going to be the next Speaker until he wasn't. There was a scandal there, and then Congressman Hastert from Illinois became Speaker. Kevin McCarthy thought he would be Speaker seven years ago and he wasn't because of some issues and Paul Ryan became Speaker, so we do not know.

And I think actually, the Ukrainians will expect that one of the fallouts from this tragedy will be that they actually maybe get more of the sorts of missiles that they need to protect themselves from the air whilst they continue their advance on the ground -- Anderson.",

Obviously, General Clark, a very difficult situation. We talked about it last night. It appears the system worked as it should have. NATO and the US moved calmly and quickly to investigate, asked everyone to wait for more information. So the escalation was averted for now. As someone who worked in the NATO structure and is probably trained, for instances like this, I'm wondering what your thoughts are on the response thus far? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think we have to follow through on the investigation. The Russians are using SA-3 missiles in the bombardment. Their SI3 missiles that should be air defense missiles have been used to attack cities as a ground to ground missile. So, there is a slim chance maybe, there was something far from Belarus. Secretary Austin said we'll get more information. We'll know the trajectory of this, and maybe that's what it was, we don't know. But, you know, the likely thing is, it was a deflected air defense missile that somehow went off course, those things do happen. I think, I think the good points on this are NATO came together very quickly. We've got full leadership attention. We are going to have to look at our air defense protection of Poland, as well as air defense protection of Ukraine. We acknowledge that we don't have a complete envelope of protection. There are additional assets. There are additional reconnaissance assets that can be brought in. NATO AWACS, other area radars can be moved forward into Poland, and maybe some of the air defense assets should be moved forward into Poland, where they could guard against this kind of an accidental or something that's more intentional. But I think that the real teaching point here is, first reports are sometimes wrong. Don't overreact. Get the information out, and then learn the appropriate lessons.

At the same time, I do think he has a legitimate argument on executive privilege from the White House being the Vice President, it really is a bad precedent to set for the Vice President to testify or the President has testified before congressional committee. But by wording it that way, it sounds like he's trying to split the baby, so to speak with conservatives who were skeptical of the committee, even as he's allowed his team to be cooperative with it.",

As Erick said, the Vice President certainly has legitimate claims to privilege and he did greenlight two of his most senior staff to testify Mark Short as well as his chief counsel. If I were advising Mike Pence to which I'm not I would say, turn the page on January 6, and start moving forward on making your case against Donald Trump. Now that he's a declared candidate, he's not winning anytime he's talking about January 6 fundamentally. He did the right thing that day, he really stood in the brink for democracy. I'm not convinced that most elected Republicans had they been in his shoes would have done the right thing.So, I'm always going to give him credit for that. But to Eric's point, it's a tremendously difficult needle to thread because there are people who see the committee as highly partisan. My experience, I've sat down with the committee a number of times, it was not partisan in the slightest, it was highly professional, they were deferential to people who wanted to cooperate with them, and willing to work on their terms. So, I just disagree with that.",

So, if he runs on the good policies, he's proud of and the Trump administration, but critiques the lies on the bad policies, which I knew firsthand, he was instrumental in reversing some of the most harmful like family separation, the Muslim ban and others and is able to definitively tell that story. There's kind of a better angel's lane, he can lean into sort of how Joe Biden contrasted himself to Trump. It's way too early to say if that's the direction he's going to go.

We're waiting on word from city officials on what that process is going to entail. I know that the city officials were in meetings today trying to figure out what the next step is.
