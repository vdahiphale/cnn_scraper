A report paid for by the U.S. State Department says AI could pose a, quote, extinction-level threat to the human species and urges immediate action by the U.S. government.CNN's Matt Egan is here with more on the dangers here.

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, I've read some alarming reports before, but this has got to take the cake. It really lays out in painstaking detail what could go wrong with AI. Two big dangers that are flagged by this report.One, that essentially the AI systems could fall into the wrong hands, that they could be weaponized. Two, that there could be some sort of a Frankenstein moment where the AI systems become so smart that we lose control of them. Now, let me read you what the report says about that concern. They wrote, quote: In the worst case, such a loss of control could pose an extinction-level threat to the human species. Now, I know that sounds crazy and we don't want to be alarmist, but this is not coming out of left field. We've heard similar warnings from Elon Musk, from some leading academics, from Jeffrey Hinton, who's the godfather of AI. Now, the U.S. State Department confirmed to CNN that, yes, they did commission this report, but no, the report does not represent the views of the U.S. government. But it does represent the views of hundreds of experts that the authors interviewed, including cybersecurity researchers, WMD experts, AI executives, and U.S. national security officials. Just to give you a taste of what some of these concerns are about how AI could backfire, they're worried about things like AI-powered cyber attacks on infrastructure, destabilizing disinformation campaign, weaponized robotics, and then there's this risk that AI systems could be so advanced that they refuse to be turned off. All of these concerns are what's driving this report -- Brianna.",

The AI on Twitter started talking to the other AI bots and started creating what seemed like a whole dialogue about my tarnished reputation in Silicon Valley and intimate relationship with Mark Zuckerberg. And so it almost looked like there was just this whole conversation happening online about it, even though it was just like AI talking to AI.This is where things started getting even more scary. They deepfaked my voice, and they made it seem like it was a private phone call between me and Mark Zuckerberg that got leaked. And this AI voice that was mine, but it was speaking words I didn't say. Hey, Mark. Look, I've been thinking about it, and I think we should stop seeing each other. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so I think the biggest thing right now is education. We are entering a world where in the next couple of years, so much of what we see online because of the democratization of these AI tools, because of some of that stuff, that report you were talking about showed, it's going to be so easy for anyone to make a believable campaign, make anyone do anything. And so we have to be more skeptical about what we begin to see online. It's going to be harder to prove that something is false, and it's going to be harder to prove that something is true. So what can we do? We really need tech companies to build out better tools. I always say it's like AI to fight AI, to be able to help stop the spread of this type of disinformation before it goes massive. You think about how X has had all of these issues with a lot of these sexually explicit deepfakes spreading, with a lot of this disinformation spreading before they can get control of that. That's a big problem. And I think we need the right type of regulation aimed at really trying to get in front of this. It's a huge, huge problem that has, as you see from that demo, it has real human impact.",

And I think there's a lot of fear about getting in a driverless car that's with artificial intelligence. And there's excitement too. You know, you hear about all the interesting things that AI will be able to help us do in science and research and medicine. And there's so much tension. I'll give a quick snippet. They showed a kind of a sizzle reel of an executive from OpenAI, which is one of the largest AI companies speaking. And you had a Hollywood audience that booed that, and they were very upset about it because there's a lot of fear about what's coming with AI, what it's going to replace and what are the ethical ways that we should be incorporating these tools. Especially as we talk about, because the correct guardrails haven't necessarily been put in yet. There are guardrails, but we're just seeing these emergent qualities of what can happen when this type of tool is used to harm.",

And it was just some simple questions that, as you can see there, the city attorney did not want to answer those questions. Instead, tried to sort of push us out of the way to get through. Look, I think the city as a whole, the government here is really exhausted by all this. I think they simply would hope that some of this would go away, that there would be a resolution. But it's up to them to get to that point.

But this year, the retreat comes amid the backdrop of a whole lot of Republican infighting.There are still a lot of hard feelings about the historic ouster of Kevin McCarthy, the former speaker. The Republicans have been really struggling to pass even basic procedural votes, given their razor thin majority. And you also have now some Republicans going after one another in primaries. So many Republicans tell me they are just simply exhausted, and they were not excited about the idea of taking a bus ride for four hours with boxed lunches and having to spend extended period of time with their colleagues. So many of them tell me they're deciding to skip the retreat altogether. Some of them have also complained about the location. This year, as you noted, it's in West Virginia, a departure from past retreats which have taken place in sunny Florida.
