Now, McCarthy has been raising enormous sums of money. He has traveled to 40 states over the last several weeks. And including today in Virginia, two districts in which they believe could help them take back the majority. McCarthy and his team I'm told have set the bar at 20 seats. That is more than enough to take back the majority. But they believe they clear that bar. It will be a very successful night. They believe that will give them enough for what they consider a governing majority. Anything less than 20 seats, they believe while successful to take back the majority would make Kevin McCarthy's life more difficult assuming he gets the speaker's gavel.

I talked to several campaign sources late this afternoon, and they -- one of them acknowledging, look, this is a jump ball, we know this is an incredibly tight race. What we are confident in, they closed it out as strongly as they could. The campaign really feels like the last five days have been very good for them.They highlight the Oprah Winfrey endorsement that came late Thursday and dominated the local news cycle here on Friday. Then they had the rally with former President Obama and President Biden in Philadelphia, and one here in Pittsburgh with Obama, and they really feel like that has really lifted and given them a lot of momentum heading into today, especially with suburban women. That was the demographic that came up again and again when I was talking to them. One more thing that the campaign is pretty confident about, Jake, it is they believe Mehmet Oz, the Republican challenger who has pitched himself as an independent voice, a moderate, undercut that message by appearing at the rally with President Trump over the weekend.

They have fewer seats in the safe column. We're going to see if they can meet that challenge as the results come in.

JOHN KING, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL CORRESP[ONDENT:  Brand new map, Jake, because the 2020 census, begets redistricting, which gets you to the 2020 map. But let's focus on this map to begin with. This is the current House, this is the prior map. So, the district lines have been changed quite a bit. That's the map you need to remember. Republicans essentially need a net gain of only five.

She was part of the wave of Democrats that have helped pick up the house for them. She has spent about $11 million in a small congressional district, in a race. And she's been working as hard as she possibly can up against a very, very sour mood. We will know early on because polls close at 7:00, and they tend to tabulate them pretty fast in Virginia.

They've spent millions of dollars, in still thought Maloney is going to end. But it got sufficiently tight in the final weeks, that Maloney's committee, the DCCC put $600,000 into Maloney's race, rather than some of the other races, a lot of the other Democrats, not happy about that.

That's partly because of Philadelphia County. Both my Democratic and Republican sources are really watching for turnout in Philadelphia, and they're also looking for margin in the Philadelphia suburbs, which, Jake, I know you know, very well, as you, I haven't grown up there, because they're really looking for particularly white suburban women and how they're voting to try to see how the nights go.",

By individual precincts because unlike most states, you can go to any voting center in the county you live in. There are 17 counties in Nevada, Clark County being the most populated, more than 70 percent of the population lives here. But they make it very convenient for them, also to vote early.

In Arizona, polls close at 9:00 p.m. eastern, and no results will be released until 10:00 p.m. an hour later, and we could see results from Maricopa County even later. So, what's been going on in Maricopa County? Earlier today, Arizona officials said tabulating machines at 20 percent of 223 voting locations were rejecting ballots as voting got underway. File this under technical difficulties, but we just learned from election officials that this problem has been resolved and all of those votes will, of course, be counted. State officials are expecting the majority of ballot processing will be done by this weekend. Meaning, if there are some tight races in Arizona, we may not actually have final results for a few days here. Then in Nevada, this is the first midterm election with universal mail-in voting, it was a method first put if place. Everyone in the state is sent a ballot in the mail. To be clear here, everyone receives one. They don't have to use it. Voters can go to the polls in person today. We don't have too many details from election officials about what order ballots will be reported tonight, which means, it could take longer to project the winners. And even though election workers started processing accounting mail ballots on October 24th, Nevada will continue to accept mail ballots postmarked on or before today through November 12th, Anderson.",
