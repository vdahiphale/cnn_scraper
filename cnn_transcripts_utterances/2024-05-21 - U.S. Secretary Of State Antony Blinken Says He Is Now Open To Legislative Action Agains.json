The surprising things are that, right, Donald Trump didn't take the stand in his own defense. That's not something that the jurors will be allowed to read into in any way as they weigh his guilt or innocence when they do engage in deliberations. The defense case, interestingly, only focused on Michael Cohen. That was the evidence that they presented by calling two witnesses, trying to further undercut Michael Cohen's credibility, saying he was a liar, saying he was making up stories about Donald Trump, knowing he was going to be paying off Stormy Daniels through Michael Cohen. That was a theme throughout much of the time in court. But the prosecution witnesses really built out quite a lot of ideas. It wasn't just a case with Michael Cohen and then technical experts bringing evidence into the record. There were several people, Hope Hicks, David Pecker from the \"National Enquirer\", even Stormy Daniels, her lawyer, Keith Davidson, testifying about Donald Trump, what his own role was and what he was saying personally about the need to protect his 2016 campaign. So, all of that evidence is likely to be summed up at the end of the day, though. Guys, there's going to be a lot for the jury to look at. They're going to have to judge Michael Cohen's credibility. They're going to have to decide if the prosecution brought this case. And is there enough evidence here that Donald Trump acted with criminal intent when he hid those records or labeled them legal expenses to Michael Cohen in the plan to keep Stormy Daniels silent in 2016?",

You know, he -- last week went in front of, I think, a House Subcommittee and said Cohen's a lying liar who lies basically, right? Really went into the fact that Cohen was doing it on his own, that he went rogue, that he was paying Stormy Daniels himself. He was doing it to protect the Trump family. You know, that seems like it's got a lot of curb appeal if you're a defense attorney. But when Mr. Costello got on the stand, you know, he was very contemptuous. He was, like you said, given the judge the side eye. He was muttering under his breath, geez, and moving to strike questions from the witness chair, which just isn't what witnesses do. So, in a case where it's all about respect for the law and whether the defendant has respected and not violated the law, it's a bad look to have someone in an inner circle that is just so contemptuous of the whole process is kind of how observers described his demeanor. There was also some tangling with a female prosecutor that suggested a certain dismissiveness of her that can't sit well with the five women on the jury. And if that's not enough, the prosecution, when it had Mr. Costello on cross-examination, start showing him a series of emails that include suggestions that he's trying to manipulate Michael Cohen to keep him from turning on the President in 2018. It says things like, does he understand he's messing with the most powerful man on the planet, and we need to keep him in line. We don't let him need to know that Mr. Giuliani and the former president or President Trump are behind this. So, this was a really tough witness for the defense. I read some reporting that they were really mixed on whether to call him at all.

What is the witness's demeanor?

There are two different types of crimes at issue here, two different types of activity and action by these two groups. The Israeli Defense Forces clearly have the right of self-defense, but they're being judged with respect to whether or not they're violating international humanitarian law on how they execute that. Hamas is under a very different agenda of just literally pursuing war crimes and crimes against humanity against the Israeli people.

In other words, the prosecutor even notedin his statement that he looks for what we call complementarity, i.e., the action by the domestic courts to do their job. Now, Israel has a very strong judiciary. If it can be demonstrated that that court system actually is looking at the performance of the Israeli leadership, not just the soldiers on the ground for individual acts of possible war crimes on the ground during the conflict, but at the leadership, and then can communicate to the prosecutor that they have that under control, that they are looking at these issues domestically, then, frankly, the prosecutor should back off. And I think between now and when the judges actually rule on this application for arrest warrants, Israel has the chance to essentially persuade, perhaps indirectly, the judges by demonstrating that they have this under control in their domestic court system. But you can't just say that. You have to actually demonstrate that you're undertaking this kind of inquiry.",

      "sentences": "Well, his lawyers have obviously convinced him not to do so, and look, this is a playbook we have seen from Donald Trumpmany times in the past. There have been repeated cases where Donald Trump has insisted that he was going to testify, that he wanted to testify, and a big part of that is because Donald Trump truly believes that he is his own best defender, and that's why you see him going to the cameras, at least a big part of why he goes to the cameras every day in and out of the courtroom and tries to speak about this, and also why he's been so frustrated about having this gag order placed on him. But we have seen also in the past that he'll say this, and then his lawyers will ultimately convince him that being on the stand would likely hurt him more than it could help him, and that's really what played out behind the scenes, I'm told. Now, I do think it's really interesting, and you laid this out well in this introduction. I think it's remarkable to see that the prosecution called 20 witnesses and the defense only called two, and so that's very interesting, as well. And, of course, there was that question of Donald Trump, if he would testify. He did not. But there's obviously a huge discrepancy in the people who were being paraded onto the stand. Now, I do also want to give you both just some insight into my conversations with Donald Trump's team of how the former president has been viewing this trial. One is I think that he is very much preparing for a potential conviction. I've been told by his team that he recognizes that there's a possibility that he could be convicted, and also he very much believes that the jury in Manhattan is unfair. This is something that they have argued since the onset of this trial, even in the weeks leading up to the trial, that they did not believe that they could get a fair jury in Manhattan, and that's something that Donald Trump still very much personally believes behind the scenes, I'm told. And so, he is being prepared by his attorneys, but also personally believes that there is a good chance he could be convicted. However, I'm also told that he's been very happy with his defense team, particularly Todd Blanch, who has been very aggressive in his cross-examination, and particularly of Michael Cohen. I'm told that Donald Trump was really happy with two instances with Todd Blanch, which was, one, when he undermined, in a way, Michael Cohen's credibility when he pointed out that the key call in question, where Michael Cohen had said he talked about the payment to Stormy Daniels with the President at the time, I should say, himself, that was actually a call to Keith Schiller, one of Donald Trump's body men, about a 14-year-old. And, of course, we'll see how the jury takes that. Cohen said that he also brought up the payment directly to Donald Trump on that call. But that was something that Donald Trump was very happy with his lawyers about. The other thing I'm told that he was very delighted with was how Blanch got Michael Cohen to admit that he had taken money from the Trump Organization. That's something, as well. And you could see from our reporters in the courtroom that Donald Trump was smiling at that. He was a bit smug about that. So I think, altogether, it's going to be very interesting to see, obviously, how this plays out next week. But behind the scenes, Donald Trump is preparing for any scenario.",

Then just two days before this updated ChatGPT launched just over a week ago, he reached out again to her agent asking her to reconsider her involvement. She said she didn't have time to think about it, and they went ahead and launched it anyway. She said she was shocked, angered, in disbelief when she heard this voice that sounded, in her words, eerily similar to hers. And it wasn't just her. There were many people who were comparing this new ChatGPT voice, which is called Sky, to her voice in that 2013 film \"Her\", which of course is a quasi-dystopian film about the relationship between humans and technology. Now, Open A.I. says this was not actually her voice. Sam Altman said in a statement last night that they used a different voice actress but that out of respect for Johansson, they have paused the use of this voice, Sky. But this really does get at some of the bigger concerns in Hollywood among writers and artists about the ways that these new A.I. models could have been trained on their work, their likenesses, and that ultimately could go on to sort of replicate them and profit from their work, their likenesses, without the artists ever seeing any compensation.",
