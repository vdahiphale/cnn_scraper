Jean Carroll's attorney says she may sue Trump again after comments he made about her at last night's town hall. This as more Republicans say they're not buying what Trump is selling. One of them is my guest. Plus, Putin's spokesperson claiming with a straight face that Russia is not, quote, waging war, denying that Ukrainian towns are being destroyed. Is it a sick joke? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, it's about to happen. We're hours away from a major change in U.S. immigration rules. This is what's happening on the ground tonight, hundreds of migrants right now waiting between barbed wire and the border wall, waiting for a chance to cross into the United States. And there are tens, if not hundreds of thousands more behind them. In fact, the United Nations today saying as many as 400,000 migrants may attempt that journey to cross that U.S. border. The reason is tonight's deadline. At midnight, Title 42 is going to come to an end. So, we've got just a few hours here. Title 42 has been used nearly 3 million times to turn migrants away from the United States. And there are growing fears about the crisis that is now on the cusp of exploding along the U.S. border with Mexico because many of the thousands and thousands heading towards that border are coming thanks to social media posts which falsely say that the United States borders are open. Like take a TikTok video, I'll show you this one. It has the #titulo42, which means Title 42. Videos with this hashtag have been viewed more than, ready, 100 million times, 100 million times. And in that video, the man says that you cannot be deported once Title 42 ends, 100 million views. Well, the president of the United States is in a series of meetings as the clock approaches midnight tonight. He and his advisers are saying that those claims are false. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's between the barbed wire and the border wall. And we've shown you the group of migrants that have been camping out here for days, some of them for weeks, hundreds of them. What we noticed just in the past few hours is Texas law enforcement, along with CBP, have been taking the lead to try to divide these individuals into groups. And we've seen many who are now grouped into families, individual men. You can see they even brought out port-a- johns, toilets to keep people contained to this area. They're no longer allowing people to go in and out along the barbed wire. That has changed just today. And so they're clearly trying to start the processing. But from above, you can get an idea of how they're trying to do it in an orderly way. But at the same time, you see folks who are on this side of things, trying to cross, being told they can no longer go over. And it's become a frustration for them.

He does not have the votes for it. I made that very clear to the president. All of us have a responsibility to negotiate in good faith. You know, Joe Biden when he was a senator voted against raising the debt ceiling when George Bush was president. As vice president, he negotiated on behalf of President Obama with John Boehner, then speaker, about a debt ceiling increase tied to spending reforms. The bottom line here is this, we cannot continue to incur debt and print new money at levels we have going forward. And so, yes, we need to pay our previous debts incurred. Yes, we need to lift the debt ceiling. No, we cannot default, but we can't keep going down this path. So my point to the president is this is not one party rule.
