      "sentences": "It is 3Just a short time ago, Israel's Defense Forces saying the IDF is now striking what it calls Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon. So there's that new development. And in a few hours, with troops on the verge of going into Gaza and conditions there becoming increasingly unlivable, people here will be waking up to what could be the first of many hostage videos to come. Hamas released the first one in the overnight hours. The footage is of a 21-year-old French-Israeli woman named, Mia Schem. Now this is not from the video that Hamas put out, which we're not broadcasting because it would serve no other purpose than propaganda for her captors. Hamas today said they now hold as many as 250 hostages. Earlier Israel put the number at 199. I spoke with Mia's family just before airtime. We're going to bring you that in a moment. We'll also be joined by the Mossad's former man in charge, trying to get hostages back about the difficulties now with so many hostages, all of which could grow that much worse in the hours ahead, especially if hostilities with Hezbollah in the north keep growing, which may explain the Biden administration's decision to send a rapid response force into the region, about 2,000 marines and sailors according to Defense officials, joining two aircraft carrier battle groups either already on station in the Eastern Mediterranean or heading this way. Secretary of State Blinken meantime continuing his shuttle diplomacy returning here from stops in Egypt and Saudi Arabia for what turned into a marathon meeting which just wrapped up after seven-and-a-half hours with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and members of Israel's new War Cabinet. Now, we are expecting an announcement from Secretary of State Blinken shortly any moment now, and we will bring it to you when it happens. A portion of that meeting tonight was interrupted by air raid warnings, which sent officials and members of the press scrambling to take shelter. The press in one location, officials in another just across the street. And with Hamas showing no sign of running out of rockets, it was far from the only such warning today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Certainly today, we expected that early this morning, some foreign nationals will be allowed to leave. Then at the last minute it didn't happen. The Egyptians blaming the Israelis, the Israelis blaming Hamas, and so on and so forth. But certainly that will be a top priority for President Biden and for Secretary of State Blinken in advance of Biden's visit. But again, we don't know yet what the Egyptians have to say about this specifically, of course, the Rafah border crossing is in, you know, it's on the border between Gaza and Egypt. They have had real concerns in the past about a number of issues, but primarily about the issue of security and also the issue of having a lot of people flowing into a part of Egypt that is already a heavily militarized zone -- Anderson.",

So I think in terms of the diplomacy and the politics that are involved here, and overall, just using the time to sop up some of the heat, some of the anger, some of the frustration, some of the hurt some of the pain that's going on here, you know, people are still being buried here. There'll be more funerals again tomorrow, for people who were killed a week-and-a-half ago, almost now. That anger and frustration is real. Time doesn't heal it. But time gives politicians and diplomats a space to work. So I think President Biden coming here on Wednesday, opens up a little more time. I don't see the mechanism yet of how President Biden comes and there is a conversation that will that will put Prime Minister Netanyahu in his Cabinet off from an incursion into Gaza and find another method of dealing with Hamas. I don't see that and I don't hear that in the language at the moment. But it does perhaps help bring down the temperature writ larger in the region, President Biden's presence, but also just gives diplomats and politicians a little more time to talk.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think that's probably right, Anderson.And there are probably two signs that the ground incursion would probably not start in the immediate future. Now, this very big sign that President Biden is going in the unlikelihood, if you will, that the Israelis would launch it while President Biden is on the ground, but also, all the reporting that we've seen that essentially, when Israel wants to go into Northern Gaza, they want to make sure that they're doing so when most of the civilians have been cleared out so they can focus their efforts on those Hamas militants. Anderson, it does occur to me that this is the second time this year that President Joe Biden is going into an active war zone. He did the same back in February, he went to the capital Kyiv -- the capital of Ukraine, Kyiv, on the anniversary -- the first anniversary of the Russian invasion there. That trip was shrouded in secrecy. And in fact, air raid sirens sounded when he was on the ground there. Now, we have this 48-hour notice that he is going to Israel. You know better than I do, the air raid sirens were sounding there. Tonight, we saw that happen while Secretary of State Antony Blinken was at the Kirya, as it's known, which is essentially Israel's Pentagon. The other thing that really strikes me, Anderson is that, we have heard these messages of support from American officials, Secretary Blinken last week, Secretary Austin as well, that really talked about Israel's right to defend itself. And over the past few days, you really heard that coupled with the fact that there really needs to be a lot more work done when it comes to people trying to get out of Gaza, trying to get aid into Gaza. So at the same time that President Biden is coming to express that level of support, there is a lot that he will be discussing on the ground -- Anderson.",

President Biden has already deployed not one, but two aircraft carriers to the region, as well as additional fighter jets, all intended to send the message to countries like Iran, for example, to not turn this conflict between Israel and Hamas into a broader regional war. That is certainly what the White House and the President are trying to head off here. We should note that the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, they are known for a number of specialties, including crisis response, humanitarian assistance, as well as amphibious operations and other special operations.

In fact, that's one of the things that the secretary of state highlighted earlier this evening is that the president's visit here to Israel is intended to make crystal clear that the United States is committed to Israel's defense.
