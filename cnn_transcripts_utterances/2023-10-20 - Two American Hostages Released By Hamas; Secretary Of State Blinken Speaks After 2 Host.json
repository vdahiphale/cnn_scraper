Over the coming hours, they'll receive any support and assistance that they need and, of course, we're very anxious to be able to reunite them with their loved ones.We welcome their release. We share in the relief that their families, friends and loved ones are feeling. But there are still ten additional Americans who remain unaccounted for in this conflict. We know that some of them are being held hostage by Hamas along with an estimated 200 other hostages held in Gaza. They include men, women and young boys, young girls elderly people from many nations. Every single one of them should be released. Since the early hours of this crisis, the president has made clear that he will do everything possible to secure the release of every hostage. During my own recent travel to the region, I emphasized the urgency and importance of this to the United States and pressed or partners to do everything they can to help us secure the release. Since that time, we continue to work relentlessly with partners to do just that. I can't speak publicly about the details of these efforts. I know you understand that. But, the urgent work, to free every single American, to free all other hostages, continues. As does our work to secure the safe passage out of Gaza for the Americans who are trapped there. In this particular instance, I want to thank the government of Qatar for their very important assistance. When I was in Israel last week, I met with the families of U.S. citizens that Hamas has taken hostage. President Biden, too, had the opportunity to hear directly from the families. It's impossible to adequately put into words the agony they're feeling of not knowing the fate of their loved ones, worrying relentlessly about them, for their safety and their security and well being. No family, anywhere, should have to experience this torture. What I shared with the families, as the president did as well, that the entire United States government will work every minute of every day to secure their release, to bring their loved ones home. They have my solemn pledge, those who continue to have loved ones held hostage by Hamas, that we'll continue to do that, working as though these family members were our own. With that, I'll take a few questions.",

For it to respect the rules of war and international -- and I am curious if you think that to date, even before that ground incursion that started, if Israel is respecting those rules and laws.

And all I could say with regard to Qatar, is in this instance, we very much appreciate their assistance. Beyond that, I really can't -- I really can't say because, again, we want to focus on making sure that we're getting those who remain hostages back home and with their loved ones. That's the single most important thing. With regard to how Israel is conducting its operations. I think you heard the president speak to this very clearly and you've heard me speak to this very clearly, we've said we believe strongly that Israel has not only the right but the obligation to defend itself against what -- it is very hard to put into words, the nature and the barbarity of the attacks and they really do have the obligation to defend themselves against it, to do whatever they can to try to make sure that this doesn't happen again. But we've been break through, that the way Israel does it matters, and in particular, it's important that operations be conducted in accordance with international law, humanitarian law, the law of war as applicable, and that everything be done to minimize the lost of civilian life. And we continue to focus on that, just as we're also focusing on getting assistance into people in Gaza who need it. There will be plenty time to make assessments about how these operations were conducted. But for on the part of the United States, this is important to us. And again, it is what distinguishes us, distinguishes Israel from terrorist groups like Hamas, which not only have absolutely no concern for innocent human life, they intentionally use innocent human lives to hide behind, to use as quite literally as human shields, knowing that civilians are going to suffer in conflict.",

But they've said that all of the hostages, the civilian hostages, which includes the Americans, could be released, that this could be the start of something bigger if there are no air strikes.Would this be a moment where, if under Israel's discretion, obviously, it would be wise to pause, to give it more time, to see if this is a moment that the ground invasion is not started, should even the air strikes be stopped to see if you could get more people out? And it was notable without going into details, that in the president's statement he said he expressed his thanks to Israel, to Qatar rather in partnership with Israel, a notable connection there. The obvious inference is that they were working together on this. Does this give you hope, that despite everything that's happened, that there could still be a broader relationship and avoid a wider war?",

      "sentences": "Thanks, Andrea.So, two things there. First, it's very simple. Hostages should be released immediately and unconditionally. That's been our position from day one. It remains our position. And to your point, I would not take anything that Hamas said at face value. I'm not sure anyone in this room would take it face value or report something that ISIS had said. Same applies to Hamas. Our position is clear. Every hostage needs to be released and needs to be released now. There is no doubt from my own travels in the region that one of the important things throughout this very difficult period, and since the attack -- the unconscionable attack by Hamas is to continue to find ways for countries to cooperate, coordinate when it's in their interest to do so. And we'll continue to look to that and any cooperation that we could illicit, that facilitates the release of hostages and any cooperation that secures the provision of the humanitarian assistance to the men, women and children in Gaza who are so desperately need it. We work on that every day. And I think we could say that we've seen some of that cooperation. The broader question, though, I think is usually important, because what's abundantly clear is the vast majority of countries, the vast majority of people, want the same thing. They want a region where countries are working together, where relations are normalized, where there's greater integration, where people are working together, studying together, traveling and doing business. Overwhelming majority of people want that. And we want to see as well the rights and aspirations of the Palestinian people fulfilled in the context of that kind of region. And that's one vision and it remains very much alive in every conversation that I had. The alternative is equally clear, and it's very stark. It's Hamas, it's Hezbollah, it's Iran. It's destruction, it is death, it is terrorism, it is darkness. So, the more we're able to make real that first vision, the more I'm convinced that that is the vision that everyone or virtually everyone will subscribe to. So, even as we are working through this challenge, this crisis, it's important to keep that vision alive, because it's important that people know that there is an alternative, and that everything that they hope for and that they aspire to is going to be best addressed through what I've just described, that first vision. We'll continue to do that.",

But I don't have anything for you on that now. Nor do I have anything for you on the status of or condition of Americans that continue to be held by Hamas. With regard to the Rafah crossing, as you know, when some of us were traveling together, in the region over the past week, getting assistance moving was among my top priorities. And we worked very hard with the government of Israel, the government of Egypt, to do just that. And we secured an understanding that we would develop a plan to move assistance. That understanding was cemented by President Biden when he was in Israel and also speaking to President El Sisi of Egypt. In the time since we've been working with Ambassador David Satterfield on the ground, working with the United Nations, with Egypt, with Israel to put that into motion.

They were visiting relatives in Israel when they were kidnapped during the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7th. Let's bring in CNN's Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon.

      "sentences": "No, but they do have a few different bits to gain here. Potentially quite a bit.First of all, it looks good for them to release hostages, given the international pressure and that's not just the U.S. and Israel, that is Qatar has called for the release of women and children, as have other countries. So from that perspective, it is good for Hamas. But it's not just that perspective, right? If there are other hostages alive, as the U.S. and as Israel believe, that means -- that gives Hamas leverage in this case. Whether that's leverage to try to get some sort of ceasefire here or get humanitarian aid, it is the belief that they could get something out of that. As you pointed out, they're not holding people or releasing these two out of the goodness of their hearts. It is because they stand to gain something, and it's because they believe there is value in keeping these hostages, keeping them alive. The U.S. believes they're held in different locations which makes it hard for the Israelis and the Americans to pinpoint exactly where they are. But there is another point to be made here, and that as we look back at the relationship between Israel and Hamas, that has largely been managed through Qatar over the course of the past several years and that is Hamas in the past, when they've launched rockets or held fence protests, or even launched flaming balloons, they have seen Israel and specifically the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu make concessions in the form of tens of millions of dollars of money from Qatar flowing into Gaza or Israel expanding the fishing zone off the coast of Gaza or expanding number of permits. So at least before the previous two weeks, there was a precedent for Israel and Netanyahu making concessions for violence. Now, this is, of course, an entirely different scenario. But if they believe that precedent is still in place, perhaps they believe they could get concessions out of holding these hostages, whether that's concessions on the Israeli side or somewhere else. So clearly, Jake, they believe there is value in keeping these hostages and perhaps releasing proofs of live at certain point, and depending on the success of Qatar in this situation. Releasing more hostages in the future as it is to their need and as they think they could benefit.",

I know that public perception in the Arab world has turned against them because largely their hostages are grandparents, they're families, they're children. That is not serving their cause. And everything is about public imaging because right now, there's tremendous pressure for all of the countries that have hostages, their governments are pressurizing the IDF not to go in and do, you know, massive scale operations because largely, we're looking at a Ramallah or Fallujah type scenario, which it would be very challenging.
