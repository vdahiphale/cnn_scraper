Hopefully not all of them in New Jersey where I'm going to be. Some context around that 37 million figure, that is up by 6 percent from a year ago. But I am here with some good news. And that is despite the rising number of people on the roads, the cost of road trips is actually going down.Drivers across the country are being greeted by cheaper gas prices than last Memorial Day weekend, a lot cheaper. On average, a gallon of regular gasoline sells for about $1 less than a year ago according to AAA. And the national average is miles away from that record high of 502 a gallon set last June. GasBuddy says that prices are down in all 50 states, California, Alaska, New York, New Jersey, and Florida are among the states enjoying the biggest price drops. All of this is yet more evidence of cooling inflation, the cost-of-living crisis, you know, it isn't over, but it is getting better. There's two important points here. Gas prices, they were lower in 2021. And, of course, in 2020, when COVID shut the economy down and people weren't really driving. Also the reasons for the gas price drop, they're not all positive. Some of it is better supply, also better than feared supply out of Russia. But it's also these lingering recession fears that have kept the lid on oil prices and also kept down the price of gasoline. Still, GasBuddy estimates that drivers will spend $1.6 billion less on gasoline compared with last Memorial Day weekend and that is undeniably good news. Victor and Amara.",

Amara, well, optimism is really coming from both sides of the aisle as they signal that a deal could be made and that it could be made soon, really, as negotiators are racing to avoid really an economic catastrophe if the U.S. would default for the first time. Now that update on Friday from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen making it clear that June 5th, not June 1st but June 5th is really the firmest date that she has where the U.S. would be unable to pay its debts, cash on hand really was significant. And it seemed to be basically the motivator needed for these negotiators literally light a fire underneath them to come to some conclusion.Now when we heard from President Biden last as he was leaving Washington, D.C. for Camp David, that presidential retreat on Friday, he said that he had hoped to hear by midnight last night whether or not a deal was possible. And we heard from sources at Capitol Hill overnight, as negotiators were working that a deal could come as soon as today, possibly even this afternoon. And we know that in these final stages of negotiations, negotiators haven't been trading top lines. But they've actually been trading legislative texts, really trying to speed up the process to really putting a bill together. Although even if a deal was announced today, it's unclear when any bill or text would be ready for Congress to view it. But still, a reality check here, which is really important, Amara and Victor is that there are still sticking points when it comes to these negotiations, chief among them as of yesterday, were work requirements. Republicans want stronger work requirements on those benefactors of the SNAP Program, food stamps, and Democrats don't. Now this was President Biden's response yesterday when leaving the Whitehouse when asked what he should do or really how Democrats feel that he shouldn't cave into Republican demand.

Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered a review of procedures around the handling of the sensitive and classified material. The Pentagon also says routine screenings of people entering and exiting the Pentagon will increase to make sure classified information is protected.All right, let's go to Tennessee now where new law is in effect, which requires third grade students to prove proficiency in reading and literacy on a standardized test in order to move on to the fourth grade. According to a report from Axios, 60 percent did not this year. Statewide data released this week shows only about 40 percent of third graders in Tennessee met or exceeded expectations. And that's the threshold these students must now meet. And third graders who scored below proficiency based on their performance have a few options here including retaking the test, enrolling in summer school and moving on to the fourth grade with a mandatory tutor. Either way, the new law has left a lot of parents frustrated. We should note that we did invite Governor Bill Lee and state senator of education, John Lundberg to come on the show. We have not heard back. Joining us now is Dr. Karen Lloyd. She is pulling her kids out of public school putting them in private school over all of this. Dr. Lloyd, thank you for being with me. Before we talk, I just want to put up your daughter's report card. And if you need to get close to the screen, I want you to see this actually, it's probably too small for you to see. Let me tell you what's here. A whole bunch of A's, some E's for excellent, you have to look hard here to find a B there are a few sprinkled in here. When you heard that because of this test, that there was some possibility that your daughter and not meeting proficiency would have to go to summer school, or have a mandatory tutor and all of those A's for the last year what went through your mind. DR. KAREN LLOYD, PARENT PULLING HER KIDS OUT OF TENNESSEE PUBLIC SCHOOL: I just there's nobody who is actually educating my child who knows my child who is teaching my child who would ever suggest this. This is something coming from politicians who've never met her.",

This is being talked about, like it's the kind of literacy test. It's not, that's not what it is. This is just to see where a child is on one aspect.And suddenly, like, everything about that child's education has now been reduced to this one test. It's ridiculous. And I ask myself, I was like, but why are they doing this? Like, why are they -- what is the point and then I realized the point is to force people like me into private schools, and also to use get political cover for taking money out of our public school system and putting it into private schools that have an ideology, and forcing that ideology on our kids.
