CNN is reporting that U.S. officials are anticipating a new phase in the coming days in which Israel decreases the scale of its air campaign and focuses on a more tactical ground operation.Joining me now was Nicholas Kristof, two time Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for the \"New York Times.\" His latest piece, losing hope in the West Bank. Nicholas, nice to see you. I'm looking at the front page of today's \"New York Times\" above the fold. And the headline is the conventional wisdom, Israel rebuffs Blinken's plea for war pause. But now I'm going to put up on the screen what Axios is reporting. They say what actually took place is this, that Blinken had a message according to one U.S. and two Israeli officials, \"We don't want you to stop, but help us help you get more time.\" How do you read the tea leaves? What do you think really is being said between American representatives and the Israelis? NICHOLAS KRISTOF, COLUMNIST, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": So, maybe not surprisingly, I tend to think that the \"Times\" got it right, that -- I think that the White House and Tony Blinken have felt increasing pressure and have wanted to have a genuine humanitarian pause and, you know, not some kind of lasting ceasefire, but some period where people would be able to move out of Northern Gaza safely. I think they'd like to see more fuel imports into Gaza and some relief, partly to take the pressure off of Israel and off of the United States for its role in this.

I think they've also been moved since then by, you know, these extraordinary scenes from Gaza and cried -- and I think they were also struck by the outrage from Cairo, from Jordan, et cetera and the refusal of leaders there to meet with President Biden.

Now, Mahmoud (ph) can't easily go visit his doctor. It's still in the West Bank. To get to them, I had to drive, take an Israeli taxi, leave it at a berm, walk over it and then take a Palestinian taxi. I couldn't even get into the camp this time.
