      "sentences": "Welcome back.Donald Trump handed two setbacks yesterday in his efforts to derail the criminal cases against him with judges in the Georgia election subversion case and the Florida classified documents case, both rejecting his bids to have those cases thrown out. In Georgia, the judge shot down Trump's arguments that his efforts to overturn the election were protected political speech, while in Florida, Judge Aileen Cannon rejected his claim to personal records under the Presidential Records Act. CNN's senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz joins our panel. Katelyn, good morning to you. Just, kind of big picture, what stands out to you about what we saw yesterday? What of this should we be focused on?",

      "sentences": "So, we're - we're talking a lot about, Trump is losing these motions as he's going to trial. These are all of the attempts his attorneys are trying to get the case dismissed or set the terms for the trial when it actually takes place. But you have to remember, that's not the only game that they have to play. They also have to try and make sure, as defense lawyers, that Trump has the best ground he can have when there's a jury in the room.It's quite clear he's going to trial in this hush money case in New York and very potentially in one of the other one - one of the other criminal cases against him, maybe even this year. And so we have to start shifting our thinking about what the approaches from his team - this is not just about delay the trials. Now they're making sure that they can do things that they want to do before the jury and that what they're presenting to the jury might not look like what Trump is presenting publicly on the political campaign. So, an example of this - there's two examples, actually, recently. One, in the hush money case, they lost a motion before the judge there to be able to talk about presidential immunity. They wanted to delay things. They wanted presidential immunity to give him a leg up in that case. And the judge said, no, but if the prosecutors want to bring in anything you said while you were president, you can try and cut that out during trial. So, we're going to see that happen during that hush money trial once it starts. Same thing is happening with Judge Aileen Cannon in Florida. She's currently not dismissing the case on this claim that Trump says these Mar-a-Lago documents where his personal records and not White House records, but she's saying, we can come back to this later. That might be something that you see talked about when there is the reality of the jury in the room.",

There are so many people who looked at this and said this is a terrible idea. MICHAEL SMERCONISH, HOST, CNN's \"SMERCONISH\": Kasie, you remember that line from \"Field of Dreams,\" if you build it, will they come? We're never going to know because they were building it, but then they stopped short of getting to the finish line. And in the end, to your point, it seems as if they really did approach a whole slew of candidates, both in the public arena for politics, even \"The Rock,\" Dwayne Johnson, was apparently offered some type of an overture to see whether he was interested. So, you know, it was the ultimate Rorschach test. You had a number of people, me included, who said, if there were ever a cycle that seems perfectly suited because of the polling for someone to get into this race it would be 2024. But then there were other people who said, any other cycle, you know, this was former Congressman Gephardt, this was David Brooks from \"The New York Times,\" individuals who said, in any other scenario we'd be open to it, but not this year because the risk of Donald Trump being elected is just too great.",

So, I'm sure the Biden campaign is ecstatic with this.I would also think, to your point, that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sees this as opportunity. Where will the so-called, Kasie, double-haters go?

I made the observation, having watched his entire announcement speech many months ago in Boston, and then having witnessed his switch to run as an independent, which was in Philadelphia, that if you read the transcripts for each of those speeches and forget who the speaker is and just focus on the message, there's mass appeal. And he addresses issues that no other candidates are speaking about in this campaign.So, if he can get individuals to focus not so much on personality and some of the more controversial aspects of his candidacy. And I know that's a reach for many, there is appeal that I think that he will have among some who don't normally come out and vote.

And he sees a causal connection between that and a rise of mental health issues, particularly among our youth. I see it as part of a larger societal disconnect.All this connectivity is actually making us more disconnected from one another. I think it has relevance in the political arena because its driving polarization and partisanship to new heights. And his is a book - I've read them all. There have been so many in the span of the last two decades, but this is the book that ties it all together. Yes, it's controversial. Some try and attack the causation argument.

This is an effort that, I mean, clearly lot of people looked at it. A lot of serious people looked at it. What ultimately do you think caused the collapse and do you think it's good for the country that they're not putting any - they're not fielding a ticket?",

And it came from - the group was always very clumsy and had a certain element of political illiteracy about them. They had this idea that if they put forward a candidate who was a Republican, right, like a Larry Hogan, or a Chris Christie, that like that would be a - no, that's going to pull from Donald Trump. That makes no sense, OK? You have a - that was not who these people were going to pull from, right? It was going to pull the critical 6 to 8 percent of - right-leaning independents, soft GOP voters who have been willing to vote for Joe Biden, that are part of the broader anti-Trump coalition. And so all they were going to do was split that anti-Trump coalition and hand this election to Biden. And I think that the fact that everybody looked at it and said, oh, no, I'm just going to spoil it for Donald Trump is the reason that the whole thing collapsed. But it was - it was silly from the beginning. It was poorly run, poorly executed. And I hope what they do now is take all of those resources that they accumulated by telling donors that they were going to have this fantasy idea, I hope they use it to join the anti-Trump coalition and try to defeat Donald Trump.",

So, they did unify quite a bit of the political universe who recognized very early on, yes, what they were saying was - I mean their math didn't even work, but they were very dangerous because they had over $70 million to get on the ballot.",

Resale tickets for the women's games are selling twice the price of the men's. [07:00:00] Double. A lot of the frenzy, of course, due to Clark becoming the all- time scoring leader in men's and women's NCAA division one history. Again, leading scorer from in the men and in the women.
