Authorities say several people were killed by falling rocks. In the town of Hualien, apartment buildings on the verge of collapse. Emergency workers inaction. Authority say they've rescued scores of people from toppled buildings and highway tunnels, but more than 900 people have been injured. And rescue teams are still trying to reach others trapped high in the mountains. The work has continued in while yet throughout the night. No ones left inside this building says this firefighter. He adds people are frightened. There are constant earthquakes here, says this woman, I've lived here 50 years and never felt one so big. It's really scary. People in Taiwan are accustomed to feeling the earth shake but rarely with this much destructive force. (END VIDEOTAPE) WATSON (on camera): And, Jake, there were scores of people that were trapped in some of these different highway tunnels that the Taiwanese have carved through the mountains to reach places like Hualien. They fortunately, almost all of them have been rescued, but the authority say they're still around 71 minors believed to be trapped in two separate mines. We don't have a lot of details about what they're conditions are right now, but that is an effort that is still underway and it may be complicated by the fact that the island is still being rocked by aftershocks.

He is speaking to the Israelis, to the Israeli government. He stood with Israel. He sent the carrier strike force off the coast of Israel to send a clear message, Hezbollah, made a very clear statement, don't.But at the same time, I think the president is working very hard to instill in the Israelis and understanding that there has to be a path to a future for both Israelis and Palestinians. Politics are politics and they're going to play out over the next six months. But what I'm confident with President Biden, what he's done up to now and I think what he'll continue to do, is show the moral clarity that the only way to have a future in the Middle East for both Jews and Arabs, people who both belong to the same land is to defeat the evil of Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, et cetera, but make sure that we provide a pathway for a future of people of goodwill were willing to live together as brothers, as cousins in peace and prosperity, not just between Israel and Palestinians, but throughout the region, which is what he was doing, trying to bring Saudi into normalization with Israel, as well as the Abraham Accord countries.",

But I'm going to tell you right now, funding Ukraine is probably one of the most egregious things that he can do.

The question, would Democrats come to Johnson's defense if he does move forward with aid to Ukraine? That is still uncertain because it's uncertain -- clear the form that's Ukraine aid package will take at this key moment. Now there are also concerns, Jake, that if there is a push to oust Johnson, who had one will be the second person ousted ever as speaker of the House through a vote on the floor, that Democrats could work with moderate Republicans and move forward a more moderate speaker. Greene pushed back against that contention. She said, I don't think we can get any more moderate than Mike Johnson. She had she said there's not even any daylight between him and Nancy Pelosi at this point. He's literally turned into Mitch McConnell's twin and worse.
