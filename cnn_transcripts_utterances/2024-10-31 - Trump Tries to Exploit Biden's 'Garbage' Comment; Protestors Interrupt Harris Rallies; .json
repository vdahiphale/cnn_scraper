So, I do think that the Biden faux controversy is -- just points out what you were saying, which is we need to focus on what is going on in this campaign. The Harris campaign has a GOTV effort. And this is a margin-of-error race. We believe it will be a margin of effort race, turning out the vote in every single state. The Trump campaign and Trump's allies have a voter suppression strategy. And that is to go into every court. They're doing it in Pennsylvania. They were successful with this effort, or Republicans were successful in this effort in Virginia. They're trying to knock out votes, not turn out votes. That is their strategy in this election. MOLLY BALL, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Well, look, I think at this point, people understand that sowing doubt about elections is just something Donald Trump does. And it's not based on anything true or real, or substantive, or anything that's actually happening. It's something he's going to say no matter what is out there. And the same thing with these lawsuits. Many of them are not based on anything actually happening. They are just an attempt to seed this narrative. And so, hopefully after, you know, so -- after three successive elections in which he has made these false claims, people understand that it is a rhetorical strategy, not -- not a real phenomenon, not something based in fact.",
