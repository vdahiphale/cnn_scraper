A world exclusive interview with ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan, who broke the news to me. We'll dig into the ramifications of this bombshell development, getting international reaction in a special program from The Hague. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in The Hague, where today, the International Criminal Court's prosecutor, Karim Khan, tells me that he's seeking arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders, Yahya Sinwar, Ismail Haniyeh, and Mohammed Diab Ibrahim al-Masri, otherwise known as Deif, for crimes committed during the October 7th attacks on Israel, where more than 1,200 Israelis were killed and hundreds of others were injured. The court is also seeking arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, citing the subsequent war in Gaza that seen more than 35,000 people killed and citing the use of starvation as a weapon of war. The prosecutor tells me this is no witch hunt, nor is it political. It is carrying out the ICC mandate to apply justice equally, without fear nor favor. Israelis from across the political spectrum have denounced this decision. Netanyahu calling it an outrage that won't deter Israel from continuing its war. Meantime, Hamas also rejected the charges against its leadership. We will get more on this global and U.S. reaction later in the program. But first, my exclusive interview with the ICC prosecutor, Karim Khan, where he laid out why he's seeking these arrest warrants after seven and a half months of war and how his office came to this decision now.

I mean, there's a whole variety of words that are said and done by the government that have not been disowned, that have not been denied, that have not -- that the two individuals have not disassociated themselves from, and I think that's relevant. But it's -- again, it's, it's a very complex operation. It's not just the denial of aid. It's not only the fact that as an occupying power, Israel has an affirmative obligation to make sure food and the objects indispensable to survival get to the civilians. They have an affirmative obligation. They're in control of the north of Gaza, for example. IDF tanks are in situ (ph). They could guard aid convoys going in and making sure it goes to the camps. They're not doing that. But in addition, one has to look at a wider aspect. Water has been cut off. Electricity has been -- plants have been either destroyed or targeted. Fuel can't go in. Desalination plants are completely dysfunctional. There's no desalination plant in the north of Gaza at all. Water purification tablets, filtration systems have been classified as dual use objects, as have incubators, as has oxygen for hospital, as have anesthetics. One sees 90 percent of all the greenhouses in the north of Gaza destroyed. 40 percent of the land that was used for agriculture has been destroyed since the -- you know, the conflict started. 70 percent of the fishing vessels. I mean, every avenue that is so important to human survival has been constrained or suffocated because of a policy and the words of the secretary general of the United Nations, which said we're at breaking point, the words of UNICEF, the words of UNRWA saying that we've got a trickle of aid in a sea of need, all of these you know, giants of the international system, their words, their concerns have been put to one side, unfortunately, in the face of other imperatives and what seems to be a bid also for the collective punishment of the people of Gaza.",

Now, of course, this situation, unfortunately lies on the San Andreas fault of international politics and strategic interests.

We don't view it like that. This court is the legacy of Nuremberg. This court is a sad indictment of humanity. This court should be the triumph of law over power and brute force. Grab what you can.

Well, can you not? If something is done in the name of either a terrorist organization or in the name of a well-organized state, you are entitled to make certain inferences about a chain of command in the absence of either the terrorist organization or the state disavowing the action that happened. That hasn't happened in these cases. And there's been long enough for them to disavow, there's been long enough for them to say that happened by mistake. It's been said once or twice, but not often. So, the chain of command may not be something for which you need, an absolute picture of every step in the chain. It may be something that's quite easily established in certain circumstances by a range of evidence. So, as far as the crimes on the ground are concerned, you've got not just the evidence that Mr. Khan summarized, but you've also got just the imagery we've all seen of the massive destruction of civilian buildings and the circumstances into which people have been put. Now, I'm not going to draw any particular inferences from that or from anything else.

They might have even said a moral equivalence between a democratic state, Israel, and a terrorist organization, Hamas. What is your reaction? How should people think about, you know, these -- requests for these arrest warrants in the same document?",

Those who have spoken out against this and on Israel'sbehalf have said it is a kind of a miscarriage of intent by the ICC or of operation by the ICC because Israel has its own independent court and system. It's a democracy. I put that to Prosecutor Karim Khan, and nonetheless, it's being said that the ICC did not get enough traction or spend enough time with the Israelis to have them be able to do it. But we are -- we talked about that in the interview. He said he had tried and he had got no definitive or, you know, important help or action and answers from them. And he had warned them in public before. And he said, essentially, he stands by what he told me in this interview that the office has sought to and will continue to seek to engage with Israel and all states. The prosecutor has undertaken three years of such engagement, obviously predating October 7th on other issues to improve dialogue and seek investigate -- information. Despite significant efforts, the office has not received any information that has demonstrated genuine action at the domestic level to address the crimes alleged or the individuals under investigation. And again, the prosecutor continues to say if Israel does decide to take this on itself, then that would be for Israel to do. So, again, the U.S. has complained about this, others have complained about this. It is the first time a democracy, a democratic leader has been targeted. We know that Hamas has. It is viewed as non-state actors and terrorist organizations. But in this case, what would you say to the criticism that Israel wasn't left to do it itself?",

And, of course, it will be up for the judges in due course to decidewhether he's right to have brought the matter in light of the history that Israel may, as he has himself explained, argue is sufficient. I think without expressing a view, it might be easy to think that many people would find it hard to believe that the Israel legal system would fairly put on trial the many allegations made against it, for its treatment of and support by those who act in its name or under its control of people in Gaza and in the West Bank. And it has to be remembered that this series of events since October are part of a much longer conflict that has had recurring events, Operation Protective Edge, Operation Car Sled, going right the way back to the beginning of the State of Israel. And that it's very hard to believe that the State of Israel itself, through its legal system, would be able, dispassionately and objectively, to look at the issues that many people think arise, that frame the overall conflict of which the 7th, 8th of October are one truly dreadful, unimaginably dreadful part in which so many people think are represented by another part in what's been done by Israel to Gaza in the last several months,",

This one, as I have suggested, going back certainly to the creation of the State of Israel, quite possibly back to the beginning of the 20th century. The Balkan Wars, depending on how you view them, going back to the Second World War, possibly to the creation of the Former Yugoslavia at the end of the First World War. And in each case, remember, the International Community's principal powerful actors have been involved and have been involved unsuccessfully in stopping the conflicts developing. These conflicts, these tragedies are not the result of the individuals who are suffering. They are a consequence of bad politicians on either sides of the conflicts or the many sides of the conflicts in the Former Yugoslavia. There are also a consequence of the powerful international actors not stopping them happening. And therefore, we should be cautious before paying too much attention to what, after all, the two sequential patrons of the State of Israel, who may bear a great deal of responsibility over all what's happened, Great Britain and the United States. We should be cautious about what they may say is wrong in bringing an objective independent view to events that have happened on both sides since October.",

The Israelis declined to appear. Hamas did not respond. But here's what Prime Minister Netanyahu has said earlier in a statement that he recorded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): The absurd and false order of the prosecutor in The Hague is not only directed against the prime minister of Israel and the minister of defense, it is directed against the entire State of Israel. It is directed against the IDF soldiers who are fighting with supreme heroism against the vile Hamas murderers who attacked us with terrible cruelty on October 7th. Prosecutor in The Hague, with what audacity do you dare compare the monsters of Hamas to the soldiers of the IDF, the most moral army in the world? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, I think I kind of understand the type of visceral reaction which Israeli leaders had at the time. We can regret it today. You may recall, I'll recall some of the statements made by Americans in the aftermath of 9/11. I'm a historian by, by profession. I recall some of the statements made by Americans after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Today, maybe afterwards, we can regret it. But yes, it'd be better if they hadn't been said.
