The suspect in the massacre of five people in Texas, including a nine-year-old boy, has been captured. We expect an FBI press conference at any moment. Francisco Oropeza was arrested tonight in a town called Cut and Shoot, Texas. That's about 17 miles from the scene of the killings. Let's go right to Ed Lavandera. he's live for us in Cleveland, Texas, the scene of the killings. What do we know, Ed?",

Well, actually, the address that we have where this arrest took place tonight is actually within ten miles of this scene here, where the murders took place, four nights ago. Francisco Oropeza has been booked into the Montgomery County Jail, which is the neighboring county from San Jacinto, where we are, and he is being held tonight on a $5 million bond.Law enforcement sources tell our Josh Campbell that he was found in a home there hiding in a closet. We are expecting law enforcement officers and they are just now starting to gather. So, we will talk here as they start to make their way to the press conference here that is expected to begin any second, and, hopefully, get more details as to when this could happen. Let's listen in to -- this is the public information officer for the FBI. So, he's helping out the photographers here at the scene. So, the FBI special agent in charge, the San Jacinto County sheriff is also over there in the wings and they'll be making their way over here shortly. But this is a manhunt that has had more than 250 officers combing through the region. And there were many people and residents in the neighborhood who had told us they were beginning to suspect that perhaps this suspect had not made it very far from the crime scene since this happened on Friday night, Alisyn. So, a great deal of movement here. We are told that all of this unfolded rather quickly throughout the evening here. And we're hoping to get more details exactly how all of these unfolding. And you'll excuse me because I'm trying to talk to you and also listen to what they're saying, make sure I'm not missing anything here as all these is all unfolding here tonight. So, there'll be -- we're told by a special agent will be making a comment and also that sheriff will be making a comment, and taking some questions. So, we're hoping that we can be able to expand on exactly what is happening here. And I'll let our photographer may be like kind of zoom in on the scene here as the -- you can see the law enforcement agents starting to make their way over here, Alisyn.",

As soon as we heard the news that this had happened, I reached out to two -- one of the survivors and a couple of the family members of survivors that were in inside the home. You can imagine they were incredibly ecstatic, one of them said, we are so happy.But what they were doing initially is watching some of the video that was captured by a resident. And it shows the arrest of Francisco Oropeza. They were frantically looking at this video, trying to see and confirm that it was indeed Francisco Oropeza. They were trying to remember the tattoos that they had remembered seen on their neighbor and comparing notes about whether or not this was indeed the suspect that they have been hoping would be caught here within the last four days. So, that's the kind of emotion and rollercoaster that they've been through over the last couple of hours. Initially, when I talk to them, they had not been told by law enforcement that this arrest had taken place. But I believe that that has now happened. I think law enforcement here will be able to expand on that and confirm whether or not those conversations have happened. I suspect that they have. But, obviously, a great deal of emotion for those family members who have been through so much in the last four days. I'm going to step out of the way here, Alisyn, so you can start seeing them and we can listen in.",

It's almost impossible to do without a pre-existing support system and a fair amount of cash to get you along.

So, Elie, we just heard from the sheriff, we heard from the assistant special agent in charge of the FBI about this guy. Basically, they got a tip into the FBI hotline. His picture had been posted everywhere, we have been broadcasting it, all sorts of T.V. stations had. They got a tip at 5:15 P.M., he was arrested at 6:30 P.M.

They're federal agencies. But federal agencies often assist in this type of manhunt. It looks like he's going to be prosecuted in the state of Texas. Not a great place to be prosecuted, by the way, if you're defended. And there was a question asked of the sheriff, is he -- what is he charged with? And the sheriff just said, murder. And the follow-up was, well, capital murder, which is known and most other jurisdiction as first-degree murder. And I believe the sheriff said, no, but that's a decision to be made later. And that will be a decision to be made by prosecutors. And as I understand Texas law, if you kill a person under the age of ten, and one of the victims he reportedly is nine, then that could be account of capital murder.

And there's bills on Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Georgia as we are looking into this.Ultimately, we have a worker shortage. By the way, we began this broadcast with an immigration issue that leads to this worker shortage. Then you have the post-COVID thing.

In many cases, we've heard about these horror stories at Amazon warehouse. The idea of putting children in those situations is definitely concerning. Having children who should be in school learning on night shifts is also a major concern. I understand kind of wanting them to have this really good moments. I think there are some great moments you can have from working a job as a child, but you know, 15-year-olds on assembly lines in factories is just not it.",

And if we go back to the original intent of the law, the law was to make sure that children got out of the factory and into the school, into an environment where they are going to acquire the skills, they needed to beat gainfully employed adults.And so, the other issue is that the school has failed to deliver on that charter. That many times, case-by-case, city by city, state by state, kids don't know how to read at grade level. They don't know how to do math at grade level. And increasingly, these young people are deciding, well, I better start working sooner because obviously this time I'm spending in the classroom is not actually preparing me for the life I plan on living or the money and the wages I need in order to support my family and my loved ones.",
