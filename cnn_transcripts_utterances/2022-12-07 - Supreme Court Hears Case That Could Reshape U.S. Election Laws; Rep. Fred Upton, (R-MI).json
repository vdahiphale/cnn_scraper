They're relying on the independent state legislature theory, the idea that state legislature should have unchecked power to control election procedures and that state courts and state constitutions have no role in checking that power. It's a concept that was first raised by Chief Justice William Rehnquist in the Bush v. Gore decision. And while four conservatives on the court have previously expressed interest in the issue, Justice Brett Kavanaugh seem to push back on it as too broad of an expansion of state legislative power.",

The way our democracy is supposed to work is people are supposed to choose their representatives, not the other way around. But what our Republican legislative leaders have done is abuse the redistricting process to try to cement themselves into power, no matter the will of the voters.

Let's discuss.And Nia, let's take a step back and look at what's happened just since Donald Trump declared his candidacy for 2024 last month. Since that declaration, his company was found guilty of criminal tax fraud, he dined with two well-known anti-Semites and Holocaust deniers, he called for the constitution to be terminated, or at least part of it, his tax returns were turned over to a House committee, his attorneys found yet more potentially classified documents in his possession, and Herschel Walker, his handpicked candidate lost the Senate race in Georgia State where every other Republican running statewide won. Pretty remarkable few weeks there for Donald Trump. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. In some ways, none of this is really surprising. This has been who Donald Trump has been for many, many years, dining with anti-Semites, that wasn't really a surprise. The Constitution, saying that it should be terminated, that's what January 6 was, an attempt to, you know, sort of overthrow the Constitution and overthrow our free and fair election. We will see what Republicans sort of reaction to this. We have seen them essentially say, well, maybe Donald Trump will fall on his own weight, right? They're not necessarily going to push him over, but they at this point, are essentially signaling that he might not be able to get to the finish line. I think that's what Mitch McConnell said more recently. But so far, they're not really to put any sort of active effort into shoving him out the door in over the bridge. Even given you've seen in 2018, how horribly they did in 2020, he lost in 2022, they obviously did horribly, too. The recent data that I have seen suggests that roughly 45 percent of Republicans still want him to be the nominee, about 45 percent said the same thing for Ron DeSantis. So we'll see how he's able to move forward, if he will, eventually just peter out among Republican voters.",

If they just sit back and ignore it, if they hope that he just falls apart on his own, that is -- they have -- they made this mistake over and over again, they have to go on offense against him in these moments when he is weak, otherwise he can sort of regain power. We don't know if these indictments come whether they have a rally round Trump effect from the base, whether Republicans then have to come out and say, oh, no, Trump is being you know, unfairly maligned, like that is how Trump pulls himself back up.

It's actually one of the best coordinating groups with the federal government, law enforcement in the agency that I run, CISA, as well as Department of Energy, but those threats are so diverse. And this one, specifically, domestic extremism, I think this is where the federal law enforcement and state law enforcement are really going to have to step up and intervene, left of boom, which means before the event or incident happens so that we can stop the bad thing before it actually happens. And you know, I personally, I find it hard to believe that energy companies need to, you know, should be responsible for shelling out hundreds of millions of dollars to protect a bunch of you know, crackpots that are trying to bring down society.",

There's also a 50 percent chance of rain which might create dense fog and make driving hazardous.In our national lead, jury deliberations are underway in the Los Angeles sexual assault trial of disgraced former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. Weinstein faces two counts of forcible rape and five counts of sexual assault involving four women. The 70-year-old is already serving prison time for a 2020 rape and criminal sexual act conviction in New York. CNN's Natasha Chen is following this current trial in California. And Natasha, bring us up to speed and what each side has argued? NATASHA CHEN, CNN NTIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Jake, prosecutors are describing this Hollywood Titan using his power to prey on and silence women. The prosecutor in the closing statement said, quote, it is time to bring the kingmaker to justice. Now you're thinking he's already been brought to justice in the New York trial where he was convicted sentenced to 23 years in prison, well, he's appealing that case, which then makes this L.A. case extremely critical. There were actually more women who testified in this trial compared to the New York one. And the sentencing range is far greater as well. If convicted here, he could get 60 years to life. The prosecutors kept describing a pattern of behavior here. As you mentioned, seven charges involving four women, one of whom is the wife of California Governor Gavin Newsom, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, two of the other accusers describe incidents that happened allegedly one day apart from each other in 2013. Now, the defense on the other hand, tells the jury that the prosecution is asking them to simply take the women's word for it without a whole lot of evidence, the defense also called the accusers, quote, \"fame and fortune seekers\" and said that they benefited from what they call a transactional relationship. The jury has been deliberating since late Friday. So we'll see what they come up with, Jake.",
