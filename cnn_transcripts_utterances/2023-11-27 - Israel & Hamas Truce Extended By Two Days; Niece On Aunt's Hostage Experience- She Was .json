And welcome to THE SOURCE.I'm Kaitlan Collins, live here, on the ground, in Tel Aviv, tonight, where 11 hostages have just arrived, back on Israeli soil, after being held hostage, by Hamas, for 51 days. The Ministry of Health confirms that all 11 are now at the Sourasky Medical Center, here in Tel Aviv, undergoing medical evaluations, while also being reunited, with their families. Nine of them are children. The youngest, 3-year-old twins, Yuli and Emma. Their mother, Sharon, was also freed today. But these kids have one tragic thing in common. Yuli, Emma and every single child, who was released today, have fathers, who are still being held hostage, tonight. Think about that for a moment. How bittersweet it is, to finally, finally, be out of Gaza. Yet return home, knowing that your dad is still in the clutches, of terrorists? The hostages released, tonight, were all kidnapped, from the same kibbutz, Nir Oz, in southern Israel. They're all also dual citizens. But no one, I should note, released today is an American. The Israel Defense Forces released this video, tonight, showing the moment that the hostages returned home. Also home tonight, 33 More Palestinian prisoners. Their release, following that announcement, that there may be more to come. Qatar confirmed CNN's reporting that this temporary truce will now go on, for two more days, meaning two more days of hostage -- hostages, potentially being freed, Palestinian prisoners being released, and more aid going into where it's desperately needed, Gaza. I want to bring in CNN's Chief Global Affairs Correspondent, Matthew Chance, for more on what we saw happen here, on the ground, today. And for the hostages, who were released, we talked about the fact that so many of them still have fathers, who are being held, all of the kids still have -- being have -- fathers being held. What else do we know, about the ones, who were released, today?",

But they still got to deal with that trauma that they've got loved ones, who are either dead, or in some cases, they've got loved ones, who are dead, or their, as you say, their father's captive. There's some of the details about them, which are quite interesting. They're all dual citizens, as you mentioned. And I think that underlines just how international this disaster has been. It's not just about Israel. There's a whole group of people, from -- with joint nationalities and, of course, foreign nationals, as well, who are also affected, by this. And the fact that you've got 11 people, dual nationalities, with fathers, still hostages, underlines both those points.",

But there are many, who are not, including a 10-month-old baby. In the last four days, we have seen some incredibly emotional reunions. Today, 9-year-old Emily Hand discharged from the hospital that she was at here, in Israel. Her father, Thomas, initially believed, and was told that she had been killed, on October 7th, only to find out weeks later, that she was a hostage. Tonight, she is back, in her father's arms, doing better than expected, he tells us. Maayan Zin's nightmare came to an end, when she got to hold her 8- year-old and 15-year-old daughters, Ella and Dafna. And for 4-year-old Abigail Edan, she is also back with her family, tonight, as you can see here, in these photos, released from the hospital. She's with their aunt and her grandmother. But notice she is not with her parents, who were murdered, in front of her, by Hamas, on October 7th. That's why these reunions are the definition of bittersweet, if you can even call it that. Many of them are coming home, to families that are no longer whole, tonight. Roughly 107 people -- 170 people are still being held hostage, by Hamas, and other militant groups, in Gaza, tonight. For those hostages' families, all they can do is hold out hope for their return. You can count Yarden Roman's loved ones among them. She was captured, on October 7th, along with her husband, and her 3-year-old daughter, Geffen (ph). At one point, the three were able to escape, by jumping out of a car that was taking them to Gaza. They fled, on bare feet, as Hamas shot at them, which is when Yarden handed Geffen (ph) to her husband, knowing that he could outrun her. Her husband and the 3-year-old daughter survived, by hiding for hours. But she was recaptured. And I'm joined now, by her cousin, Maya Roman, back here, again with us, tonight. And thank you, for coming back, tonight. MAYA ROMAN, COUSIN OF YARDEN ROMAN-GAT, HOSTAGE SINCE OCTOBER 7: Sure.

And he was released in the Shalit deal, in which 10,017 prisoners, and many of them convicted of murder, one of them was Yahya Sinwar.By the way, he was convicted for murdering Palestinians. He was labeled, in the Gaza Strip, as the Butcher of Khan Younis. And this is the place he comes from. And he was murdering people, who were negotiating, or talking with Israeli security services. And this is the reason he went to prison, not for murdering Israelis, but for murdering Palestinians. And he became the leader of Hamas. And there is an incredible story that's been published, by Channel 12, and verified by Yediot Ahronoth, where I work, about Sinwar actually meeting some of the Israeli hostages. Underground, in the tunnels, the door opens, Yahya Sinwar walks in. He says, in Hebrew, to the Israeli hostages, \"My name is Yahya Sinwar.\" They identify him. And he says, \"You're safe here.\" And of course, the reason he came there, Israeli sources are saying, is not to make sure they're safe. He came there to send a message. And he also came there, as these types of leader do, to see what he has done, to see in front of him, those Israelis that were kidnapped.",
