Welcome to \"CNN Tonight.\" We've got exclusive CNN reporting tonight, that Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's former lawyer, has been talking to prosecutors in the special counsel investigation into Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. One of Trump's other former lawyers, Michael Cohen, is here tonight with his thoughts on what Giuliani is saying.Plus, the former president is offering multiple explanations tonight for that audiotape obtained by CNN of his meeting at Bedminster where he showed off his reportedly secret classified documents. What does that tape reveal about Donald Trump's motive? Our panel of legal experts weighs in. And, as we know, people who crossed Vladimir Putin tend to fall out of windows or suffered mysterious illnesses. So, what is next for Yevgeny Prigozhin? A longtime Russian TV host tells us. Let's begin with our CNN exclusive. Rudy Giuliani has been talking to prosecutors as part of Jack Smith's investigation into Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election win of Joe Biden. Our senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid is here. Paula, great to see you. So, do we know what Giuliani has told investigators?",

We do know that he was accompanied by his lawyer, Robert Costello, for the sit down with special counsel prosecutors.But we have some idea what they might want to talk to him about. We know that late last year, he was subpoenaed for documents related to payments that he received around the time that he was filing legal challenges on behalf of former President Trump trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election. That subpoena came when it was still a Justice Department investigation, before Special Counsel Jack Smith was appointed. But, Alisyn, when Smith was appointed, Giuliani did not hear anything for over six months and there were questions being raised about whether that meant that he was possibly a target and not just a potential witness in this investigation. So, the fact that he has now sat down with prosecutors, talked to them, presumably answered questions, that is notable. Now, we just got a statement from his spokesperson, Ted Goodman, who said -- quote -- \"The appearance was entirely voluntary and conducted in a professional manner.\"",

It is just a broader, more diverse array of potential criminal activity.But it does appear, over the past few weeks, we have seen a flurry of witnesses going before the grand jury. We have seen other activity that suggests strongly that the special counsel could be nearing a charging decision. So far, he has not brought any charges related to January 6th, but it appears that could be coming. It is completely unclear if Rudy Giuliani or former President Trump or anyone at all will definitely be charged. Definitely, we are seeing an uptick in activity.",

Subsequently, some other defendants of Russia flew to kill the first defendants of Russia, but they themselves were killed during the attempt. We are talking now about at least two helicopters which were shot down by Wagner. Prigozhin, a Russian hero, was on route to kill Russian hero Shoigu, the Russian defense minister. As a result, Russian hero (INAUDIBLE) set out to kill Russian hero Prigozhin. Simultaneously, Russian hero (INAUDIBLE), who is head (ph) of Russia FSB, opened a criminal case against Russian hero Prigozhin but immediately closed it. That is why the main Russian hero, Putin, first guaranteed that the traitors would all pay a mighty penance and then rapidly guaranteed that they would not be any (INAUDIBLE) at all. That is giving you an idea of how many actually very high-ranking Russian heroes, you know, Russian --",

You know, that is contrary to two centuries of checks and balances that our system has had, but yet it sure looked like before the argument like many of the justices were entertaining this idea.

The number of shenanigans that could have been launched was infinite.And so, what Chief Justice Roberts said today, uh-uh, in this country, we have the tradition of judicial review, judicial oversight, particularly things that impact our democracy. And if you think back to the 2020 election, there were about 60 different cases that Donald Trump tried to bring, claiming to throw -- claiming that he won. Almost all of those cases were in state courts. And had this theory prevailed, all of those cases would have come out the other way.

You know, Americans risked their lives to generate those documents or our allies' spies do. You cannot not treat them cavalierly. I was national security adviser at the Justice Department. I can guarantee you, anyone who did such a thing would not just be fired, they would be prosecuted immediately. That is one. But the second is, you hear Trump on the tape actually saying, oh, that is a classified document, it is not declassified, and I do not have the power to declassify because I'm not the president. That throws the whole theory that he can magically declassified documents by bringing them out of the Oval Office to smithereens, too. It was never a real legal theory. it was only a made-up one.

We saw that in the midterms. There was actually a kind of fallen nature of his relationship with their own base, even as some of that has come back around to him. But what has changed in the last time since the midterms is that that is not something you can say as he has become -- looked more likely to be the nominee. You have Kevin McCarthy, as he has done over and over again, having to kind of crawl back to Donald Trump and basically, politically, apologized in the most open manner. I think this is for Kevin McCarthy, who looks weekend, but this is a person who came into that office with that hanging over him. Since the day he got that speaker gavel, the Trump wing of the party has put pressure on him, even as he has continued to rack up some winds in D.C.
