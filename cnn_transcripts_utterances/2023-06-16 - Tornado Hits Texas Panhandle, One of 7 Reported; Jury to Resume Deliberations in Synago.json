The twister plowed a trail of destruction right through the heart of that city. Perryton's fire chief confirming at least three deaths and damage to as many as 200 homes. A nearby hospital says that it treated 50 to 100 people for injuries, including collapsed lungs, head injuries, and broken bones. Cleanup is, of course, underway. Congressman Ronny Jackson who represents Perryton is asking people to help anyway they can. I want to bring in meteorologist Derek Van Dam in the CNN Weather Center. Derek, this was just one of seven tornadoes reported Thursday, along with, what, nearly 200 storms. Are we looking at anything like this for today?",

And let's focus on the more immediate threat, what's happening now.We have severe thunderstorm watches stretching from Texas through to Louisiana, all the way to the Gulf Coast. Flash flood warnings, tornado warnings, let's get to that tornado warning which is in the Florida panhandle. You can see it just west of the Branford region. This is near the Big Bend of Florida. There is Tallahassee. Here is Jacksonville for that geographical perspective. This is valid through the next 15 minutes or so, as we've been monitoring the storm all morning. This is part of the larger, severe weather setup that we have, a slight risk that is at level two of five from the Gulf Coast, stretching all the way Little Rock. Notice, too, the other areas across Kansas, eastern sections of Colorado, under the threat of severe weather today. The other weather story that we're covering is the massive amounts of rain that have fallen, over a foot of rain has taken place just outside the Pensacola region. This is from the storm system that is over the tray same area, a storm that produced rainfall over the same locations for several hours. Some of that rainfall occurring within a three hour time span. This is a radar estimated rainfall total over the next two days, you can see the southeast has been in a very unsettled weather pattern, but focusing in on Pensacola. Pensacola Beach, look at this, unconfirmed reports, of 10 to 15 inches of rain, where you see that shading of a pink and white. That is a dangerous and life-threatening amount of precipitation in such a short period of time. National weather service picking up on that, social media show some of the flash flooding that is ongoing. By the way, flash flood warning particularly dangerous situation. That is valid through 5:45 this morning. And this is part of a broader picture here. You can see the flash flood watches that are in place across the south, a few other flash flood warnings associated with that storm. That is producing a tornado across the Big Bend. But going back to parenting Texas, just, Christine, seeing some of the aerial footage of the devastation there, heartbreak for the people this morning about what they're going to find when they see first light.",

The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told CNN on Thursday that it is, quote, providing support to several agencies which have experienced intrusions affecting their movement applications and is, quote, working urgently to understand impacts and timely remediation.Now, Move It a widely used file transfer software that hackers appeared to have found a vulnerability in earlier this year and began exploiting in late May. Progress, the U.S. firm that owns the Move It software, has now urged victims to update their software packages and has issued security advice. Now, so far, the U.S. Department of Energy is the only federal agency to confirm publicly that it was hit, saying in a statement that records from two of its entities were compromised and that the department is investigating the incident. But, look, the hackers have used the vulnerability not only to target federal agencies but state governments and academic institutions, including Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and Georgia statewide university system. In terms of who is behind the hack, a Russian-speaking ransomware group known as Clop last week claimed credit for some of the cyberattacks which have also affected employees of the BBC, British Airways, oil giant Shell, and state governments in Minnesota and Illinois among others. But the Russian hackers were the first to exploit the vulnerability, experts say that other groups may now have access to a software code that is needed to conduct the attacks and are simply taking advantage of it. So, broadly, the new hacking campaign really shows the widespread impacts that a single software flaw can have if it is exploited by these skilled criminals and putting new pressure on federal officials who have pledged to combat the ransomware attacks that have hobbled schools, hospitals and local governments across the U.S. Natasha Bertrand, CNN, Washington.
