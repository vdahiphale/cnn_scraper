We are live from Dubai.Russia is now upping the death toll and casting blame in what the Kremlin says is the deadliest single attack on its forces during its war in Ukraine. Russia's defense ministry now says 89 soldiers were killed in the New Year's on a military barracks in a Russian occupied region of Donetsk. The military says Ukraine was able to trace the location of the barracks, due to quote, \"mass use of cell phones by soldiers.\" Ukraine says the death toll from that attack was much higher. Scott McLean is connecting us this hour from the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. Scott, look, despite the Kremlin's death toll being remarkably lower than what we are hearing from the Ukrainians, this is the biggest, deadliest attack that Russian officials have confirmed.

He called that a deliberate attempt to smear blame and said this could have easily been Ukrainian drone surveillance that picked up their location or even an informant. This also may have been a bit of a wakeup call about the weapon Russia says was used, the U.S. supplied HIMARS artillery system. It is a mobile artillery system that allows the Ukrainians to fire much deeper behind enemy lines. And there are questions about whether the Russian military really understands the capability of it. One other prominent military blogger inside of Russia says it is now undeniable that the Ukrainians are using this weapon not only to target supply lines and other bits of infrastructure but they are also deliberately using it to target barracks and other concentration of Russian troops.

What we've learned is that, out of the 52 components Ukrainians took apart, took out of this drone when they took it apart late last year, 40 were actually made by American companies, by about 13 different American companies. This is, of, course not a singularly American issue. This is also a global problem. When the Ukrainians examined the rest of those components, they found they came from places like Canada, Taiwan, Japan, China and Switzerland. So this is really a big issue now that is confronting the Biden administration, as well as the U.S.' allies, because the Ukrainians actually shared this intelligence assessment with the U.S. late last year, to tell them, look, this needs to be addressed. As long as the Iranians are able to manufacture these drones, of course, Russia is going to continue to use them with devastating effect inside Ukraine. Something Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy actually warned about on Monday, saying they have intelligence that the Russians are using these exact drones, the Shahed drones, the ones that Ukrainians examined in the assessment I obtained, in order to exhaust civilians and infrastructure targets inside Ukraine. So there's no evidence, we should, note the companies are running afoul of any export laws, any sanctions laws. But the fact is that these parts on the global market is going to be a big challenge for the U.S. and Europe to address the fact that the Iranians are using front companies, shell companies, distributors, retailers, to get their hands on these very small components that are, of course, very important to the functioning of these drones.

The European Union has said they are considering imposing preflight testing on flights from China, on testing wastewater as well, for the virus, as it comes out. But one sector of the global economy that does not like this is, no surprise, the aviation industry, which has taken a walloping over the last couple of years due to the pandemic. Look at a statement coming from the head of the International Air Transport Association, calling this extremely disappointing to see this knee-jerk reinstatement of measures that proved ineffective over the last three years. He goes on to say governments must base their decisions on scientific facts rather than science politics. You have a spectrum of some countries, like the U.S., saying you need preflight testing to get on a plane to fly to the U.S., prove you don't have COVID, if you are coming from China.

He successfully moves the car, tows in his driveway, he's clearing snow. And then he gets off the Sno-Cat to talk to his family member and that's when it starts to roll. So he attempts to jump back on the Sno-Cat to put it in park to stop it. But it looks like he fell off and then that's when it crushed him. Thankfully, he's alive this morning. The sheriff appeared on \"CNN THIS MORNING\" and talked about what Jeremy means to the washout County and Nevada community. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's one of our non-profits thatmembers in our community and they help us do Shop with a Sheriff, where they spend $50,000 in donate it. He's one of those members. He does a lot for the community. He came in when I took office in 2019. He showed up for Shop with a Sheriff and you should see the kids and the parents. And he took the time out of his days to do autographs, shop with kids. So he does a lot in our community. And what I truly enjoy about Mr. Renner is, a lot of times he does it and no one knows. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And look, Jeremy was lucky that he had family members and neighbors who sawwhat happened and rushed to his aid and called 9-1-1. But because of the snowfall in the area, it took over 30 minutes for them to even reach him. So again, he's lucky to be on the road to recovery.",
