All right. Court is just about to resume after two breaks in the trial of the Michigan mother who is facing involuntary manslaughter. The judge is trying to decide if a major piece of evidence, text messages between Jennifer Crumbley and her attorney will be allowed in trial, which the defense says could get set a dangerous precedent in the case. But she opened up the door. So the judge is looking at that now. The case is already historic in its own right. Jennifer Crumbley is charged with involuntary manslaughter after her son shot and killed four students at Oxford High School in 2021. He will spend the rest of his life behind bars. And now his mother, Jennifer, trying to avoid jail time herself. She's take -- took the stand yesterday shifting blame to her own husband, but saying this about the violence that's transpired that day at the hands of her son. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So while being on the witness stand has got to be the worst place in the world because, one, you're allowing the conversation between your lawyer and your attorney to now get out into the public domain. And now prosecutors also have a right to cross examine now on that information. They can't be left as a former homicide prosecutor. I'd be screaming and yelling. She can't say something on direct examination about a communication. And now I'm unable to cross examine her on it. So she opened the door for those to be released.",
