As soon as today a federal grand jury in D.C. could hand down another indictment against former President Donald Trump. Any moment now that grand jury is expected to meet once again. And all of this is surrounding his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election result. Today is also something of a deadline day for Trump and his legal team. After getting the target letter from the special prosecutor - from the special counsel, he has the chance to make his case before the grand jury, but that's seen as highly unlikely to happen. Someone who is expected before the grand jury today, two sources tell CNN that Will Russell, a special assistant to Donald Trump, will testify today. He's already been before the grand jury in this investigation at least twice. CNN has learned that in the face of this growing legal threat, Trump is expanding his legal team. He added criminal defense attorney John Lauro to work alongside Todd Blanche. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has the very latest for us. And, Katelyn, you're outside the courthouse in D.C.

Now, they have a couple questions. One is, did anyone else receive a target letter? They want to know, is Donald Trump the main focus of this case or are there others involved as well that the special counsel is looking at? They also are trying to get a better sense of the evidence that special council Jack Smith has against him, as well as whether any other Trump -- members of Trump's inner circle cooperating with the special counsel. Now, the charges that were laid out in that target letter that Donald Trump received Sunday night are much more sprawling than they had anticipated. And so they're trying to get a sense of, what does this case look like and what do we need to be prepared for? Now, I think it's important to note that many of the witnesses that have so far come before the grand jury are people who were represented by many of Donald Trump's legal team or are paid for by Trump world. And so that is something that they're watching very closely and it also gives them a lot of insight potentially into what they're being asked. Rahel.",

You can even ask them, what did they ask you? What did you say? As long as you're not tampering with the witness.I'm surprised it's actually taken Donald Trump this long to mobilize his legal team.

Section 241 of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, which obviously we're all learning about, except you know about, it states the following, if two or more persons conspire to injury, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any state, territory, commonwealth, possession or district in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.

There were several people who were injured. You can see those firefighters trying to put out the fires in this building, both in them -- from among the rubble and up on that ladder up there.

We are on the edge of the port. The - one of -- the biggest port in Ukraine, which we can't show you for security reasons. But that is almost certainly why, according to Ukrainian authorities, Russia has been carrying out these strikes on Ukraine. Now, this attack started just before 2:00 a.m. local time. It was a combination of drones and missiles. We could hear those drones very clearly buzzing the roof tops in downtown Odessa. I want to play you some of the video that - sorry, we're just going to get out of the way of these -- this water. I want to play you some of the video shot by photojournalist Scott McWhinnie of one of the explosions of the missiles here in Odessa last night. Take a listen.

This was an incredibly sophisticated attack. Almost 40 drones and missiles. Most of the missiles got through. Russia used long-range strategic bombers, supersonic bombers. They used four different kinds of cruise missiles. They used those Iranian Kamikaze drones. Just the symbolism of what they used is sending a very large message to Ukraine. President Zelenskyy has said it is very clearly Russia trying to target the grain infrastructure just a few days after Russia pulled out of that critical grain deal. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

There were a lot of questions about what this would ultimately mean for their operations in Africa.Colonel, the attacks overnight in Odessa and Mykolaiv, the result of weapons that have propulsion systems, of course, as you know, allowing them to travel long distances. Ukraine has been pleading for better air defense systems. What do they need most at this point?",

And what that means really is they need a bigger umbrella to cover places like Odessa. The Ukrainian air defenses have focused mainly on Kyiv and then to another extent on Kharkiv, the second city up in the northeast. But they really need to protect Odessa because the Russian goal has always been, from the very beginning of this phase of the conflict, has always been to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea.And what the Ukrainians need are systems like the NASAMS systems, the IRIS-T system from Germany, and the Patriot system. These systems would allow them to do a better job of shooting down the missiles. Alex, in his report, mentioned, you know, some of the limitations that they had and the fact that they really didn't shoot down all of the missiles. There were 38 that were thrown at Odessa. They got 18 I believe it was. So, that, you know, shows that they have to have a better track record. Once there's a more concentrated air defense system, the track record goes up. And, you know, in some cases, you're able to achieve a track record of shooting down almost 100 percent of incoming missiles. And that's what they need for Odessa to protect that infrastructure.",

That is one aspect of it. The other aspect is that some of - there will be some more NASAMS systems themselves coming. There will be four more coming in as part of this aid package.So, as a result of that, Ukraine should be better able to protect some of its other critical assets, such as the Port of Odessa and possibly the port of Mykolaiv. And that will then allow them to fend off these attacks and limit damage to that critical port infrastructure.",
