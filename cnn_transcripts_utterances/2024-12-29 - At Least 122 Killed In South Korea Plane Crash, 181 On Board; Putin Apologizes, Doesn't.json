We have the latest now on our breaking news.Officials now say that nearly everyone on board a plane that crashed in South Korea has died, 181 people were traveling from Bangkok on a Jeju Air Flight. So far, rescue workers have confirmed the deaths of 122 people. Two crew members have been rescued, but they say the remaining passengers and crew are presumed dead. South Korean officials say hundreds of emergency personnel are at the crash site to help identify the remaining victims, and to record the exact locations where people died. Now, the Boeing 737 800 jet crash landed at Muan International Airport on Sunday morning. Firefighters believe the incident was caused by a landing gear malfunction. Now, this video shows the plane dragging along the runway with no landing gear in sight, and moments later, the plane burst into flames. CNN correspondent Mike Valerio is following this breaking news from Seoul. So, Mike, I understand were getting a few more details about what might have happened. Take us through what we know.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Kim. Thanks for having me on CNN. Happy holidays everybody, and fly safe.From what we know so far, you know, when you got a bird strike on the 737, the 737 has got redundancies and backups and hydraulics. So you've got two engines running hydraulic systems. So even if you've got a bird strike on one engine, the second hydraulic system takes over and gives you your -- your hydraulics to operate your landing gear. And even if that fails, you have something called a ram air turbine. Okay? So fundamentally the 737 is a pretty well designed aircraft. And obviously, Boeing has spent billions of dollars on that aircraft. The bigger issue here is, is what caused that uncontrolled rapid descent. Now, what we know so far, Kim, is that we're dealing with eyewitness reports and hearsay. And unless, you know, we get that flight data recorder or the FDR, the CVR, your pitch that together also get hold of the ATC tapes, ADS-B out data, put that in over into a room. Get guys to start looking at it at it. You know, we're not going to know what actually went wrong. You know the video says he came down with the landing gear. His gear was up. His flaps were not deployed. And he came -- I mean, from what we know, he came pretty fast. So obviously he, you know, he's -- he's broken a rapid descent over there and he slammed the aircraft down on the runway. But again, again, we're speculating. And you know, let's respect the dead. There are a lot of lives lost. The crews know more. And I think the faster we get into an independent investigation, and because this is a Boeing -- you know, Boeing needs to get involved with this. And so does the FAA because something like this. You never hear of a Boeing 737 having such, you know, incidents or such a crash for that matter.",

You know, when you're assumed or presumed someone dead, sometimes, sadly or unfortunately, they're not. And you've got to get them immediate medical attention because as much information that you can get from passengers on board and survivors is absolutely critical to piecing together, that puzzle together to figure out what went wrong.And, you know, from what we're seeing so far is that, you know, if you look at the end of the runway, you are going to have that kind of equipment. But what it appears that this guy turned back and he said, look, I'm going to bring the airplane down now, okay? And get me any spot to land. And he did that. And I guess he overshot from what we know so far from the video, Kim, is he overshot. And when he overshot, you know, you got no braking, you got no landing gear, you can't pull your thrust reverser back, so it's never going to -- you're never going to bring your aircraft to a complete halt or stop. And that's what led him to ramp the aircraft into the wall and into the ground equipment.",

I mean, you know, they throw everything at you. engine failure, bird strike, you know, you know, doors blowing out, you know?I mean, pretty much, you know, the worst that can happen. And pilots are trained to bring an aircraft down with the highest level of safety procedures. And, you know, everything is taught to you by the book. You're not there to do your own thing. And, you know, clearly, from what we know so far, is that the pilots brought the aircraft down, even if the aircraft was completely incapacitated. So you had an approach, you had a touchdown and everything was going fine from what we saw from the video. But you know, you know, tough luck. He just couldn't stop the aircraft in time. And -- and you know what we would really establish. And I think what's going to be a quick fix here is that once we get the cockpit tapes out, the CVR and the ATC tapes and the DFDR, I think all of those should -- should tell us, at least initially, what went wrong. And the larger part of the investigation is when we start piecing the -- you know, start piecing the aircraft together in a hangar. That's when we know why did certain things didn't work with that aircraft? You know, why did they have to come in at that high speed? Why did the engines completely shut off? Was it one? Was it duel? So there are just so many questions right now. And, Kim, as I said before, let's respect the dead. You know, were dealing with a whole lot of people who have lost their lives, and as much as least speculation. But this is important. And I think, you know, we've got to wake those FAA guys out of the -- you know, out of their holiday spirit and get them down over to Korea, because this is critical and this has to be sorted now.",

But the second thing that really concerns me is that these aircraft, the 737, one of the most reliable and well used aircraft, not only in the United States but in Europe, and it is capable of landing without landing gear down and in an emergency situation like this.My concern is that after it touches down, that there are blockades and items on near the runway that they collided with that may have caused this severe explosion once it hit the ground. So a well-designed airport would not have had any kind of blockades there. The aircraft could have landed and slide off the runway onto the grass, and it should not have been able to -- it should not have had any interference with these blockades. So that would be the first thing. As an investigator I would be looking at is certainly this tragic loss of life, perhaps could have been avoided had the airport been designed and prepared for this type of emergency landing.",

There are still manual ways to do this, right? And as you say, these aircraft are designed so you can possibly land it without that.And also, there have been so many advances in safety that, you know, we don't often see these aircraft sort of, you know, exploding in flames like this, unless, of course, as you say, it hits an object. So certainly there are all these questions. What about the idea of bird strikes? That's something that was mentioned as well. Does that seem like it might be a cause here?",

The other thing to think about is that if an -- if a pilot knows that they're going to have to land in an emergency situation without the landing gear, they radio head to the airport, and the airport can do some things to prepare for that. They can put foam on the runway, they can have emergency vehicles standing by so that when the aircraft does have this emergency landing.So it appears to me that no one really is really aware of the fact, at least on the ground, that the aircraft was landing without the landing gear down. So that indicates to me that possibly it was an oversight during the emergency landing to not deploy the landing gear. That's one of the things that I would be looking at again, as an investigator. But again, I really am hedging on speculating on the cause, and it -- certainly, this isn't the time to do that. The time now is to make sure that there's any survivors that are dealt with and removed from the aircraft, if possible.",

With the landing gear up, and also to find out why it was making an emergency landing. Also look to see if there was any calls ahead of time to notify the airport what's going on. So that would be my first step.The second would be the flight data recorder itself, to tell me what was going on with the systems on board the aircraft. You have to rule those things out first, if there was something that failed on the aircraft. And as you mentioned, Boeing and the NTSB will most likely be there at the investigation as well to determine if there's anything specific -- anything beyond that specific aircraft that needs to be dealt with, flight -- fleet-wide, which would be done immediately. So that's some of the communication concerns that the NTSB or the investigators there would have to communicate immediately to see if there's any other things that we need to do with the rest of the fleet.",
