Look at that little wobble that it did at some point yesterday, then it kind of a straight line, but even just a couple of hours ago, there's another one, there's another wobble, so its been doing these little tracks to one side and treks to the other.When it comes to the shape of Tampa Bay that is incredibly important. This is the center line forecast for where the eye will go. We've seen the impacts, of course, the entire peninsula because the storm is 300 miles wide at this point. But when it comes to that exact point of landfall, for the eye, that will really determine where some of the greatest storm surge is. And again, when it comes to the storm surge, that's the highest strongest winds in the eye of the storm pushing that ocean inland, right? And when it's three feet, it gets to the bottom of your house, but a lot of these places again, were looking at 8, 10, 13 feet of storm surge and they take out a lot of homes in this area. When it comes to Tampa Bay specifically, it's because of the way that the bay is shaped, right? So in Tampa's worst-case scenario, that exact eye would be either right up against Tampa Bay or maybe a little bit to the north. Then you'll have those onshore winds funnel straight into the bay and take the worst the storm surge, most of the ocean straight into the back. If that eye goes a little bit to the south, again, doesn't have to be by much, right? We're not talking about it, a miss in the forecast, right? We're talking about it just going a couple of miles to the south. Now, all of a sudden, because of the way that the hurricane rotates, you have an offshore wind in Tampa Bay. So, that sends the water is receding and since the worst of the storm surge into those places to the sound like the hurricane director was talking about you know, into places like Port Charlotte you know, Venice and Sarasota area. But again, I want to emphasize we are looking at the entire coast, seeing storm surge. What were talking about here is the difference of the -- you know, the 12 feet, the nine feet, you know, some of those bigger, bigger numbers. That's where we're talking about here, Jake.",

There's moments of just intense winds -- wind gusts, just slapping you in the face this rain of flying sideways, hitting you right in the face and it's serious.I mean, we're looking at here a storm surge expectation of forecasted potentially eight to 12 feet for the Tampa Bay. This is the Hillsborough Bay which is connected to the Tampa Bay. Here's the Tampa General Hospital, the regions only level one trauma center. I mean, they saw something unprecedented during Helene and that's the water is actually reaching up to the walls. That was around five to six feet. If these tracks verify and you're looking at eight to 12 feet, the worst-case scenario, that would be unprecedented significant storm surge for the Tampa Bay area. That's what nobody wants to see. I spoke with Sheriff Chad Chronisster. He's saying that the water and the debris is what is keeping him up tonight? He's so concerned for citizens here, especially those who have not evacuated. And the debris in particular, he is worried about his first responders. He's saying that contractors dropped the ball and clearing out all this debris from Helene out of the area. And now he's worried these will be flying projectiles that could harm people or in the water where his rescuers hot, got to go to get access to people they could hit something unexpected. So he's keeping a very close eye on this, but very, very concerned -- Jake.",

When that comes, it takes the military to step in and help.The problem is you're now taking away for military readiness, national security issue number one. Number two, in places like the Middle East, when a drought ensues, an agriculture is broken, populations become unsettled. Migration ensued. Conflict results. And then third and finally, Jake, sea level rising. Distinct from the big storms, the sea levels are rising because of global warming and the melting of the ice caps. So as though sea levels rise, our national security bases, like Norfolk, for example, are going to be slowly taken away from us. So this is a huge national security threat on every level we ought to pay attention to it for many reasons. But national security, you bet.",
