You are looking at live pictures here of the Fulton County courthouse where Donald Trump's lawyers just finished meeting with the Fulton County D.A.'s office. At that meeting, Trump's lawyers agreed to a $200,000 bond as part of the former president's release conditions when he surrenders to face charges over his effort to overturn Georgia's 2020 election results. We are also learning details about the release conditions for at least two of Trump's co-defendants, former Trump attorney John Eastman who's agreed to pay a $100,000 bond and former poll watcher Scott Hall who agreed to a $10,000 bond. Trump is expected to turn himself in on either Thursday or Friday which, of course, will be just hours after the first Republican debate. Eight Republican hopefuls expected to share that stage Wednesday night, but overshadowing their appearance, the frontrunner who won't be there. Donald Trump is choosing to skip the big event, a decision he's made before, but it still is one that remains extremely rare in U.S. politics. Also rare? A candidate who's facing 91 criminal charges, a number of firsts in this 2024 cycle. Let's begin our coverage this afternoon with CNN's Paula Reid who is in Fulton County, Georgia, in front of the courthouse there. So, Paula, what more do we know about this agreement for Trump's release conditions?",

Even reposting is barred. That's notable, Erica, that's the first time we've seen it and it's significant especially because we've seen the former president use his social media accounts to go after judges, district attorneys, even to discuss the grand jury in this case.Now, we know all of the defendants in this case, including former President Trump, have to turn themselves in by Friday of this week. But before you can surrender, you need to negotiate your bond agreement which is why the former president's legal team came down here to Fulton County to meet with the district attorney and try to hash out some of the details.",

He has agreed to $100,000 bond. He was really the first one -- the first bond agreement that we saw appear today. Also, one of the most notable names among this list. Another co- defendant, Scott Hall, a bail bondsman himself, he has posted $10,000 bond. Now, both of them are prohibited from talking to any other defendants in this case.

There's some room for interpretation. So if I'm in the D.A.'s shoes here, I want to be as explicit as possible.We know what Donald Trump does. He does this over and over again. He tweets or Truth Socials out things in coded language and sometimes he does in fact tend to repost things that others have posted and then try to distance them.

Mug shots are really only in case someone flees or needs to be identified by the public. I don't think either of those things would be an issue for Donald Trump. And If I'm in Donald Trump attorney's shoes here, I'm not sure where I would come out on this. On the one hand, it's humiliating, let's just be honest, to have a mug shot taken.

They investigated potential illegal lobbying, money laundering, tax evasion and gun possession charge but at a certain point this year, they were ready to end the investigation with no criminal charges. However, things at a certain point changed. And what \"The Times\" report is highlighting is the fact that that was when IRS whistleblowers decided to emerge and go public with their accusations that the DOJ was treating Hunter Biden with kid gloves, going soft on the president's son possibly because of political considerations. And it was around that time, Erica, when according to this report prosecutors decided to drive a harder bargain and insist that Hunter Biden plead guilty to something. Eventually, the arrangement was for him to plead guilty to two federal tax misdemeanors. That's what they took to a judge last month as their plan to resolve the case. But, of course, as you know, that collapsed in front of the judge when she scrutinized it and, Erica, there is still no deal.",

Marshall just laid it out. We've now seen it play out two or three separate times. DOJ moves toward a very lenient disposition, they are just about to lock in that lenient disposition, and then there is arises pressure either through whistleblower testimony or public scrutiny and then the DOJ backs off saying now that it is called off, we'll try to up it a bit. And that happened again. And then they got all the way to appointing special counsel -- the same guy who's been presiding over the case for five-plus years already.

So, yes, there is certainly a deep fundamental questions need to be asked of these candidates as we get to the point where we have to figure out are these ideas simply a headline wide and a inch deep when we're looking down the barrel of a potential Third World War, when we have the first war of expansion in Europe since World War II as it relates to Ukraine and all the other myriad issues facing America including the fentanyl streaming across our southern border killing over 70,000 Americans each and every year.",

And that has real power and it will be very difficult for any of those folks to pierce it. I think only way is to courageously speak the truth. You've seen Mike Pence who is 6 percent in the polls but I give him a ton of credit because he stands up courageously and says the truth is the Constitution did not give me that power to pick the president.
