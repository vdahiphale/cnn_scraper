      "sentences": "Well, Audie, one thing they're not doing is attacking Donald Trump over these 14th Amendment challenges that were just discussed. In fact, they've actually defended the former president in light of what's happened in Maine and Colorado. But they have been focused on attacking each other and we have seen that consistently in the weeks leading up to the end of 2023 and as the calendar turns to 2024.For DeSantis and Haley, neither one of them were able to come out of 2023 as the clear alternative to Donald Trump and so now their mission in 2024 is to push the other out of the race or at least neutralize them in some way so they can start to solidify a coalition of the non- Trump supporters going into these caucuses and early nominating states. DeSantis -- that means focusing heavily on Iowa. This is a state that he put a lot of money, time, and attention into. And I think short of a close second-place finish would be disappointing for his team and leave a lot of questions about his viability going forward. For Haley, she doesn't necessarily need a great showing in Iowa. A strong surprising finish to this there would show that she has some momentum going into New Hampshire, which is a state that she has put a lot more effort into. And then, of course, the frontrunner, Donald Trump -- he will be in Iowa all this weekend, Friday and Saturday, with multiple stops as he continues to ramp up his appearances and give a sense to voters that yes, it's time to vote. It's time to pay attention. It's time to do what you need to do to get me the nomination in 2024.",

They're taking shelter here because their homes have collapsed. They have nowhere to go but to sleep in their cars or this shelter.They're using very thick blankets and mats to stay warm because there's no central heating in this building. There is also no running water. People are taking water from these self-defense forces who are just outside providing this very essential human need to the locals here. We spoke to a couple of people inside the shelter who are just visibly very frightened about the aftershocks that are following after that powerful earthquake. We experienced a couple ourselves just 10 minutes ago when the entire building was shaking. There is also rubble near some of these cement pillars. One of the women we spoke to -- a survivor of the earthquake -- recalled how she thought she was going to die. She was in the middle of celebrating New Year's Day with her family who had come from southern Japan in Osaka to visit her and her mother and they all -- she told me how she would just go under the table to try to essentially just survive this earthquake because she had absolutely no idea what was going on.

But just as obviously, it risks invading privacy interests and dehumanizing the law.\" The 15-page report did not address the court's newly installed Code of Conduct -- the ethics controversy that plagued the justices over the past year -- or the issues tied to the 2024 election.

You have to have a real case there.And a good judge and good staff, they go back and they look to see is that case -- well, they used to not have to act like is that case for real. They used to act -- they used to look at does that case really stand for the proposition that the advocate is making here. Is it really central to this new argument being made here? And in Michael Cohen's case, they weren't even -- you know, they weren't real. They were non-existent. A U.S. District Court Judge Jesse Furman looked up man of them and found that they did not stand for the proposition that Cohen was arguing. And I think in one of them there was, like, not even any case there.

He had only one victim despite the fact that Palm Beach police had found nearly two dozen -- only one victim to testify. And then they brought out her Myspace pages, which like a lot of teenagers probably depicted simulation of drinking and so forth. So he appeared to undermine his own witness, which seems strange.

It is shameful that is occurring. And instead of -- if the governor really, truly wants to deal with this issue he should talk to other senators in his state and actually ask them to work with us. Look, what we're seeing right now is negotiations happening on the Senate side to talk about how do we come up with a bipartisan agreement to deal with border security. There's a reason why the president put that in his emergency ask, right -- in the national security supplemental ask because he thought it was incredibly important. In a couple of weeks, we're about to hit three years -- three years since the president put forward an immigration comprehensive legislation -- put that forward to Congress and nothing was done on it. And the reason why he put that first --",

JEAN-PIERRE:  The president put forth a comprehensive immigration plan because he believed that the system is broken. The immigration system is broken and it's been broken for decades. Now we are having, we believe, a very productive conversation in Congress with senators on how do we move forward in a bipartisan agreement to deal with the border security. That is important. Now, what we hope is that when Congress gets back we'll be able to act and get these things moving forward so we can deal with this issue. We've been in touch with some of those mayors that you talked about -- governors in northern -- in the northern part of the country on dealing with the issue that they're dealing with on the ground. And we have provided resources to them and we're going to continue to have those conversations. But again, Congress needs to act. The president took this very seriously on day one.",
