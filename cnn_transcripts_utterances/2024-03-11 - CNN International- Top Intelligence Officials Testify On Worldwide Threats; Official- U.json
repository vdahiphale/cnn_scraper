Once a year, America's top intelligence officials testified before the U.S. Senate about what they see as the greatest foreign and domestic threats to U.S. national security, and the security of its allies. That day is today. And the hearing just getting underway on Capitol Hill briefing lawmakers, as you can see, there, the director of national intelligence also briefing the heads of the CIA, FBI, NSA, and more. This is Avril Haines, director of national intelligence, giving her opening statement. Let's listen.",

This is an annual event by top U.S. intelligence officials where they outlined the greatest threats to security of the United States and its allies around the world.A few highlights there. She says without continued U.S. military assistance, in her words, it's hard to imagine how Ukraine can maintain its defense going forward. She also spoke a great deal about the threat from Russia and China -- China to U.S. interests and increasing links between not just Russia and China, but other middle powers led by North Korea and Iran. Joining me now to discuss, CNN global affairs analyst Kim Dozier, and CNN national security analyst and also \"New York Times\" correspondent -- national security correspondent, David Sanger. Good to have you all here. David, as you and I were sitting here watching together, our ears perked up to that moment when she spoke, Avril Haines, about that growing on, if you know, quite what to call it an alliance, but certainly cooperative body of Russia, China, North Korean and Iran. DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: That's right, Jim. And I noted two things about this. First of all, is last year, you didn't hear much on this topic almost none. And last year, in fact, I remember asking President Biden at a news conference whether or not there was into his mind a worrying link between Russia and China, and in this realm of cooperation. And he said no, I didn't really think those two could get -- to get together.",

As I lay out in the new book, \"The Return of Great Powers\", which is published tomorrow, what led the Biden administration to reach such a startling assessment was not one indicator but a collection of developments, analysis, and crucially, highly sensitive new intelligence, including communications among Russian commanders discussing such a nuclear strike. We had to plan so that we were in the best possible position in case this no longer unthinkable event actually took place, a senior U.S. administration official told me.

I wonder what did you know at the time, and did you share those concerns? MARKAROVAundeniable when 24th of February, when Russia attacked us. And after that, that not only we have seen all the atrocities on the ground, but I want to remind that very early on, they have occupied the Chernobyl station and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear station. And the Zaporizhzhia nuclear station remains occupied. And as we have seen in Bucha and other places, there is no red lines. So, yes, we have monitored very carefully, especially all the crimes that Russia was doing around the nuclear stations, attacking them, putting them under risk. But then I want to remind you that in October '22, that's when Russia started spreading false information and criminal -- war criminal Shoigu even started calling everyone saying that Ukraine will drop a dirty bomb or something like this. So we also wanted to make very public that this is false. This is lie from Russia. And, of course, we couldn't exclude that they might be contemplating something bad. But look, we see all these atrocities and horrible stuff on the ground and they already war criminals thousands, you know, thousands -- tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands times.

My premiums are too expensive. And so as long as that persists, I think there's going to be an argument for Republicans to make that there could be health care reforms that need to be addressed.

I mean, Republicans have always believed that in any entitlement program system for all the entitlements, that there is a tremendous amount of waste, fraud, and abuse, and all Republican presidential candidates have always wanted to try to do more to get rid of that.I mean, as it relates to Social Security and Medicare for Donald Trump, he changed the paradigm in the Republican Party. Remember, he is the one going all the way back to 2016, who totally rejected congressional Republican efforts to do any kind of entitled reform at all. I mean, he really has changed the party orthodoxy on this. So, no, I don't think he's going to be running on cutting Social Security and Medicare because he's the person who's frankly done a 180 on the Republican platform on that topic.",

We've seen that historically happened and you can either look at that as a good thing or a bad thing. I think in this particular case and in frankly, a lot of issues that he talks about, whenever he says he's going to do something like cutting Social Security and Medicare, we should take him at his word. We should take that very seriously.And I bet you, that President Biden is going to also take that very seriously and talk about this very heavily on the campaign trail. He's going to go into towns and communities across the country and make it clear that again, this is a giant distinction between him and Donald Trump. That Joe Biden wants to protect your Social Security and your Medicare, and so do Democrats, by the way. Republicans and Donald Trump do not. It's going to -- it's a clear distinction.

This is really around the world tour, one that really stood out to me, Jim, from the -- from the unclassified report that the intelligence community produces as sort of part of this annual exercise was about Chinese support for Russia and its war for Ukraine.The intelligence community telling -- telling lawmakers in this unclassified report that they now believe that China has tripled its export of goods with potential military use to Russia for -- that it has used in its conflict in Ukraine. Also hearing from intelligence leaders as part of this report how they view Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's potential political future as the conflict in Gaza continues to rage. The intel community writing in this report and telling lawmakers that they at this point believe that Netanyahu is quote, via ability as a leader is, quote, in jeopardy. The other big headline here that I think is sort of standing out to me, is that the intel community also really pushing for ongoing aid to Ukraine. You heard from director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, as she made a sort of unusual plea to lawmakers here in her for opening remarks saying, look, if the United States does not continue to provide the kind of support to Ukraine that is envisioned in this $60 billion aid bill that's currently stalled before Congress that its going to be really difficult for Ukraine to maintain the gains that its made. So really bouncing from a lot of different topics here. But lawmakers have limited amount of time with these intel leaders and they're going to try to get as much as they can into this appearance.",
