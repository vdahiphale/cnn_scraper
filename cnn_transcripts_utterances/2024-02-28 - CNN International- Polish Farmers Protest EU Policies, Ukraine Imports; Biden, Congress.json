Donald Trump banked another win with the Michigan primary and President Joe Biden took the Democratic contest by a wide margin. However, a significant number of voters did cast their ballots for uncommitted in protest against his support for Israel. Mexico's most dangerous active volcano spewed ash and smoke into the sky on Tuesday, causing some flight cancellations at Mexico City's main airport. But authorities say there's currently no risk for people who are living in the area. And the Bank of England has just unveiled banknotes featuring the portrait of King Charles III. The new currency will enter circulation in Britain starting June 5th. The new notes featuring the king will only be printed to replace those that are worn and a bit scruffy, we're told.",

Let's take a listen to GOP leader Mitch McConnell. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), U.S. SENATE MINORITY LEADER: I think it's pretty safe to say we all agree we need to avoid a government shutdown. Speaker was optimistic that they'll be able to move forward first with the four bills. And under no circumstances does anybody want to shut the government down.

At issue is that Speaker Mike Johnson has been under immense pressure from his right flank to fight for a number of conservative policy wins. And we're told that some of the last-minute hang ups have revolved around WIC, which is the Women, Infants and Children program, as well as provisions related to guns and veterans and background checks.But really, at this point, the ball is seen as in Speaker Mike Johnson's court, as you have Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer, Hakeem Jeffries all urging him to drop demands and try to come up with as clean as legislation as possible, clean bipartisan agreement. That is what they are pushing for. Now, if a deal does come together within the next 24 to 48 hours, under that scenario, the House would act first. It would then kick over to the Senate. But in order to move quickly, it would require unanimous cooperation from the Senate. So even if a deal comes together soon, there's a chance that they're going to need a very short-term stopgap spending bill or else stumble into a partial government shutdown. And just to note here, those first four government funding bills are thought to be among the easiest. There are even more complicated bills that are running out of money next Friday. So all of this at this point, expected to come down to the wire. Melanie Zanona, CNN Capitol Hill.

      "sentences": "February is supposed to be the biggest and busiest month here at Campo Felice ski resort in the Apennine Mountains in central Italy, not this year. As you see behind me, all of these mountains that are brown are supposed to be covered with snow. This year, instead, there just hasn't been the snow. The only snow you see here was made with artificial snow machines.NADEAU (voice-over): The human-caused climate crisis has resulted in snow loss across the northern hemisphere. Here, more than 4,400 feet above sea level, where snow is disappearing fast, people are questioning how much longer skiing can go on. This year, the influence of El Nino means temperatures have been even higher than usual. Normally, on a Sunday in February, you'd have 6,000 people skiing on these slopes. This year, only four of the 14th slopes were open. Of the 250 people who work here normally, only 50 have been able to keep their jobs, because the season has been so mild and short. This ski resort has been in Andrea Lallini's family for 23 years. First, his father and now, he and his brother, Luca, run it. He says the seasons have been getting shorter over the years. He tells us the problem is lack of precipitation, plus it has never gotten cold. This year, winter barely even arrived, he says. They tell us that in the 1980s and 1090s, artificial snow wasn't necessary. There was plenty of the natural stuff to go around. This year, snow machines were the resort's only option. But even that is problematic because, last summer, there was very little rain and lakes like this one ran dry. There was no water to make snow and even fake snow melts if it is too warm. It's a vicious cycle, he says. And non-skiers feel the impact too. Gennarino Di Stefano is the mayor of Rocca di Cambio. He says the town's livelihood revolves around this ski resort and those nearby. The changing climate is having a ripple effect on the economy. GENNARINO DI STEFANO, MAYOR OF ROCCA DI CAMBIO, ITALY (through translator): Every town has a good number of people who come here to work from the ski instructors, the managers of the bars, the restaurants, the people who run the ski lifts. Many people are not working. NADEAU (voice-over): And for ski instructors like Isidoro Franceschi, the lack of snow and shorter season means these young competitive skiers have to go elsewhere to train. ISIDORO FRANCESCHI, HEAD SKI INSTRUCTOR AT CAMPO FELICE (through translator): For those of us who have always worked in this area, it is heartbreaking to see nature spoiled like this. It isn't good. NADEAU (voice-over): As skiers turn to resorts at higher elevations where there's more snow, skiing in places like this will soon be wiped out for good. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Campo Felice, Italy.

Do you remember when the Russians said it was fake and the bodies were fake? And that the Ukrainians had killed people themselves? He asked me. When we seize the phones, we proved to the whole world that it was the Russians who killed people -- Ukrainians. Ruslan says the war crimes investigations continue, using a trove of evidence from multiple cameras, phones, and other recordings. But when they inform the Russian soldiers, they identify, they don't cooperate. And Father Andriy tells us the awful truth is, that bodies are still being discovered today. Two years on. From time to time, we find someone by accident, he says. The Russians had hidden their bodies somewhere and we find them. So, unfortunately, the number of people who died is increasing.
