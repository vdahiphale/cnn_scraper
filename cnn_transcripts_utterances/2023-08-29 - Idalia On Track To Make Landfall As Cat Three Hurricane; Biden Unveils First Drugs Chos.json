One of the things that was really interesting there that the governor is warning about is the potential -- the potential for as this storm is heading there up into kind of that Big Bend area that catcher's mitt, we've heard it referred to, there is a potential for the storm to make a little bit of a left turn and head more towards Tallahassee.His point there is that don't think that if you are there in the Panhandle, you are there in Northern Florida that you are out of trouble. He's saying everyone should be prepared in case this storm does make a turn. And he's telling people, look, you should be prepared to lose power and you need to get out of the way of the storm surge. You don't have to go far but you have to get far enough away to get out of that storm surge. 10 to 15 feet in some areas. We're talking about a lot of water. And that water can be very deadly. We've got our CNN team tracking every angle of the storm. I want to start with CNN's Chad Myers, who was in the weather center. Chad, we heard a lot of warnings, they're very good warnings including that one about generators. You cannot operate a generator inside of your house. And so many times we see people making it through the storm and afterwards, that is actually the thing that will get them in trouble. So, certainly a good warning there. But tell us what you're tracking.",

And you know, for the people whose houses were got -- were flooded, who may not have powered out for days or weeks, you know, probably feels like a direct hit. And so, you know, nearly 10,000 people were evacuated late last night. Well, that was the final number we heard. We know now that, you know, most of the western Cuba is without power. Officials working on getting the power back on but that is going to be a very slow process. And flooding throughout much of (INAUDIBLE) from Havana west of this island.

And I can show you exactly the concern going into the storm out here. You can see exactly where the water level is right now. We expect that this time tomorrow, we'll have all of this storm surge, we're going to have all of this rain and then we're also going to have to figure in high tide. And so you can see why the concern is that as this hurricane makes its way off the coast of the Tampa Bay area, we are going to experience some sort of flooding. Tampa General Hospital, just on the other side of where we are, they have already put up their flood gates. We're told that that can handle a storm surge of up to 15 feet. Again, we're expecting maybe half of that to take place. There are two mandatory evacuation orders that have gone out in this part of the state. Over in Pinellas County, the St. Pete Clearwater area, there was one mandatory evacuation order there. The other is right here in Hillsborough County, which is home to the Tampa Bay area. The city's mayor had a news conference earlier today where she talked about some of these preparations that are now underway. Here's a bit of what she said.

And in comparison, another powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl is about one hundred times more potent than morphine.So, that's a significant difference here. And what we have learned in this new study that just came out today, Jim. Researchers looked at data on emergency department patients who were hospitalized for an overdose. And they found that those patients who were using Nitazines at the time of their overdose actually needed more doses of a medication called Naloxone to treat their overdose in comparison with patients who are using fentanyl. So, specifically, the study found about 36 percent of fentanyl patients received two or more doses of Naloxone compared with about 67 percent of Nitazine patients. So the takeaway here, Jim, is that it -- if clinicians see more of these Nitazine patients, there is this possibility that they may need more doses of Naloxone because of our understanding of really the potency here when it comes to Nitazines, Jim.",
