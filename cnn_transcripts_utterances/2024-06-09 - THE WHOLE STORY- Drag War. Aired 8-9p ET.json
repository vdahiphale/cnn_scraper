Women weren't allowed back then to appear on stage so men dressed up to play the roles of female characters. Drag performances have evolved a lot over the decades, exploding in mainstream popularity in recent years with TV hits like RuPaul's \"Drag Race\". But now it's also become a political target. Republican lawmakers in six states have passed laws aimed at restricting drag performances in places where children are present. The laws have been amended, blocked, or currently being challenged in federal courts. Over the next hour, CNN's Randi Kaye digs into the colorful history of drag and takes a look at how and why it's come under attack. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It blocks venues or publicly permitted events from admitting children to an adult live performance which according to the law includes any performance that quote, depicts or simulates the lewd exposure of prosthetic or imitation genitals or breasts. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): There are these like, you know, these drag shows. It's sexually explicit in what they're doing.
