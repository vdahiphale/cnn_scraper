This morning, you're looking at these live pictures now. They're out of airports all across the country, Atlanta, all over the U.S., as major -- another major air travel disruption is happening across the USA. Technical outage forcing the FAA to ground all domestic departures until 9So as we continue on with the breaking news here, we want to get straight to CNN's aviation correspondent, that is Pete Muntean. He joins us now from Reagan. Pete, good morning to you. Thank you for joining. As we are hearing now, at least from our own David Urban, who is I think at the very same -- he is at the very same airport that you're at. His flight has been canceled. Are we seeing cancellations happening? And are they moving -- the FAA is saying the system is down, or they're checking on the system and they're going to ground everything until 9:00 a.m. Are cancellations starting? And are they going to move back that 9:00 a.m. time that they have put in place now?",

      "sentences": "We are mostly seeing delays right now, Don. I just took a breeze by the departures and arrivals board here at Reagan National Airport. We're seeing the delays go up here. We're also seeing them go up around the country. Just check Flight Aware. The delays keep going up by the moment, 2,500 delays across the country right now.We've seen that go up by about 1,000 delays in the last hour. Just before 7:00 a.m. it was only 400. So this is a huge, widespread effect nationwide because there is now a nationwide ground stop in place from the Federal Aviation Administration. That means that flights are not able to depart from the airports they are leave from. That is a huge impact, and it's impacting every airline. The airlines are being told to stop all domestic departures because of the system outages. It's behind the scenes at the FAA. It's called the Notice to Air Missions System. It used to be called the Notice to Airmen System. Now it's been changed to Notice to Air Missions. NOTAMS is the term for the acronym. And that means that pilots cannot get this critical information that they need to take off. These are things like whether or not runways are open or closed, whether or not radio navigational aids that pilots that need to land, whether or not those are in place and in position and working properly. So this is having a huge ripple affect across the U.S., and the FAA says it is working to deal with this as swiftly as possible. It is trying to repopulate the system, it says, but it says there is no evidence so far of a cyberattack. That's just in from the White House press secretary. We know that President Biden has been briefed about this issue. We know that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg is also in touch with the FAA about this. Of course, a lot of frustrated passengers at airports across the country. We were seeing some delays, some departures and arrivals earlier today, but now that this nationwide ground stop is in place, that makes it officials, no flights leaving U.S. airports until the issue is resolved. NOTAMS are essentially the thing that pilots need to read before the fly. It's Bible and verse in the federal aviation regulations. There has never been an issue like this in the airspace system that I have seen. I've been flying pilots since 2007, I've been around airplanes my entire life. Both of my parents were pilots, I'm a flight instructor. There has never been something like this in the national air system before. This is a mega impact. It cannot be understated how big of an impact this will have. Even if this is able to be fixed by the FAA soon, there will likely still be a ripple effect. We've seen that behind the scenes. Think about the Southwest issue just a few weeks ago when they had back end infrastructure issues that caused their schedule to meltdown, and that happened for days and days. So we will see if the FAA is able to get the system back online and what the lingering impact of this will be, Don.",

      "sentences": "What happens now is, what really should have been happening all along. Now when the FAA built out, and we're talking several decades ago when the plan hatched and they started building out the system to make everything electronic, a seamless electronic system where you get the information before you fly, which is what a NOTAM is. Think of it as a great big bulletin board in the sky where every airport, every flight route, every piece of information out there about tweaks in the system, what runway is in use, if there are runway lights out, if you have a different minimum you have to follow. If any airport has something that's a little bit unusual from what the typical is in the published approach, for example, you have to check that before you fly. It's one of the several things you have to check before you fly.So Pete is right. So if the planes were already in the air, they've already checked this, and they can get the information that they need to get safely down by communicating with air traffic control at the in route center. So they can pass the information on to them. But it's a lot of information. Think about that, every piece of information from every airport or every flight route or anything that pilots report can be posted as well. And that was supposed to be run by a big computer system and they were supposed to have three systems, one to be running, one for maintenance, and one for backup. Over the years it's been very expensive. And by the way, these are supposed to be run by contractors, and the contractors are supposed to keep these up and running at all times. So there's a lot of questions here as who and why this failed. In the olden days when we relied on paper and telephones the flights would go on, because that's how you used to check them. Now it's literally impossible because everything is by computer, and it seamlessly goes into your computerized flight program. And that's why there's so much trouble for this one system being down.",

      "speaker": "SCHIAVO",
      "sentences": "The people in the air -- first of all, you're going to be safe because your pilots checked this, the pilot is required by law to check this. Generally, aviation pilots like me, they check this. Everyone checks it before you take off. You're safe in the air and air traffic control will get you down. Why? Because your aircraft and pilots are communicating with air traffic control. The ground stop for people on the ground this isn't good news, but you're on the ground keeping people in the air safe, so nothing happens to them. So people in the air you're all safe.But people at home are wondering, because anyone who uses computers, which is everybody in the world, wonder if you can have computer bulletin boards for every kind of recipe there is in the world and hundreds of millions of dog pictures and cat pictures, why can't you get your computer bulletin board for airplanes up and running? That's the biggest question of all. Computer bulletin board, which is kind of what this is, not exactly, is not a high-tech operation. So in the past when the FAA has had computer outages -- FAA was caused by a fire at a facility. They've already said this is a problem that they're just -- they're fixing the system and they're rebooting. So we know it's not some kind of -- fire -- but there are a lot of different causes. But this is not -- this is not the most high-tech part of the air traffic control system. Things like collision avoidance and all the scheduling, et cetera, can be more complicated. But I think in the end we'll find out this was a glitch, programming code, error code, because remember, when the FAA was developing this system, and this was decades ago, they literally had 5 million computer code glitches they didn't quite know how to solve. So things have improved, but even a few lines of code can mess up the system.",

And White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a tweet that so far they have not seen any evidence of a cyberattack but that the president has asked the Department of Transportation to conduct an investigation into how exactly this all played out. White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain also said they expect to get further updates from Secretary Buttigieg a bit later this morning. But clearly this is presenting a huge logistical headache for airlines and so many travelers across the country. It's something the White House will continue to monitor over the course of the day, especially at they try to determine the cause of these outages. Additionally, I should note, that the president made these comments speaking to us out on the South Lawn as he was departing to travel to Walter Reed. He is accompanying first lady Jill Biden there where she is having a surgery to remove a skin legion from her face that was found during a routing skin cancer screening.

And then you see yellow, check-in open. Just in the last few minutes, some of the earlier delayed flights became -- turned into check-in open. Now, some of these open check-ins are for international flights. We've spoken to several passengers who were checking in for international flights, those were never an issue. But we should begin to expect to see this board changing when it comes to these delays. And there was another flight, I believe, to Fort Lauderdale, that was able to -- it showed departed as of about 7:15. So, things may be beginning to be resolved here at Newark. There's not a lot of folks in this terminal. This is partly international flights, partly domestic flights. And you know, some people get the -- get disinformation, they hear there's a problem, and they're going to pause before they come to the airport to see if it's resolved. But it may be that at least in Newark, according to FAA, flights are going to be resuming their departures. And so, we should expect to see a lot of these delays or, you know, a lot of these -- this board changing here, Poppy. HARLOW: That would be great. Athena Jones, thank you very much.

And I was e-mailing with United Airlines, you know, we're complying with that directive, that directive from the FAA to ground all outgoing aircraft until 9:00 a.m. So, this is something where the airlines, the executives, their hands are tied here. They've got planes that are gassed up, fueled up, they've got crews that are ready, they've got routes that they're ready to service, but they have the federal government saying, you can't do it until 9:00 a.m.",

They're seeing these early morning flights have been rolled to a little bit later. So, they have been delayed. But at some point, you start missing connections, right? And then when you miss the connection, that's where the rebooking has to happen.So, what you're hearing from travel experts is go to the app, make sure you're on the app, check the app, reschedule if you can, if you don't need to travel this morning, travel tomorrow, if it's not an urgent trip right now. And, you know, maybe don't leave for the airport right away, if you can just use the app and reschedule for another day to travel if it's not important travel. But you've got millions of people -- millions of people come in and go in here at America's airports. This is a vital artery. And we'd heard from the United Airlines CEO just a couple of months ago, you know, September is usually are kind of a slow month for United. In September, he said was one of the best months they've had for September and years. And that's because, with hybrid work in the U.S., every weekend is a three-day weekend, people are traveling like crazy coming out of sort of the COVID lockdowns and the likes. So, these airlines have been struggling, really, to keep up with so much passenger demand. And today, this is not an airline issue. This is an FAA issue to be very, very clear here. They've got the planes, they've got the staff, they just don't have the clearance to fly it right now.",

And some more flights are departing now from Newark where Athena just was, and from Atlanta, Hartsfield. So, hopefully, that's a sign of what's to come in the next few hours. So, I want to bring in now the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Californa -- California, Eleni Koulakis (PH) is with us -- Kounalakis is with us.Lieutenant Governor, obviously, we booked you to come on and join us, and we appreciate you're here for the weather crisis in your state. And we're going to get to that in a moment. But given this breaking news, could you just address any updates you might have from the state of California, the most populous state in our country, major airports up and down California. How they are dealing with this, and how this is impacting folks? LT. GOV. ELENI KOUNALAKIS (D-CA): Well, Poppy, it's great to be with you. I've been sitting here watching the coverage. It's really extraordinary. I can't remember any circumstance where all of the flights across the country have been grounded for what appears to be a problem with the overall computer system. Here in California, this is going to impact us. We're in an emergency situation right now with the weather, and the storms, and the flooding, and the power outages, mudslides. And so, on top of that, to have our 24 airports which have scheduled flights have all of the flights grounded, is very significant for us here in our state.",

And, you know, we've never really seen anything like this. The state has been experiencing drought for the last four years, and now we have storm upon storm. We've had six storms in the last two weeks. This is the kind of weather that you would get in a year, and we've compressed it just into two weeks. And more significantly, we're looking at more rain over the next week.And already, everything is so wet. We're seeing trees coming down with high winds of 50 to 60 miles an hour. We're looking at a fully saturated ground that can't take any more water. So, in the coming days with more rain coming, we're looking at more flooding, more downed trees, more high winds, more power outages. So, we're very, very concerned about what's to come.",
