      "sentences": "Well John, to be perfectly honest with you, so far, all is quiet. All seems to be pretty much the status quo here outside of the governor's house in Montgomery County. His security detail pretty much looks the same -- looks normal like it was yesterday.And frankly, yesterday seemed like a normal day for a governor of this great commonwealth. He got up here in Montgomery County and drove out to Harrisburg and spent most of the day at the Capitol. He drove back here and didn't respond to our shouted questions. And then he actually shot some hoops with his son outside in the driveway before ultimately heading in. So believe me John, if there are tea leaves out here on the ground to read, we are working to find them. But let me just describe to you a little bit about who we're talking about here just to set the scene. John, we're talking about Josh Shapiro, of course. He's the 48th governor of the state of Pennsylvania. He's actually the third Jewish governor of the state of Pennsylvania. But if he were on the ticket and then he became the vice president, he would be the first Jewish vice president in our nation's history. And Gov. Shapiro is a first-term governor. He just got here -- inaugurated, I should say, in 2023. But he's used that year and a half of being in the governor's office to not only boost his national profile -- you might remember a portion of I-95 collapsed here in Philadelphia -- or not far from here in Philadelphia -- and he made sure to go in there and work to get it reopened within two weeks or so and then ultimately, get that entire highway repaired. He also spoke out heavily about antisemitism in the wake of the October 7 attacks as well, again boosting his national profile. But some of those views that Josh Shapiro has on Israel -- that's also put him into a little bit of the scrutiny machine over the past two weeks as this veepstakes process has gone on. Some progressive folks taking umbrage at some of his past views. But Shapiro, over the past two weeks, has said emphatically he's for a two-state solution and that's a view that he's held over much of his public career. So we've seen a lot of those instances which have gotten him to this place. But the biggest benefit, potentially, that he has to a ticket here with Kamala Harris, his approval -- his favorability ratings, I should say, incredibly high here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. That's one of the biggest reasons why they think he could be an asset in taking this state's 19 electoral votes -- John.",

      "sentences": "Very quiet here as well. We have not seen that telltale sign when a bunch of Secret Service SUVs roll up. We haven't seen anything like that. This is very much the status quo here as well.We were at a fundraiser last night, so we got to see Gov. Tim Walz sort of work the room. And he really keyed in on some three things here. He said that he's really trying to push forward a feeling of joy and a feeling of unity. And he really talked about his experience having come up from becoming a former football coach, high school teacher, and then joining public life in 2006 when he ran and won his first congressional race. And he actually ousted a six-term incumbent Republican in a rural area of Minnesota. And so what he may bring to the table is this ability to bring in voters in rural areas with quite a bit of red -- you know, Republican-leaning voters and be able to bridge that gap. And so, again, he talked about -- quite a bit about unity. About pushing forward a message of joy. And then finally, John, he did reference something that has put him on the national map, certainly, and it's this attack line that he lobbed against President -- former President Trump and the vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket, J.D. Vance, when he called them \"weird.\" That attack line has really taken off, John. And he referenced that and said just to be clear, he was -- what he said was making an observation, but he wanted to be very clear that he was not calling Republicans weird. And he said these are my neighbors. These are people that I love. And what he wants to do is try to push forward the opportunity to have healthy discourse between people -- a very different side to the political aisle in a respectful way. And what he kept saying is a joyful way. So he really wanted to spread a message of joy and unity. But again for people who don't know him, he is in his second term as the governor of Minnesota. He's been in public life since 2006 when he won that first congressional race. And John, notably, he ushered the state through some of its most turbulent times during those protests following the murder of George Floyd in 2020. But right here on the ground as we wait to see if he is the pick, it is very quiet. So we'll keep you posted, John.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Sara, I am learning that Vice President Kamala Harris actually went to bed last night not yet having made a decision on her vice presidential running mate and chose to sleep on this decision for one more night. That, of course, means that decision is going to be made sometime this morning and that she's going to be able to inform that running mate of that decision today as well as, of course, the advisers that are around her.Now, despite that decision not having been made last night, of course, the preparations for that eventual public announcement, not to mention the Philadelphia rally where the two are going to be appearing together for the first time this evening, those have had to continue. And so the campaign, I am told, has actually printed up multiple versions of signs featuring Harris' name as well as the potential multiple running mates that she might be choosing today. Again, the news here is that Vice President Harris did not have a decision on this as of last night when she was going to sleep. She needed an extra night to sleep on this decision and is going to be making that call this morning. Again, when we find out eventually who that choice is going to be, this is just something that we should be keeping in mind. This was a decision that ultimately really came down to the wire really until the final minutes and hours of that decision and the moment where she would have had to make this public. Because again, there is sort of that hard drop deadline of this evening when this rally is going to proceed. We will know as we are talking about that decision, once we know what it is, that it really came down to the wire and it was a decision that she really made at the last minute, Sara. SIDNER:  All right, thank you so much, MJ Lee, with that new bit of information. Joining us now to continue this discussion, Republican strategist and political commentator Joseph Pinion, and former campaign manager for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, Robby Mook. Thank you both for coming in this morning to talk about this. Robby, I'm going to go to you now because obviously, we're just getting this new information that Vice President Harris had to sleep on it. She had not made her pick or made the calls to her pick last night. That ostensibly is happening this morning. We don't know if it's happened yet. If you were going to pick, who do you think best helps her try to win this race against former President Donald Trump? ROBBY MOOK, FORMER CAMPAING MANAGER, HILLARY CLINTON'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN:  Well, I think, and particularly in contrast to when I was doing this for Sec. Clinton in 2016, there was really an embarrassment of riches in terms of the talent that she had to choose from. We have so many more governors than we had eight years ago. And so honestly, I don't think she can go wrong. These are both governors. They're both blue wall governors. And look, Pennsylvania is uniquely important in this race. Those 19 electoral votes that are there are hard to find in other states on the map. So there is something to be said for picking Josh Shapiro because if he can even provide a point or two points advantage that can easily be the margin of victory. We -- that state has gone by less than a point in the last two presidential elections. But honestly, she can't go wrong. These are both very qualified people and I think either would be excellent vice president.",

He has been on the stump, he has been doing interviews, and he has been going after her in different ways, but mostly talking about her personality.This is what he put on Truth Social earlier yesterday where he talked about her name again -- mistakenly putting her name wrong. Kamabla, I think, is how he put it. But here is what he said about -- there it is. Here is what he said about her during an interview. Let's listen to what he said about her running mates versus Kamala Harris herself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  All of the people that she's looking at are considered much better than her. These were people that were thinking about running. They would have run except that they didn't want to go through this roadblock with her and, you know, because you're the vice president. So they wanted to go pick them. And I think virtually, every one of them is considered better, smarter -- would be a better president than her. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

PINION:  Well look, I don't think that President Trump has even been one to mince words with anyone. I would make the argument it is not wise to be attacking Kamala Harris in that manner. I think it is wiser to focus squarely on the issues. What is going on with our southern border. What is happening with the economy as the Dow goes down over 1,000 points yesterday. What is happening with a world torn asunder under the guise of an administration that was supposed to be the return to normal administration. And now, Gaza is ablaze. You have the South China Sea, which is inflamed. You have again, what's happening on our southern border -- not just the migrant crisis but the fentanyl crisis as well. And so these are all the issues that I think are better suited to attack Kamala Harris. She wants to take all the good of the Biden- Harris administration. She wants to pretend none of the bad ever happened. You cannot have it both ways. You have to own the entirety of it or acknowledge that you were in the building but never has he allowed him to do anything.",

She's going to have the convention next week, which will be an important opportunity to roll out what you're -- a lot of what you're talking about. What is that vision she has for the country? What is her plan for the future. And then I'm sure she's going to be giving interviews after that and there will be plenty of time to do that.But I think it does speak to the problem in this race, which is we're seeing across the world, change elections are happening. And I think this is going to be a change election as well. And Donald Trump got a little soft and complacent thinking he could just run against Biden and wouldn't really have to say what he's for. And the thing is if he continues to act the same way he's been acting for the last eight years he's not going to be a change candidate. And Harris has been a breath of fresh air. She's talking about turning the page. But I'd say most importantly, she's focused on the future. That's what I'm eager to hear her talk more about at the convention and in interviews. And Donald Trump -- if he can't talk about the future, if he can't have a hopeful message, he's not going to represent change and he's going to lose this election.",
