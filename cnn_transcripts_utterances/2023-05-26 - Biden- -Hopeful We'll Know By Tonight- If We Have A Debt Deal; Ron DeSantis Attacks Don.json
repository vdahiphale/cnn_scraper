I don't know, maybe they'd raise the interest rate by 1 percent. We owe $31 trillion. 1 percent of that is what $300 billion. There are 300 million Americans. That's $1,000 each, that we'd each be paying, in extra interest, every year, if we default. And that's before we talk about a recession.

Because, as you know, from your own experience, the longer this is on the vine, the more everybody either complains about something they know is in it or comes up with an idea to put something new in it. JOE WALSH, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: And John, it's probably not a good thing, because you know, politicians only react to the deadline. And they wait until the last moment. Look, we always dance this dance. And I was there, when we last danced it, in 2011. They're going to craft a deal. They've probably already crafted the deal. And some on the right won't like it. And some on the left won't like it. And it'll mostly be passed by the majority of Democrats and Republicans. And that will give McCarthy enough cover, I think, that he can say he tried.

They're stuck up on the length of those spending caps, on whether there will be work requirements, for food stamps, other social safety net programs, and the details of permitting reform. Will it be just for fossil fuels? Or will it be for green energy as well? Let me ask you, Congressman Rose, about the work requirements, because both Republicans and Democrats say it's a red line. Republicans say it's a red line for them, they won't vote for it if it's not in there. And a lot of progressives are furious, saying, \"Mr. President, don't you dare.\" How does the outline sound to you? To me, it looks like a traditional old-school Republican deal.

And he made a number of other promises as well, including that he would fight for fiscal 2022 spending levels. And so, it is certainly a possibility that if he agrees to something that falls short of what conservatives are expecting, that he could be threatened, his Speakership could be on the line, here. Now, do I expect the Freedom Caucus to vote for whatever deal comes out? No, they typically do not vote, for these really big compromise deals. They don't usually vote for spending deals. So, it's possible that they could just swallow their -- you know, swallow this deal, vote against it, say they don't like it, put out a statement, and leave Kevin McCarthy alone.

The way that he is going at him ideologically, as you point out, is constantly trying to get to his right. I mean, you can think of Donald Trump, as this kind of Mack Truck rolling down the right lane, of the Republican freeway. And with all these lanes, to his left, and center, DeSantis, is trying to pass him in the shoulder, the six inches of the shoulder, on the right. The problem with that is that the better argument, even in a Republican primary, may be that Donald Trump can promise you all these things, but he can't deliver them, because he can't win again. And by choosing to define himself, to the right of Trump, you already see DeSantis, alienating some donors, and strategists, who thought that he was potentially more electable than Trump. I mean, it kind of undermines the second argument. If you're pinning yourself, into this corner, on all of these issues, can you then turn around and make the case that I am in fact a better vehicle to win back the suburbs of Philadelphia, and Detroit, and Milwaukee, and Atlanta than Trump is?

The charges, brought by the Texas House General Investigating Committee, detail alleged violations, by the A.G., and a request for more than $3 million of public money, to pay a legal settlement, to whistleblowers, who worked as top deputies, in the A.G.'s office. They revolted against Paxton in 2020. There are also bribery charges, with a top campaign donor that involved an alleged affair. In a statement, Paxton says, the allegations are politically motivated, and based on, quote, \"Hearsay and gossip,\" and also added that \"Corrupted politicians in the Texas House,\" are \"Actively destroying Texas' position as the most powerful backstop against the Biden agenda in the entire country.\"",

      "sentences": "Well, let's break it out from outside of Texas, and inside of Texas.Outside of Texas, his significance is exactly what you say. Republican state attorneys general have repeatedly sued the Biden administration, trying to preserve Trump-era policies, or block policies that Biden wants to pursue, particularly on immigration and the environment, but also on the Mifepristone case. And very often, Texas is the lead plaintiff, because that way they can find Trump-appointed district, or other conservative district judges, in Texas, and then have a pipeline for the case to go through the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, which is perhaps the most conservative in the country. And this is something that Republicans have used over and over again. So, Paxton has made himself into a hero, for the MAGA base, in many ways by positioning himself as kind of the tip of the spear, in the legal efforts, to stop Biden. Inside of Texas, it's fascinating, because there is a divide, between the Texas State Senate, and the Texas State House. The State House has generally been considered more pragmatic, somewhat more centrist, although, still under Republican leadership, than the Texas State Senate, which is led by the Lieutenant Governor, Dan Patrick, who was kind of Trump before Trump. And so, the intramural struggle is reflected in this that it's the House pursuing, and unclear whether the Senate will follow up. It is remarkable, though, for this to be coming up, at the end of a session, which has probably been the most conservative, in Texas history, which is saying something, not only a raft of socially- conservative legislation, but also unprecedented measures, being passed, in both chambers, to strip authority, from the increasingly Democratic-leaning large cities, and counties, in the State, including giving the State, authority, to overturn elections, just in Harris County, which is Houston. And so, for this to come, this kind of intramural fighting, in the Republican Party, to come out of the end of a session, that has been so ideologically aggressive, is still somewhat remarkable.",

He sent a letter, about this. \"Based on a review of Speaker Dade Phelan presiding over the House of Representatives in an obviously intoxicated state, I am calling upon the Committee to open\" an \"investigation\" into the Speaker \"for violation of House rules,\" state laws, \"conduct unbecoming his position.\" That we have seen in Washington, like, attack the attackers, or attack the investigators.

It is very hard for him to argue that this is somehow partisan. Again, this whistleblower complaint started with loyal Republican staffers, in his own office, who became alarmed, about his behavior, about the way that he was using the office, allegedly, to cover up, for his friends, and do his friends' bidding, and help them. So, it is between -- this is all between Republicans. There are -- to talk about a liberal faction, in the Texas State Legislature, it doesn't really exist. So, he's clearly trying everything he can.

I just need to out swim John King, right? But seriously, when you're in the water with sharks, you need to remember, as you touched on earlier, in a healthy marine environment, like here, along Plymouth and Cape, where I live, we have lots of sharks. You're often never more than 300 feet away from a living shark. Sharks are integral to ecosystems. They are the pinnacle predators. They're the sign of a healthy ecosystem. With that said, you don't want to be at the wrong side of a shark. So, the best way to avoid injury, is just avoiding those situations, where negative encounters could happen, like going in the water, at low-light levels, during dawn, or dusk, after rainstorms, during the breeding seasons, if there's a big predator prey event. John, you're talking about Cape Cod. I scuba-dive just about every day, in the summertime, when I'm home.

They have a Research vessel called \"Song of the Whale.\" They also, not far from here, they have the Marine Mammal Rescue center. Them, along with the team, from NOAA, and all these other research and conservationists, have discovered that this species is about to disappear. Why? Well, they migrate up, John, from Florida, up into Canada Waters. They do that. They come up here, to feed. And as they're migrating their way up, they give birth, they reproduce, in Florida. They come and feed, in places, like Nova Scotia off of Stellwagen Bank. They're getting hit by container ships, when they migrate into shipping lanes. They're also getting entangled, in fishing gear. So, you're looking at footage, right now. This is a whale that's actually entangled up, in ghost net, and fishing gear. And it takes Herculean efforts, it's actually very dangerous, to try to free these entangled whales. But when you're so endangered, when you're so close to disappearing, every one of these whales matters. Another challenge they're facing John is when they go to Canada, and when they head up to Maine. The Bay of Maine is the fastest warming body of water, on the planet. So, that means they come here to eat. And they have to work so much harder to fill their bellies. So, you add up the climate change, the entanglements with nets, and the shipping lanes, this creature is in a world of hurt. But it's not too late.
