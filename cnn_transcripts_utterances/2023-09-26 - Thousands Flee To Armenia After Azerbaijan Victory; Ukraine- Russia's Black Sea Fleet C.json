CNN's Becky Anderson shows us what they're facing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A mass exodus raising fears for Armenia of ethnic cleansing by Azerbaijan, a charge Baku staunchly denies. So far, thousands of ethnic Armenians have fled the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh into Armenia, a tragic journey they've become all too familiar with. SVETLANA HARAPETYAN, NAGORNO-KARABAKH RESIDENT (through translator): We've had three wars, three times we left and came back. And now we, I don't know. ANDERSON (voice-over): Last week, Azerbaijan forced the surrender of ethnic Armenian fighters in the breakaway disputed region, closing a major chapter in a conflict that has  simmered for decades. But like every war, the horrors don't stop when the fighting abates. Although internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, Nagorno-Karabakh is home to about 120 thousand ethnic Armenians who make up the majority of the population. Over the last three decades, the two countries have fought intense wars over the enclave, with a larger, more powerful Azerbaijani military ceasing increased territory. Russia, the traditional power breaker, says it's been delivering aid to the region's capital, Stepanakert, and that its peacekeepers on the ground will help escort civilians fleeing to Armenia. But despite Moscow's presence, Nagorno- Karabakh has been under a blockade for nine months. Azerbaijan-backed forces blockading the Lachin Corridor, the only road connecting Armenia to the region. Preventing the import of food and aid and separating families and loved ones. On Saturday, just days after the cease-fire was signed, the first convoy of humanitarian aid enter the region from the International Red Cross. [00:05:08] Its members also carrying out medical evacuations. There are still fears aid isn't reaching those who need it most, with thousands here having been surviving with little to no food and fuel for close to a year. And that is why many of those fleeing seem to prefer an uncertain future in Armenia over the bloody and vicious past in their homeland. Becky Anderson, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So people were already in a fairly desperate state. And then since the start of the 24 hour conflict last Tuesday, that's only worsened. The people that I'm speaking to here talk of massive shelling.I met with a woman yesterday who said that her brother was seriously injured and in hospital, but she and her kids have been able to get out. People have taken shelter from the artillery barrage and drone strikes in basements across the city. And then the question was simply how can we get enough fuel together to load up our cars and get out. And that starts to come through when, like, the Red Cross and the Russian peacekeepers here laid on deliveries of petrol and diesel. And since then, people have been taking matters into their own hands and done whatever they can to take them and their families to safety. I sat down with one of the first women to come across, she sat in the back of her brother's four by four, he'd been waiting for her at the checkpoint. She brought her two young kids with her and they just sat in the back of the car, and while the kids ate chocolate bars, something they'd not had for a very long time, she just wept and said, you know, we're here. And that comes with a lot of uncertainty, because people are not just leaving their homes and their homeland, they're leaving their livelihoods as well in many cases. Farms, machinery, equipment, things that people made a living off. Those are no longer available to them and they now are in a country that is incredibly tense politically and its relationships with its neighbor, Azerbaijan. And there's no clear sense of what's going to happen in the long term for people who need housing, schools, and jobs.",

It happened in a Friday attack on Sevastopol in Russian annex Crimea. Ukraine's military says Russia is using the peninsula as a logistics hub, and operation \"Crab Trap\" targeted a senior leadership meeting.Viktor Sokolov reportedly took command of the Black Sea Fleet in August of last year. Moscow has not confirmed his death and CNN cannot independently verify Ukraine's claim. The report comes as Russia launched more than two dozen drones and missiles and two supersonic missiles at the Ukrainian port of Odesa. Ukraine says the port infrastructure and an abandoned hotel were seriously damaged. More now from CNN's senior international correspondent, Sam Kiley. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukraine dismissed this as a pathetic attempt at retaliation. A Russian bombardment of the port city of Odesa, with drones and long-range missiles. Two warehouse workers were killed, and abandoned hotels smashed in what could have been an almost routine attack by Russia, but for this. Kyiv now claims to have killed the commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet, admiral Viktor Sokolov. Ukraine says it also killed another 33 Russian officers in a missile strike against the fleet headquarters in Sevastopol on Friday. The Ukrainians have targeted senior Russian officers throughout this war, often using intelligence from NATO, and specialist units have been tasked by Kyiv with these killings. They're aimed at sapping morale, and undermining command systems. CNN has no independent confirmation ofUkraine's claim to have killed Russia's admiral, but it would be its biggest success in this campaign, and part of an ongoing campaign to break through Russia's defense lines to ultimately strike at Crimea. They've included early attacks on Putin's navy and a bridge to Russia itself. The first batch of US donated Abrams tanks have also arrived in Ukraine. But they're not the strategic weapons the Ukrainians say they need. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The defense packages from the United States, including artillery, necessary shells, high marked munitions, air defense missiles, additional air defense systems, tactical vehicles, and some other types of weapons that will prove themselves on the battlefield. KILEY (voice-over): Kyiv wants these ATACMS. Long-range missile systems to attack deep behind Russian lines, to kill more officers, and destroy logistics hubs. The US is yet to announce that Ukraine will get these missiles before the winter freezes over the frontlines where they are. Sam Kiley, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Sir, good to have you with us, we're seeing an escalation in fighting in the Black Sea. Let's start with Ukraine's claim that they killed the commander of Russia's Black Sea Fleet in an attack on the port city of Sevastopol. Is Kyiv opening another front with these attacks on Russian targets in occupied Crimea and what does this mean for Russia?LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yeah I'd say that -- and first off all, it's great to be with you, but I'd say that this is actually a deep battle strike doing multi-domain operations. So the Ukrainians are hitting the Russians on the frontline, trying to push through the various defensive belts that have been put in place by Russia, but they're also putting Russia on guard in their rear areas. They've been doing this for months now, striking targets like ammunition dumps and command post headquarters and places where soldiers are. Logistic bases. But now what we're doing is taking it to the next level. This is a strategic strike against the Black Sea Fleet headquarters. Not unexpected, they've been hitting Sevastopol on multiple locations for the last several weeks. But this one certainly was a very good targeting methodology by the Ukrainian forces to hit the headquarters of the Black Sea Fleet.",

What Russia continues to do is conduct, truthfully, war crimes against infrastructure and civilian targets. Things that are contrary to all the Geneva Conventions and the International Court of Law in terms of armed conflict.So what we see is just a very different approach by the Russian military, trying to affect the Ukrainian people, making their lives miserable, a strategic approach to try and get Kyiv to do what they want them to do. But it's not working. We're going back into the winter months, there are indicators that Russia will attempt again during the winter to strike key infrastructure targets to make life miserable for Ukrainian civilians, while Ukraine continues to fight on the battlefield front. And I personally think that the approach that Ukrainians are using are much better than what Russia is using.

And yet there's a misunderstanding of what takes place on the battlefield. How difficult it is.From the very beginning of the offensive operations, I've said this will be hard because of the opportunity Russia had of them placing mines and defensive belts. It's a whole lot harder when you have soldiers going against those defensive belts then it is talking about big arrows and circles on the map. So yeah, I think early on there were some disconnects between the capitals in the West and what was happening on the battlefield by Ukrainian forces.

The guild says it will share the details on Tuesday, and ultimately more than 11 thousand members would need to vote to ratify it before the strike officially ends.As a reminder, writers have been on strike for nearly five months as they called for better residual pay on streaming shows and movies, protections regarding the use of artificial intelligence potentially creating content based on writers' ideas, having minimum staffing levels and duration of employment as studios have increasingly used smaller groups of writers for shorter periods resulting in wages that writers say make it very difficult to sustain a living. But ending the strike still doesn't mean TV and movie productions immediately start back up. There are still 160 thousand actors on strike since July and their union, SAG-AFTRA, will still be picketing this week. There is some optimism that writers having an agreement with studios may spur a deal for actors as well and SAG-AFTRA said they look forward to reviewing the writers agreement while continuing to urge studios to return to the table to make a fair deal. Meanwhile, the Milken Institute told me these double strikes have caused more than $5 billion in economic loss across the US, affecting not just actors and writers but so many small businesses that have had to lay people off since the productions they support through custodial services, catering, props, makeup and more, have been at a standstill. Some of these small business owners tell me they're now wondering whether actors will also form a deal with studios in time for productions to start before the holiday season or if there may not be true income rolling in until the new year.

But, you know, that is 1.3 million square miles of area we're talking about which is why some of their claimed islands and atolls are so far away from the mainland coast. But, you know, as you mentioned, these have always been hotly contested waters.What China does though is so extraordinary and increasingly aggressive compared to other claimants. And in the past few years through land reclamation and massive construction, they have turned previously uninhabited atolls and islands into man made islands equipped with airstrips and sophisticated radars and other equipment. That really is the basis of why they're able to project an increasing military power not only through its navy but also its coast guard and sometimes and increasingly its nominally civilian maritime militia. And we've been following the story for years, but in the past few weeks and months we have seen this growing number of publicized incidents involving Beijing and other claimants, especially the Philippines. We have seen the Chinese coast guards using water cannons, and what Manila described as dangerous maneuvers to chase and drive away Philippine boats. And Manila, of course, has also been accusing Beijing of destroying marine ecosystems in its exclusive economic zone through deliberate actions. Now Beijing of course has been pushing back all these allegations saying the only thing that's changed recently is a change of government in Manila. The new president, Marcos, is now, basically, in their words, doing the US bidding, being a US pawn by instigating tensions in the region and they are especially angry at the fact the Philippines are bringing international media to witness some of those encounters and calling that stage performance falsely portraying China as a bully, trying to create a more favorable international opinion and narrative for the Philippines. But Laila, at the end of the day, the fundamental question here is the Chinese ministry is now leaving the area.
