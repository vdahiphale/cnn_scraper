We're in the town of Kiryat Shimona, which has got a population of just over 20,000 people.The order has now been given to evacuate that town because of the ratcheting up missile threat coming from across the border in Lebanon. You can see behind me, there's a whole load of cars waiting to exit Kiryat Shimona. And the police and the army are here in some force to try and make sure that's done in an orderly way. Buses are being laid on, state people don't have their cars to various locations outside of this danger zone. But, look, the road itself out of Kiryat Shimona is currently blocked by the police and the army, and that's because there's been an incursion, according to Israeli Defense Forces, from Lebanon by militants from the other side of the border into this side. They've shot three people on the border. They say already three militants trying to infiltrate Israel. There's another one person, according to security officials here that we've spoken to, who is at large somewhere up there on Israeli territory. And so there's a big search operation underway right now to try and find that person. And until that happens, the army tell me, and I've been speaking to them right here, they say they're not laying any civilians go any further than this. And so you can see they've got that roadblock there. They've got the spikes on the road to make sure nobody sort of rushes through the checkpoint, I suppose. But it just does, Erin, give you an indication of just how tense the situation is here and that -- just how tense the situation is here right now and, of course, how tense it could get once an invasion by the Israeli military into Gaza takes place, because it's then that we will really know what the response of actors like Hezbollah is going to be. Are they going to fire massive barrages of missiles into this area and across Israel, or will they hold back? Well, the people of Kiryat Shimona, the authorities at least, not taking any chances and are evacuating. Erin?",

There's a lot of things we don't know.We do know the total number of hostages we estimate in Gaza, the 203, we know that that number could rise because we've got the people that we are unaware they're just listed as missing. And every day we learn something new. But I can't share with you and I apologize more precise information. And think about how the families think of those people who are unaccounted for. Think about the families -- I saw them outside where we are today, they're meeting, the suffering of all those who got loved ones who are in Gaza. It's a terrible, terrible situation. And I would suggest that the message from the international community has to be that all people abducted by Hamas and Islamic Jihad and in Gaza, they have to be unconditionally and immediately released. Holding hostages this way is a war crime. We know it from organized crime. The mafia, you know, they kidnap people and ask for ransom. This is not the way people behave. And I think Hamas is exposing itself for what it is, a brutal, ruthless, horrific terrorist organization. And we saw that in the murders and we see that in the kidnappings.",

And if you've interviewed any of those soldiers on the front, you know there's a determination to go and to do what needs to be done.Now, as has been said by leading Israelis, the prime minister down, we know that there will be difficult fighting. And I think the soldiers who are going into battle know that they are risking their lives. We are facing a formidable enemy, a brutal enemy, an enemy that will try to kill as many of our fighting men and women as they can. And we go into this battle, though, united in knowing that this is necessary. No country should have to live next to a terrorist enclave like Israel has had to live next to Gaza. These people can massacred Israelis on October 7th, brutally murdering us. We will change the situation. We refuse to live in proximity, in immediate proximity, to these murderous terrorists. And when this is over, we will have paid a price. I have no doubt that those brave young men and women, not all of them will be coming back, and they know that. But the price is worth paying. We will free Israel from this terrorist threat that is a plague upon our country. And in doing so, we will also free Gaza from this tyrannical authoritarian theocracy.

But his belief is that it is like a dull ache just below the surface. Americans know that there is something at the core of who we are as a people that is under attack, both at home and around the world. And this was about putting that in the foreground and saying to people, look, this is -- I know we are asking a lot of you, but he reached back to World War II.

We may not have the credibility, the money, frankly, to be able to continue to play a role in the world that we had during the Cold War and afterwards.And I think his argument -- and let's be clear, some Americans won't agree, but his argument is this is not a chance, a moment, an opportunity for us to sit back. This really calls upon Americans, both because our friends are asking for help, but also because our adversaries are watching our actions. And the key concept, and this goes throughout his -- really, his political career, is that when dictators or terrorists are not stopped, ultimately, they will continue to march forward. And that's the idea that he wants Americans to walk away with, because his belief is that, yes, it's going to cost us now. He's about to ask Congress to find it within themselves to fund not only Ukraine, but also Israel, and that if we don't do it, ultimately, the globe stability and American security is in peril. The last bit I'll mention on this, which I think is important, is you heard him say something directly to Americans, saying that Americans deserve to be safe, if they are Jews or Muslims, from attacks here at home.
