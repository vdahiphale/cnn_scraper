I'm joined by Geoff Duncan, a former Republican lieutenant governor, who says he's voting for Harris over Trump. Then, riots and racism plague the U.K. after a surge in far-right protests. We discuss how this happened with comedian Nish Kumar and journalist Coco Khan. Also, ahead, panic on the markets from Tokyo to Wall Street. But what's really the state of the global economy? I asked Betsy Stevenson, who served as a top economic adviser to President Obama. And -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EDWARD WONG, AUTHOR, \"AT THE EDGE OF EMPIRE\" AND DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  He realized he had no future in China.

I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, it's Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. After what feels like endless speculation, though, really, it's only been about two weeks, Kamala Harris has chosen her vice-presidential candidate, and it seems to have been a personal choice. People saying Harris was drawn to Walz's happy-go-lucky attitude, and it doesn't hurt that he has a track record of winning, even in conservative leaning districts. Of course, she'll also want her new VP to sharpen the contrast between her and Donald Trump and the controversial Republican VP pick of J. D. Vance. The Trump campaign has already begun its campaign against Walz, labeling him a dangerous radical. So, let's get into all of this now with Geoff Duncan, a Republican who served as the lieutenant governor of Georgia until last year. Now, he says that he'll vote for Harris over Trump defying the party. Geoff Duncan, welcome to the program. It's good to see you. First, your reaction to this pic of Tim Walz?",

I mean, as I think Nisha articulated very well there, we've seen a drip feed of anti-immigrant sentiment for many, many years. That's been -- it's almost like an eco-sphere of politicians saying it, repeated in certain sectors of the press. And then, of course, you have the social media aspect and how certain platforms, you know, elevate these extreme views. I think there is a lack of distinction between migrants, asylum seekers, and just people of color. And I think there has been an unwillingness to try and create separation between those things. I think it's been politically expedient particularly for the Conservative Party that's been our ruling party for 14 years until relatively recently. I think it's been politically expedient for them to tap into these racial anxieties and not make distinctions about people who were born here, people who are legally here because they need to do a job in our NHS or prop up our failing university system and so on and so forth. So, I think it's been a long time coming. I think probably the surprise element of it, if there is indeed any, was the organization of it. Like, not to trade in stereotypes about, like -- let's be honest, like, a mob of people that aren't that different to football hooligans, who we know very much -- very well in Britain, you know, like, they are traditionally quite disorderly and quite chaotic, they've been very organized this time, and that is quite chilling. And they don't seem to be relenting despite the pushback from not only the police, but from local communities who -- where they can, are turning up in force to defend, you know, asylum seeker homes, even just their own high street. So, I think that, that bit's been a bit shocking. You would normally look at the kind of, let's be honest, drunk football lads who are just looking for a punch up and think, oh, yes, they'll go home, they'll get bored soon. But they haven't.

We've seen, Coco, over the last year, a spike in anti-Semitism, a spike in Islamophobia in a country that is well known to be quite a diverse country.

There's no ability to rebuild peace andrebuild communities if stuff is on fire and people are scared to leave their house. So, I think that's the first thing that needs to happen. You mentioned there the Russian disinformation. It has been really chilling to see this play out so quickly. Just in case any of your, you know, viewers are unfamiliar. There was evidence that this particular rumor, and there's often rumors that blame and assign blame to migrants or British Muslims or whatever it might be that are false. But this particular one about this -- who was the culprit behind this horrible child killing, that came from a channel called Channel 3 Now. When you see it, it looks like an American cable channel, but it's not. When the Times, one of our newspapers here, tracked it down, it was tracked down to Lithuania, and we have reason to believe it's attached to the Kremlin. So, they were reporting it before the police were even reporting it. The police couldn't report it because the culprit is under 18, and we have reporting restrictions around that because they are legally a child. So, there was lots of things kind of going on there. And so, I think, to return to your original question about what can be done to heal it. One, get this under control. Two, look very closely at the tech giants. Go for individual profiles who are whipping up hate, if you can get them if you're British and you've got the evidence for it. Obviously, the problem of controlling tech giants is a large one, and I don't necessarily know if it will be resolved. But I also would love to see some diplomacy on this from the international stage. I don't know what can be done. I don't claim to be an international diplomat, but I think these are conversations that our foreign secretary must have and must form part of our longer international commitments and work because this is a problem that is affecting everyone and is not going to go away.",

Stock markets have nothing really to do with the recession in the sense that's traders,that's a bunch of people who are making investments, making bets, and all of a sudden, they think maybe those bets aren't going to pay off as well as they previously thought. You know, when it comes to a recession, we're talking about main street, we're talking about, are we producing as much stuff as we have been in the past? And right now, the forecast for Q3 of this year is 2.6 percent growth. That's pretty far from a recession. So, I don't think that we've got anywhere, you know, recession around the corner. I do think that we've seen a slowing economy and we have the Fed a little bit behind and that raises the risks of a recession compared to, say, eight months ago, but I still think that the risk of a recession is pretty low. And I love that you mentioned wars, because what causes a recession is a big negative shock that does, you know, cause us all to pull back our spending simultaneously at the same time in a way that causes the entire economy to shrink. Now, there's one caveat that I do want to add, though, which is, you know, a lot of businesses out there, they're just going along, they're doing their things. The fundamentals are fine. But they're seeing a falling share price. And I think the thing we need to avoid a recession is to make sure that there aren't companies making dumb decisions too because of a falling share price, if they've got the fundamentals right. Have a second look, make sure you've got the fundamentals right. But if you're overreacting to your share price, well, you could do something that's less efficient. And if a bunch of companies do that, that could push us into a recession, because all of a sudden, companies start doing dumb things that mean that they're less productive.",

Betsey Stevenson, thank you so much for joining us. It's really good to see you again. Say hi to Justin for us. Well, as market jitters in the U.S., the shockwaves are being closely watched in China, calculating how changes in the stock markets and the White House could affect the future of the world's second largest economy. China's economic leadership has been built atop decades of communist authoritarian rule. And few people have experienced this transformation as closely and personally as author Edward Wong. In his book, \"At the Edge of Empire,\" he chronicles how his family and the nation grappled with the political evolution that paved China's path to global ascendance. He joined Walter Isaacson to discuss his latest work. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALTER ISAACSON, CO-HOST, AMANPOUR AND CO.:  Edward Wong, welcome to the show. EDWARD WONG, AUTHOR, \"AT THE EDGE OF EMPIRE\" AND DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  Great to see you again, Walter.",

He placed it in my hand as we sat together in the living room of my childhood home outside of Washington, D.C. It had been taken in China in 1953. His eyes glimmered, and skin had none of the lines of age. He wore a plain military uniform and a cap. I ran a finger over a darkened spot in the center of the shadow there. Father said, that's where the red star had been. A symbol of the People's Liberation Army. This starts you on this journey finding out about your family and how it's interwoven with Chinese history. Tell me how that propelled you.",

And so, I thought at the time, I learned a little bit more about what my parents have been up to during these great years of upheaval on their Mao's regime. I learned that my mother fled China fairly early age because they were landowners, the communists persecuted them. My father had a much more complicated history and he started telling me a bit of that. He told me about how he had served in the army and he eventually fled to Hong Kong. Now, I knew some of the general contours of that. But it wasn't until after I finished a long tour in China for The New York Times, I was there from 2008 until the end of 2016, and then moved back to Washington, that I really started probing deeper into his story, because it was only after living in China and going to many of the places where my parents had lived, where my father had served in the army, in the Northeast of Manchuria, in the Northwest, in Xinjiang, that I could understand the context for the questions that I wanted to ask him. And so, I probed deeper into how and why he had joined the army and also what he did out there as part of this military occupation of Xinjiang that Mao ordered from the very beginning of communist rule.",

And they'renot really frontiers when you think about it. The areas of Xinjiang, the Tibetan areas, they make up a third of China. And when you think about it, China really is the last of the big Eurasian empires to survive. The British, the Ottomans, the Russians, they all fell apart because of the world wars. China, on the other hand, was able to reconstitute itself as an empire under the communists when Mao took over. And then, when he sent troops into Xinjiang, into Tibet to occupy those regions, my father was in the vanguard of those troops being sent out in the early '50s. He became part of that military occupation. And in my assessment of this, much of the rule of the communist party is defined by this idea that they have to hold on to the empire. They have to make sure that doesn't fall apart. One of the main narrative tracks of the book is contemporary China from 2008 onward and the rule of Xi Jinping and how that's changed under him. And I say in the book that one of Xi's big fears is what happens to Soviet Union, and he's -- he talked about that privately with President Biden in a dinner in 2011 in China. He's talked about that in private speeches with communist party officials. I dug all that out for the book. And when he talks about that he has in his head this idea of the Soviet territories, like the Central Asian territories, really leaving the empire. And I think he has a great fear of that in China. And so, the increasing use of force and paranoia and the idea of China as a state that must maintain internal security is ever present for Xi because of this.",

My father obviously saw something on a smaller scale. But I did feel that there is a certain echo of history here. I really felt when I stood there, oh, my father must have been just a few yards or a few 100 yards away from me, and actually in the parade, march in front of Mao, just like these troops are doing, wanting to see some sort of sign of approval from the great leader, all acting out of patriotism or nationalism, and I really felt that sense there in Tiananmen Square. So, I feel like a lot of the feelings of China becoming a stronger nation, of the nationalism that courses through many Chinese citizens and through the City of Beijing today, it has their foundations earlier, much earlier in the Mao era.",

And he suspected something was up at that time. He suspected he was being sent into exile. Then in Xinjiang, over six years or so, he wins the confidence of military commanders. He gets a chance to go back into interior China to study engineering. He wants to build military aircraft for the country. And he's got a pending application to be a party member. Some senior officials in Xinjiang have recommended that he be allowed to join the party, and he has high hopes for doing that. Then he discovers through conversations with other officials that they still don't trust him. He has something in his background dossier, and he realizes it's because he comes from a merchant family that lived in Hong Kong. He was born there in the British colony, and his brother, as you know, had gone to America to study there. And so, the communists suspected this about his background. At the time in Maoist China, there was hunts for subversives. There were campaigns against counter revolutionaries. And you never knew who might be cast under this shadow of suspicion. And so, my father realized there's something structurally wrong with that -- with the party, that someone like himself, who had made all these sacrifices for the party and for the army, could not be trusted. And I think he realized that because of this dynamic of power and of fear and suspicion, that he would never be trusted. He also experienced the great famine that happened when Mao instituted his disastrous economic policies under the Great Leap Forward. 30 to 40 million Chinese died during that period. My father fell ill, as did his classmates. And those along with a few other factors, like Mao's purges of military commanders, then spurred him to make a flight to Hong Kong. He realized he had no future in China. That China was heading in the wrong direction at the time. Mao had kept his grip on power for too long, and he needed to get out of the country.",

I think this is one thing that many Americans miss, even once analysts inWashington, for example, I think that both countries see themselves as great powers. And I don't mean just the leaders, I mean, the leaders and the citizens. They see themselves as powers that have something to give to the world and that the world should accept that and appreciate it as well. And I think Americans feel strongly that way. They -- America, as you know, has a certain missionary zeal in its foreign policy. It wants to spread democracy in the world. We see that as recently as Biden, who's framed his foreign policy as democracy versus autocracy. They say they don't want regime change in other countries. But at the same time, when you look at all the rhetoric that comes out of American leaders and policymakers, they would prefer it if other countries adopted democratic systems and certain norms. I think China isn't trying to impose its exact political system on other countries, but it would like other countries to accept certain things that China is giving it. I think China believes its economic system might be better than that of many other countries, including the United States. I think it feels that if other countries adopted its vision of economic performance of trade, and to a certain degree of politics, then those countries would benefit. And I think neither country sees the negative consequences that could result from trying to persuade or impose these policies on other nations.",

I mean, it goes back and forth. Walter, we've seen, for example some setbacks to the far-right in recent elections in Europe. But I also think that in the U.S., we're now grappling with this idea of, you know, whether certain authoritarian ways of governing might be better than messy democracy. And I think you see this not just in the push and pull between the Republicans and the Democrats, but if you look at polling among millennials, you see a lot of them say, for example, democracy isn't necessarily that important to the governance of the United States. I think a large part of it is an erosion of our memories from the mid-20th century, Walter, that there's a -- as the older generations fade away younger people forget the wars that were fought in the 20th century and of the rise of authoritarianism. I do think that China does present, to a certain degree, a model for some people because of the economic boom that the communist party has managed to oversee in China. And the fact that the party, oftentimes, in recent decades, has seemed adaptable. We have to admit that, that it has been able to pick and choose policies and put in place ones that have allowed the country to grow, even as it maintains this repressive security state in many parts of China, especially in the western regions, as we talked about. And one example is the recent zero-COVID policy that Xi adopted. It was very strict. People took to the streets in order to protest it, and then Xi immediately dropped it. It's amazing. Like he just turned around. Many analysists, including here in the U.S., were skeptical he would drop that policy. They said it was a personal policy to seize. But instead, as soon as he realized that pressure built a certain point, he immediately reversed course and went the exact opposite direction. And I think that that's an example of this adaptation that we see in the communist party and that type of policymaking might have appeal to some people in other parts of the world.",
