But also a picture of a really heartbroken little boy who lost his mother when he was just so young and couldn't -- felt guilt, he was saying to Anderson Cooper on CBS, felt guilt that he couldn't cry like everyone else was crying, struggled with his feelings. Also believed that maybe she was coming back in 10 years' time, she'd just gone for a break. It's absolutely heartbreaking. And this is -- to hear her say that she would suffer at the thought of the rift, she always wanted her boys to be together, and yet here we are in a situation when as Harry puts it it's a full-scale rupture between him, William and Charles. They aren't speaking. It's not very likely at this moment that Harry's going to come to the coronation. He feels the relationship has been very damaged by all the briefing against him, the struggles that Meghan has had. And I think he feels that speaking out is his only recourse now.",

      "sentences": "I have to say one of the biggest surprises actually came out during the Tom Bradley interview, the ITV interview that aired yesterday.Of course, everyone remembers the bombshell Opray Winfrey interview where the takeaway from that was that there was somebody racist within the royal family who'd been asking -- who had questions and concerns and conversations about how dark Archie's skin complexion would be while Meghan Markle was pregnant. And you remember Opray's reaction to that. Who would be having such conversations? Meghan said, well, I can't speak about this because this would be very damaging. And then Harry followed onto that saying he will never elaborate on that conversation. Well, Tom Bradley asked Harry about those accusations and Harry is now saying he never said the royal family is racist or a member of the royal family is racist. He said Meghan didn't say that either. And in fact, it was the British pes who ran with that narrative. Of course, the royals faced a racism crisis because of this. The queen put out a statement saying that these issues that have been spoken about in the Opray interview were very concerning, especially those around the matter of race. And then Harry is saying that this is really unconscious bias, those comments about Archie, not racism. He says there's a difference between the two. But the question here that has to be posed is, why didn't he speak out about this earlier because it's been almost two years since the Opray interview came out? And remember when Prince William was asked directly, is your family racist by a reporter, he responded no. So it's not like Prince Harry didn't know that that was the narrative out there. It's interesting he didn't clear things up when he'd spoken so much about how he and Meghan would have loved the palace to step in and protect them.",

We've seen allegations about William before, and there were quite a lot about the book about the rift between Charles, William and Charles and Harry and William.But this is about Camilla. And Harry is here saying -- he actually uses the phrase she got in bed with the devil, that she is working with the press and she gave stories to the press about him to protect herself, to protect her family, to keep them out of the spotlight. When she was really seen as the bad guy in the aftermath of the exposure of the affair between Charles and Camilla, that they were trying to rehabilitate her image. And he said she was on a long-term campaign to be queen. This is extremely severe allegations against the queen consort. And we know before sources have told us that Charles felt this was a red line. Criticize him, OK. Criticize Camilla and that was a red line for him. And certainly Harry says he loves his stepmother, he understands the position she was in, but this I think is extremely tough. And it does seem to me a slight contradiction here. Because if Camilla was trying to rehabilitate her image, if she was doing this as a P.R. campaign, if that was happening, it would have had to have been with the assent of Charles. So he is also responsible if that is the case. (CROSSTALK)",
