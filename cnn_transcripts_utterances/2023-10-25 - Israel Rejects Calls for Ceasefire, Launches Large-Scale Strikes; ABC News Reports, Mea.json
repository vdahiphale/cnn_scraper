So, it's a lot of that psychological support. But the strikes continue and we've heard, you know, Nic Robertson reporting on these new precision mortar munitions that Israel has been using that are different than anything they've used before. They even sound different. We've heard that both from Nic as they go in and I've heard that from a source in Northern Gaza saying that it sounds completely different. But even overnight, hundreds more strikes. They said they killed the commander of the Khan Yunis North Battalion of Hamas, who they say has been instrumental in many terrorist attacks. This morning saying that they found a tunnel, Phil and Poppy, that actually came from Gaza to a beach on the Israeli side and that they said two Hamas operatives came out of that, engaged in a fight with Israeli Special Forces who were there and the Hamas operatives were killed. But this is happening day in and day out. And while we don't yet know how many Hamas operatives, how many commanders, how much capacity, capability, operational and command centers have been taken out, we do know that they're taking them out every single day, every single day and there are hundreds of strikes.

What they do is warn civilians to vacate areas before they conduct strikes, but we are in constant communication with them about how best they can do that and encouraging them to act within the laws of war. As the president has said, it's important that democracies follow -- it's important that democracies respect all human life. It's important that democracies follow the laws of war and follow international law. That's what we expect Israel to do, and we'll continue to be in conversation with them about that.",

We had meetings with them where we talked about work to return these hostages. You've seen very initial efforts with two American citizens released and two Israeli citizens released over the weekend. And so we are continuing to work with the government of Qatar. We are very appreciative of the efforts that they have made. It's been very important in the progress that we've had so far. We know that there are still 10 Americans who remain unaccounted for, and we do know, unfortunately, that some of those are hostages -- as, of course, a number of other foreign nationals and ultimately hundreds of Israeli citizens. So, we're going to continue to work -- to work on it, but one of the things I'll say is we have found that throughout talking about our work publicly, in such a sensitive, delicate area isn't actually helpful to our goal of trying to get these hostages released.",

On the other side, we have seen a couple things. At times, as in the clip you just showed, Hamas has had no one there manning the border station. Remember that this is an area that is administered by Hamas. Hamas has been the government of Gaza for some time, and they before this conflict manned that border station. At other times, we have seen Hamas militants actively there, with guns, preventing people from approaching the crossing. So there has been a problem in getting people through the Gaza side into the no man's land where they can ultimately get across to the Egyptian side to be processed to enter into Egypt. It is an extremely difficult situation. We continue to work through it with the Egyptian government. We continue to work through it with the United Nations.

That's according to an ABC News report that also says he's spoken to federal investigators at least three times this year. And ABC sources tell them, quote, Meadows informed Smith's team that he repeatedly told Trump in the weeks after the 2020 presidential election that the allegations of significant voter fraud coming to them were baseless. That, of course, would contradict many things Meadows has said publicly, including in his book, which was first published in November 2021, a full year after the 2020 election.CNN has reached out to Mark Meadows' attorney and has not heard back. For his part, Donald Trump is denying that Meadows told that allegations of significant voter fraud were baseless. Trump posting on Truth Social, quote, Mark Meadows never told me that allegations of significant fraud about the rigged election were baseless. He certainly didn't say that in his book. Joining us now is Timothy Parlatore. He's Donald Trump's former attorney and currently represents former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerrik, who has been subpoenaed to testify in the Georgia election investigation. Tim, we appreciate your time. To start with, there have been so many questions about where Mark Meadows is on all this. I haven't heard from him much publicly other than down in Georgia.

But if you go all the way back to March/April time frame of this year, you know, there was litigation over whether he could claim executive privilege and be prevented from testifying. And he was ordered by the judge to testify before the grand jury.So, this immunity grant makes sense because when somebody in his position is then compelled under the executive privilege issue, they would naturally go before the grand jury, plead the Fifth and the prosecutor would say, hold on a minute, and they would run out and give them a grant of immunity, at which point they no longer have a Fifth Amendment right and they would -- they basically have to answer every question.

But when you have a witness who refuses to testify, you give him a grant of federal immunity, they testify, unless there is an issue of a parallel state case, which, back in April, Mark Meadows wasn't necessarily expecting.And so I can predict what happened here is he was talking to Jack Smith's team, until, all of a sudden, Fani Willis decided to indict him. And, you know, then he starts pleading the Fifth again and shuts down. And the timing of the ABC story to me is fascinating because just this past week is when Fani Willis has, all of a sudden, started opening things up for everybody to get misdemeanor and no jail pleas. So, I wouldn't be surprised if this is really just a setup for Mark Meadows to take a sweetheart deal in Georgia and maybe this article was even a message to Fani Willis of, hey, maybe instead of indicting him, you should have tried talking to him first.
