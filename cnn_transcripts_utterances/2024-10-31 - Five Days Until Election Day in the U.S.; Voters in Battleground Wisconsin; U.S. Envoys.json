The CIA director Bill Burns is going to be in Cairo as well, pushing on negotiation efforts around the hostage situation and around Gaza. You have the CENTCOM commander in the region as well.The point here being President Biden is making a huge diplomatic push right before the U.S. elections, and that is because there are a few issues on the table here that could be of concern. Let's go to Lebanon, where there is optimism that a short term ceasefire deal could be reached, that the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah could be temporarily stopped for at least a month and that during that month, intensive negotiations would take place as to what would happen the day after the war. Would the U.N. resolution that's kept the peace kept that ground? Would that be enforced? How would that would be enforced? Who would enforce it? All of those questions. How do people return to their homes? What about aid? So all of that would potentially be discussed if, if, if, a ceasefire deal is reached, Lebanon's caretaker prime minister expressed optimism as well. He says he hopes that a deal could be reached within days or weeks. That's based on his conversations with U.S. officials. Now you'll note I haven't mentioned Israel's response yet. So far, with these media reports, they seem to downplay them in response to questions to reporters saying, Yes, there's a lot of paperwork out there. There's a lot happening out there. Meaning essentially, I don't think that there's going to be anything said from Prime Minister Netanyahu until we're closer to a done deal. But if a deal is reached, that would give some hope some relief to those suffering on the ground. More than 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since the start of this offensive. Thousands more displaced, thousands more wounded. They need, they need that respite. MACFARLANE: And as we've been seeing, obviously, there's been very little response from Israel as well, too, until we have the election date done. So we'll wait to see, you know, if that can progress in the days to come. But what is also hampering potential ceasefire negotiations here is the expansion of Israel's war now to the north of Lebanon. The intensification of that.",

Eyewitness accounts on the ground saying people were literally shouting at each other from their cars.Which route do we take? Where do we go? Where is safe? That's the chaos that's happening on the ground. And again, I mentioned that it's in the north of the country because we already know the south has been struck by Israeli firepower. We already know Beirut has been struck by Israeli firepower. So for those families, there is this sense of disarray.

And this is an area where the U.S. has simply said they're very much watching this space, but they have nothing to say yet. They won't speculate here, but they have made clear that they're looking to see if there is some sort of quid pro quo between Russia and North Korea in terms of what does North Korea get in return?Now, the U.S. hasn't gone that far yet, but South Korea did. The South Korean defense minister speaking alongside Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Wednesday at the Pentagon said it is, quote, very likely that North Korea will receive help in critical technology areas, including perhaps nuclear weapons, specifically tactical nuclear weapons, intercontinental ballistic missiles, satellite technology, all of the areas we have seen North Korea trying to push forward with some successes and some failures. Of course, that is technology that Russia already has at its disposal here and a space that the U.S. was watching in South Korea to see if that's what they would give in return. Now South Korea didn't say it definitively, but they said that's effectively what their indications are showing what's very likely to happen. Now that would effectively mirror a sort of arrangement that Iran has with Russia, where Iran provides drones and ballistic missiles, and in exchange, Russia provides technology in the nuclear realm, on ballistic missiles, on drones, as that relationship grows. Now, this is an area where South Korea and the U.S. will expand their intelligence sharing to see how this relationship grows and in what direction it goes. What sort of steps and advancements is North Korea able to make in these critical technology and crucially weapons areas? So you're likely to see an expansion of that cooperation and intelligence sharing. This, of course, all happens as Western intelligence officials tell CNN that a small number of those North Korean troops in Russia are already on the battlefield in Ukraine, a situation U.S. President Joe Biden called, quote, dangerous.
