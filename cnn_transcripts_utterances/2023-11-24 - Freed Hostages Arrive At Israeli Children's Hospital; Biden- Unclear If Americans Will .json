After more than 49 days in captivity, the first group of hostages held by Hamas are now back in Israel. And moments ago, we just saw some of those hostages met by cheers, as they arrive by helicopter at a children's hospital near Tel Aviv. We don't know how many people will be brought there. But sources say the mothers and their kids who were freed today, will not be separated. A total of 24 hostages were taken out of Gaza earlier today in these vans right here by the Red Cross, where they then got their initial medical checks. Now, the rest will all be taken to hospitals across Israel based on their current medical needs, given most were believed to be kept underground for nearly seven weeks. The released hostages include 13 Israelis, ten Thai citizens, and one citizen of the Philippines. Israel identified its citizens as Yapa Adar, Ohanna Peri, Ruth Munder, her daughter Keren, and her grand son Ohad, Margalet Moses, Hana Katzir, Adina Moshe, Daniel Aloni and her daughter Emilia, Doron Katz Asher and her children Raz and Aviv. No Americans were included in today's hostage release. President Biden says he's still hopeful a few will be freed in the coming days, but he has no guarantees. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They don't want it to look clinical or intimidating or cold. They wanted it to feel warm. The words they used were, they wanted to create the feeling of a beautiful hotel.They've put in lots of toys in the rooms. This is where they'll be reunited with some of their friends and family and loved ones. And this is where, also, they have hand-picked the very best and most appropriate of their staff, of their doctors, of their psychiatrists, to begin the work, the complicated work, of trying to break tough news to them but also of trying to assess the level of trauma that they have undergone. And it's important to underscore that the freed hostages who have been brought here are not believed to be seriously injured. Those have been taken, at least two, we believe, to other hospitals. Those who have been brought here are children and their mothers. We don't know exactly their names, although obviously there are three families in particular who are the most likely candidates to have been brought there. They did put those screens up for privacy. And you can't see on camera, but there's a number of onlookers around. Some of them are children. Some of them are families. We spoke to one nurse. She's an ER nurse, not from this hospital but from another hospital nearby, and she knew you could see the helipad. She was working in the ER on October 7th. And she said she wanted to come here to witness this moment. She called it, quote, a drop of joy in a sea of sadness. And she said that while it's unlikely to change the course of events and while there is much more sadness to come and probably, sadly, much more bloodshed to come, she wanted to be here to witness this moment and to hold on to that drop of joy. And I think, Pamela, that's something that all of us, whether we are watching this, covering this, involved in this, can all relate to is just that sense of one moment after so much horror of joy with, you know, hostages finally being returned home, although to a very different future.",

DORON SPIELMAN, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  Thank you for having me, Pam. As Clarissa said, I think we can delve a little bit more in depth. They have gone through an initial medical check, and we have seen that there is nothing life threatening. However, the process, mostly the psychological process, of what these children have been through and what these adults have been through, is going to take time to unfold. And we have to multiply that by what is going to be happening to them in the next few minutes. These are the minutes where they're going to be meeting with their families, with all that joy, with the hugs and tears. And then those children and those adults are going to look around and say, wait, what about my sister? What about my father? What about mom? Why are they not here? And that news is going to be delivered to them that, in fact, every one of these hostages that are being returned, every one of them has family that has either already been murdered or has been abducted. And the process is going to be a long process. They're in the hospital with their families. And it's going to be a case by case basis. The most important thing is to try to nurture them and keep them protected so that they can really see hope in the future. Remember, these hostages have no idea what the rest of the world knows. They don't know the extent of October 7th. And that is now going to be known to them in the next few minutes.",

We put out toys for them each step along the way. The first meeting at the initial point, there were teddy bears. There was candy. There were things to welcome them in. Now they're being flown by helicopter, which is a ride. It's somewhat exhilarating for them. So, they get to land. Hopefully this will cheer them up. When they enter into that area, it's going to be a slowly unfolding process. And how does a 2-year- old, a 4-year-old, a 5-year-old, and a 9-year-old come to grips with this? I think you said it yourself, and I think you said it very well. They will not be the same ever going forward that they were before. But what they will see when they leave that hospital is an entire nation who feels like these are our children. We've been waiting for them, and this entire nation, who's been serving the army.

I can't even imagine, just emotionally processing everything they've been through.Given your experience, tell us about that, what these people who are freshly freed from captivity go through? O'SHEA:  Yeah, I have been through that, resistance escape training. I became a repatriation subject matter expert with a number of debriefs that I did with hostages that were released the in Iraq. So, first and foremost, is the medical check, which they're all going through right now. I know all the hostages have been pulled out of Gaza, are all in hospitals now, as I understand. They're being medically checked and examined. As you know, there are four or five women in their 70s and grandchildren. So I think the age range is between 5 and 72, as I recall. So, there's going to be different physical exams for both. But the mental aspect of this and the psychological damage, especially with these young children, it is going to take months and potentially years and potentially a lifetime of trauma, especially for these kids who are have likely been held in a bunker-type situation underground, probably in darkness, for the last 47-odd days.

Do you see a world where all of the hostages will be released, or do you think that is just wishful thinking?O'SHEA:  Well, I'm a pessimist just because I worked 400-odd kidnappings in a two-year period in Iraq. And I can honestly count the happy endings on one hand with fingers to spare, especially when it came to the 44 Americans that were taken, held hostage over my time. So, I'm not optimistic that this will go smoothly or quickly. More hostages will be released. But right now these hostages are the only bargaining chip that Hamas has. Holding these hostages means there's survival for another day. It will get down to a calculus, the value of what a hostage is worth. And it will come down to the nationality, their age, and for all military-age males of the Israelis held in Hamas, those men that are 18 to 40, as most know, you serve in the Israeli military for two years minimum. And I think up until 40 for the reserves. Those men and the women that serve in the IDF that are captured, they may have an enduring captivity ahead for them.",

As you said, they're emotionally scarred from the initial attack on October 7th and everything that's happened ever since. I'm sure that the authorities are going to do everything they can to, kind of, take care of their physical and their mental state right now. And I'm hopeful that more can be released ASAP.",

Like, Hamas needs to release all of these hostages ASAP, like, now.And so, if they do what is the humane and civil thing to do, which is to release these hostages, we could see this temporary ceasefire extend.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  It's the sounds of life, not death, today on the streets of Gaza. For first time in nearly 50 days, they are not running for their lives. No bombs raining down on them from the sky. So children can even smile again, even if only for a brief while. But there's nothing to celebrate. Too many lives have been lost, so much gone. They know there will be more. The Israeli military dropping leaflets on Friday warning people that the war is not over. It will soon resume. Telling them to stay away from northern Gaza and its troops. Many tried to head back to the homes they fled with nothing more than the clothes on their backs to see what's left and grab what they can find, including their dead. We want to see what's happened to our loved ones. So many are under the rubble for 20 days, Abu Hamad says. We need to get them out. \"Who else will bury them? Who will bury our 2-year-old and her father?\" says Hama Abdullah (ph). What did she do to them? It was a tense scene on the Salah al Din Street, TThe highway linking north and south, people here saying Israeli forces opened fire on those trying to head back north. We want to get to our homes, they say. We're civilians. They shot people. One was shot in the head and the other in the mouth. Gunfire and the panic that ensued captured in this video geolocated by CNN. Asked about these shootings, the military says its troops are stationed along the, quote, operational lines in accordance with the framework of the agreement, but that didn't stop those determined to get back to what's left of their lives. Sisters Hanin and Sada (ph) are cradling their cats who have been through it all say they know the risks, but they just want to go back home. Gazans know all too well what comes after the brief calm. What's this truce for, to hand over the hostages? What happens after they hand them over? What happens to us, Hama Abdullah (ph) asked? We feel like we are dead, she says. They hope it doesn't all start again, but all they can do now is prepare for a crucial winter ahead. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London. (END VIDOTAPE)",
