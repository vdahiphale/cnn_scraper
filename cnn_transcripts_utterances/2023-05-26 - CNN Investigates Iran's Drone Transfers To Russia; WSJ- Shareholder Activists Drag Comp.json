Iran sees an opportunity to rebalance the relationship on a more equal playing field.And the area we're talking about here, the Caspian Sea -- you take a look at that map. There is no footprint for the U.S. There is no footprint for NATO in that area. We did ask U.S. officials about our story. They did not acknowledge or confirm the Caspian Sea route. But there is one thing I want to mention, which is that a U.S. Navy commander made a visit to Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan just last month to discuss maritime security. You can absolutely expect the United States is scrambling to try and stem the flow of arms.",

Corporate board members bombarded by a record number of shareholder proposals challenging their so-called ESG -- Environmental Social Governance policies. It puts them uncomfortably in the middle of America's culture wars.One executive telling The Wall Street Journal, quote, \"Companies are getting dragged into partisan fights that they don't want to be in, but they can't avoid it anymore.\" Let's bring in Jessica Kriegel, chief scientist of workplace culture at Culture Partners. Jess, a fascinating trend when you look at all of these proposals. What's causing this? JESSICA KRIEGEL, CHIEF SCIENTIST OF WORKPLACE CULTURE, CULTURE PARTNERS (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, it's an opportunity that these shareholder activists are seeing that they can force the hand of the board of directors and CEOs to make a statement on political issues that really have nothing to do with the business, and so they're taking that chance. They know that most of these proposals are not going to get passed and yet, it's still an opportunity to see what the CEO will say. And half of the CEOs are really eager to make a statement about these things and half of them do not want to be forced to at all and they're trying to just focus on the business.",

Focus on workplace culture and not these political culture wars because many of those issues -- gun control, abortion -- they're not going to get solved at the business level.And so, for a CEO, there are so many issues right in front of them that they can solve. The excess burnout. Issues with employee mental health. Issues with women and men leaving the workforce. Those are the issues that they need to be focused on and that the great CEOs are really paying attention to; not these distractions, which are perhaps getting headlines but not helping the business.",

And every company is made up of people on the left and on the right, and so if take a stand on one side you're not going to be creating an inclusive environment for half of your employees.And so what's important here is to focus on your purpose. What is the meaning of the work that you're creating for this community of employees that you are leading, and really serving, because servant leadership is the key here? And that has to do with creating an environment where they all feel like they belong. And so these political issues are not going to get you there.",

Their oil is still getting to market in certain places despite the fact that the U.S., the EU, and U.K. have sanctions on them. But their oil is still making it (INAUDIBLE) so we didn't lose that large producer out there. They have come back a little bit as far as their outright levels of production. But the greatest fears have never come to -- come to pass last year. And there's always at this time of year this fear of not enough and every year we seem to make it through. That being said, gasoline inventories in the United States are kind of a lot lower than what they normally would be this time of year. But the fact of the matter is we still have a lot of people working from home. I'm in my basement right now.

In a town so often divided, today, members of Congress from both parties were united and came together to wash this wall by hand ahead of Memorial Day. Republican Congressman Mike Waltz from Florida is a Green Beret who did combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Africa. He organized this bipartisan event several years ago with fellow lawmakers who have also served. REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL):  It's a reminder of the sacrifices that have been made for this country, and it's a reminder to us as members of Congress, both sides of the aisle, that at the end of the day, we're all American. We're all veterans who were willing to die together just a few years ago, then we can come together, roll up our sleeves, and move the country forward. TAPPER (voice-over):  Retired Lt. Gen. and Michigan Republican Congressman Jack Bergman is one of only three Vietnam veterans left serving in the House. REP. JACK BERGMAN (R-MI):  I normally come here alone. I never -- once I get here I'm never alone because I know who I'm visiting. TAPPER (voice-over):  A wall full of the names of friends and Americans who did not come home. REP. MIKE THOMPSON (D-CA):  I have friends whose names are on that wall. People -- kids that I grew up with and people that I served with. And from that perspective it was powerful. REP.
