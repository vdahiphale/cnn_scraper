For the moment, let's turn in a completely different direction. Also equally significant, of course, we're at the Spring Meetings of the IMF and World Bank here in Washington, DC. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS coming to you live from the headquarters buildings at the IMF, and interestingly, of course, over the course of the rest of the program, these are the voices you're going to have. You're going to hear from the French Finance Minister, Bruno Le Maire, who will be talking to us at a time when France of course, under protest; the President of the EIB, Werner Hoyer will be with us; Mairead McGuinness, the EU Commissioner for Financial Stability at a time of credit crunch and banking crisis, and Morocco's Finance Minister, Nadia Fettah will be with us, because of course, Morocco is the host of the annual meeting of the IMF, which takes place in October. Let's start with France, of course, and the ban on protests that take place. The band will continue until Saturday morning, but that still hasn't stopped people coming out on the streets. There have been a day of demonstrations: 380,000 protesters have been out and about, with teargas being deployed by the police and stun grenades, rockets have been thrown, fireworks. The Pension Reform Plan is now before the Constitutional Court, and we're expecting a law ruling on Friday. A reminder of course, the plan aims to raise the pension age from 62 to 64. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):   Outbursts of anger rip across France. PLEITGEN (on camera):   I just got a full load of teargas -- PLEITGEN (voice over):   Police in Paris charging a crowd of demonstrators. Flares and sirens taking over the headquarters of Luxury Giant LVMH, which owns the likes of Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Tiffany's. Chants from rail workers echo through the halls of the Metro, trash bins blocking off schools and streets with garbage set ablaze. These are the sights and sounds of rage by some protesters stirring tensions in what was largely a peaceful day of protest across the country. (PEOPLE chanting.) PLEITGEN (voice over):   French citizens, young and old, coming together for the 12th day of nationwide outrage against President Emmanuel Macron's controversial Pensions Bill, which would raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. FABIEN VILLEDIEU, SUD RAIL UNION REPRESENTATIVE (through translator):   I would lie if I was telling you that there is no fatigue. We are tired, but immobilization is like a marathon. It's the last kilometers at the end that are the hardest. PLEITGEN (voice over):   While protesters say they are here for the long run, the final hurdle for the bill comes Friday at the country's Constitutional Council. The contested reform will either be greenlit, partly scrapped, or in a highly unlikely situation, entirely thrown out. The Court's decision will bring to an end a month of deliberations; however, French unions and protesters say they are going to continue to fight the reform regardless of the ruling.

So all of our regulators, our supervisors, my role is to make sure that that system serves the economy. So it's not to say that what happened in the U.S. stayed in the U.S. You saw that there were concerns both in the European Parliament.

So, so I say, with real sincerity that all of us have a duty of care around the peace process. And President Biden is absolutely committed. I mean, he's you can see him there with the taoiseach, my party leader, Leo Varadkar. I think the visit has been incredible. He was in Dundalk, which is a town close to where I live myself. I was a little bit jealous that I wasn't there. He was in Carlingford, which is a beautiful part of County Louth. And he will go west, where he also has very deep family connections. And you know, some people are cynical about this. You know, they say, oh, this is just, you know, if you like, drawing on Irish roots. My experiences with the then vice President Biden, it's absolutely sincere and I think Irish people are delighted. But the strong bonds between Ireland and the U.S., which were based on horrors of the past, Irish people had to leave because of tragedies in Ireland. And it's nice that they're having a banquet.
