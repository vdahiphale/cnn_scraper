Snow is the issue up at altitude. In SoCal, they`re rushing to rebuild some sort of road for 450 households. This is their only way out. Springville`s Pleasant Valley Road now anything bad. In my 40 years, never seen it like that, to the man who shot these images. A major artery in Oakland closed at rush hour nearby a peach coffee warehouse roof collapsed, killing one. Around 25 times the volume of water that flows in the Mississippi is flowing through the air and this is the 10th so-called atmospheric river to hit California this winter. Low pressure from the north meets moist air near Hawaii. They call it a Pineapple Express, sounds fun? It`s not. Essentially a fire hose aimed at this state usually famed for its sunshine. Throw in a couple of other winter storms that dumped a couple of years` worth of snow on some upland areas. And this is the result. Today`s storm is a warm one. So along with all this rain, some of that snow is melting. The residents of Felton flooded in January once more told to evacuate, here and elsewhere yet more upheaval.",

It`s been called the capital of fashion and the city of love, but Paris is also well known as the city of light. And up next, we`re traveling to France where over 1 million people have been protesting against the government`s plans to raise the retirement age for most workers in the country from the age of 62 to 64. The protests have happened in major French cities and the impact has been felt across the country. It`s brought many transportation services to a standstill. Trains shut down, flights canceled, old schools and businesses, closed, as trash piles up on streets. Even the Eiffel Tower was closed to visitors. The French government has said that raising the retirement age is necessary to keep their pension system viable. All French retirees receive a pension from the government on average around $1,500 a month. But this planned reform angers workers at a time when living costs, food costs and energy bills are rising in France and elsewhere. Many of the protesters are young people, some who haven`t even entered the workforce yet, they say, though, that for a generation already concerned about inflation and job prospects, the government moving the finish line on retirement is depressing. We`ll hear now from CNN`s Jim Bittermann from the streets of Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM BITTERMANN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): French President Emmanuel Macron, like his predecessors, has run into fierce opposition from the streets trying to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64. Strikes are growing by transportation, energy and even garbage workers. (On camera): In a country where the average life expectancy has now increased to the age of 82 years old, it seems reasonable to expect that with France`s pay as you go retirement system that, in fact, the retirement age would have to increase as well. After all, as it stands now, if you retire at 62, it means collecting pension benefits for, on average, 20 years. And the money has got to come from somewhere. (Voice-over): But it`s not that reasonable to everyone. TAYEB KHOUIRA, SUD UNION SPOKESPERSON (through translator): We are going on an unlimited renewable strike as long as this reform has not been withdrawn.",
