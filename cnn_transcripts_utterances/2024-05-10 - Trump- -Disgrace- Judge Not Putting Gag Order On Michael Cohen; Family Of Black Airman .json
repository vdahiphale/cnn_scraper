What to expect when it all goes down, starting on Monday? But before then, an extraordinary warning from the judge, today, about Michael Cohen's big mouth. There are also new questions tonight about the killing of a Black U.S. service member, shot by police inside his own home, seconds after the Senior Airman opened the door. That moment is captured on camera, and it's shocking. That Airman's mother is here tonight, along with their attorney, Ben Crump. And if a solar eclipse wasn't enough for you, an extreme solar storm is hitting the planet, right now. It is the biggest in more than two decades with the potential to wreak havoc on our power grids and our GPS systems. Also, putting on a spectacular light show. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. It has all been leading up to what is coming on Monday. David Pecker; Hope Hicks; Stormy Daniels; Madeleine Westerhout, who was Donald Trump's former White House gatekeeper, wrapping up her testimony today; all of their testimony is laying the groundwork for you know who. Michael Cohen expected to take the stand, when the Trump hush money trial resumes on Monday, and speak to the very payment that he helped negotiate before the 2016 election. Remember, he went to prison, in connection with this payment. And buckle up, because if this week was any indication, it is going to be a scene. And Cohen himself appears to be leaning in.

The judge denied the request by Trump's legal team. He said that he can't gag witnesses, only the defendant here in this case, and even that's a limited gag order. But he did give Michael Cohen an extraordinary warning, through prosecutors, telling them to tell him to stop making any more statements, about this case, or about Donald Trump. He told them quote, \"That comes from the bench.\" In other words, stop talking. But that message to Michael Cohen did not go far enough for the defendant. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There is no gag order to Michael Cohen. What the judge did was amazing, actually. Was amazing. Everybody can say whatever they want. They can say whatever they want. But I'm not allowed to say anything about anybody. The judge is corrupt. And the only thing he gives us is to make him look a little bit good. He gives us nothing. Now what he just did now is a joke. It's a disgrace. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But Kaitlan, the fact that it exists like 48 hours ago, is insane. And just one other thing, I want to talk about with credibility. And Judge Konviser will really elaborate on this.

He was in his apartment last week, when his family says that he heard a loud knock on the door. It was a sheriff's deputy, responding after they got a call for a disturbance in progress, according to the police. Police say that they responded to the correct address, a claim that, I should note, Fortson's family rejects. Facing mounting pressure, from his loved ones over his death, a Florida sheriff released the body camera footage. I do want to warn you that what you're about to see is disturbing.

This Space Weather Prediction Center, which some people may not even know, is this division of government that we have, is now ranking this storm as a G5, which is the highest that the scale goes, and means that it's the first G5 that we have seen since 2003.

So, if you have an opportunity tonight, or tomorrow night, or even Sunday night, go outside, get away from city lights, and look to the north.
