And yet, Canadian officials will make a fine point of saying that, even during the Trump administration, that they were able to get things done.So then if you fast forward here to 2023, I mean, these guys, Boris, Jessica, go by Justin and joe. And given that personal report - as we can see right now, in fact, Joe Biden coming out and he is about to deliver an address to parliament. I want to say that this address to parliament will be historic. In many ways, it's going to follow in the footsteps of Kennedy and Clinton and Obama and Reagan. And these will be the historic remarks, again, underscoring really what is a unique relationship around the world in terms of how close these allies are. But getting back to your point, Boris, about disagreements. Look, these two administrations have disagreements as well. And they will get to the hard facts of that after this address to parliament in that press conference. In that press conference, in fact, they will be able to address the thorny issue with the United States for many years, and that's Canada's defense spending. Given the new geopolitical reality, we are told that Canada is coming to the table with certainly billions more. The issue is the timeline and that involves things like defense spending, whether it's NORAD or NATO or Arctic security. And we expect to hear more on that force - Boris, Jessica?",

Of course, we will bring that to you live as soon as it happens.But again, momentarily, we're expecting the president will address the parliament and then will take reporter's questions a little bit later in the day. We will be bringing both of those events to you live. We're keeping our eye on that. But first, we're going to turn to California, where more than a half million students in the Los Angeles Unified School District are back in the classroom following three days of strikes. The union representing school support workers ended their standoff Thursday, but the contract disputes still hasn't been resolved despite negotiations going on for nearly a year.",

City Mayor Karen Bass is also involved in these conversations.Last we heard, the union is still asking for 30 percent of an increase in salaries plus $2 an hour. And the last offer we heard from the district is an increase of 23 percent plus a 3 percent bonus in cash. Now, the question is, are they getting any close to an agreement? We do not know. Again, these conversations are taking place, but they're not doing it publicly. And as we mentioned, this strike, in particular, the one that took place this week was about workers, saying that they felt that they were being mistreated after they started asking for more money. So this strike that just happened was not necessarily about the salary. So when I talked to the union, what they told me was, look, as these negotiations continue, if we do not come to an agreement, you could see a no other strike. Of course, that's not something they necessarily want. And of course, a lot of the parents here do not want another strike. They were already suffering this week and are very thankful to have these children back in school. Here are some of those moms. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Gwyneth denies that this happened. He says that he skied into her and that she was downhill. No cameras of what happened that day. This is only based on eyewitness testimony. And we're going to hear from Gwyneth, potentially from Terry Sanderson. They're on a lunch break right now. And there you see Gwyneth from the other day. The camera is not on Gwyneth Paltrow anymore. She's asked for the camera to not be focused on her. So really, we only see the lawyers, whoever is on the stand. So when we see Gwyneth it's going to be a big moment.
