They are extraordinary human beings, because even in the depth of grief, 10 years ago, they started to harness that grief, for action, and move forward. Their grief didn't go away. They were able to do it simultaneously. And what they've accomplished is remarkable. Things that people said could never be done. They sued the gun manufacturer. I mean, every lawyer they went to said, as you'll hear tonight, said it couldn't be done. They did it. They won $73 million. They sued Alex Jones, as you know, and just won $1 billion. So, I mean, not only that. They've passed all sorts of -- helped pass all sorts of legislation, at the state level.

BELL (on camera): What the host mother told us was that of all the exchange students, she'd had, at her home, Kenny DeLand was the one that seemed to be having the most trouble, fitting in and settling down to life, here in Grenoble. She also said that of course, since he's disappeared, she'd been inundating him, with messages, to which he hadn't responded. And she added that she had been reassured by that sighting of him, about an hour, south of here, in that sports shop, because she said it confirmed the possibility and her hope that in fact, he'd gone and cut off communications, voluntarily. BELL (voice-over): It was taken on December 3. Kenny DeLand spent just over $8, before vanishing, altogether, according to his family, leaving behind only Facebook pictures, of his life, in France, from Paris to the University of Grenoble Alpes. BELL (on camera): The last time Kenny DeLand turned up for lessons, here, at the university, he was studying at, was November 28. By the 29, when he failed to turn up, a missing persons report was filed, and it emerged that he had left his host family that morning, taking a packed lunch, a change of clothes, his wallet, and his phone. Kenny DeLand hasn't been heard from since. BELL (voice-over): We showed Kenny's picture, around the campus, in the hope that someone may recognize him. When we find Kenny's friends, they prefer not to speak, on camera, but tell us that \"Kenny had friends that were exchange students and some that were local. We care about him and we want him to come back safely.\" Statements that contradict what French authorities have said that Kenny struggled to make friends. KENNETH DELAND SR., FATHER OF MISSING U.S. STUDENT STUDYING IN FRANCE: What I'm telling you is he makes friends and he's easy to talk to, like me. If you don't know my son, then it's tough for you, to make some statement, some bold statement. BELL (on camera): One of the things Kenny's friends told us is that he may have been stressed about the upcoming exams. Is that something that you recognize? DELAND SR.: He's in a foreign country. He's pretty upbeat kid. You know what I mean? So, it's possible. Sure. He was anxious. He was -- he wanted to do good that he wanted to prove that he could get good grades, even on the trip of a lifetime. BELL (voice-over): Kenny DeLand Jr. chronicled his journey, to France, in August. His father still hopes he'll be able to pick him up, as planned, on Saturday. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So, how common are aortic aneurysms? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, they're not that common, thankfully. I mean, the aorta is, as Celine was just saying, the big blood vessel that comes out of your heart, supplies all these other parts of your body. And it's a pretty sizable blood vessel. So, there's different places along the blood vessel, where you can have this aneurysm. Let me show you, if we have this image here. When you look at, where she was describing Grant's aneurysm was, it was right at where the aorta leaves the heart. And that's where that ballooning sort of occurs, and the walls of that became thin as a result of that. That's the image on the right there, Anderson. When the wall becomes thin, you got blood coming out of it, and with a pretty good velocity, it can rupture, or it can dissect. And that seems to be what had happened here. Let me show you quickly if I can, on this model, Anderson, same thing here. Again, the heart, this is the aorta here, in the big red blood vessel. This is the area that had ballooned, and that's right in your chest cavity, around your lungs, around your trachea, things like that.
