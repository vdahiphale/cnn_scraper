Supporters of the opposition leader say he has been found, but his new home may be the worst yet. It's a penal colony known as Polar Wolf. Canceled Christmas, no public celebration of the holiday in Bethlehem, as the horrific death toll mounts, with just two -- with 250 killed in just the last 24 hours alone. Israel's prime minister now vowing to intensify the war. And push for immunity. Former President Donald Trump urging an appeal court to throw out one case against him. Will they accept his argument? We're following these major developing stories and many more. It's all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Vladimir Putin's most famous critic has been found in one of Russia's most remote prisons. Alexey Navalny is -- quote -- \"doing well,\" despite being at a penal colony in Siberia known as Polar Wolf. That's according to his legal team's spokesman. That prison is nearly 2,000 miles from where Navalny was held before. The 47-year-old opposition leader had been missing since December 11, and his team said he'd never been -- quote -- \"hidden\" for so long before. Navalny missed two scheduled court appearances last week. His yearslong protest of Putin was the subject of a CNN film and HBO Max documentary that won an Oscar this year. CNN's Nada Bashir is covering the latest for us from London. Nada, do we know why Navalny was moved in the first place?",

These are some of the victims after a deadly 24 hours in Central Gaza. The Hamas-run Health Ministry says at least 250 people were killed from Israeli strikes; 70 of the victims were at the Al-Maghazi refugee camp Sunday. Israel Defense Forces told CNN -- quote -- \"In response to Hamas' barbaric attacks, the IDF is operating to dismantle Hamas military and administrative capabilities.\" Also today, Israelis' -- Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Gaza, his second trip to the battlefield, vowing to continue the -- quote -- \"long fight\" a day after promising to intensify the campaign against Hamas. The IDF says, since Friday, at least 15 of its soldiers have been killed in Gaza. CNN senior international correspondent Will Ripley is in Tel Aviv. Will, tell us more about what the prime minister said to troops today during that visit to Gaza.",

      "sentences": "Well, he's certainly there to send them encouragement, to say that their sacrifice -- this was one of the deadliest weekends in this 80-day war for the Israeli military, just like it was one of the deadliest 24- hour periods in Gaza since this war began back on October 7.Eighty days, and you have more than 20,600 people who have been killed on the Palestinian side, along with more than 53,000 injuries. And even though Israel's death toll is much lower, they do say that they are adhering, Jessica, to international law, that they are not indiscriminately targeting civilians, but they're going after specific military targets based on intelligence. They say their targeting changes as different intelligence comes in. And they say the fact that Hamas is choosing to position itself in areas densely packed with civilians who are sheltering, civilians who are displaced, that makes Hamas just as culpable for this skyrocketing death toll, this is the Israeli argument, as it does Israel itself. So, despite that we had this U.N. resolution last week that, of course, was quite watered down from the original draft that the United States vetoed, and then there were several delays as they were rewriting it, Israel says they're not going to stop until they obtain their objective, which is to eliminate the leadership of Hamas. And they have not been able to do that yet. Netanyahu in Northern Gaza, where they have essentially obtained operational control, meeting with the troops and saying that this war will continue. President Biden in a phone call with the prime minister of Israel encouraging a more -- slower, more focused, streamlined technique, not such a large-scale casualty type of situation. President Biden, speaking with Democratic donors, did, on one instance, use the word indiscriminate bombing, which would be a violation of international law. But then the Israelis really said that that one reference from the U.S. president is not reflective of their reality on the ground. And so the fighting absolutely continues, and you have a Christmas Day where we have now just had some of the deadliest incidents since this war began 80 days ago.",

And joining us now to talk a little bit more about this is retired Army Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt. Thanks so much for being here on this Christmas Day. We really do appreciate it. I want to start first with some of Will's reporting there. We know that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israeli forces are intensifying -- that's his word -- operations inside the Gaza Strip. What do you think an intensification looks like at this point? BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT (RET.), FORMER U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR PLANS AND STRATEGY:  Well, I think it means probably putting more ground troops in to finish up the fight inside of Gaza, seeing more ground troops to finish the fight in Khan Yunis. I think it also means that they may step up the amount of air attacks that are going into both those cities, because I think that they recognize that international criticism cannot continue at this level. So, the sooner they mop this up, sooner they clean this up, the better. And, candidly, that saves lives by speeding it up, simply because you won't be finding as many days when you hear casually tolls of 250- plus.",

The soldiers need to focus on fighting, because they can't depend on diplomacy to fix this. And so they're going to keep fighting until this war is over. That seems to be certain.",

      "sentences": "Well, Jessica, Donald Trump lost this attempt he had made to toss the charges against him in federal court in Washington related to the 2020 election whenever the question was before the trial judge.And so now everybody's getting their legal arguments on paper for an appeals court, who is going to consider whether there is immunity around the presidency, whether Donald Trump can be tried for his alleged crimes after the 2020 election. So, what his lawyers argued in their filing over the weekend is that Trump should not be prosecuted for things that he was doing while he was president. And what he says is that what was happening after the election, as he was spreading disinformation and wanting to block the transfer of power, that was all part of his official duties as president questioning the election. Now, the special counsel's office has pushed back very strongly on that, and courts have found that what was happening after the 2020 election was campaigning, electioneering, not something that's part of the presidency. But this question still has to be answered by the appeals court. And Trump's team, they also are putting in some of their typical language that speaks to the politics of the moment as well. They're saying it's a plague on the nation to have a former president being accused of crimes like this and that it's dangerous for the country for Donald Trump to be going to trial. That trial is set for the beginning of March, but it depends on how fast the appeals court works here and also if the Supreme Court gets involved later down the line.",

Looking at the prior history of the panel of the Court of Appeals, the D.C. Circuit that's about to hear this, on an extraordinarily fast timeline -- it'll be fully briefed and then we will have argument on January 9 -- that court is likely to throw it out as well. And I think the Supreme Court will look askance at the argument that there's absolute immunity. But Donald Trump's focus is not just on succeeding. It's on burning as much time on the calendar as possible.",

And if you had to guess, you would say 60 to 90 days of slippage. Again, no one knows for sure. But that case most likely will go to trial in 2024. The effect of that case slipping means there are other cases that might go first. And that starts with New York DA Alvin Bragg's 2016 election interference case, which is currently set for trial on March 25. And if the federal case slips for 2020 alleged election interference, then the state case will move in New York for 2016 election interference. And there's two more criminal cases beyond that.
