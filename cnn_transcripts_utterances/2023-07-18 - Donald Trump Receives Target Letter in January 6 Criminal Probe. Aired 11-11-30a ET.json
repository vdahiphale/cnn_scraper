      "sentences": "Yes, you're not joking. I literally did run, John.But, yes, we are learning more about how all of this went down, with Trump's team receiving this target letter. I'm told that the legal team received it on Sunday, including Todd Blanche, who, of course, was one of Trump's attorneys who was in court in Miami when he was indicted the last time and arraigned in the documents case. Now, in this separate investigation, he has gotten this target letter. Todd Blanche was among several of the attorneys who received this letter. One thing that we're also learning is that Trump's legal team has not formally responded to this so-called target letter yet. Of course, as we have learned, these target letters offer an invitation to go and testify before the grand jury should the person who receives the target letter wish to do so. It is widely expected that Trump will not go and testify before the grand jury, but they haven't formally said yes or no to Jack Smith's team yet. So, of course, a lot of the questions here are going to be if this signals that an indictment is coming -- it certainly does -- when that indictment could happen, and, of course, what ultimately the charges could be here. I will tell you one thing that has happened here is, this has caught the Trump legal team off guard. They, of course, had been wondering if Trump was indeed going to be a target in this investigation. They were not expecting charges to potentially be brought for anyone this month. Of course, the timing of all of this is really up to Jack Smith and his team. So it's not really something they could know. But, as they were speculating, that was kind of the thinking. One thing that I do think maybe tipped people off that Jack Smith's team was looking closer at Trump's mind-set here than we previously knew was the fact that they brought in Hope Hicks, someone who was one of his closest confidants formerly, brought her in last month to go and testify before the grand jury that is investigating January 6.",

It looks in to the fake electors scheme. We know he's brought in state election officials. A lot of those attorneys who were around Trump in that period before and after his election loss have been essentially the forefront of Jack Smith's pursuits, Sidney Powell, John Eastman, Kenneth Chesebro. There are -- Patrick Byrne, he was the former overstock CEO who was at that crazy, chaotic Oval Office meeting six weeks after the election. Those are names we know they're also looking at. We have not heard of anyone else who has gotten a target letter so far. But, obviously, that is the next question that everyone is asking if Trump himself has now gotten one.",

And we saw why. It was because of that audiotape that they had. On the January 6 investigation, I think the thinking was, it's such a broad case, there is such a wide-ranging scope here, what charges could they be pursuing? Is it conspiracy to obstruct a proceeding? We know that that is something that they have been asking questions about. I think, when they started bringing in people like Jared Kushner and Hope Hicks, it seemed to change the calculus for some of the people who are reading the tea leaves here. I mean, only, ultimately, Jack Smith's team knows what they are pursuing here, what these charges could look like. I think the Trump team thought that the January 6 case would be difficult. And so that was part of their thinking here. What could -- what did prosecutors actually think they could potentially prove here? And so that remains to be seen what that ultimately looks like. We don't know that he is going to get charged here. Obviously, we believe he will be, if this is based on how the last indictment went. But I think that they kind of had this idea that maybe they would focus on the attorneys here, the Sidney Powells, the Rudy Giulianis, the John Eastmans, those types, and maybe not Trump himself, given the level of difficulty it would be to bring those charges. But, clearly, they are not. Clearly, they are focusing on Trump directly. That's why he got this target letter on Sunday night.",

I expect it has a lot to do with perhaps conspiracy to commit fraud and relating to the overturn the outcome of an election, relating to -- there's a number of factors, the fake electors scheme, perhaps -- perhaps the trying to switch the attorney general out, the pressure on the former vice president.
