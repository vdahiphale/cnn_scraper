Well, just days ago, former President Donald Trump declared he would testify today in his $250 million New York civil fraud trial. But a few hours ago, he changed course, announcing on his Truth Social platform that he will not take the stand after all. New York Attorney General Letitia James responded on social media saying her office had, quote, \"already proven that he committed years of financial fraud and unjustly enriched himself.\" Trump, his adult sons and his company are accused of inflating the value of their properties in order to receive better loan and insurance terms. He already has testified once and his lawyers advised against him doing it again. Former U.S. Attorney Harry Litman explains why.

They are also -- they have also jointly made the decision that they are largely going to defer to another day, making the strongest possible case against Trump and focus on trying to edge out each other to get him into a one-on-one race. You know, they are operating from completely different theories about what it takes to beat him.DeSantis is running to Trump's right, trying to peel away some of his core supporters on the theory that if he gets it down to a one-on-one race, that the voters in the middle will have no choice but to rally around him as the last chance to stop Trump. But that strategy, Rosemary, really hasn't paid a lot of dividends. He hasn't peeled away a lot of Trump supporters, and he's alienated a lot of the more centrist voters in the Republican Party who are the most resistant to Trump. That's left the vacuum for Haley, which she has filled to probably pass him as the most viable alternative to Trump, consolidating those more centrist voters, college-educated voters, suburban voters. But that last debate showed the limits of her approach. But when DeSantis and Ramaswamy really tag-team, went at her from the right, and she didn't have, I think, as effective a response as she did in some of the earlier debates.",

So, if it is inevitable that this becomes a two-man race between Trump and Joe Biden, it certainly looks that way right now, Democrats usually win the popular vote in U.S. presidential elections, but that's not how elections are won in this country. Instead, the Electoral College System essentially puts the decision in the hands of a few hundred thousand voters residing in those smaller swing states. So, what might that mean for the outcome of the 2024 election as things look right now, the numbers?",

No party has won the popular vote seven out of eight times in over eight elections since 1828.Now, right now, Joe Biden would like to have that problem of leading in the popular vote, but having an Electoral College puzzle because he is trailing consistently in polling at this point to Donald Trump, which is something that was never the case in 2020. There was no point at which Biden was trailing Trump. But we continue to see polls with Biden really at a low ebb. And those polls do reflect a lot of dissatisfaction with him. You know, his approval rating is stuck down around 40 percent. It's even been sinking lower. CNN and others have had him as low as 37 percent. But I don't think the polls at this point register fully the resistance that Trump may face if he emerges as the nominee, particularly if he's going on trial this summer. Biden, in all likelihood, will be in a situation where the last few points he needs to win, if he can win, will have to come from voters who aren't wild about his performance, but are reluctant to turn over the reins of power to Trump. The situation they are both in, though, is that, as you know, we are down to a handful of swing states. Forty states have voted the same way in each of the last, at least past four presidential elections, which is the highest share of states voting the same way four times in a row since the turn of the 20th century. We're talking about Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, maybe Michigan as our true swing states and only a handful of voters in them. You're going to see enormous effort in very few places that will ultimately decide how 330 million people go forward from here.",

We're seeing that a key focus still in the north of Gaza is the Jabalia refugee camp, as you say, the WAFA news agency, the Palestinian news agency reporting 45 civilians were killed in an attack on a house on Sunday, another nine in a square.Israel says, the national security adviser for Israel says that they are closing in on a command-and-control center, a Hamas command and control center in Jabalia. The IDF this morning saying that they've uncovered a number of stores of weapons including AK-47 rifles and an RPG hidden, they say, in UNRWA bags, the UN Relief and Works Agency bags, in a civilian residence, also a launch site, they say, containing 50 projectiles. They are making it very clear that the key focus is still to try to root out Hamas's infrastructure and officials however, they can. They are now claiming that they have killed some 7,000 Hamas militants out of an overall death toll that we're getting from the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah of approaching now 18,000. So that is up in the north in Jabalia. Separately, we're seeing very intense fighting in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza. That is an area where there was an urgent appeal by Israel for civilians to evacuate on Saturday. They published a map, we can show you it, which shows very specific areas that civilians were told to evacuate from some five blocks, you can see them highlighted there in orange. They were told to evacuate to shelters to the west of Khan Younis without being very specific about exactly were. [02:24:56] Now this is something that the international community is watching very closely, this tactic, to see whether there is a sign that Israel has somehow changed its tactics, is doing more to protect civilians now that it's also operating in the south, which is where, of course, many civilians from the north have evacuated to. And this is something that Secretary Blinken spoke about in an interview on CNN on Sunday, choosing his words very carefully but still making it clear that what Israel is doing is still not enough. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  I think the intent is there, but the results are not always manifesting themselves. And we see that both in terms of civilian protection and humanitarian assistance.

She really questioned the validity of that.As to what comes next, Secretary Blinken also spoke about that. He said, once the military operation is over, this is not over. There need to be serious discussions on a durable lasting peace, which he said should involve an independent Palestinian state. That is clearly some way in the future. We don't see any sign of this operation winding down.
