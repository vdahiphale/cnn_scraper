In fact, the Israelis are saying there were six rockets that were fired in total. They said at least one of them was intercepted. One apparently fell in the Golan Heights, which of course, is an area that's controlled by the Israelis.And then you had those retaliatory actions by the Israeli Military, and that was actually very important as well. We saw some of that video on our screens just now, where the Israelis launched an unmanned aerial vehicle, a drone obviously, and took out some of those rocket launching facilities. But then they also said that they use their air force, their jets, to then launch strikes against Syrian military targets. Now that's interesting because the Israelis have not said that they believe that those rockets were actually launched by the Syrian military. They believe it could have been other groups behind this as well. But they do say that any sort of attacks on Israeli territory or Israeli controlled territory originating from Syrian territory that they hold Syria accountable for those. And of course, this is something that's very concerning for the Israelis because they've taken rockets in the early morning hours from Syria in the past couple of days. However, they also took some rockets from Lebanon and from Gaza as well. And the Israelis launching some retaliatory action, so certainly very tense, very volatile atmosphere.

So then on top of all these other injuries to his right leg into his foot and ankle, it was just too much for him. So unfortunately, he pulled out and, you know, he admitted earlier in the week that he's not sure how many more Masters he has in him. He's appreciating the time here. He's cherishing the memories and he's finding joy actually playing golf with his son and passing on his knowledge to some of the younger players. So we'll have to see how much more he can play. It's just so hard for him to walk.",

You know, you pay tribute to his dad who died of Alzheimer's by putting a tattoo, having a tattoo on his wrist. It says don't wait to do something.

We're both very tall, very popular. And both frankly white Americans. You know, Jesus did some incredible things. Some would call them miracles in terms of fish in with regard to bread, a lot of fish and bread. He rose from the dead on the third day, I would have done it faster, possibly. Possibly two days. I think we could have done it a lot faster. He had a good mind for business water into wine, pure profit. And he had big, big rallies just like me. And a lot of his followers got in big, big trouble just like mine. All because I told them exactly what Jesus would have said, get very violent and start a war. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I'm Fredericka Whitfield. The CNN Newsroom continues with Jim Acosta after this, but first, April is autism awareness month. And it's a time of year when 2022 Top 10 CNN Hero Debra Vines phone rings off the hook with calls from parents impacted by autism. Since 2007, she and her nonprofit have provided 1000s of families in underserved communities with support services and education that they need to thrive. As the mother of a son with autism. She understands the daily challenges facing those she helps. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DEBRA VINES, TOP 10 CNN HERO: Children and adults they live with autism are very repetitive everything that they do this the same way but when you have a career or parents that have other children and up responsibility sometimes it can be very, very, very, very challenging, like you look handsome. When Autism Awareness Month comes, we are in flux with so many calls and so many families about the what if so, what can I do? Do you have more resources? We learn from each other, you know, the community should be more aware of the signs and symptoms of autism. And I believe that Autism Awareness Month is not just April, autism is every day and so many families. I would like to see them have more resources within the community, within the park districts, within the businesses. With the numbers going up every day. We need support every day. So I encourage families not to give up because you never know when that lightbulb is just going to go off and they're going to hit another milestone, right? My advice help families that have children and adults with disabilities be a little bit more supportive, and to the world open up your heart to autism. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
