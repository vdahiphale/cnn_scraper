Pennsylvania governor, Josh Shapiro, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, are here, joining me live. And meanwhile, Donald Trump is back in Pennsylvania, tonight, which I should note, has the largest Puerto Rican population of any of the battleground states. That as the crisis, and the fallout from his racist rally is continuing tonight, as Trump is describing what happened at Madison Square Garden as an absolute lovefest. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We're live in the nation's capital tonight, where Vice President Harris just made her closing message of this campaign, with only seven days left to go. In the same spot where Donald Trump told his supporters to fight like hell, on January 6th, before they did just that on Capitol Hill, as lawmakers were trying to certify the 2020 results. Harris, tonight, was seeking to remind voters of the deadly assault from that day, while also issuing a call for unity. You can see the crowd, she was speaking to, here in Washington. It was a massive audience there. As she was laying out her view of the stakes of this election, a week from today, as she called on voters who were not just there, but also watching this nationally-televised address, to turn the page from the former President.

He would have walked out on that stage, at Madison Square Garden, after the comedian was done, when it was Donald Trump's turn to talk, and the first thing he would have said is, Hey, by the way, that guy who spoke before me? He was way off base. He was wrong, and I would never talk about Puerto Ricans that way. But he didn't do that. Because, you know what? That's how he really feels, Kaitlan. This is a guy who, for the last decade, has spent his time creating others in our system, others in our society, separating people out, attacking people based on what they look like, or where they come from, who they love, or who they pray to, to try and score some cheap political point. Listen, I am proud to be the Governor of Pennsylvania, where we are proudly the home to 500,000 Puerto Ricans. They have made extraordinary contributions to our Commonwealth, in our workplace, in our culture, in our institutions of worship, in our schools, and well beyond. And for him to basically endorse the vitriol that was spewed by the guy that they picked, to speak at his rally, at Madison Square Garden, is abhorrent. Listen, Kaitlan. Beyond any policy, beyond any particular proposal, we're electing a President of the United States who should, at baseline, be able to meet the standards in which we raise our children, to simply love thy neighbor. He can't do that. Donald Trump is incapable of that. And this is yet exhibit number 12 million, of him not being able to look out for his fellow Americans.",

It was about democracy for sure, and reminding us about the chaos of Donald Trump, and what a petty tyrant he wants to be. And she had good, sharp language about that. Drew that contrast. But remember, she also made this very personal. She made clear the argument for what she wants to do for middle-class working families. She talked about how she's going to help first-time homebuyers be able to buy that house. She talked about our seniors and how she'll protect Medicare, which Donald Trump, by the way, all four years he was in the White House, tried to cut, and J.D. Vance is talking about cutting now. She talked about in this how she is someone who is willing to take on price gouging at the grocery store. And she spoke directly to mamas and daddies of little children, saying that she is someone who is going to invest in child care for all our babies.

She was in the fight against giant banks, that were trying to take away homes, cheated homeowners, and were now trying to foreclose against them. She got in that fight to protect homeowners. Every fight I've seen her in, since then, has been that same kind of our job, as in government, is to help create more opportunity, and to make sure that middle-class working families don't get cheated, and have a real opportunity to build some economic security.

And so, he feels like he doesn't need her. There's an arrogance to Donald Trump. Because he knows that if he were to go out, on the campaign trail, with Nikki Haley, and he pulls off a win? Then he has to credit his success to her, and that he needed her help to get across the finish line. And his ego, he can't handle that. And so, if his campaign was smart, they probably would have been campaigning with her, and using her as an asset, to try to reach those Nikki Haley voters. But guess who is doing that? Kamala Harris. She's been the one, out there, campaigning with folks like Liz Cheney, trying to show, I'm going to be a president for all Americans, moderating some of her policy positions that she's taken, and a willingness to reach across the aisle, and try to have a conversation with these people, and say, If Donald Trump doesn't want to win over your vote, then I will. And so, it's not very smart political strategy, on their part. But it is kind of pathetic that Nikki Haley continues to beg and grovel to want to be on the campaign trail with him. I saw some leaked stories about how she's offered updates, to the Trump campaign, and they haven't taken her up on the offer. But I don't understand why she feels the need to go on the campaign trail with a man, who mocked her husband, called her bird brain, other than she wants to stay relevant, I guess.

There are active investigations ongoing. There's active incident response ongoing at various telecommunications firms. My understanding, that this is not just about senior officials.
