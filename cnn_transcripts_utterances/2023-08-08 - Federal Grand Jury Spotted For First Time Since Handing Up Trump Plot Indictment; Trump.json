The federal grand jury here in Washington, D.C., the same one that indicted Donald Trump last week, is back behind closed doors today, for the first time since handing down those unprecedented charges for Donald Trump's unprecedented actions. It's a clear sign that the investigation into the efforts to overturn the 2020 election is not over. And it raises questions about six co-conspirators listed in the indictment and whether they could soon also face federal charges for their actions. We also just got some new court filings from both Trump's lawyers and special counsel Jack Smith's team. U.S. district judge Tanya Chutkan asked both sides to propose a day this week where they could discuss what restrictions if any should be placed on Mr. Trump's ability to publicly share evidence. But Trump's team is now pushing to delay that meeting until next week, citing his busy legal schedule. Let's get straight to Paula Reid. Paula, let's start with the federal grand jury that met right down on the street today. Do we know how many more witnesses they will hear from and when more indictments could potentially come?",

We, of course, broke the story on your show yesterday that the special counsel interviewed Bernie Kerik. Now, he is a close associate of co-conspirator number 1, Rudy Giuliani. This was a highly anticipated interview. We got a readout from it. And I'm told that he did get a lot of questions, not only about Rudy Giuliani, but also about Sidney Powell, another one of the co- conspirators. But it does not appear, according to Kerik and his attorney, that they gave them sufficient evident to support a superseding indictment or a new indictment against, for example, Rudy Giuliani. And at this point, there are no plans for Kerik to go before the grand jury to testify. But as of now, Jake, we know that the special counsel prosecutors are expected to sit down with at least one other witness and at this point, we're not aware of any plans to bring another witness before the grand jury over the next few days.",

So, when they received the evidence that could be used at a trial. Now, she appears to want to do this hearing this week so the fact that the Trump lawyers are asking to delay it next week, that could be because of their schedules, but we know, part of the overall defense strategy in both of the special counsel prosecutions is to delay, delay, delay. And a delay of a few days doesn't seem like much, but if you do that a dozen times over the course of the investigation, and in this case, you could potentially help push a possible trial into after the election.So I don't know if Judge Chutkan is going to go for that. So far, what we've seen from here, in her scheduling orders, is that she's trying to move this along as quickly as possible. She wouldn't even give them an extension to respond to her about the protective order. So I would expect a decision quickly and I would be surprised if she let this hearing slide until next week.",

And it might seem a little artificial if they were charged separately. That said it doesn't mean that all would be tried together, or thatthe cases would all be proceed on the same schedule.

As we know, this is not a criminal defendant who remains mum and follows the advice of his lawyers to stay silent. To the contrary, he offers running commentary, often zests the commentary on the proceedings, on everything -- the judge, his opponent, the special counsel. So I think they're going to be pushing as hard as they can to help complete freedom to comment on the evidence. My best guests here, Jake, is that the judge is going to come down somewhere in the middle. I would be a little surprised if she approved what seems to be a pretty broad protective order that the special counsel is demanding.

That is such a pocketbook issue, and it really hit people where they hurt. You've got interest rates up. It cost 1 million dollars to get a house. I'm just talking about around here. I might be complaining just about myself, but it's a lot. Everything feels more expensive. And I think that's the issue that they have, is that they have not been able to connect and make people feel like Biden has done something for them.

He staffed the commerce secretary under Donald Trump. He has been involved in that kind of nexus of political stuff that you can do, under the auspices of governor, like moving the migrants to blue places like, you know, whatever, Martha's Vineyard, et cetera. And so, this is obviously someone you trust. Is it going to work? I don't know, maybe, what has he got to lose? But there is a pattern and practice. You remember Donald Trump has dumped a number of campaign managers, it worked in 2016. It did not get him over the finish line in 2020. But if you do it early enough, it can serve as a reset.

Great reporting.And in our world lead, it has been nearly a year since the death, some would say murder, of 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini, a Kurdish Iranian woman who died in the custody of Iran's so-called morality police after she showed just a little bit of her hair. Iranian women, nonetheless, are still courageously defying the regime, refusing to wear the hijab in public. But as CNN's Jomana Karadsheh reports, the merciless efforts to stop these women are getting increasingly dangerous. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Iran's brave women are fighting for their freedom with every day acts of defiance like this, out on the streets without the mandatory hijab. This video appeared to show a woman harassed and called a criminal for refusing to cover up. The days of being afraid of you are over, she said. Nearly a year after the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Jina Amini in the custody of the so-called morality police, the uprising sparked by her death may have been crushed by a bloody crackdown, but not the will of those standing up for their most basic of rights. Countless women have been defying the establishment choosing not to wear the compulsory hijab. And now, the regime is lashing out with a campaign of renewed repression, announcing the return of morality police patrols. IRANIAN WOMAN (through translator): Being a woman in Iran is now harder than ever. Because of all of the attention, our privacy and safety is a wish. You should always be worried and careful about police.",

This chilling video released by a group affiliated with the security apparatus captures some of the terrifying tactics, facial recognition technology being used to identify and threaten unveiled women.Cameras are everywhere, thousands have had their cars confiscated according to amnesty international and women without a veil are being denied access to education and public services. Perhaps even more disturbing is courts have been imposing degrading punishments on women including counseling sessions for, quote, anti- social behavior claiming government buildings and washing corpses in morgues.

A story of generational power and back channel image rehabilitation, \"The New York Times\" reports that former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's sister coordinated with an existing group of Democratic supporters, mostly older women, active on Twitter to help to fix his public image. This was in 2021 after multiple women accused the Democratic governor of sexual harassment.Madeline Cuomo, the governor's sister, reportedly encouraged group called We Decide New York, WDNY, to publicly attack if not smear the accusers, including Charlotte Bennett, Cuomo's former aide who alleges that the governor asked her inappropriate questions about her sex life, claims that former Governor Cuomo has denied. One of the group's leaders reportedly tweeted threats such as this one at Bennett, quote: Your life will be dissected like a frog in a high school science class. This after Madeline Cuomo reportedly encouraged members of group to post photos of Bennett from her Instagram which Madeline Cuomo said made Bennett look like a, quote, bimbo. Madeline reportedly told the We Decide ladies that the governor was, quote, seeing everything but in public she said he was not involved. Though the group's official We Decide Twitter page still states, quote: We stand by New York Governor Cuomo. \"The New York Times\" reports that the group has since fractured a tad. The group's president told CNN today, the board of WDNY will not condone the repugnant behavior of Madeline Cuomo. CNN has also reached to the governor and his sister and a spokesperson said Andrew Cuomo does not personally have nor does he follow social media accounts and he was not directly or indirectly involved in these online efforts when he's had something to say, he has held back from doing so publicly. And his sister Madeline Cuomo tells CNN, quote, to the extent I invoked his name, so the group felt it was appropriate but it was not with my brother's direction or with his knowledge, unquote. Joining us now, the attorney representing Charlotte Bennett, Debra Katz. Ms. Katz, thanks for joining us. You called Madeline Cuomo's role in all of this, quote, shocking but not surprising, unquote.

ANDREW CUOMO, CHARLOTTE BENNETT: Well, we know from this reporting that Madeline Cuomo did what we knew was happening, which is part of a concerted campaign to try to smear and intimidate complainants from coming forward. Andrew Cuomo was a bully. He surrounded himself with people who tried to intimidate and bully women who came forward and this is shocking this behavior exists but it is not surprising because this is the hallmark of the Cuomo administration.

And by doing that, it's called issue one. That's all voters are deciding here today. That would raise the threshold from a simple majority of 50 percent needed to approve an amendment to the state's constitution to 60 percent needed to approve an amendment to the state's constitution. But that's not all. It would also make it more difficult for normal people, citizens to put forward an amendment to the state's Constitution. Right now something signatures are only needed in 44 of the state's 88 counties. If this issue 1 were to go forward, this would require signatures to be gathered in all 88 Ohio counties, effectively allowing one county to block the rules of the rest of the state.
