Sources say the High Court did not disclose existing ties with former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff. Chertoff was the expert brought in to independently review the court's investigation into who leaked the draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade. Joan Biskupic has this new reporting and she joins us now. Joan, tell us more.JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST (on camera): Sure. Good morning, Kate. You know, first, we had this leak of the ruling that was reversing abortion rights that shook the country. Then there was the investigation that concluded last week that said they couldn't find the culprit who had leaked it. Now, we're learning that the expert brought in to vouch for the nearly nine-month investigation that the court had done, former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff had long-standing financial ties to the Supreme Court. The Chertoff firm had previously been hired by the court to do consultations and risk assessments on the justices' safety. We have an estimate that reaches close to $1 million for one of the contracts. And then another time he was hired to advise the justices on how to return to the courtroom during the COVID pandemic. None of these financial ties were revealed by the justices when they held him up with their -- with a seal of approval that he said that he gave the investigation. He prepared a one-page statement that was issued last week with the court's report on the leak investigation in which he said that the court had done anything -- everything possible to find the culprit and there was nothing more he would recommend. The court itself has not commented on our findings, and neither has the Chertoff Group. But it just goes to show how an institution that's known for its lack of transparency, one more time has withheld a piece of information that might have helped with the context for how that leak investigation was revealed last week and assessed by the American public.",

Surely, in Rodney King's case, there was this beating that went on and went on and on, and they were trying to beat him in -- to submission. And as a consequence of that he received terrible, terrible injuries, many of which you probably never really recovered from. I don't think that he ever recovered to go back to being King -- Rodney King than he was before.And so, these kinds of beatings not only adversely affected him in the most damaging way, but it also affected the community as well. Because in those days, look, there wasn't this outcry in support of Rodney King. The black community was outraged, but the vast majority of the community was not because they had never seen this type of beating before. And so, Rodney King was kind of the first time that people could really see that police could in fact engage in the most brutal type of conduct imaginable. And some of it obviously was racially motivated because in that -- on the tape, we could hear during the trial that there was the N-word being said often, but we don't necessarily have that. I don't believe in the present case with Tyre Nichols. And as much as all the officers were black, that doesn't mean they didn't use racial slurs, but it's a different connotation when the officers who engaged in conduct are black versus those in the Rodney King case when there's three of those were white men. And so, you had the stark reality of it.",

I can remember officer Powell was the person talking about Gorillas in the Mist. It was this complete stereotypic notion of the community and it was racially motivated. I would not think that that's necessarily true here in Memphis, but it can't be. Just because it's black offices does not mean it's not racially motivated. Particularly, there's a practice that's taking place of stereotyping the black community and going after people in that community very well can be.So -- but at the same time, we know in the Rodney King case, what we had was these officers were found not guilty. And that was shocking. And I would say that ultimately, we had to have in federal criminal trials, we had to -- criminal crimes and ultimately had a federal civil trial, which I was in. And even in that case, there was justification on the part of the judge himself to indicate that much of what had taken place was lawful and did not necessarily blame the police officers for it.

She was present for that first interview with state law enforcement agents that night that Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were murdered at their home talking to Alex Murdaugh. And we got a chance to listen to that interview. There were some very bizarre points in there, including where he hypothesized as to who could have killed his wife and his son, talking about the boat crash from 2019, talking about someone that they had hired who was bizarre and had told strange stories. But what the prosecution has focused on is the fact that Alex said that he checked on his wife and his son, trying to check their pulse checking on them. And the fact that he was clean, the detective noting -- and I want you to look at this photo taken from a body cam video from an officer who responded. You see that clean white t-shirt that Alex Murdaugh has on. The detective is saying that his hands were clean, his shoes were clean. The defense though, of course, Kate, trying to do cross- examination saying wouldn't that be an indication that he didn't shoot them? Remember, this is a very gruesome crime scene here.
