There's water throughout the basement of this home -- throughout the subfloor of this home. Debris is simply scattered everywhere. And let me show you where this house, which was according to family members we spoke with earlier, lifted basically out of the foundation here and thrown clear across the street, Wolf. That is where that house is now. And we spoke with family members who walked us through what happened. They said around 8:00, the woman who owns this home, their mom, was inside and she called, and she was hysterical. She couldn't get through to 911. She called her kids to say please come get me. The house has fallen on top of me. Fortunately, she walked away OK. The family has spent hours this morning trying to dig out. Wolf, fortunately through all of this destruction, all of this damage, there are so far -- officials are saying there are no fatalities. But there are at least 38 people who are injured, Wolf.",

Israel is our ally. And we should be their ally all the time, not just when it's convenient. And look, Democrats and Jewish people, specifically Democrats in this country, they don't have an anti-Bibi problem. They have an anti- Israel problem and an anti-Semitism problem. And that's what needs to be addressed. It's not Benjamin Netanyahu. And now's the time more than ever to stand with Netanyahu and -- democratically elected leader of Israel, who has been there for us. And to try and point -- paint this any other way is absolutely wrong. And you have Joe Biden, who has leader Schumer out there calling for the removal of Netanyahu. And on the other side, you have the far-left saying let's have an all-out ceasefire. He's got a real problem. And that Jewish voters in the Democratic Party are saying what is Joe Biden's policy? He has to hurt his cattle here on this issue because this is going to be a tremendous issue in the 2024 election, and you have far rights on both sides on this issue. And the most important thing is we need to show support for Israel. Israel had a right to defend themselves. And their enemy, it's not Bibi. Their enemy is Hamas and extreme terrorism. That's what we need to keep in mind, first and foremost.",
