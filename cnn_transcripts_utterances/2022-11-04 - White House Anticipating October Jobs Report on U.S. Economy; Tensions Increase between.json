More jobs is good news. But we are not in normal times, inflation is incredibly high. So what White House officials are looking for is a number somewhere between 150 to 300,000 jobs added last month. And it is this sort of Goldilocks number in that they don't want it to be too low. They still want to see jobs growth. But they definitely don't want that number to be too high because they know that the economy has to cool in order for these high prices to come down and in order for the Fed to stop these very aggressive rate hikes. So, yes, we are in a world right now where the White House is sort of actively hoping for a moderate job number.",

But that is not how voters feel. Just this CNN poll that came out this week showed that 75 percent of Americans feel like the economy is in a recession. So it almost doesn't matter, guys, what the numbers say, what the reports say, what the data show. This is what the voters are feeling right now, pretty pessimistic, a lot of them, about the economy. So that is sort of the political reality that Democrats confront heading into next week, regardless of what the jobs report might say at 8",

I think it's a combination of coming off a tough couple of years of the pandemic, people are feeling anxious about the price of everything going up, all their groceries and their rent, and it's a frustrating time.

Here in New York City people think that crime is number one, 28 percent, this according to a Quinnipiac poll, inflation is 20 percent. The crime rate overall is down, but there are issues when it comes to violent crimes, there are issues when it comes to murder. They're down in some places in the city, up in many places in the city, and in the state as well. What are Democrats not getting about crime? Why are Republicans winning on this whole crime issue?

We've made sure that our red flag laws are tough and there's background checks, whereas Lee Zeldin has opposed every part of that, even voting against the first significant gun safety legislation in three decades in Washington. He didn't even show up to help support our police officers with funding for them in Washington. So they can say all they want, but the facts are on the other side.

I know you're saying they're being disingenuous about it, but that is a real, real factor, governor, you can't deny that. HOCHULRepublicans' ad campaign is, if they're going to say they're tough on crime but soft on guns, that doesn't add up, and I want the voters to know that. But we have leaned hard into working with Mayor Adams on getting more cops and cameras and care for people who are severely mentally ill who have been on the subway. So I was not talking about this in an election environment. We did this back in January, and it's a sustained approach to bring state resources to help local law enforcement, which is something I'm proud of that hasn't happened before. The governor and the mayor of New York never cooperated in the way that we are now. And it's going to take some time. And I know the voters understand this. But nationwide crime is a problem. Our numbers are better in New York City. Violent crime is up, but we look at murders and shootings and they're down about three percent. But that's not going to give anyone any comfort.

I tripled the amount of money for law enforcement. We're supporting violent disrupter programs. To say that you're just going to change one part of the system, it shows a naivete that is not going to be a real solution. So we did make targeted changes to the bail laws covering gun cases and repeat offenders. That has all just been in effect for a few months now because of what I was able to accomplish in the budget.I'm always willing to look at it again, but the data is not showing that that is the cause of this. There are individual cases. But compared to pre-pandemic and when this was passed, I don't think there's a real disparity. But that doesn't matter. We're dealing with people's feelings here. And I understand that. I'm a mother. You're hardwired to care about your children and your family's safety. So voters need to know that we have a plan, we're working on this, and just putting up ads that say you have the answer when you really don't. When you don't think we should be getting guns off the streets, you want to give guns to every teacher, you want guns in the subways, that is just irrational to think that that is going to make people safer. I just think people need to know really what's on the line here as someone who has been working in the trenches, rolling up her sleeves and getting the job done, and not just running around the state saying all you have to do is repeal a bail law and all the crime will disappear.
