They need them to stop Hakeem Jeffries from becoming speaker of the House and as John just points out, seven plus four is 11.  At this rate, Hakeem Jeffries gets a majority present in voting.  So I -- the challenges here are really unprecedented as we've outlined.  TAPPERthat time not only did Congressman Gosar of Arizona vote for Andy Biggs, bringing up his margin to seven votes.

You get yourself out of the process so that other people can figure out where the votes are, and because that hasn't happen. That's going to have -- have to happen today in-- in real time. Either McCarthy's going to twist some arms or someone else is going to whip those votes.

Or they could simply grind it out, ballet after ballet, that is the preferred course of Kevin McCarthy at the moment, saying we plan to vote endlessly essentially until he -- he told me, until he gets no more than four Republicans to defect.  But that is going to be a very tall task, 11 members and counting right now.It's hard to see how they change their mind after McCarthy already had made a number of concessions to give them more power, essentially what they want.  Some of them have indicated to me, Bob Good of Virginia, he won't vote for McCarthy even if they got everything they wanted. So it is really unclear what his path here, for the moment the hope for McCarthy and allies is to let the votes play out.  Let it happen. Hopefully cooler heads will prevail but that has just simply not happened after weeks of negotiations.

He is done negotiating and now that this does poised to appear to be headed to multiple ballots, the strategy here is going to be grinding his opponents down and going through as many ballots as it takes.  Now we'll see how long that is sustainable, but the feeling right now in McCarthy's camp is that this fight with the House Freedom Caucus has been along time coming.  If you remember in 2015, this is the same group that denied McCarthy the speakership and forced him to drop out of the speaker's race before it even went to a vote.  They say this time that is not the case.  They are going to fight this out. He is not going down without a fight.  Jake.",

It's almost rather quaint that he had to step down from his bid for the speaker over that back in 2015.  But look I think it's important to, kind of, pull out the lens here and think about, like, big picture what's going on here, because what did we learn from the midterm elections where they thought this was going to be a red tidal wave, sweeping through the House of Representatives. A real change election that rejected, you know, complete Democrat -- Democratic control of Washington.  Instead what we got was a message from voters that actually they want a little bit of stability and they're looking for people who are going to, kind of, maintain the status quo.That that feeling of being sick of the up and down rollercoaster that was the Trump Administration for four years.  They're still some feeling out there among the American electorate that, you know, we need to kind of get back to governing, to actually functioning and what's happening right now today is really putting on display the fact that Republicans are not capable of government.  I mean I thought this was going to happen repeatedly through two years of Republican control, whether it was  (inaudible), I don't know how many hours on government shutdowns in 2013 or whenever that was.  There's the debt ceiling fight, etc cetera.  My sense that this was going to be governing from crisis to crisis because of this group in the House. I never expected that it would be so bad that right out of the gate, on the very first day of the Congress, that -- for the first time in 100 years it looks like they're be able to even chose a speaker.  And that sends a message to the American public that, you know, Republicans are not in place right now where they are capable of governing the country.  They're simply not and we'll see if they prove if they can figure it out.  Right now this display is poor if you're gauging it based on, hey, can you actually pull the levers of government to make them function and work for the American people.",
