I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we start with this breaking news, the Federal Aviation Administration is now ordering the grounding of certain Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes following a terrifying incident onboard an Alaska Airlines flight on Friday. Flight 1282 had just taken off from Portland, Oregon, when a section of its cabin ripped off. And you can hear the swirling winds whipping through, after a gaping hole ripped open right there in the plane's cabin mid-flight. The pilot was able to make an emergency landing after about 20 minutes. One person was taken to the hospital with a minor injury. The FAA says it's requiring immediate inspections of some of the 737 MAX 9 planes before they are returned to service. CNN aviation correspondent Pete Muntean has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The FAA says it's planning to institute an emergency airworthiness directive, essentially an emergency recall leading to the temporary grounding of these Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes. This latest incident happened in an explosive moment, like the most violent convertible you've ever been in.In this case a passenger jet, where there could have been a door, this plane did not have it. It had what's called a door plug. More on that in a second. This happened with a bang. Seven minutes into the flight at 16,000 feet, what is technically called a rapid decompression where the high pressure breathable air inside the plane goes rushing out and the cold thin air outside comes rushing in. We heard from a passenger that a boy sitting nearby had his shirt pulled off. The oxygen masks dropped and pilots very quickly had to deal with this issue. I want you to listen to the calm in the new air traffic control audio. Step one, fly the airplane. Step two, run the checklist, descend back to 10,000 feet, where the air is more breathable. And step three, communicate with air traffic control exactly what is going on.",

About 150 flights for Alaska airlines since then. This has thrust Boeing under the microscope once again, the latest in a litany of issues with the 737 MAX family, killed 346 people in two crashes abroad, there was a 20-month long grounding in the U.S. that ended in November of 2020.

This could have been catastrophic. So in a way, this was a very lucky failure, and hopefully, it will point very quickly to the kind of corrections that need to be made, whether it's fabrication, inspection, or redesign.

And the pilot and crew did a remarkable job, as you mentioned, with this emergency landing, descending very carefully and slowly 16,000 feet, or at least to the 10,000-foot threshold because of the decompression and making a safe landing.What are among the lessons learned here in your view?",

We all know we had virtually a perfect record last year in the jet airline safety with no fatalities worldwide in the jet field.So this is a rare event. But, yes, keep your seat belts fastened, and in the past, in 2018, we lost somebody. They weren't completely sucked out. That was when an engine failure caused a window to be destroyed, but back about 40 years ago, we had the same thing happen on a wide body and the person was sucked out. When I worked for the air force, we lost an airman who was sucked through an overhead window on a tanker airplane, an Air Force tanker. So, yeah, keep your seatbelts fastened is the one thing you can do. But I really don't think your viewers should panic over this. I believe that this is a very strange and rare occurrence, and I think both the FAA, the NTSB, Alaska and the rest of the airlines, are going to deal with this in a very prompt and efficient manner. I just don't think this is something we need to worry about a lot. But we need to find out why this happened, and that's clearly the role of the NTSB and the manufacturer.",

My understanding is that this window actually exited the aircraft, separated, as they say, from the aircraft. So it would be great to find that wreckage some place along the route of the flight, but they also have the aircraft, obviously, and they can look at the remainder of the adhesive and the metal that is designed to retain that plug.So they do have at least part of the puzzle. They have the part that's still on the aircraft, but I'm sure they would love to find that window and the other components that were ejected. Whether or not it's adhesive, glue, if you will, or mechanical fasteners, bolts, those are all on the table, as they say. They will take metallurgists and experts in adhesives at the factory and at the NTSB. I suspect they'll cut this part out and take it back either to Boeing or the NTSB, materials lab in Washington, D.C., but I suspect that within a matter of certainly weeks, if not days, we'll have an idea of what wasn't done right on this particular aircraft.",

Just yesterday the former president continued to say that the rioters that attacked us, the police, and our democracy at the capitol, that those people are hostages. And if those people are hostages, patriots, political prisoners, what does that make us, the police officers? I mentioned this in my book \"American Shield\", the people who I risked my life for, they are desecrating the sacrifices that myself and my colleagues did on January 6th for political gains, including those who were inside the chamber helping barricade the chambers to keep the mob away with guns drawn.",

Because the actions of myself and my colleagues on January 6th, especially inside the tunnel where I was, I don't think most of them would have made it. You know, when you have thousands and thousands of rioters trying to breach the entrance and only about 40 officers, including myself, me putting my body and life on the line to give them that opportunity to escape, and now that they are safe and sound at home, now they say it wasn't that bad, it was Antifa, oh, it was the FBI.No, it was not. It was Trump supporters, including himself, because he continues to downplay everything that happened. But, you know, as I cover, as I mentioned in my book, a lot of things that I'm saying right now, it's just -- it's just about staying powerful. It doesn't matter who you hurt, it doesn't matter whose life they ruin, like my career, they did that. And, you know, I've served as 17 years as a police officer and in the military, I went overseas and protected this country, so I had done both things they require from us to defend the country, at home and abroad.

All right, even as the winter storm hits the East Coast, a warm start to the winter season is leaving the Great Lakes almost completely ice free. It's the lowest ice cover to start a new year in at least 50 years. The ice cover is usually around 10 percent by early January. Well, this year, it's less than one-half percent according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The missing ice adds to a growing list of winter woes across the U.S. from dwindling snow packs in the West to the snow drought in the Northeast.

That doesn't exist anymore. This is the lowest it's been and it has implications both good and bad when it comes to say commerce. Barges can move a lot more freely. There's no ice jams that would clog up shipping in the Great Lakes region before. And that's good for big shippers and industries that rely on them. But then for lake side communities where ice is part of their culture, we're going to see a slew of cancellations of winter festivals that depend on that lake ice. And another tragic side effect, a 2020 study looked at winter drownings and they go up exponentially in places around the world. They looked across seven different countries and it happens around freezing because it hasn't been cold enough for a steady ice to go ice fish on or skate on as people have been used to for generations.
