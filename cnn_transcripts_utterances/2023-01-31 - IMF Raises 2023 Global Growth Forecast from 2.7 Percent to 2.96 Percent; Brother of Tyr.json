I'm Eleni Giokos in Dubai; I just want to bring in Nic Robertson, who is in Ramallah in the West Bank for us. Nic, we've just heard from the Secretary of State Antony Blinken, as well as Mahmoud Abbas, I just want to go through some of the lines that we heard from Blinken. And what was really interesting to me, saying it is important to describe right now that there's a shrinking horizon of hope, not an expanding one for the Palestinians that really stood out and listening to Mahmoud Abbas, saying that he's willing to work with the U.S. and international community to end the occupation of Palestine. What have you read into this meeting and the outcomes?",

There's a very low expectation on thestreets here in particular, that Mahmoud Abbas can deliver on what he says in principle, because he's lost the support of a lot of Palestinian people. And part of the reason for that is because they perceive him as enabling the actions of the Israeli security forces inside of Palestinian towns, and not being able to protect Palestinians. And this is what we've heard here from Palestinian politicians, and from people on the street here. I think what Secretary Blinken is talking about, this sort of parity of support for Israelis and the Palestinians of a parity of import rights. There's aspiration that Secretary Blinken says that he wants to work towards is something that's absolutely not felt here at the moment at all. The feeling is that United States support tips so heavily in favor of Israel, that they are not really a partner, who's going to support the Palestinian position. That's what people here feel, because that's what they've seen in the past, it felt abandoned by the White House. And it to me at least, and from what I've heard from people today, and in the past $50 million additional aid for a U.N. agency, the support to build a 4g network here. That's hardly going to sort of fulfill Palestinians desires and expectations. Remembering much of the rest of the world it's already moving on to 5g and has it in many places. The fact that the discussion is about enabling a 4g service here really gives you an idea of how far people in the West Bank feel left behind.",

And they have raised their global growth forecasts saying the economy is now expected to expand 2.9 percent this year, that's up from 2.7 percent in October. China is reopening, that's one of the reasons for the upgrade. Richard Quest spoke to the IMF Chief Economist. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PIERRE-OLIVIER GOURINCHAS, CHIEF ECONOMIST OF IMF: This year to the 2023 and next year, we're going to have relatively low growth numbers to start with. So this year in particular 2.9 percent, this is not a super high number.

Now, why is it being so resilient with one point is well, I've already mentioned the labor market with coming out of the pandemic and crisis of the last two years. And there is an enormous demand for labor. And some of that demand is not yet met in the U.S. services; we still have very elevated levels of vacancies. And then on top of that, households have accumulated a lot of savings through this last two years, thanks to policy and also thanks to the, you know, precautionary behavior, and they're looking to spend some of that, so that's supporting the economy.

In the second half of the year, economies like the United States, labor markets, like the United States, were really resilient after a choppy first half of the year. And also the China reopening is a positive for the global growth story. It remains to be seen what it means for the global inflation story, but it is a positive for the global growth story. Couple of interesting things to note here, you have an upgrade of the condition for Russia as well. Russia contracted last year for all the obvious reasons its self-imposed economic misery in Russia in terms of growth, the negative 2 percent, at least because of its invasion of Ukraine. But the IMF is actually upgrading forecast for this year to 0.3 percent. So that's one interesting part of the story here saying that Russia has been able to find other trading partners for its because of the sanctions, that is have kept it, I have heard it from the West. And also that it remains to be seen what happens with that global price cap of the G7 price cap of $60 for exports for crude oil. So Russia is one part of the story and the U.K. is a different part of the story as well U.K. suffering more than the rest of the G7, higher interest rates, rising interest rates, higher taxes, still dealing with how to implement Brexit and a surging cost of living there.",

So you're right, it is sort of interesting there, in terms of what the IMF is saying COVID snapback and China would be a problem, an escalation of the Russia-Ukraine, crisis is still a problem.

We don't have the list of all of those, but that Abu Dhabi holding company actually put in $400 million on top of investments they've already made in it. This is extraordinary, if you just consider how we've seen investors really flee the group and all of their companies. Some $70 billion wiped off the market cap in recent days, following these allegations from Hindenburg research, the short seller of brazen stock manipulation and fraud. And we've had days now of back and forth between the two companies. And yet they have managed as they plan with their FPO. This is the follow on public offer to rise over $2 billion. How? Why? Two key reasons I would say and I think it's very interesting. We didn't see many retail investors in there. It was largely sort of big institutional and non-institutional investors. I'd say one reason is this company, the second biggest conglomerate in India, holds on to massive infrastructure companies. We're talking ports, we're talking mines, we're talking energy. So in terms of the fundamentals, there are plenty of investors out there that want to be invested in that story in India. In addition to that, one of the big problems for the Adani group, and this actually really predates the Hindenburg research attack is its debt load. And of course with FPO, it does help a little with that debt load. And it also dilutes the investment from the top group, largely Adani family owners, Eleni.",

For a while it was quiet but now all that is changing the fighting is coming back. And it's heavier than ever before. PLEITGEN (voice over): The few people remaining those too poor or too old to flee. I asked Valentina if it's not too dangerous to stay here. Yes, it is dangerous, she says but what can we do? Of course it's dangerous, but we endure sometimes we hide, but now it's too cold the basements. The Russians have massively beefed up their forces around Kreminna. They believe they have to prevent the Ukrainians breaking through here to sustain their own offensive against Bakhmut and are now also launching fresh attacks near Vuhledar further south. This video near Vuhledar shows Russian armor getting hit by Ukraine's artillery. The soldiers run away, a wounded comrade tries to crawl to safety. In all these places, drones are critical to detect and to destroy the enemy. Dnipro-1 has its own drone workshop where NATO issue grenades are literally sawn and have to be carried on drone. Here you can manufacture drone munitions in 20 minutes, and they've proven very effective in the conflict. Drone operator is one of the most dangerous jobs the boss says as soon as they locate a drone operator. They use all kinds of weaponry, artillery, MLRS tanks. We have a high rate of casualties among drone pilot. In the forest, Ruslan mission is now over. But he sees a long battle ahead in a contest of wits and brute force.",

We've seen Eleni, you know, just last week, Intel, really sending a shiver down I think the spine and many tech investors, you know, with exposure to PCs and Smartphone's, because there are concerns about demand really falling this year. And it's no surprise that Samsung which both makes chips, as well as actual devices is going to get doubly hit by this slowdown.

They're sticking with older devices for longer, which is a problem for companies like Samsung and Apple obviously.",

DR. DIANA FRANCIS, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR/ KHALIFA UNIVERSITY: Dust storms are weather phenomena that are caused by high wind speed that are occurring near the surface over the Trojan. They will lift small particles of sand, and these particles will be able to travel thousands of kilometers around the globe. CHINCHAR (voice over): In June 2020, a colossal dust storm nicknamed \"Godzilla\" crossed the Atlantic from the Sahara Desert, darkening skies across the Caribbean. It was the biggest dust storm worldwide in 20 years according to NASA. And one of a number recently wreaking havoc across the globe. In 2022 thousands of people were hospitalized across the Middle East with respiratory problems due to a wave of deadly dust storms.",
