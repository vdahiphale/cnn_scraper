What investigators are doing today as they search for a motive and a perpetrator. Plus, it's shaping up to be one of the most interesting U.S. Senate races of the year. Can the state's very popular former Republican governor pull off an upset in reliably blue Maryland? Well, the Democrat trying to stop him joins us live just a few weeks after Democrats gave her a prime speaking slot at the Democratic Convention. And leading this hour, we're just one week, that's right, seven days away from the very first debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Today, we're getting new insights into how both campaigns are preparing, while the Trump campaign says they're ramping up his campaign appearances in the coming days. Harris is gearing up to further lean into her economic proposals as she tries to moderate some of her past positions. Let's get straight to CNN's Kristen Holmes and Kayla Tausche. And Kayla, you've got some brand new reporting about how Vice President Harris is preparing and the new policies we're going to see before she takes the stage.",

In particular, she's going to be calling to increase a tax deduction for small businesses to $50,000, that's a tenfold increase from the current level of $5,000 that businesses currently get to deduct in their first year of operations, and she's also going to be calling for some specific limits on regulations that apply to operational licenses and tax filing for small business as well. We've learned from some of her advisors that she's also expected to go after former President Trump's 2017 tax cuts, arguing, in effect, that the revenue gained from allowing some of those taxes on the corporations and wealthy to lapse should be diverted or used to fund programs that matter to more everyday Americans.But what's so interesting, Jake, about the proposals that she is set to unveil tomorrow is that they favor pro-business, low regulation, some of those traditional hallmarks of Republican platforms and fiscal discipline are reporting to nod to as well. And now this comes, of course, after unveiling her first tranche of economic proposals about a month ago that Republicans broadly slammed for being populist and instituting what they called as price controls. So clearly, she's trying to hit back at Republicans and take a page out of their own playbook before taking the stage directly opposing President Trump.",

But we are told he's going to continue to have the same kind of, quote unquote, \"policy sessions\" that he had ahead of the last debate. Reminder that Donald Trump nor his team like to use the word preparation, instead block off these sections of time that they call either policy time or policy review time, where he sits down mostly with some of his senior advisers, Jason Miller, even Stephen Miller, who is not technically part of the campaign, but has been advising him on various policies, particularly about immigration, for example, Vince Haley, one of his speechwriters and policy advisors. He's going to talk through different policy aspects with them.We are told that that is built into this week. He doesn't have that much of a ramped up schedule yet. Today, he had nothing on the schedule. Tomorrow, he only has a Fox town hall. So, that is supposed to happen in these various blocks of time in between the next couple of days ahead of that debate. But one thing we know is certain they were nervous ahead of that debate with President Joe Biden.

She can make comments that sort of message things a little bit differently, but I don't know that she can really change what the message is or change what the policy is.That's going to be a real challenge for her on the debate stage. But I think speaking to an earlier point that you made, she's not going to be like Hillary. She's a prosecutor. She does not really come back like hide from a fight.

Again, it's the same four charges, but he does have to enter a pleading and he's saying, I plead not guilty.

Those are out of this new indictment. There are some other minor adjustments, but essentially, this is Jack Smith's effort to slim down his own case to enable it to go forward.As for why today, this is a piece of paper that a defendant like Donald Trump files so that he doesn't have to physically appear in court on Thursday.

ATTORNEY: No, Jake, I'm not, because you know the timing now, it's post Labor Day, you know, it's game on for the campaign for the presidency, and it really is not uncommon to waive a defendant's appearance in an arraignment. But as Elie and Katelyn said, it's an important step in the proceeding because, well, when the arraignment happens and that plea is entered, it starts clocks ticking. You know, there's a typical 70-day till trial rule, but that often gets changed when it's a complex case or, you know, there's a need for continuance on either of both sides. So it's -- I don't think it's surprising. It's certainly not surprising that he pled not guilty. You know, he's pled not guilty in this case in all the cases from the beginning. But as Elie said, this superseding indictment is a bit of a leaner, meaner document. It is an attempt by Jack Smith to excise all of the verbiage and counts that related to the defendant's activities as president. Because, as we know, the United States Supreme Court gave a wide ranging immunity opinion this year. So we'll see if it holds up. [17:20:29] TAPPER: And Elie, in a separate case, a federal judge denied former President Trump's request to move the New York hush money case into federal court, finding that there's nothing in the Supreme Court's immunity ruling that alters his view of the facts that were -- that the payments were, quote, \"private, unofficial acts.\" Can you explain this?",

One of the things Trump was trying to do was get the federal courts to take his case, because he's saying, well, we have this new Supreme Court immunity case, I want to make an immunity defense through the hush money case, because some a little bit of the evidence in that case had to do with when Donald Trump is president. But now a federal court at the moment, is saying, no, you can't bring that case over here. But Trump's also trying another way to sidetrack his sentencing. He's asking Judge Merchan in the Manhattan case, he's saying, I want you to throw out the verdict because of the immunity, I get to appeal before you sentence me.And the DA has said we're fine either way.
