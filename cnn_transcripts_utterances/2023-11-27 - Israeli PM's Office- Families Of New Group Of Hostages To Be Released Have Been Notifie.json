Actually, the last one to see her was her father, who was locked in the bathroom.And he hid there for the entire day. He saw her through the cracks in the window as she was kidnapped from the house. That's the last we know of her for sure. And we now understand that she is considered kidnapped, in the hands of Hamas, but we can't really be sure. Because, as you know, some other hostages were -- they have been described as kidnapped by Hamas but now their status is different. But we understand -- we believe that she is alive and kidnapped by Hamas. The story of her sister-in-law, Yardin (ph), is actually different. She was kidnapped from the safe room in the house with her husband and her 3-year-old daughter. They were, three of them, put in a car and driven to Gaza. And a few meters before the fence, they seized the moment and just broke out of the car, started running. And she was holding the baby in the arms and understood she couldn't run fast enough so gave to her husband and said run. He took a last look behind his back and he saw Yardin (ph) and she was hiding behind a tree. That's the last time he saw her. And she's now also considered and defined as kidnapped by Hamas in Gaza. KEILAR: It's an amazing story of the difficult choice she made for her daughter that you described there. When you say the status is complicated, are you talking about maybe not being held by Hamas but being held by another group? Is that your concern?",

Hamas is a terror organization. It's not like a state or it's not an army that holds prisoners in a way. It's just they are using every trick in the book as means of psychological warfare and actually psychological terror, so that we don't know what is going on with our relatives. And they are going to be very, very vicious to us. And during the next few days, we are trying to be prepared for it but it's hard. And this is why we don't get our hopes up. We don't try to imagine them coming tomorrow, but we are getting ready for it as much as we can.",

She ran to their house and she was kidnapped from there.So we're talking to other relatives of hostages who came back asking how it is for them. It's very difficult to come back from such -- from such an experience, of course, and we talk about it amongst ourselves. You know, the hostages' families became a big family. When there are hostages coming back and mainly kids, grandmothers and mothers, I feel as if my own relatives are coming home. And I think many Israelis feel the same way. So we try to prepare ourselves. We try to talk about it. We try to think, what's going to happen, but don't want to get our hopes up.",

And the answer is, we can't.He's given no further guidance on what he meant by approving that, so we have to take him at his word today. What he said today after he visited, he said, \"actions speak louder than words.\" He described what he saw at the kibbutz as being jarring and troubling, which some might describe as somewhat of an anti- -- a bit of a small statement considering the massacre that took place. But did go on to say that when he saw the video of the way in which the Hamas killers rampaged through the kibbutz and he saw they reveled in joy at killing civilians that he described as evil. So that is the scenario, Brianna. You have the tweet on the one hand, you have him agreeing to allow the use of Starlink on the other, and you have his comments.

On Sunday, this commercial shipping vessel that was carrying phosphoric acid, apparently with some public links to an Israel-owned company, sends out a distress call saying it is under attack.A U.S. warship that is also operating in the Gulf of Aden and off the coast of Somalia as part of a counter-piracy task force responds to that call, races to the distressed ship and finds five armed hijackers on board. Those hijackers jump off into a smaller boat of their own. They race away. The U.S. warship gives chase and ultimately is able to apprehend these five hijackers. Now the U.S. military has now said publicly that these hijackers are believed to be Somali, likely Somali pirates. But it's what happened in the hours after that episode that's so concerning to the United States. At about 2:00 a.m. local time, while the U.S. warship was still wrapping up responding to this distress call, two ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen in what the U.S. military describes as the general direction of this specific U.S. warship. Now these missiles landed harmlessly in the ocean, about10 nautical miles away from the ship. No U.S. casualties, no U.S. injuries. But the concern, of course, for U.S. officials is that the -- that this Iranian-backed group, the Houthis, may be seeking to escalate in the region.",

But that said, the Houthis are one of the more sort of independent acting of the Iranian proxies. They don't always take direct orders from Iran. And, in fact, they have launched numerous attacks, both missile attacks as well as drone attacks against U.S. forces in the region, as well as against Israel.
