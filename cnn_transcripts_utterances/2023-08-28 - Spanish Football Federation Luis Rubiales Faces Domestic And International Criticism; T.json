FIFA has slapped him with a three-month suspension for kissing star player Jennifer Hermoso during the World Cup medal ceremony, an act she says she didn't consent to. Now, Spanish prosecutors have opened an investigation into Rubiales, waiting to see what comes of that meeting. But for now, they seem to be backing their president and accusing Hermoso of lying. The world champion women's football team want him fired. They're refusing to play until Rubiales is gone. Most of the coaching staff have resigned. And there are some reports citing other inappropriate behavior by the Federation president during the World Cup final. Atika Schubert is covering this story from Valencia, Spain and filed this report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Euphoric celebrations for a historic Women's World Cup quickly turned into a moment of reckoning. When Luis Rubiales, president of the Spanish Football Federation, planted a forceful kiss on player Jennifer Hermoso during the medal ceremony in Sydney. A kiss she later said she had not consented to. Facing domestic and international criticism, Rubiales was pressured to resign, but he defiantly refused. He doubled down, saying the kiss was consensual to the applause of men in the room. LUIS RUBIALES, PRESIDENT, SPANISH FOOTBALL FEDERATION (through translator): You think I have to resign? Well, I'm going to tell you something. I will not resign. SCHUBERT (voice-over): Hermoso issued her own lengthy response which said the kiss was not consensual at all. \"I felt vulnerable and a victim of an impulse-driven, sexist, out of place act without any consent on my part, she wrote. Since then, FIFA, the world's governing football body, provisionally suspended Rubiales for 90 days and the Spanish government has submitted a complaint to its sports tribunal, a step towards suspending him. What was first a national embarrassment now threatens international repercussions but could well become a turning point for women athletes in Spain.",

In that sense, in a statement published this morning, the prosecutor confirmed that they will contact Jennifer Hermoso in order to let her know her rights as a victim of an alleged crime of sexual assault and to know if she wants to file a suit against Luis Rubiales or not. So, as we see, the pressure is growing and growing against the Spanish football Chief Luis Rubiales, and his family seems to have had enough of it. The Rubiales' cousin Vanessa Reif confirmed this morning that her mother had locked herself inside of a church in the town of Motril, south of Spain, as to show some support to her son. Nevertheless, the pressure seems that will continue to grow at least socially because as an example in a matter of hours at 8 P.M. local time, the organizers of the International Women's Day March will be calling people to demonstrate here downtown Madrid in order to show some support to the female national football team and also to protest against Rubiales.

The Italian military has started transferring the migrants to the mainland. One hundred and thirteen thousand migrants have arrived in Italy so far this year. That's double the numbers compared to last year. The government plans to meet this week to come up with an emergency plan to combat the rise.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADEAU (voice-over): It's the height of the Mediterranean summer and this tiny island is overwhelmed with the arrival of thousands of migrants and refugees. More than 4000 people arrived on the Italian island of Lampedusa in hundreds of small boats over the weekend. Among them pregnant women, babies and unaccompanied minors. It's the highest number of arrivals in a weekend this island has ever seen. More than 113,000 people have arrived in Italy by boat this year. That's more than the total number that arrived in all of 2022. There may be more migrant and refugee boats at sea, but there are fewer NGOs to rescue them. At the moment, the Italian government has sequestered three NGO ships for allegedly breaking a law set by Italy's right-wing government under Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni that mandates how many rescues a charity ship can carry out. Each of the sequestered ships will be docked for 20 days and fined up to 10,000 Euro. Fifty-six organizations have signed a petition against the government, accusing them of obstructing civilian search and rescue and warning that it will lead to more deaths. But the Italian government says without the rest of Europe helping, they cannot manage the influx. UNKNOWN (through translator): Italy can't be left alone facing this extraordinary phenomenon. Italy is the gateway to Europe. Europe must intervene with us. NADEAU (voice-over): Meloni will lead crisis talks this week after the government reconvenes on the agenda, ways to help people migrate legally and ways to deport them faster. In the meantime, the boats keep coming and coming and coming. (END VIDEOTAPE) NADEAU (on-camera): And you know, Lynda, when you look at those numbers, those figures, that, you know, extraordinary year for migration.

Essentially, President Zelenskyy's point is that of course the martial law that we are now seeing renewed every 90 days here in Ukraine prevents political activity, but that the parliamentary elections due this year, the presidential elections due next year, can go ahead as long as allies help foot the bill for that. What he was trying to show was that despite all the major difficulties that will have to be tackled. And you're talking about, Lynda, not just the Ukrainian men and women currently fighting. You're talking about the many millions who fled. Organizing all that will be substantially difficult, a huge logistical task, but it can be done, he said. He was also saying in that same interview, by the way, that what he's going to be seeking with Washington is a bilateral agreement similar to the one with Israel that will allow that agreement to take care of things like military aid, security agreements in the long term beyond, for instance, things that Ukraine is seeking already like NATO membership. Meanwhile, as you say, that counteroffensive cows on just to the south of here. There have been significant, if not substantial gains that have been made these last few days around the town of a village, rather. It was several hundred strong before the war of Robotyne. Ukrainian authorities confirmed this morning that it had been recaptured, but the going is extremely slow. What we're hearing is that Ukrainian forces are beginning to make it towards those very heavy -- heavily fortified Russian defenses have made it in parts to the first line of defense. It is the second and third they'll have to tackle as they try and make it beyond there. Their aim is the logistical hub of Tokmak. They have several more villages to get through before they get there and get their artillery within reach of that. That will be a significant gain if they can get there. But again, every single inch of ground that is taken is a substantial gain. What you're talking about is not just the heavy minefields, but what we've been hearing from the soldiers carrying it out, extremely difficult open terrain where everyone is visible, every single movement is watched. There is substantial air fire from the Russian side, making any advance towards what is a system of incredibly entrenched positions, trenches that have been dug out and built over such a long time. Russians had the time they needed to prepare these defenses. They are bombing them regularly. The going is extremely slow. But Ukrainian forces say they will carry on as they seek to make it to Tokmak, Lynda.",

The incident, which took place on Thursday, according to CNN affiliate CNN News 18, has gone viral on social media, sparking widespread outrage and condemnation. In the 39-second video which CNN has viewed, shows classmates take turns to slap the boy on the face, forehead, and his waist. The teacher, who can be seen in the frame, asks for the students to slap the boy harder for allegedly forgetting his time stable. The boy can be seen crying through the video. According to a statement released by the police, the teacher made some objectionable comments in class. She said, quote, mothers of Mohammedan students don't pay attention to their child's studies, which impacts their performance. On Friday, the police issued a statement saying that a case has been opened against the teacher and that legal action will be taken. However, the teacher, Tripti Tyagi, speaking to CNN News 18 on Friday said the video that has been circulated online was edited. She claims to have been under pressure from the students' parents to be strict with him. She said she is disabled and unable to get up. She instructed the other students to discipline him. Tyagi has issued an apology. Speaking to CNN, the father of the student denied the teacher's claims and said his son has been moved to another school but feels restless and scared. Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has blamed the Modi government for inciting religious violence in the country. In a post on ex-formerly known as Twitter, Gandhi said, quote, \"Sowing the poison of discrimination in the minds of innocent children, turning a holy place like school into a marketplace of hatred.

Now, these appearances will start beginning at 9:30 in the morning. That's actually when Donald Trump is scheduled. They'll go at 15-minute increments throughout the morning, so, all 19 defendants can get their arraignments in. Notably, though, some of these defendants, including the former president, they might be able to waive their appearance, meaning they don't need to appear. That's actually up to the judge. Or they could potentially appear, you know, via video video conferencing, like Zoom, that's all to be determined in the next few days. But yes, that Fulton County case is moving forward here. At the same time, we've got a hearing going on in federal court that started at 10 o'clock this morning, so just about two and a half hours ago, and it's all revolving around Mark Meadows and whether he can actually move his case from the state level to the federal level and potentially get his charges dismissed, although that's not a sure thing. So, as this hearing is going on, we're getting the minute by minute updates from our team actually inside the federal courthouse because of course federal court has no cameras in the court and we're seeing that Mark Meadows in this hearing, he's actually on the stand. He's testifying about his role as chief of staff and talking about why his role encompassed a lot of the things that this indictment alleges. He says that it was his role as chief of staff to be in touch with state level officials and to be involved in the wake of the 2020 election. So, this is all playing out, this is adding a lot of insight to his role as chief of staff. Lynda, he talked about just how difficult this role was. He said he was basically consumed by the job, you know, 24 hours a day. So, we're going to see how the judge, the federal judge, actually responds to these, this hearing, this testimony to see if there's any willingness to move this case to federal court, where Mark Meadows at least believes he'll have a better chance of getting this case dismissed.",

It's one of the worst elections that Zimbabwe has ever had in post-colonial history since 1980. I mean, you've had in the past, citizens, especially on the countryside of Zimbabwe, being intimidated. But this time, it was done in front of international television cameras. They had desks that were set next to the polling stations where they were taking down the names and I.D. numbers of the rural folk that were going to the polling stations to vote. And they were told that if you vote for anyone else, except the ruling party and the president, we will know because we've taken down your documents, we've taken down your name and we've taken down your ID numbers and we will deal with you after the election. And you know, that's a very ominous kind of statement in Zimbabwe because dealing with you can be anything from violence to being killed. In 2008, over 300 Zimbabweans were killed. Some were injured badly through the violence that was pushed by ZANU-PF when Robert Mugabe lost the election by 73 percent to Morgan Tsvangirai who was then the opposition leader.",
