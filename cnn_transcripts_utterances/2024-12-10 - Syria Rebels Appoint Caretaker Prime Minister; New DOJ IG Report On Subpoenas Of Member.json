      "sentences": "I'm Jim Sciutto in Washington. Thanks so much for joining me today on CNN NEWSROOM. And let's get right to the news.We begin with Syria, where the rebels have now appointed a new caretaker prime minister. Mohammad Al-Bashir has announced he will oversee the power transition for the next three months. He also says that Assad era civil servants will continue to serve as ministers in the caretaker government until March 1st. Syrian rebels say they will soon as well name which senior officials from the past Assad regime are now wanted for torture. They have declared a general amnesty for Syrian military conscripts, though they exclude those who volunteered to serve. The collapse of the Assad regime has triggered a punishing military response from Israel. Israeli forces have launched airstrikes at multiple military targets across Syria. They've also deployed ground troops into and even beyond a demilitarized buffer zone inside Syria for the first time in 50 years. Despite those actions, the Israeli military insists it is not interfering with internal affairs -- internal affairs unfolding in Syria. CNN's Clarissa Ward is in the streets of Damascus for us, where Syrians are celebrating the fall of just the brutal Assad regime. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And if they find him to get him back home safely.Now, Jim, the State Department would not say whether that conversation had been conveyed directly or through third parties, but they said they do have ways to get messages to this group, which is a U.S. designated terrorist group. They also noted that there is no legal barrier to them talking to this terrorist group, if it is in their interest to do so.

So there are those questions that are being asked, and I'm saying this because this power, there's not really a power vacuum as such, but the rebels still have to kind of affirm and control, or a certain more control over certain areas of Syria. What happens to ISIS, which we know is still active there, especially what happens to ISIS fighters who are now in prisons in northeastern Syria, which is currently controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces, by the courts.

Now they are telling me, and I believe, sources close to Donald Trump, that they believe there's not only a pathway, but they're starting to see these senators come around. And a lot of that is based on Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa. We know that they've been watching those meetings very closely. Now, Hegseth has been focused particularly on women senators. That'ssomething the Trump transition team is watching carefully, because they do believe that three particular women senators, Senator Collins, Murkowski and Senator Ernst, could be the determining factor when it comes to Hegseth. But when it comes to his cabinet picks, overall, we are not done yet. He is starting to see all of these various candidates up there on the Hill, meeting with lawmakers, and they do feel like its going very well. Kash Patel, someone who is considered incredibly controversial, who's been tapped to lead the FBI, obviously, after Christopher Wray gets fired and Donald Trump is in office, has been having almost glowing meetings with some of these senators, we've seen these senators come out saying that they're inclined to back him. These are senators who were kind of questionable on whether or not they would actually back Patel. So right now, the transition feels like it's in a very good place with these candidates. We also believe its going to be a number of these cabinet picks up on the Hill next week, too. They're going to be cycling through as we really start to see the epicenter of this administration and transition move from here in Palm Beach over to Washington, D.C. as we inch closer and closer to that inauguration -- Jim.",

And when police got there at 8:30 in the morning, the light posts around the hotel, the windows had all taped upon them, wanted posters, wanted fliers, you know, for the different CEOs of the big companies with their names and pictures.

And here it looks like the frame of the pistol, as well as potentially the silencer as well. And the ease with which you can do this now with kind of printers that are available to, to average consumers, not industrial level equipment is really alarming. And I should say, you know, the sites that are promoting these designs and websites, their goal is to undercut federal and state firearms laws. They're not really shy about it. They are saying it. And so as I was listening to your last guest talk about, you know, trying to understand this -- this shooters motivation, the radicalization that other, you know, extremists go through. All I think to myself is these online 3D printed websites are designed precisely for those that are seeking to do war with the government, who want to take violence into their own hands.

What you have seen more frequently, what we've seen tens of thousands of recoveries over the last, you know, five or so years has been these online kits where you -- you buy the unfinished lower receiver or frame and you use some tools, some milling and drilling devices, and then you've got what you need to make the rest of your firearm.Those were very popular. Thankfully, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has a regulation now that has dramatically curbed the presence of those kits online. But this is the next chapter. This is 3D printed firearms, and we're not seeing them by the tens of thousands. But if you go onto some of the sites that host these, -- these prints, these blueprints, you're seeing tens of thousands of downloads. And again, you don't need to be an expert to understand who is this most appealing to? The folks that do not want a background check, do not want a paper trail, do not want law enforcement tying the firearm back to them. And unfortunately, we're seeing this horrifically play out in this assassination in midtown Manhattan. But there are other groups out there right now who are touting their 3D printed firearms that are part of militia or extremist groups or hate groups precisely because they're untraceable.",

It is an extraordinary moment, not only for the history that is being made as the Israeli prime minister walked into this courthouse and then began testifying in his own defense, but also because of the moment at which it comes, with Israel facing a multi-front war. That was part of the reason why the Israeli prime minister sought to delay this very moment of testifying in this case unsuccessfully, though, as the judges ultimately ruled that he would have to show up to testify in his own defense, a process that could take several weeks. [15We expect that the prime minister will testify as many as three times a week for as long as six hours per day, initially beginning with questions from his own defense attorneys, who have been giving him a lot of running room here to make comments about foreign policy accusations against the media, as he really tries to make his own case. But then the more serious cross-examination will come from the prosecution. And there are three cases that are involved in the trial that the prime minister has been facing for four years now. They are case 1,000, case 2,000 and case 4,000, all of them effectively boiling down to allegations of corruption that the Israeli prime minister offered favors to wealthy businessmen in exchange for more favorable media coverage, or in exchange for lavish gifts, some several hundred thousand dollars in champagne bottles, in jewelry and other gifts that these businessmen allegedly provided. Now, the prime minister and his attorneys, of course, maintain that he is innocent. And we have heard the prime minister already on the stand making his case, defending himself against these allegations, insisting that he is innocent. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Sources say the president and his advisers are working closely with officials from the incoming Trump team to secure a cease and hostage deal to end the war, or at least pause the war in Gaza. CNN's senior White House correspondent, M.J. Lee, joins me now. And, M.J., there's been a flurry of activity again. Trouble is we've seen previous flurries of activity with no outcome. Is it your sense that they're closer this time? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. Jim, you and I have certainly discussed many times on your show just what a top priority this has been for the Biden White House over the course of this war, trying to facilitate a ceasefire in the Gaza conflict. But as you just said, it has been elusive for well over a year now for all of the efforts that the U.S. officials here have been making to make this happen and, in fact, so elusive that actually, over the last couple of months, the people that are involved and who would be in the know have basically said there have been no formal negotiations to even speak of. But as of the past few weeks, we reported today that these talks have sort of quietly restarted with U.S. officials again getting involved and essentially making a last minute, or I should say, an 11th hour final push to try to get a ceasefire and hostages release deal across the finish line. And as a part of that, and U.S. officials we have talked to would say this is basically appropriate. U.S. officials have been in close consultation with the incoming Trump transition team and even more notably, it has been made clear, I am told, by the Trump transition officials that they share in this goal of wanting to get this war to end before January 20th, when incoming president Donald Trump will be sworn back into office. You know, President Biden and former president, the incoming president, Donald Trump, they may not actually seem to agree on much, but this is clearly an area, Jim, where the two actually see eye to eye and have a shared goal. They would like this conflict to be over. This has been top of mind for the current sitting president for a while, as we just talked about, and it is a top priority for the incoming president, who basically doesn't want this conflict on his plate when he assumes the presidency. And the Trump team has made clear they are supportive of whatever the Biden administration needs to do to get this done, and that communication has been made clear, we are told. And just for broader context, I should say, U.S. officials we've been talking to will talk about the fact that perhaps sort of the environment and the context is a little riper now for Hamas to have sort of the incentive to come to the table because of things like Hezbollah striking a deal with Israel for a ceasefire across the Lebanon border, given the situation with Iran being weakened, Yahya Sinwar having been killed over the last couple of months. So keep all of that in mind as you are thinking about this current White House and what it is doing, and the incoming Trump White House as well.",
