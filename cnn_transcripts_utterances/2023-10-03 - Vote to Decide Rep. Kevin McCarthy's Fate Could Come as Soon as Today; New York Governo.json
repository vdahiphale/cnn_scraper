Democrats are going to huddle behind closed doors around 9You hear from some Republican allies of McCarthy that if Democrats care about this institution, that they will just vote to move on with this resolution. But you hear from a lot of Democrats that they're not going to be a cheap date on this, that they believe that they could get major extractions from the speaker, from Republicans, if they were to help him. And there are many Democrats who don't even want to lift a finger to do that, arguing that this is a mess of McCarthy's own making, that he's the one who allowed this rules package, that any one single member could bring up this resolution to try and oust him. And that is exactly the moment that they have found themselves in. That is what many Democrats are saying. So, right now, something to keep in mind is the reality that the Republican conference is also divided on what should happen. They're going to be meeting behind closed doors as well, not too far away from where the Democrats are meeting. Also, you have some hardliners who aren't big fans of Kevin McCarthy, but are also weighing if this is the right moment to try and oust him. I talked to Representative Ralph Norman last night. He's a conservative. He's in the House Freedom Caucus, also serves on the Rules Committee. He said that he's concerned that if they go forward with this, the implication could be that they would not get to one year spending bills, bills that have been promised by the Republican leadership, and that in 45 days, they could find themselves in another shutdown showdown, given the fact that they will have spent so much time dealing with this on the floor. Because, remember, if McCarthy is ousted, you have a situation where who is the speaker and who would actually have the 218 votes to rise and become the next speaker. That is something that a lot of hardliners, even people who want to oust Kevin McCarthy, cannot answer right now. Poppy?",

Why that park? Why that time? Why this family? And the answer may be he was just waiting for the right moment and the right opportunity with a child who was by herself, not with a group of other children, a lack of witnesses, or the answer could be based on the early hint we got from police that this might be targeted, that there's a connection to that family. So, they've got to peel back not just with Charlotte's family but also through the suspect's information. Was there any connection? Did they ever worked together? Is it possible they knew each other?

So, with a nine-year-old girl, in this case, we're in that ballpark.Kidnap for ransom is not for sexual predators. The money is the motive, and that's a different kind of criminal, and that's a different kind of kidnapping. I ran a lot of kidnappings, particularly in Los Angeles. And the ransom drop was always the opportunity and the worst moment of the case, because you had to decide, do we do the ransom drop and let the person go and attempt to follow them, maybe it will lead us back to the victim. But if you give them enough room so that they don't detect the tail and you lose them, you lose the money, you lose the suspect, you lose your trail to the victim.

He's going to plead not guilty to these three counts. Then he's going to be processed by the federal officers inside the courthouse there and then probably released on his own recognizance. He's facing these three counts as a result of the fact that this plea deal that was hammered out and was supposed to get ironed out in July, late July, just fell apart spectacularly right before the judge, when the judge asked him simple questions about exactly what this plea deal covered. Now, that was a diversion agreement under which for 24 months, Hunter Biden just had to abide by not using drugs, not buying any firearms, and then this would have been over with. Now, he's facing these three counts related to when he bought a firearm back in 2018. He owned it for about just a few days, and according to the indictment, he lied on the form that you fill out when you buy that firearm. He was addicted to drugs. He has written about this fact that he was addicted to drugs at the time. And as a result, the federal law says that was a federal violation. Now, we anticipate that this is not -- it's over after this, because we know the special counsel is still investigating Hunter Biden over his taxes. It is possible that they are going to bring charges in either Washington or Southern California where he lives.
