The area is keeping watch as nightfall sets in.Plus, we're following the money. A man who tracked down where U.S. funding really went in Afghanistan. His warning for the incoming administration. President-elect Donald Trump dictates what role the U.S. will play in global conflicts. And leading this hour, the wheel's already in motion for the new Trump agenda 14 days out from him taking office. Earlier here on CNN, Congress certified his election win and in 14 days, once he's officially back in office, Mr. Trump is calling on Congress to take up his plans on energy, the border, taxes, and much more all wrapped up into one single bill. Mr. Trump says it's his preference. How's that going to work? Good question. Let's go straight out to a trio of CNN reporters who have been covering today's election certification on Capitol Hill, as well as the prosecutions that resulted from the violent attack on the Capitol during the last counting of electoral votes four years ago. First to you, CNN's Manu Raju, live on Capitol Hill. With President-elect Trump's election officially certified by Congress, Trump's now obviously looking ahead, getting his ambitious agenda passed. It includes immigration, it includes closing the border, tax cuts, energy reform, it's what Trump is calling one big, beautiful bill. He also wants to get a ton of his nominees confirmed, some of them quite controversial. Does Trump have the votes for all of this?",

The policy is gonna be enormously complicated and they have to deal with complex rules, particularly the United States Senate to try to do it in the process that allows them to pass this along party lines, not rely on Democrats, but they also have the slimmest of majorities, particularly in the House. So all of this raising major questions.Now, what Trump wants to do is, you're right, he wants to put energy policy, immigration policy, a complex tax overall, also raising the national debt limit with spending cuts as well. All part of one big package. Any of those specific issues would divide Republicans about how to proceed on the specifics of the policy. And then there's also division about the strategy. A lot of Senate Republicans are concerned about this big approach who want to break it up into smaller pieces, including the Senate Majority Leader John Thune. Now, one key Republican, Senator Lindsey Graham, who I caught up with earlier today, is also concerned about the big approach and says that the border needs to be secured first and not just sacrifice that for tax cuts.

Wants it potentially by the president's desk by late April, early May. But in talking to Republicans alike, that is incredibly an enormous undertaking to try to get this through, Jake.Not only because of the complex rules in the Senate, but also because this would require a two-step approach. They have to pass a budget resolution first in the House and Senate. Then they can actually try to pass a policy agenda. So a lot of questions about whether this can get done. But Donald Trump has weighed in, Jake. He says he wants it done quickly, but that's about to meet the realities of Capitol Hill, Jake.",

The event today, a small amount of people, about a couple of dozen people who are family members, who have family members serving time for their actions on January 6, who are campaigning for those pardons that Paula mentioned. These are some of the reddest of the MAGA base and they want Trump, one, to pardon their loved ones and let them out of prison and jail, and also to pardon everybody. They want absolute blanket pardon from the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers on down with no exceptions. And I think what we're going to see in the first few weeks of this Trump presidency is these J-6 families, as they're known within the MAGA universe, they won't stay quiet if Trump does not act quickly and does not act very decisively on pardoning all these folks. So these are some of his most die-hard supporters and they're hopeful, but they are nervous that he may not pardon everybody.",

So unless another judge stays at the sentencing, as of now, Trump is scheduled to be sentenced this Friday in New York, though Trump did get a concession out of Judge Merchan last week who said, look, I know there are a lot of demands, both physical and mental on your time as president-elect, so you can appear virtually. Jake, he's also made it clear that he's not going to sentence Trump to any jail time or really appears any penalties, but this is significant because earlier today the Trump team tried to get that sentencing delayed.",

So in a lot of ways, she's saying the right things, and she's, again, challenging what I think Trump's team wants to challenge is that they will -- he will be more disciplined in this second administration. His team will be more disciplined and more focused.The question is, what will be the reality that Susie Wiles faces and will she be able to keep a tight grip with all these personalities that Trump is surrounding himself with? Well, you know, we don't have to look any further than Elon Musk. I mean, she's saying she wants no stars, but Elon Musk literally is trying to make himself a player, not just in U.S. politics, but in so many other nations.
