      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, Haiti in crisis, ports remain blocked,and aid struggles to get in amid the deadly violence. Tonight, CNN joins the national police by armored car for unique look into gang control territory. Then at any moment now, we expect to hear from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, he is in Egypt today for high level talks on Gaza, we'll bring you that live of course. Plus, this hour, a landmark lawsuit. The Department of Justice and more than a dozen U.S. states sue Apple, claiming the company has kept a  legal monopoly of its smartphones. But first tonight, time is running out in Haiti. Desperate efforts to evacuate hundreds of Americans trapped amid the escalating violence really continue today. The U.S. State Department says two more chartered helicopter flights from Haiti are expected today, two left from Port-au- Prince on Wednesday and the evacuees were taken to neighboring Dominican Republic. Meantime, while the port remains closed and key roads are blocked, humanitarian groups are continuing to try and provide much-needed aid in Port-au-Prince. And as we've seen from our correspondents on the ground and guests throughout the whole week, schools, hospitals and government buildings in the capital continue to be attacked. Many have closed, and of course, food is getting harder to come by. But earlier today, our David Culver witnessed the desperate scenes playing out in Port-au-Prince, riding with Haiti's national police. He went into the gang-controlled territory, way really offices can, and that is by armored vehicle. What you're about to see from David, it really is a microcosm of what is happening across Haiti. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Here in Port-au-Prince, there are no frontlines. The boundaries, they are blurred and they are constantly shifting. And when you're with Haiti's national police force, one that is facing struggle and sent back, and diminishing resources, you realize just what they're up   against, and that is constant gang activity. We're driving through areas that are highly contested between different gangs and the police, and they're trying to hold them back time after time. And yet, these attacks are constant and they come at odd hours. The police often, especially with armored vehicles like this, are able to push them back. The issue comes in holding that space and keeping it secure. They don't have enough resources to do that. Many of them have told us that's where an international mission would help. As of now though, they have to go in, push back and then move on to other areas where gang activity has broken out. It's incredible to be inside this tank of sorts and to realize just how much it has seen, evidence of that is along the windows, the glass, bullet- proof in theory, but certainly has taken a lot of beating. David Culver, Port-au-Prince, Haiti. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We had some strong words there that there's a clear consensus on shared priorities. That's what we heard from Secretary Blinken as the group convened the Arab allies or convened. And the clear consensus was around an immediate and sustained ceasefire with the release of hostages. Let's bring in Kylie Atwood who is at the U.S. State Department who was listening in. And what I heard is that   the gaps are narrowing there, Kylie, but there's still difficult work to get there. But that he believes he could -- I  continue to believe he said that it's possible. What do you take out of what we just heard from Secretary Blinken? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, listen, we have heard sentiments   that this is moving in the right direction a few times and they haven't actually translated into forward momentum. But what's significant here is that the secretary sounded positive tones about the forward movement of these negotiations yesterday. He is repeating those sentiments today. As you said, saying that he believes it's possible for a deal to come to fruition here. And this also comes on the heels of us finding out that the negotiations in Doha between Israel and Hamas facilitated by Qatar and Egypt in the United States are going to be continuing tomorrow at an even higher level with CIA Director Bill Burns heading over to Doha to partake in these talks. So, it looks like the wheels are turning in the right direction significantly. The Secretary said once again that the best way to get humanitarian support that is needed in Gaza right now is to agree to the ceasefire, so they can really surge in those humanitarian resources that are needed so desperately right now. The other thing that he said is that they have, you know, been meeting with Arab leaders and talking about what the next steps look like after there is some sort of a ceasefire agreement that happens after a hostage deal comes into place. He didn't really get into the details of that. But one thing that he did comment on was the normalization talks between Israel and Saudi Arabia. He said there's positive momentum there. He was just yesterday in Saudi Arabia. So, he was speaking from his experience talking with Saudi officials on that.",

Trying to force him into foreclosures, if necessary. That process has already begun. So, they have gone and they have told various areas, counties and the city of New York that they have earned this judgment in court. And so, that they will be able to move very quickly once that judgment becomes enforceable on Monday to collect on things like the Seven Springs Golf Course, north of Manhattan, as well as Trump Tower, the penthouse he owns there, a property on Wall Street, hotels, apartments in the city, and some other properties. Now, Donald Trump does not want that to happen. And so, to hold that off, he has gone to an appeals court to ask for help. He is also trying to post a bond that will allow him to appeal and block for some time the Attorney General from collecting on those properties. But he's having some trouble because in order to post bond, he needs help from insurers or from a bank, someone who will give him a loan or underwrite that bond. No one will do it because they want the amount in collateral, that's a half billion dollars. That's a lot of money that Trump doesn't have because his assets are primarily in real estate. And so, he's waiting now to see if an appeals court will throw him a lifeline in the coming hours or days before Monday, or on Monday, we will see more steps to be taken by the New York attorney general to collect, and to freeze, and to put liens on, and to get a hold of those Trump properties that the attorney general says this -- are now owed to the state and that are currently in Donald Trump's possession.",

At the heart of this lawsuit is concerns about what some people refer to as Apple's walled garden, its efforts to keep customers within its ecosystem of products and services. So, for example, one of the claims this lawsuit makes is that Apple is intentionally making it hard for messages to be compatible with messaging on android. I'm sure many viewers will be familiar with texting from an iPhone to an android user, and you see that green bubble pop up, or you try to send a video and you end up with this tiny grainy little file. The DOJ is saying that's an example of Apple using the monopoly power of the iPhone in a way that could harm competitors. It's also accusing Apple of intentionally making it so that the Apple watch isn't compatible with Android so that you have to have an iPhone if you want your Apple watch to work well. And look, if Apple were to lose this case, it could have a serious -- it could have serious implications for the company's bottom line and for its core business model, which is really having the customers buy its hardware, but then also using its software services. So, if Apple were to lose this case, it could be forced to take steps, including allowing customers to download apps from third-party app stores, similar to what's happening now in the E.U., as you mentioned. It could also be forced to lower the fees that it charges to app developers, which has been a huge source of tension among those Apple app developers. Now, Apple, of course, pushing back on these claims. Saying, it's going to fight this lawsuit. And what I found interesting is Apple is saying that the DOJ is trying to make the iPhone more like the Android, which Apple says its customers don't want. They picked the iPhone for a reason. Isa.",

Let me pick up with that little clip that we just played from your -- when you went to Gaza City. You said all the families you saw had a look of fear in their faces. I suspect that speaks, William, to the prolonged nature of this war, but also the devastating humanitarian situation. Just tell us what you have seen.",

Indeed the scenes in Gaza can only be described as utter devastation and destruction.We saw countless buildings, really as far as the eye could stretch, that had either been damaged or totally destroyed. Civilians desperately walking around, trying to meet their basic needs under extreme difficulty and health facilities that are overwhelmed and damaged after months of hostilities.",

It is very difficult to access food, particularly in thenorth of the Gaza Strip, but really across the Strip. Families are surviving mostly on canned food, on dried foods, where they can purchase it for prices that have skyrocketed since the conflict began. There is an increase of aid that is coming in. There is a trickle, but what we need now more than ever is for that trickle to turn into a steady and robust flow of food for civilians in order to avert a famine. And really even the prospect of such a horrendous reality should really be a call to act and to galvanize our efforts to ensure that this can and should be prevented.",
