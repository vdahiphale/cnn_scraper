And the belief was that because of the intense fighting, the extraordinary bombardment by Israel, it was really hard for Hamas to get a sense of where all these hostages are, what condition they're in. And so what Hamas is believed to have been doing over the past four days is going around, getting a sense of where these hostages are being held whether it's different factions within Hamas, whether it's other militant groups like Islamic Jihad, whether it's gangs, and essentially getting a sense of who they have, who they are, what health condition they're in. There is a real fear that a number of them could be dead.

There's no electricity. Food is hard to come by. Fuel is very hard to come by.

Watching a lot of the hostages being released. Moshe Lavi's brother-in-law, Omri Miran, was taken by Hamas on October 7th. Moshe, thank you so much for being with us. I mean, obviously, we have been talking so much about just how joyful the past few days have been for the family members of those who were taken by Hamas and who have been reunited with them. We just saw Thomas Hand being reunited with his daughter, Emily. But of course we do have to speak about what it means for the family members who are sort of sitting on the sidelines, who are watching this, not knowing when they will see their loved ones again, like yourself. I mean, this is a lottery, right? Just in terms of Hamas putting out this list each day as to who gets to go home and who doesn't, it's a really painful lottery. I would just love to know from you what has the past few days been like for you? I mean, what is the hardest moment each day? Is it getting that list or seeing that list and realizing your loved one isn't on it? What is the hardest moment just in terms of watching these reunions taking place, wishing and praying that your brother-in-law is eventually one of them? MOSHE LAVI, BROTHER-IN-LAW HELD HOSTAGE BY HAMAS: Yeah, before I speak of the artist moment, I will say that these videos, the photos, communicating with family members -- families of hostage that have been in contact with me over the past seven weeks brought joy to my heart and joy to our family to see those were united with their families. Although we must remember that many of them still have family members held hostage in the Gaza Strip or had families who were murdered on October 7th. But with the joy, of course, there was a lot of agony that Omri is not part of those who were released by Hamas. And we know Hamas and their accomplices in Gaza continue to play a psychological warfare game with us, the families of hostages with the citizens of Israel and of course those foreign national families or foreign nationals who are held captive. But we will not let that psychological warfare to get to us. We are focused on continuing advocating for the release with all the relevant stakeholders.",

They're not merely male, their fathers, their sons, their grandparents, grandfathers, their brothers, they're meaningful to so many people, so many loved ones, and they should not be only categorized by their gender. But we keep being hopeful. We know that this is just the beginning of possibly additional humanitarian pauses that will allow for more hostages to be released or for any other path that the Israeli government will choose to take in order to ensure the release perhaps non-negotiation path.",

But from that freeze, I also drew a very small ray of sunshine on the top. And I hope that ray of sunshine will continue to grow, melt the freeze, thaw the snow and the ice, and make sure that -- and that will happen only when everyone will return home, and we could perhaps see the day after this war happen, a day that hopefully we could live in peace and compromise with our neighbors, but that day will not be possible with Hamas on the other side of the border, and with Omri staying in their captivity.",

But I hope that you have found comfort in just how much solidarity there has been in New York. People, you know, standing with Israelis, standing with the Jewish community, just given everything that the Israelis have gone through over the past seven or eight weeks. Moshe, thank you so much.
