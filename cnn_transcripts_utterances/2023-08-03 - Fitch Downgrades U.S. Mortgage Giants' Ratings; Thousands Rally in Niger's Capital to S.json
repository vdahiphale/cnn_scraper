      "sentences": "Yes, I think you know we have a big number for private sector jobs, Julia, which sort of weakens the argumentfor the Fed to take a pause. Plus, that sort of double whammy as you talked about with the Fitch downgrade. And then the increased estimate for borrowing from the Treasury for the current quarter, which of course, is nothing, you know, you have higher borrowing and higher borrowing costs. And we already had an estimate, six months or so ago that by the middle of the century, the U.S. was going to be paying more on interest payments on its debt than it is on anything else in the federal budget. So that may well accelerate that path in terms of the markets. I think equity markets are reacting to all of that, I think it's worth looking at the 10 year yield again, because this is now at a 10 month high. And as I said that does push up those borrowing costs and also, if we can switch as well to the dollar because the dollar tends to be Fed by those treasury yields. And the dollar has been rising. It's roughly now hovering around a four week high against the euro. But I want to bring in a quote for you from Kit Juckes from Societe Generale on sort of how to interpret that dollar move. He says Fitch's decision to downgrade the U.S. from AAA to AA+ is dollar positive. For now it pushes us yields higher and the FX market understands that the actual risk of the U.S. not meeting its obligations is even smaller than the risk of the dollar you losing its status as the world's dominant currency. He says the rating will only hurt the dollar if the U.S. tightens fiscal policy enough to alter the path of Fed funds. We know of course, the IMF has been pushing the U.S. to tighten fiscal policy. But I think you can see from how the debt ceiling debacle went down several months ago that that is going to prove extremely difficult. And just for perspective, Julia, I want to show you the Fitch Ratings for all of the G7 countries. The U.S. has now lost the tough spot Germany is the only one left with A, I don't know if that's the right, the right graphic there. But maybe we can bring it up Germany is the only one left with that top AAA rating their debt to GDP ratio is just a little over half of what the U.S. is at about 69 percent. The U.S. now is on a par with Canada there. So that is something to look at all those still we should know the AA+ a very solid credit rating still very much investment grade.",

But I think the message from Fitch is that America is not acting politically, norfiscally like a AAA credit rating but don't forget their superpower, which is the power of the dollar being used around the world and in a crisis. What do you buy? You don't go to AAA rated Germany, you go to America and that hasn't changed. Clare Sebastian, thank you for that. Now, Fitches Co- Head of America's sovereign ratings. Richard Francis, as I mentioned will join us later in the show to discuss all of this, in the meantime, more foreign evacuations, in Niger. The United States now, ordering some of its embassy staff and family members to leave the country in the aftermath of a military coup. The President Biden also calling for the immediate release of the country's President saying the Nigerien people have the right to choose their leaders. Meanwhile, one of the coup leaders meeting with the junta of neighboring Mali, that's backed by Russia's Wagner mercenary group. David McKenzie joins us now, David, the U.S. State Department actually said that the U.S. Secretary of State spoke to President Bazoum and talked to him about the prospect of promoting the sanctity I think of the elected government. How does that square with at least a number of individuals being now pulled from the embassy?",

Right now he's not here. He's not in town yet. He would be coming in from Bedminster, New Jersey, where he has been where he stays most of his time these days. And he'll be coming into this courthouse, essentially not seen by the public assembled outside right now, there's not a huge amount of crowds here. There is a lot of press. And there's a lot of security around the building, making sure that these grounds right here in the nation's capital, just a couple blocks away from the capital building where that Riot took place on January 6, at after Donald Trump held his rally on the lips. We're very close to where that is. But things are not crazy at this time. Because there is so much security, there's so much lockdown here. Whenever these initial appearance arraignments happen this afternoon at 4 pm, Donald Trump will be driven into the building and you won't see him walk in like any other criminal defendant coming here. He will be taken into the courthouse he will be arrested, make sure he's in the system facing his charges. And then he'll be here before a judge, we expect it to be a very short court appearance, one where he'll be essentially just read his charges or told what he is charged with. He may not speak at all, there may be people from the Special Counsel's office not just the prosecutors on this case that perhaps the Special Counsel himself Jack Smith, who oversaw signed off on this case against Donald Trump may be here in person as well. And then the magistrate judge may allow Donald Trump to enter his initial pleading of not guilty, but there are no photos inside a federal courthouse, no video inside the federal courthouse, there will be a lot of opportunity for hundreds of observers to watch the proceedings. But all we will get to see if what happens inside the building are going to be courtroom sketches. And then Trump will be out on his way back to New Jersey and then these kicks off this case to word trial. That could be quite a long road ahead, but one that will be very intensely argued on both sides with legal arguments about whether the Justice Department is properly charging this case, whether Donald Trump has protections around him under the First Amendment, the Constitution and even the presidency. A lot lined up for the future for this courthouse.",

The Fitch decision to cut its U.S. credit rating from a pristine AAA to AA+ still reverberating through global financial markets and helping spark a heated I'm let's see healthy debate over the unhealthy level of U.S. Federal boring. Just take a look at these stats and that perhaps explains why Fitch decided America no longer warrants AAA rating. America's debt ratio as a proportion of its economy size is over 2.5 times the average of nations that currently have AAA rating. Now, the repayments, the interest costs and all this debt as a proportion of the money coming in, or revenues is 10 times the size of the average for other AAA rated nations. And it's not only Fitch that believes all of this is unsustainable longer term. Democratic U.S., Senator Joe Manchin today calling the U.S. debt crisis, a fiscal runaway train. Meanwhile, Washington watcher Greg Valliere, a frequent guest on this show says more. U.S. credit downgrades seem inevitable. Now, Richard Francis joins us now he's the Co-head of Americas Sovereign Ratings at Fitch. Richard, welcome to the show. Oh, boy, you've had a week this decision met with a mix. I think of anger, derision, ridicule even we prepared for that you and the team. RICHARD FRANCIS, CO-HEAD OF AMERICAS SOVEREIGN RATINGS AT FITCH RATINGS: You know, I guess no government likes a downgrade. So I guess some of this was not unexpected, kind of the statements by the U.S. Treasury, for example. So, you know, as I said before, and you just mentioned that the numbers I think speak for themselves, you notice very, very high debt level. We expected to continue to grow high deficits, again, expected to grow. And as you mentioned, the interest burden, especially with the higher interest rates, and the high level of debt is set to grow as well.",

And second, theunparalleled reserve status of the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency, and the tremendous financing flexibility it gives to the U.S. government. These are key strengths and part of the reason we have AA+ rating at this is because of those strengths. What we're saying is, you know, the debt level has it was under 60 percent, and 2007. Now, it's 113 percent. And as you mentioned, it's nearly three times larger than the AAA median. And add on top of that these governance issues and the inability to tackle the situation.

So we really wanted to make sure that we took into consideration of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the impact that would have on the fiscal deficits and on the debt, and also revise our numbers and make sure that we you know, have a, you know, a good forecast. And also kind of take stock of what just happened with the debt ceiling debate itself, and what the resolution means.
