You know, 70-plus thousand people stuck in there.And CNN has spoken to some of those who've managed to get out so far. And they describe a scene on Saturday, everyone waiting for that man to be burned, the kind of climax of this festival. The rain started, and initially, people were dancing in the mud, having a good time. And then gradually, there was a realization, hang on a second, we're not going to be able to get out of this. You mentioned that the sun is right now key. What happens is that is clay. It's a dried-up ancient lakebed. The rain comes, makes it totally slick. The water just sticks on top, which makes it hugely problematic to get out. But also, if the rain, the water is still on top, that means the sun can dry it. And that's what we're seeing right now. You know, there is an ethos of kind of self-reliance around this festival. And a lot of people did bring in everything they needed to survive for a few days. They were planning to be there and a little bit extra. But we have heard that some people were not so well prepared, and it got pretty terrible for people. Their camps were washed away. It's the desert. It got cold at night. And then, of course, Omar, there were some people who walked out, including a little clique of celebrities, including Chris Rock.

Herbert Hoover. JIMENEZNow, Trump left office in 2021 during the height of the pandemic. But when it comes to Biden, despite low unemployment and rising real wages, most Americans are still unhappy with how he's handled the economy, according to polling. This Wall Street Journal polling shows that only 37% approve, while 59% disapprove. Now, when you look at the GOP field, President Trump, former President Trump, no surprise. Way out ahead of everyone else, 58%, the closest Ron de Santis at 16%, that's according to a CNN poll of polls. And when you put Trump against Biden, they're both in a dead heat when it comes to a face-off, potentially, in a general election. But the key block right there, that undecided 8%. And then a key issue between the two, President Biden in his 80s, Trump in his late 70s. Age is a big issue. The new polling shows 73% think Biden is too old for the job, while only 47% think Trump has too many birthdays under his belt. Now, 46%, let's look at the mental acuity, mental fitness part of things, partly related to, of course, the age considerations that 36% say Biden is up for the job, 46% say for former -- President Trump. Now, the White House continues to push back on the age and economy questions, with one advisor saying, most Americans approve of the components inside Bidenomics, underscoring the challenges that they may have with messaging, especially as we get out into the campaign trail.",

And this is where there's this disjunction between reality and perception that's as large as I've ever seen in my career.The poll you were just describing about asked people, do you think the economy has gotten better or worse over the past two years? And there's no question on this, by the way, unemployment is down, inflation is down, economic growth is up, real wages are up, everything has gotten better over the past two years. Two years ago, was 2021, it was a miserable time. Yet only 28% of people say that things have gotten better over the past two years. A big part of that is there's this enormous partisan gap. It's gotten to the point where it's almost pointless asking Republicans how they feel about the economy. Only 7% of them were willing to admit that the economy had gotten better over the past two years.
