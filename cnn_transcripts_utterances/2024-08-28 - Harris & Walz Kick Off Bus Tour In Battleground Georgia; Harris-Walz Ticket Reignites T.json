I'll be joined live by the man in charge of dashing those Democratic dreams. And we're learning brand new details about the failed attempt to assassinate former President Donald Trump.

They just landed in the host city of Savannah, Georgia, where they'll kick off a bus tour through rural and southern parts of the battleground state. Touring this area is a lesson learned from President Joe Biden's very narrow 2020 victory in Georgia. Metro Atlanta's bluest counties may not be enough to pull off a win in the Peach State. They're going to need some more throughout the state. And tomorrow, during this trip, Harris and Walz will sit with CNN's Dana Bash for their first major interviews since President Joe Biden ended his presidential bid. We start things off with CNN's Priscilla Alvarez who's in Savannah, Georgia. Priscilla, the vice president and Governor Walz, just arrived. What do we expect to see and hear from them on this bus tour over the next two days?",

But it's where they're going that is notable about this visit to this critical battleground state. Of course, they're hitting southern -- south Georgia with its rural counties. And it's a page from a playbook from Senator Warnock back in December of 2022 during his runoff, where strategist and his campaign manager at the time, Quentin Fulks, they tried to peel off voters from Republicans.And Quentin Fulks is now the deputy campaign manager for the Harris campaign, and when I spoke to him, he told me that he thinks that he can use a similar strategy in Georgia this time around. Again, what this boils down to is essentially winning big in metro Atlanta, but also trying to close margins with Republicans, essentially losing by less in South Georgia. By doing that, the campaign thinks that they have a path to victory in this state, a state that as you mentioned, President Biden only narrowly won in 2020. Now, of course, strategists I've spoken with also say there could be a Tim Walz factor in all of this, too, and that's going to be critical as they both hit the stops today and tomorrow. And that factor is the fact that he comes from a rural upbringing. He has roots and football and his military background and how does that resonate with voters. That is what strategists say that they are focused on. But again, Phil, certainly a critical time for this campaign in a place unlikely, but when they think they can make in roads in.",

They would do better, of course, to ask for consistency and logic from their own candidate. But that notwithstanding I think she's quite capable of doing so. If you saw her speech at the convention, she laid out basic elements of her vision, but she also wanted to communicate to people I care about. Remember, I think it was Maya Angelou who said people won't remember what you say about that. Remember how you made them feel. Now it's not that feeling as a substitute emotion as a substitute for serious concrete forensic analysis and policy, but it does suggest that given the history of this country recently with President Trump having so disrupted, the politics and the protocols of normal everyday existence, her presence is a reassuring one.

You can remove the barrel. Then there's just a lower receiver side-by-side with a backpack. You could see you could fit all of that in the backpack. And now, you're not a guy walking around with a rifle that's over three feet long, you're a guy walking around with a backpack and these elements are inside and could be assembled. We also learned about the explosive devices that were found in the trunk of the car and we learned some really interesting things about how long he had been studying these things, including, you know, making a device, going back to 2019 even. We learned he got up onto the roof by climbing on that air conditioning unit we just saw and then boosting himself up.

So you have a little suicide by cop built in. So what we find with these characters, you know, in the research of each one and the interviews with those who survived is that they often had the plan to do an attack before they had the why. In this case, we know that from the FBI briefing today, he researched Donald Trump. He researched Joe Biden. He researched a number of other people, but not as much in the political swirl.

There is no evidence that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are purposefully trying to mess with his Secret Service. I will say, however, though, that this is an unprecedented election and the idea that you have a former president than it was a former president versus a current sitting president. Now, of course, it's Vice President Harris he's facing against, that is put a lot of strain on Secret Service. We've heard that through our extensive reporting on what had happened at Butler.

According to NPR, Trump campaign staff, quote, verbally abused and pushed a cemetery official who tried to stop campaign staffers from taking pictures. Trump's running mate, Senator J.D. Vance, just spoke in Pennsylvania and said this about the Abbey Gate bombing. Take a listen. I'll go ahead and read that, we're trying to get the actual specific sound, and what he said according to our reporters on the ground: Kamala Harris is disgraceful. We're going to talk about the story oh, story out of those 13 brave innocent Americans who lost their lives, is that Kamala Harris has so asleep at the wheel that she won't even do an investigation into what happened.

So Mr. Trump has disrespected the most important heroes in American history at that graveyard, 400,000 of them. So, of course, I don't like Trump anyway, I'm inclined to believe it. So I think Matt's right. We should have more transparency from the Army. The Trump campaigns spokesman alleged that the Arlington National Cemetery official, quote, clearly suffering from a mental health episode. I want to know -- I want to know.

I think the main incident was that one there is the photography, but also the idea of you heard the statement from Arlington National Cemetery about this being, you know we absolutely prohibit political campaigning. They said that they had given them a statement in advance warning them of this. I was told the incident and happened at that scene where they were laying flowers on the burial site and that's really what was in question here. Look, I think at the end of the day, they want to move away from this. They don't want to keep talking. You haven't really seen a lot of people after the initial response last night from Trumps campaign, you're not really seeing a lot more continuation of that from them.
