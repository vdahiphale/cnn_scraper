And he has just given himself the latitude to be able to make sure that U.S. national interest is put first. The other aspects of this, I think, are part of the vibrato of the team here, that the administration does like to raise the tenor on this.

It helps drive down costs for every American. Whether you're spending six bucks on eggs or just trying to fill up your minivan, these are things that are important. We were able to pass that again in HR-2. This is something where we've shown great coalition. And then making sure that we draw down the amount of government overspend. There's a huge way to do this. One, reduce our debt, but also grow our economy. And that's something we are seeing in the extension of the Trump 2017 tax cuts. This is something we want to be able to see extend.

Like we just noted here on water resource management, on being able to control forest fires by proper forest management. I've got family out there helping fight the fires right now. I don't want any first responder to be out there in a dangerous way when the lead up to this has been a government that has been negligent.

But it also, I want to point out, it's as this fire that's coming through these constructions, then hits the fuel that's been growing. We had record precipitation two years ago, more or less, here in California. And that built all of this bush, all of this fuel for fires that now it's just - just waiting to burn. That's how this fire spread so quickly. And we have been quite lucky until, you know, this week when these 100 mile an hour winds end up pushing all of this fire into neighborhoods like this one. Firefighters are still working tirelessly. They're still responding to some calls over here. What we are hearing also, Kasie, they're working 36, 48 hour shifts and it's not enough. There are firefighters coming from Arizona, from Nevada, from Oregon. And all of this as other fires are in the Los Angeles area, not too far from here.

I think especially I'm looking forward to hearing Steve ford, Gerald Ford's son, and Ted Mondale, Walter Mondale's son, read eulogies that their fathers had promised to deliver at Carter's funeral because Carter and Ford were very, very close, even though they were rivals during the election. And then Mondale was the first vice president who really made - because of Carter, had an office in the West Wing. You know, Carter, among many things, professionalized the role of the vice presidency. So, it's really paying homage to not only Carter, but these beautiful friendships and relationships.

And it was, they admitted, largely about his need to feel at peace with not just his four years in office, but 50 years in public life. And there is an acute awareness of an ending here, a threshold, where you're ceding power to Donald Trump. This has to be a difficult moment for, as Meghan and Isaac said, a reflective person, and a difficult moment at the end of a long career.
