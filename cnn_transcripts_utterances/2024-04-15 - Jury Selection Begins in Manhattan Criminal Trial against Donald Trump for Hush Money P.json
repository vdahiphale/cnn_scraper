Certainly not against any civilians. And more likely than not, against Iranian military capabilities outside Iran than actually on the  territory. But again, there are differences between the way that Bibi Netanyahu and his far right government feels about an escalation here, especially because of the potential to then drag the Americans into a conflict with Iran, something that they don't mind at all. And someone like Benny Gantz, who would like to be Netanyahu's successor, has a much warmer and stronger relationship with the Biden administration and would be on the side of restraint, would be on the side of not punting, to have a major response to what Iran did.",

Israel's political system is very divided. Their War Cabinet is divided. So that is where this pivot right now is occurring. That's what it's all dependent upon. But look, you'll remember when three American servicemen and women were killed in Jordan, the United States waited for a week to respond, and that response was telegraphed clearly through the Iraqi government, through the Turkish government, to make sure the Iranians knew what was coming and they were able to prepare and get their people out. And that helped to ensure that we didn't immediately tip into the United States fighting Iran and $150.00 to $200.00 oil and all the other consequences, right? This is exactly what the Iranians were trying to do over the weekend. They waited for a week responding to the Israeli strikes in Damascus on an Iranian diplomatic building against an Iranian military leader. They telegraphed what they were going to do to the Iraqis to the Turks in advance, who got the information to the United States. I mean, if they had wanted to cause huge damage to Israel, they wouldn't have told people in advance, here is when we are going to attack, here is how were going to attack. US, you and the allies, make sure you get it and help these guys, right? I mean, so clearly, the Iranians, were trying to limit the likelihood of having further escalation, but they also wanted to have some kind of spectacular show of force. And let's face it, it is hard to accomplish both of those things at the same time. And this is dangerous, it's a very dangerous environment.",

I will show you this motion that Baldwin's attorney filed in March asking for this case to be thrown out. They wrote that prosecutors publicly dragged Baldwin through the cesspool created by their improprieties. This is an abuse of the system and an abuse of an innocent person whose rights have been trampled to the extreme. Prosecutors again, then responded, calling Baldwin and his legal team, calling them ignorant, calling them arrogant, calling them liars. And one filing saying that to watch Mr. Baldwin's conduct on the set of \"Rust\" as to witness a man who has absolutely no control over his own emotions and absolutely no concern for how his conduct affects those around him.
