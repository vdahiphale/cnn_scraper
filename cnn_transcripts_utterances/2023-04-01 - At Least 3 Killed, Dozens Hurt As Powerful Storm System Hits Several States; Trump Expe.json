Unfortunately, leaving this path of destruction, a deadly path of destruction, we have to confirm fatalities. There were search and rescue operations ongoing throughout the middle of the night. And I want to just set the scene show you where we are. This is the Wynne High School and you're looking at an auditorium this is some sort of pickup or drop off lane for students who attend this particular school. Look at the shrapnel the roof completely collapsed in on itself. And if we take the aerial shots take us more of a bird's eye view, you can almost see that path that tore the town in half, quite literally ripping the turf off of the football field as if the Vortex the actual sucking power from the middle of the tornado took everything in its path and threw it strung up to the sides and literally snapping power poles toppling trees moving houses off of their foundations, if not completely destroying them, scattering them across the neighborhoods here. And I want to show you what we filmed last night because there was active search and rescue operations that were taking place. We spoke to some of the search and rescue first responders and they were going house to house to house checking to see if there was anyone inside and the way that they confirmed that no one was indeed indoors or there was no immediate help, as they would spray paint a green X on the side of the building. All too familiar sight been covering natural disasters for years, we see that it's not something we want to witness.

So you have in each of those cases, one count, two counts, three counts, it's really one bundle of activity, but they break it down in these cases, by each payment being a separate count. So you can get that easily to 30 if you have 10 false statements and they're all misdemeanors, then you have 10 false statements, which are designed to evade FEC, Federal Election Commission reports, that's 10 more charges, if those same 10 are then made to evade tax requirements, that's 30 charges.

These were taken in his capacity as a private citizen, who, like anybody else needs to be held accountable. So whether it's a strong case or a weak case, whether it should be the first case, or the second case, I think the issue that the prosecutors have here is, should we hold him accountable? How should we hold him accountable?

She was described as being a quote, \"beacon of joy to her family, someone whose faith was pure and her prayers were sincere.\" [06:40:00] On Saturday, there will be two more funeral services.

Now, at no point during that call, does it seem that the father knew his daughter had been shot.

I asked him if he had been afraid on Wednesday with his breathing difficulties, he told another joke about a man who said I didn't see death, but I saw it   coming, and it's ugly.So that's difficult. Francis trying to deflect questions, but it was also a moment where he met with some of the public. There was a couple there, very poignant moment, they had just lost their daughter, Angelica, last night, and he prayed with them and comforted them, signed a cast of another young boy who had broken his arm. And of course, we know he was also busy during his stay here in the hospital yesterday, visiting the children's oncology unit, bringing them Easter eggs and rosaries, and even managed to baptize a newborn baby boy. So the good news for the pope is he's back on his feet. He has gone back to the Vatican. He also confirmed to us that he will be present tomorrow, and he will be speaking, not saying the mass, but he will be there. His voice is a little bit soft as you would imagine somebody who's just getting over bronchitis, but he certainly looks strong and in good spirits, we'll see now how this goes, is the busiest week coming up for Easter week. A lot of services happening here at the Vatican, Pope is expected to be at all of them, so we'll see starting tomorrow, because the spotlight is back on his health. He has a knee issue, he has mobility issues, but now we're looking at his speaking and his breathing. But certainly, from just an hour ago, having seen him right up close, he looks in good spirits.
