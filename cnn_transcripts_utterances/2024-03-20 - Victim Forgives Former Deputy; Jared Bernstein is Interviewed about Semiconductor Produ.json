And the courtroom sort of stood silent for a moment.Hunter Elward, one of the officers who was charged and convicted, and now faces 20 years plus one month in prison, actually turn to the two victims and addressed them in court. There wasn't a dry eye at that moment. But over and over again we heard about the two hours of tortured, the fact that the men were slapped by swords, or that the officers and deputies used tasers to see which taser was more effective to put pain on the men. And then they made them shower off to try to hide the evidence. They even stole parts of the video surveillance system inside the home so there would be no video evidence. And, of course, you can't forget the fact the man who faced all - most of the charges yesterday, Hunter Elward, was the man who took his service weapon, placed it in the mouth of Michael Jenkins, and fired a shot, severing his tongue. So, you can understand how high the emotions were in court. But talking to Hunter Elward's father after court yesterday, he told me the reason why he wanted his son to tell the truth is because that's the only way healing could happen. Take a listen.

You see them there, Arizona, Ohio, New Mexico, and Oregon. And with that expansion, they are promising it will create thousands of jobs. Joining us right now is the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Jared Bernstein, one of Biden's top economic advisors. It's good to see you, Jared. Thanks for coming in. So, this announcement today, $20 billion in grants and loans for Intel to expand. Bringing chips, this production manufacturing, back to America has bipartisan support we've seen.",

And he said they're focused on housing prices and food prices. And I had the treasury secretary on the show right after the State of the Union Address and I asked her why polling isn't showing that people give Joe Biden credit for good things happening in the economy. And Yellen said essentially, we need to explain what the president is doing to improve people's lives.

And this time of the year there's a switch from the winter to the summer blend. That puts some upward pressure on price. We had a big refinery come offline in Indiana. It's going back online. So that should provide some relief. And, of course, the conflict in the Middle East has raised the price of a barrel of oil by a bit north of $10 a barrel.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:52:03] BOLDUAN: The 2024 major league baseball season has officially kicked off. The Los Angeles Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres in today's season opener in Seoul, South Korea. Japanese baseball superstar Shohei Ohtani made his highly-anticipated season debut, but in the designated hitter spot. Two hits and his first RBI in Dodger blue, helping the team beat the Padres 5-1. That is the extent of my baseball knowledge. Lawmakers in Alabama passed a controversial bill that would block public schools and universities from maintaining or funding diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The governor is expected to sign it into law. And it would also require public universities to designate restrooms on the basis of biological sex at birth, not gender identity. New data from the FBI shows that crime in the United States plummeted in 2023. According to the findings, America had one of its lowest rates of violent crime in more than 50 years last year. The data also shows that murder rates dropped 13 percent. The sharpest decrease ever. John.",

That blocks that were predominantly Hispanic or black were much more likely not to be tested for lead, but much more likely to be exposed to lead. And so obviously we know that there's no safe known level of lead exposure. And particularly for little kids, it's really concerning. It can lead to developmental delays, neurological problems. And so this is a huge problem. And these numbers are really eye-popping. This relates to - this is 129,000 kids under the age of six.",
