I'm Kim Brunhuber with the latest in our continuing coverage of the Israel- Hamas war. It's 5 a.m. here in Atlanta, noon in Gaza, day three of a fragile planned four-day truce between Israel and Hamas.So far, the pause in the fighting has held. Israel is now preparing to receive another group of hostages today. The government has their names and has informed their families. Further details about today's exchange haven't yet been announced. 13 Israelis and four Thai nationals released on Saturday, but only after an hour's long delay threatened to up end the exchange. The freed Israelis range from 67 to three years of age, following preliminary medical checks. They were taken to Israeli hospitals for care and to be reunited with their families. One doctor said, none of the people examined so far are in need of urgent medical attention, but they do show signs of extended captivity. Qatar has been at the forefront in mediating this truce and said difficulties like Saturday's unexpected delay are to be expected and work through. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: I can tell you that even before the pause began, we were anticipating that this would not be an easy process. We are in a warzone. Emotions are high on both sides and the level of death and destruction that we are seeing is unprecedented and therefore we shouldn't expect for the pause to be easily conducted and for the agreements to be easily conducted and monitored. And we were ready for this and the operation is going here in Doha immediately came into effect. As we saw the disagreements taking place. We know that we still have the two days and our negotiation team here in Doha led by His Excellency, the Prime Minister and the efforts taken by all the officials here in Doha to make sure that whenever we have an issue like this, we immediately jump in. We talk to all sides and get everybody on board and we are able to understand the concerns from both sides address them. And before the end of the day, before the, you know, that there'll be any breach to the past. We have it all settled and back on track like we did today. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the reason for the delay, at least according to Hamas, which of course, abducted these hostages as part of its murderous rampage of October the seventh, was that Israel wasn't sticking to its side of the deal to allow sufficient aid into the northern part of the Gaza Strip.And it was also not happy, it seems, with the seniority, the kind of number of years served by the Palestinian prisoners, who Israel was going to be releasing from Israeli prisons. Now, Israel denied that. And Israel I think was also concerned that on the names of those do to be freed or who were ultimately freed by Hamas did include a Hila Rotem, a 13-year-old girl, but didn't include her mother. Israel, saying that as part of the agreement, it was agreed that mothers would not be separated from their children. Israel saying that Hamas has now breached that. Now, it's worth noting, we don't have the full text of this agreement that was painstakingly mediated by the Qataris. But according to Israel, part of that agreement does include the proviso that parents shouldn't be separated from children. In the end, it did happened. Those 13 Israeli hostages were freed and the 39 Palestinian prisoners were released as planned. And there is the hope and expectation that something similar will happen today. Kim.",

Many of them go from this part of the world, seeking better incomes. And they come from poor farming communities, namely in Thailand. There are tens of thousands of Thai migrants in Israel, many of them working in an agricultural belt, close to that southern border with Gaza and have been swept up in all of this.So yes, some very pleased families. In fact, the Foreign Minister, the Thai Foreign Minister, put out a tweet earlier in which he said, sent out as congratulations to those who have recently been released as well as to their families. And also said that they are preparing to return to Thailand, those 14 Thai nationals. So there were 10 that were released on Friday, and then another four on Saturday. And he also expressed his elation at the fact that they had been released as additional hostages. Now, I do need to point out that this is a separate agreement. This is not the same as the one that Elliot was talking about. This is something that the Thais have been working on. And again, the Qatari Government has been involved in this as well. Previously, the Thai government expressing its thanks to all of the parties involved in negotiating this particular aspect of the agreement. But as for their condition, it is described as stable. They are mostly healthy. The Thai Prime Minister earlier on social media saying that they were in good health and none of them needed emergency care, which is definitely good news, Kim.",

And they simply exploited it. We are dedicated to this framework. On our side, we've upheld all of the commitments that we -- that we committed to. The IDF has not fired on Hamas positions.

And there are many families still hopeful that they will see their loved ones released as part of this agreement.But we've been speaking to many families, many locals here who said that while they are happy and have welcomed the release of their loved ones have many of their friends and neighbors, their happiness is subdued. They tell us that they have paid a heavy price for the release of these detainees and prisoners referencing the war in Gaza and the mounting civilian death toll that we have seen in the Gaza Strip. But of course, this is a very delicate, very fluid situation. And it remains to be seen whether or not the terms of that truce are upheld over the next few days whether we will continue to see these Palestinian prisoners and detainees released. And of course, whether we continue to see the safe return of Israeli hostages currently held captive by Hamas in Gaza, Nada Bashir, CNN Al-Birah, near Ramallah. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
