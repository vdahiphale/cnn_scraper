I speak to President Zelenskyy's adviser about how his country is coping. Then taking to the streets. French protesters demand higher pay as inflation takes its toll. And when hospitals become a threat. How an underground network of doctors is saving protesters in Iran. But first, tonight, Ukraine's president says Russia has destroyed 30 percent of the country's power stations in the past eight days. That's causing massive   blackouts right across the country. Now many Ukrainians are facing cold, dark nights without heat or even light. Russia confirms it launched more high precision strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure on Tuesday. And those attacks killed at least three people in Kyiv. The city's mayor is pleading for people to conserve electricity as well as water. U.N. officials meanwhile say blackouts and the utter devastation of Russia's war will make for a miserable, deadly Winter in Ukraine. Nic Robertson joins me now live from Kyiv. And Nic, just how critical is the situation right now across Ukraine following this almost daily -- I think it's fair to say, drone attacks on energy infrastructure there?",

      "sentences": "Yes, well, Ukraine's energy workers say that they are able to repair most of the damage withinabout 48 hours. But we know that Russia knows the exact sort of layout inside these power plants. They're not just sort of looking at satellite images of power plants and wondering whereabouts is the sort of the most vital and critical and expensive equipment and the best for us to damage. You know, these power-generating stations were pretty much made, you know, at the time of the Soviet Union. And I was looking at a video, one of Dnipro -- in Dnipro today that was -- that was hit today, cut and paste that with one in Moscow, very close to our Moscow office. So the Russians know just precisely where to target them. And this gets to your question, Isa, how deep is this problem for Ukraine? Because if you're going to continue to repair at the attrition rate, and this is a war of attrition on the power supplies that Russia is mounting here. And the attrition rate that Russia is creating, you've got to have the spares to be able to do it, and of course, the manpower to do it. And if Russia knows which bets the target and is managing to hit, the president says 30 percent. Then if they -- if they don't have these big generators and these big spare parts that they're going to need readily to hand, this is going to be an offensive that Russia can steadily over time really turn off the lights in this country, and the heat coming into Winter. So it is critical. But we have heard in the last few hours, from NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, that NATO is going to send in hundreds of jammers specifically to defeat the threat coming from drones. But of course, the power station that was hit in Kyiv today? That was hit by, you know, conventional missiles. So Ukraine really needs those air defense systems as well.",

Well, in Paris, several thousand people turned out to protest as inflation continuesto take its toll on energy prices as well as food. Unions called for a nationwide strike and a push for higher salaries. Workers in several oil refineries have been on strike for weeks. They have yet to reach a deal with the French government. It is causing fuel disruptions across the country. Our Melissa Bell is in Paris for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  The context of this is that for the last few weeks here in France, there have been huge queues at the petrol station, refinery workers going on strike, first of all, because they say they want to have better wages to face the   inflation that is so bad they say here in France. But also because they want more profit-sharing from the energy companies. As a result of the profits they've made these last few weeks. In the context of that, you have this strike that was called today as you say by transport unions, but also some public sector workers, and what they've done is they've had a march as well. The traffic wasn't that crippled in France. It was a lot of traffic, a lot of trains were able to run, but it is more this. A large demonstration on the streets of Paris. There had been one, Sunday, again against inflation and the high cost of living and low salaries. But they haven't thought as many people out of the streets as they've managed to, today. Here in -- we're riding in Nia Avalid(ph) which is the end point of the demonstration of the march. And it's really been remarkably well attended. We hadn't seen these kinds of figures on the streets of Paris in a couple of years. Of course, COVID has made it impossible. There had been some protests about the restrictions. But nothing like this really since the very end of the Yellow Vest protests and the union movements of 2019. And so once again, the French back on the streets, and it is a difficult time for Emmanuel Macron. He's trying to get workers back into the refineries so that the petrol stations can be working once again. But he's also having to push through, as a result of parliamentary division, the 2023 budget by bypassing the vote altogether, and in the hope behind that of being able to push through his controversial pension reform. So it's a difficult time politically for Emmanuel Macron re-elected, you'll remember in May, with a very divided political landscape and wanting to push through reforms in this second term. So this large demonstration, of course, bad news for the French president as he looks ahead to the full season in which he had hoped to get so much through. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Authorities are actively hunting down protesters in hospitals, even in pharmacies, to throw them in jail. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh has details and we warn you, her report has some graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The repressive republic is crushing dissent with brutality that knows no bounds. Kurdish cities like this one bearing the brunt of an unforgiving crackdown, that has left no place safe. And security forces now hunting down the injured. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The injured don't go to hospitals because if they go there, plainclothes police will arrest them. Even in most pharmacies, they cannot go and get treated, because they will be immediately identified and eventually lead to their arrest. For this reason, people are not being treated for their wounds. KARADSHEH (voice-over):  This is a leg of a 14-year-old boy peppered with what appears to be birdshot wounds. Protesters in his town know better than to go to the hospital. His story is replicated over and over across the country. Doctors, protesters and a human rights group tell CNN hospitals have turned into a trap, too dangerous for protesters. A doctor inside Iran who doesn't want to be identified for his safety spoke to us through the voice of a translator. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  They mostly come and recover but most of times they are recognizable by some signs. They come in, ask about patients, if they want to use force. We have to answer them. Most of the time we use fake names or (INAUDIBLE) to help them so that they will not be recognized by (INAUDIBLE) forces. KARADSHEH (voice-over):  Security services are cracking down on identifying people by their horrific injuries they're inflicting on protesters. And it's not just at hospitals. Protesters say ambulances are being used to detain people. In this video, people attack an ambulance with security forces inside. The narrator says protesters are saving the girl. Not knowing who they can trust, desperate protesters are now turning to an Iranian American doctor in New York for critical medical advice over Instagram. DR. KAYVAN MIRHADI, INTERNAL MEDICINE PHYSICIAN:  The pictures they would send me are as basic as fractures and when they're running away from the police versus brutal beatings. People have sent me skull fractures that they're trying to treat in their house. The multiple pellets throughout their bodies. A lot of them fear, spend the next 10 years of my life in prison or just kind of let this broken femur heal on its own.
