Of course, he had agreed to that, then reneged. Now he is saying he will, in fact, do that debate.Harris has not answered about the other two debates that were also proposed by Donald Trump for September. The other thing that was asked of him, partly by me, partly by other reporters, was why he wasn't campaigning more, why his campaign doesn't seem to have changed. And he said that he didn't need to campaign, that he was leading by so much. But if you talk to his senior officials and advisers, they know that's not the case. They know that there's been a change in this ticket and in this race, given the enthusiasm we now see around Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, the enthusiasm that is there that wasn't there for President Joe Biden. But clearly, Donald Trump getting under his skin, what he is seeing on the other side here with Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, part of that being the crowd size. He said there wasn't that much enthusiasm on that side when he was asked about the fact that there was all -- there was more bigger events for Harris than we had seen for Joe Biden. He instead lashed out at the media, saying the media inflated her numbers and downplayed his numbers.

But obviously, this is a very serious issue.And, you know, the region in Israel in particular is on edge. We've got kind of some kind of mixed messages. The Iranian president in a conversation with President Macron of France saying that if the West wants to prevent war, then it should put pressure to get this ceasefire into effect. But at the same time, you have Iran's mission to the United Nations saying that Israel is going to be punished. And I think Iran has certainly boxed itself almost into a corner in terms of the rhetoric that's been coming out. And it does feel obliged to retaliate in some capacity. But of course, the big question is, what will that retaliation be? Where will it come from? And will it lead to further escalation from Israel in retaliation for that? Or will it kind of allow the two sides to kind of leave this for now? But meanwhile, the simmering war between Israel and Iran's main proxy, Hezbollah, continues. Sirens were just sounding the last 15, 20 minutes before I came on air, Max. And so there is still the risk that that that could escalate as well, even if the Iranian retaliation, when it comes, doesn't lead to all-out war.",

Very pleased to have Fawaz Gerges with us today. Thank you so much. I mean, the title of your book sort of speaks to this, doesn't it?  You know, the failure of the West in the Middle East. They're not getting anywhere near a final peace deal. And it continues. FAWAZ GERGES, PROF. OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, LONDON SCHOOL OF ECONOMICS: Absolutely. I mean, I think the overarching lesson is that American diplomacy has failed. American diplomacy in the Middle East has failed to basically bring about the end of the war in Gaza. It has failed almost now to prevent a wider regional conflict. I mean, think about it, Max. In the past 10 months, the Americans have been saying they would like a ceasefire in Gaza, they would like the Israeli hostages to go home, and they want to prevent an escalation that could really trigger all-out war. Now that the war in Gaza has ended and we are now on the brink, literally, there is a race against time between global diplomacy to de-escalate an escalation that could really see a cycle of counter- escalation and a wider war. And I think, I know you've been talking to your reporter about the possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza. I think the devil lies in the implementation details. This is really, so my take on it, even though the statement by the American president and the Egyptian president and the Qatari Amir calls on both Israel and Hamas to basically sign the deal on the table. I think if you look at the details themselves, you really think, I mean, the likelihood, the chances are probably 40 percent and less as opposed to 50 percent.",

I mean, if you want absolute victory, how do you basically sign for a deal about a ceasefire in Gaza? And what does Hamas want? Hamas wants the end of the war, because it wants to alleviate the suffering of Palestinians and survive, politically survive. So how do you bridge the divide between a prime minister who wants absolute victory, utter victory, and a resistance movement, Hamas, that wants really basically the end, the war? This is the challenge. Without really finding ways to bridge the divide, I fear that the implementation phase, once they meet on the 15th of August, as the statement has called on Israel and Hamas, we're going to be in the same cycle of demands and counter demands by Israel and Hamas.",
