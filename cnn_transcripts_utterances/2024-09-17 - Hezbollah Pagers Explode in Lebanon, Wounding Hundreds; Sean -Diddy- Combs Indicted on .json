Of course, Lebanon, since the 8th of October, Hezbollah has been launching rockets into Israel. Israel has been striking back daily. Since then, there has been an escalation going back to late July, when, of course, there was that strike on Majdal Shams, which is in the Israeli occupied Syrian Golan Heights, which left 12 children dead, 12 Syrian children dead. And that has really set the stage for this period of escalation that has -- tensions have remained very high since then. And of course, the Israelis have been concerned that Hezbollah could launch the kind of attack that Hamas did on the 7th on October last year. And therefore, you've seen, for instance, more than 62,000 Israelis have been forced to leave their homes in northern Israel. More than 100,000 Lebanese civilians have left their homes in southern Lebanon because of the exchange of fire every day. And the pressure is mounting on the Israeli government to somehow restore peace and quiet to the border area. And as that pressure mounts, what we're seeing is that the Israelis are putting more pressure on Hezbollah. And this incident, this very strange series of incidents of exploding pagers, seems to fit within the context of those escalating tensions.",

Because obviously this is -- this has just happening at this point. It's very recent and there's no understanding of what exactly has happened at this point. So they're trying to make sure that there are not going to be others that are going to be caught up in whatever has occurred at this point. So the question now is what exactly happened, who was responsible. As you heard Ben there, the -- certainly that the feeling in Lebanon will be looking directly to Israel. Now we haven't heard anything from Israel. We don't know exactly what has happened. I have to caution. But of course, it does come at a time when tensions are extremely high between Israel and Lebanon, when we've just heard from the security cabinet just yesterday, saying that they have added another objective when it comes to the war against Hamas. And that objective is to make sure that they can allow tens of thousands of residents to return to northern Israel, meaning they want to try and end the threat from Hezbollah when it comes to that that northern border. So it's certainly been more of a focus in the last 24 hours.",

      "sentences": "OK, so the range of possibilities of how this could be done is limited there.  It is hard toimagine that a remote detonation of a mere pager would cause this kind of damage. We're still learning. But it does seem like injuries are significant, at least from the reporting so far. What is in the range of possible is Israel somehow infiltrated the distribution of the pagers. Hezbollah is a organized entity, terrorist organization. They need their people to communicate in ways that are not using public data or public wi-fi. And pagers tend to be the way. And so the question I have, the most likely scenario is that this happened in the supply chain, that somehow the distribution of the pagers to Hezbollah members were pagers that Israel at some stage -- if it's Israel, I'm sorry, the most likely perpetrator of this. That whoever planned this would be able to detonate simultaneously to wreak the most havoc on the threat. I will say secondly, communications is key. This is, this is, this is for organizations to be able to organize a fund raise, recruit, plan. They need to be able to communicate amongst each other. So going after Hezbollah's communications network is in some ways more significant than going after a single leader, because they are going to be scrambling. They don't know who to trust, they don't know how to communicate. Hezbollah leadership doesn't even know who's hurt. So this is what someone like me would look at in these early moments of what is happening in southern Lebanon.",

I think one can feel safe about that,although if you're if you're Lebanese and not a member of Hezbollah, you might be a little bit, a little bit worried, just given the extent of the potential damage that is going on. The pagers are a self-contained communications network. And so Israel could limit the harm. Where they can't limit the harm is just, important for people to understand, is that what we're seeing from Lebanon now is their emergency management and medical capacity is now going to be completely stretched, given the injuries that are going on. And, therefore, not able to serve normal civilian and emergency management needs that happen every day in a country like Lebanon. So it will impact the Lebanese, probably not related to their cell phones or even other pagers but in terms of the emergency management and medical response, which we're seeing from Lebanon is already stretching. It's all hands on deck from what we're hearing from Lebanon. And so we can only surmise how big the -- how extensive this attack was. But it wasn't -- as Ben was saying, it wasn't one or two people at this stage. So that is that's where we are. And it is important that this is a communications network. Hezbollah is flying blind.

It did respond to the 30th of July killing of Fuad Shukr, that senior Hezbollah commander, with an attack almost a month later. But that attack, although involving, I believe, more than 300 missiles and drones, caused very limited damage in Israel itself. So it's questionable what Hezbollah is able to do unless it decides to use some of the kind of ammunition, the weapons that they haven't used until now, which would certainly lead to an even greater escalation. But in terms of a limited response to this incident or series of incidents today, its options are limited because what we've seen, certainly last month, was that the Israelis are able to essentially prevent any of Hezbollah's short-term, short-range missiles and drones to cause any significant damage whatsoever.",

In terms of the ability of a group like Hezbollah not being able to communicate effectively and potentially, this could happen again, right? This could not be an isolated incident.

This is how Hezbollah does communicate to plan,organize, fundraise, recruit, know where everyone is and to have a unified approach to  their planning. So the question is, is Hezbollah sophisticated enough that they have a plan B communications system? I think that's highly unlikely. These are systems that are expensive. They're hard to distribute. They obviously -- this system got infiltrated somehow. They are going to be suspicious of other communications networks. We don't know where people are physically, if they're together, perhaps they can communicate. But they can't -- it will be more difficult to send messages out and they will have to do that on public platforms. So they will have to do that on telecoms systems or even -- we don't know the extent that Israel has infiltrated other communication systems within Lebanon. So I suspect they don't have a plan B. I could be wrong but it would have been expensive. They could turn to that plan B, a new set of pagers, whatever it is. But right now, they are scrambling. This is what Israel likely -- the perpetrators likely wanted because it will delay their ability to respond and it will allow -- Israel -- Hezbollah is not going to be able to respond quickly or, as importantly, defend itself right now.

One is nefarious communities, terrorist groups, drug trafficking, human trafficking, whatever else, because they don't -- they don't want to create that vulnerability that someone might be listening in because they're direct. The second is public safety and medical. They often use this because, in an emergency, public systems can become overwhelmed. So they want direct lines of communication. I do a lot of work in public safety planning. It's the only time I ever see beepers anymore is within law enforcement in emergency management and medical emergency management. So this may have an impact. I, just knowing how Hezbollah plans itself, it would not be drawing on generally public systems to buy beepers. They are sophisticated enough and secretive enough, they had direct manufacturing line for these beepers.

That lawsuit was settled very quickly. But after the filing of that lawsuit, we saw a variety of other lawsuits being filed with very similar allegations. And then fast forward to March of this year, we saw homes of Sean Combs in Miami, in Los Angeles, being raided; phones being confiscated from him at an airport. And there were rumors that subpoenas were being served on witnesses and that a grand jury had been empaneled in New York to look at, consider evidence against him for these very charges.

A Lebanese  security source tells CNN -- and we're now learning from an Iranian news outlet -- that among them was Iran's ambassador to Lebanon. There was also injured health workers across Lebanon are being asked to urgent do report to work, given the large number of injured people being transferred to hospitals. The attack happened primarily in the southern suburbs of Beirut, a Hezbollah stronghold.

They have to come back to hospitals because of the sheer number of injured that are trying to access these hospitals and being brought into the hospitals. At this point, you have members of the public being asked to donate blood to these hospitals as well to help those injured. So it gives an idea of just how significant this event has been and how many people potentially have been affected. We've also got the ministry of health urging people with pagers to discard them. Now we know that Hezbollah uses these pagers but, of course, they may not be the only ones and they may not be the only ones being injured at this point, we simply don't know. But the fact that the ministry of health has specified that this is such a significant event does suggest that the number of injuries maybe quite significant.

Now we don't know what to read into that at this point. We know that Hezbollah is Iranian equipped, Iranian funded, Iranian sponsored. It is one of the Iranian proxies.

We again, trying to confirm the number of injured. We know that it was Hezbollah pagers for now, still waiting for that. But there's a political element to this and it's a really big one at a time. We've got incredible tension in the region. You have a war that is raging between Hamas and Israel. And, of course, that's spilling over into Lebanon. And the huge ramifications of an attack of this nature.",

We've got more on our breaking news story this hour.These are the first pictures in to us, showing people's pagers exploding in Lebanon. Now the government is urging people to get rid of their pagers after this bizarre attack. Sources say pagers belonging to members of the Iran backed Hezbollah began exploding in areas where the group operates. Let's just watch this video again. This is video just in to CNN. It shows the moment where pagers exploded. This is in one of the markets, as you can see. Let's watch in. All right. Really important video there.  This is the first that we're seeing of a pager exploding. From what we understand -- All right.  From what we understand, you can hear the explosion there and people running. What we understand right now, the health department has said, all health workers need to report to work. People have been asked to donate blood. We -- from what the initial numbers tell us, hundreds of people have been injured. This is video, just in from Lebanon, of one of the pagers exploding. And these are pictures of people heading two hospitals as well. All right, so we also hearing, Paula, the Iranian ambassador to Lebanon, part of the injured. I think the questions now become, we know we're asking the questions of how find how many people have been injured, who was injured and so forth. But importantly, who is behind this attack.",

I just, Charles we are playing this video again of the moment one of the pagers exploded. This as in a fruit market, would seem to be a fruit market inside Lebanon. And you hear the explosion and then people disperse. So this is one of the first pieces of footage that we're getting in after hundreds of people were injured; specifically, Hezbollah members So Charles, we're seeing this video and, from what we understand, many of these incidents occurred to the point where people are being asked to donate blood. But from a political perspective, from a terrorism perspective, there's so many elements to this. What is your initial reaction to visit what you're seeing in this video but also, this overall incident?",

      "sentences": "First off, obviously this comeswithin a dynamic whereby we've seen some fairly significant escalation on the front between Israel and Lebanon just in the recent days. A lot of rhetoric coming from Israel about, as you said, just a little earlier, about the need for Israeli citizens to return to their homes in the north. And the only way to accomplish that was to deal with the Lebanon front. So it comes within that wider dynamic. And it's hard to ignore that. But the attack itself is, I mean, virtually unprecedented. It looks like well over 1,000 members of Hezbollah or individuals linked to it have been injured in this attack, some of them in Syria. So in another country across the border. And then as you, as you just said, as well, Iran's ambassador to Lebanon. So the complexity, the sophistication, the wide scale, the wide reach of the attack and then, of course, the context within which it comes makes this enormously significant. There's been a lot of expectation and concern that we may be very near a major escalation between Israel and Lebanon and this could easily become the pretext for that. But we're not there yet.  We should say very clearly that I don't think actually anyone wants a full scale war. But it is an incident like this with these kinds of wide-scale repercussions that could put us there anyway.",

But for now the breaking news out of New York, music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is in a federal courtroom in Manhattan right now, according to a law enforcement official and an indictment against him was just unsealed. We've learned he faced federal charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking and he was arrested last night in New York. His attorney says his client will plead not guilty. CNN's Kara Scannell is outside court in New York, with the latest. Kara, many viewers will remember that shocking video of Sean Combs assaulting his longtime girlfriend, Cassie Ventura. Do we think that the incident is related to all those charges that we've seen coming through today in those unsealed documents?",
