The frontrunner who has this tremendous gulf between all the seven who were inside the debate hall as compared to where Donald Trump is currently standing. But I want you to take a listen to some of these notice -- some of these moments that we noticed when Donald Trump was mentioned directly by name by some of his competitors. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL) AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You know who else is missing in action? Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be on this stage tonight. MIKE PENCE (R), FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My former running mate, Donald Trump, actually has a plan to start to consolidate more power in Washington, D.C., consolidate more power in the executive branch. NIKKI HALEY (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is where President Trump went wrong, he focused on trade with China. He didn't focus on the fact that they were buying up our farmland. He didn't focus on the facts that they were killing Americans. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: If  you're afraid of being on this stage and defending your record, you're ducking these things. You keep doing that, no one up here is going to call you Donald Trump anymore. We'll going to call you Donald Duck. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There were discussions about Ukraine and the divisions that represent the larger party. Also causes of the UAW strike and the various remedies. There were divergences upon that, John.

Well, Kate, you're exactly right, I mean his goal with this speech was to break further into the working-class voter coalition that he knows he's going to need to win over in order to be successful in 2024. And that's true in states like Michigan, which he did lose - he won in 2016 with the help of some of these workers and people who were in the room last night, but he lost that state to Biden in 2020. And he's also trying to do the same things in states like Wisconsin and Ohio.But, look, his speech was really - it was a bit dark. He was talking about a dire picture of the future of American jobs. He described President Biden as a vulture and warned that his policies, particularly those relating to electric vehicles, could be very damaging for the auto industry. And he tried to paint himself as a savior for auto workers and the trajectory of the auto industry. Now, as part of that pitch, he also called for these members' endorsement. Let's listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Your leadership should endorse me. And I will not say a bad thing about them again. And they will have done their job. They will have done a proper job. In fact, if they endorse me, they will have the easiest labor leadership job anywhere in the country. They just have to sit back and watch as our auto industry reignites. (END VIDEO CLIP) TREENE: Now, Kate, you don't typically associate Donald Trump as a pro-union leader. That's normally a title that's more associated with President Biden. And you did see Biden actually got a much warmer welcome from union leaders on Tuesday when he was in Michigan than Trump did last night. But he was speaking to a crowd, Donald Trump, of an invitation only. It was a curated group of people. And a lot of those people in the room, the auto workers, the current and former union members, including those -- some of them who are on strike right now, they are very supportive of Donald Trump, and you could hear that in the room last night.",

Certainly, he had the opportunity to give his own direct appeal to those auto workers. And I think while much has been made about the fact that it was a non-union shop, I think you have to remember that all the people leading those auto unions have been endorsing Democrats for quite some time, did not endorse Trump in 2016 or 2020. But it's really about the rank-and-file members, according to some estimates, close to -- anywhere 25 to 30 percent of those workers still support President Trump.So, again, at the end of the day, certainly there were candidates that spoke well, that made some points about the Republican agenda.

But, no, I don't think that the American people are ready or want to hear this false notion that slavery is somehow going to be equitable to what has happened in the great depression (ph). It is a different type of pain. It is a different type of reality. But nothing can really be given a one-to-one comparison to human subjugation. But we should not be dismissing out of hand the very real reality that there is economic despair and personal despair that has been brought around by decades of policies that we pretend don't matter simply because the party that has brought us those policies pretends that they are the only friend back people have when it comes to their political problems.",

Obviously, this was a top issue for Donald Trump, and he spoke about it often and frequently. Whereas, it seems like the Biden administration refuses to acknowledge the crisis at our southern border.So, I don't know if that's necessarily the strongest place where you can draw a contrast between yourself and Donald Trump. And at the end of the day, obviously, Donald Trump wasn't on stage but it is really hard for those candidates to break out and have a moment without him there. And I think that while we might see a bump in the polls for Nikki Haley, like I said, I think she had a really strong performance last night. Until the field narrows down, no one is going to be able to effectively challenge Donald Trump for the nomination. His lead is just too dominant right now.

I asked multiple members going into this meeting if the plan is still to vote tomorrow, as House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has been saying, on a short-term plan.

The hope is that after the votes tonight perhaps that will build some momentum for leadership, but it's just not clear that's going to be the case.

And a senior White House official telling us this morning that fighting to preserve democracy has been the central cause of Joe Biden's presidency.And the president has been sharpening his attacks on Donald Trump and the threat that he represents to democracy in recent weeks at fundraisers. And we expect to see him take that to new levels in this speech today. We have some excerpts from the president's remarks, and this is what he's going to say. Quote, \"there is something dangerous happening in America. There is an extremist movement that does not share the basic beliefs of our democracy, the MAGA movement.\" And so the president is effectively going to say that he is trying to defend America's democratic institutions from this threat that he says is embodied by former President Trump's MAGA movement. And he's also going to make clear that he believes democracy is not a partisan issue but an American issue.
