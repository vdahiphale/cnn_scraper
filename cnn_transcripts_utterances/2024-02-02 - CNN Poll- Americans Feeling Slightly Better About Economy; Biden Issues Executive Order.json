That's a discussion for another time.

I've got to note it every time. Go Cats! So let's first, though, talk about Biden's visit to Michigan yesterday and your latest reporting. As I understand, you are traveling with the president. You talk about how his campaign took extra steps to make his visit a little bit more secretive than usual. Tell us a little bit more about why that was. TYLER PAGER, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, good morning, Omar -- and, of course, Go Cats! I was traveling with the president yesterday on Air Force One to Michigan. As you said, the focus of the trip was his union support celebrating the recent endorsements on after from the United Auto Workers. You can see him there meeting with union workers at a union hall just outside of Detroit. But, obviously, the big story in Michigan right now for the Democratic Party is the outrage from the very large and significant Arab-American and Muslim communities over the U.S.'s continued support for Israel and its military campaign in Gaza. The president studiously avoided any contact with leaders or members of that community yesterday when we were there. We saw some protesters, but the motorcade that I was in with the president also took some side streets when we were arriving at the union town hall to sort of avoid the large protests gathering just a few blocks away. It's not unusual for protesters to demonstrate in front of a president's visit, but it was noteworthy how the White House and the Biden campaign tried to keep the exact locations of where the president was going to be more secretive than usual. I think the hope here is that he was able to connect with voters, which we saw him do. Black voters at a Black-owned restaurant outside Metro Detroit and then --",

You know, I had a resident that came before our City Council meeting who had lost over 80 families in Gaza.

So the president has not made that outreach yet in Michigan. The White House says senior administration officials will. But how that plays with the community leaders, I think we'll see.

Americans at least said they are starting to feel better about the economy but not about him. And I'm curious.

Economic indicators continue to be positive and they say headed in the right direction. But his poll numbers do not appear to be moving in any significant way. I think the White House and the Biden campaign will be optimistic that this CNN poll is showing things trending in the right direction. And they argue that they have many months and a lot of time for the president to travel around the country with his surrogates and to travel around the country meeting with voters and trying to connect those two things -- the positive economic growth and the president's policy -- trying to get more credit for what they say he's done to improve the economic situation in the country.",

The Biden campaign has said for months that once it becomes a clear two-person race between Biden and Trump and more Americans are tuning in to this rematch, they will start to see their poll numbers change more and that Biden will take over the lead in those polls as Americans grapple with the potential return of the former president.So I think we'll see Biden taking an even more aggressive posture about Trump. We started to see that, briefly, from his allies and surrogates, but I think we'll continue to see it even more as the campaign really heats up and gets into a full general election rematch.",

Good to see you. Now, in some of your most recent reporting, you talked about how Haley's Hail Mary strategy, in some senses, depends on open primaries, like in Michigan or some of what we saw in New Hampshire.

And crucially, it's a winner-take-all state. So a keep-it-close strategy also means that if she loses and it's close, she doesn't get any delegates.So looking beyond that, we look at states like Michigan. We look at 11 of the Super Tuesday states that her campaign has outlined. And I think in those states they're counting on Democrats and Independents being ineligible to vote in the Republican primary. And so, they're saying that in two-thirds of the Super Tuesday states the primaries are either open and semi-open. And that's the path forward that they're outlining even if it's very narrow, even if it's very complex, and even if it's unlikely.",

And one of the things she kept bringing up was that the majority of Americans don't want a Trump-Biden rematch. She was trying to insert herself in there, but also saying that she polled better against President Biden than former President Trump. We're seeing glimpses of that here and there.Something else that came out of -- out of this polling is that 42 percent of Americans, including 37 percent of Republican voters polled, say they don't know enough about Haley to have an opinion on her. Do you see that as some sort of shortcoming with her campaign strategy or really more of an opportunity? CAI:  I mean, look, she is different from Biden and Trump. She has not been the president before. She's been the U.N. ambassador. She has not been a household name. And so I think that's why you see her pretty relentless on the campaign trail. She talks about some of the same talking points, right? You mentioned appealing to the 70 percent of Americans who don't want to see a Biden and Trump rematch and being pretty consistent with the way that she toes the line with Trump, although she's been more aggressive in attacking him, calling Biden and Trump grumpy old men.

And I think in his mind and for his team every day that Nikki Haley doesn't drop out, that's more resources he'll have to expend to campaign against her. And we're hearing that he's been in Nevada. He'll be back in South Carolina to campaign. And those are all trips that he may not need to make.
