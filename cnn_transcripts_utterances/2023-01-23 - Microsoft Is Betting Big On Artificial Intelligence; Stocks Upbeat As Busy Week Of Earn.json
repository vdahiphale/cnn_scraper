Well, look,there was great going along here, and then it sort of all petered out a bit, but we are still up overall. If you look at the triple stack, you'll see a strong session, particularly on the NASDAQ, which is up eight percent year-to-date, and we're not even out of January. One swallow doth not make a summer make, but things are looking a little more cheerful. The markets and the main events of the day. Microsoft is pouring billions of dollars into the company behind the AI phenomenon ChatGPT. What does it stand for? Anna Stewart will tell me. Brazil and Argentina float the idea of a common currency, but will it fly? And the CEO of Fortnum &amp; Mason is here as the company prepares for a coronation year and better of course with a nice biscuit that I can enjoy with my cup of tea. Hello. We are alive in London tonight. It is Monday, January the 23rd. I'm Richard Quest, and in London as elsewhere, I mean business. Good evening. Tonight, Microsoft is making a multibillion dollar bet on the future of AI by upping its investment in OpenAI. This is the company and the creator of ChatGPT. It's a tool that can do just about anything you ask it to do, compose an e-mail, write an essay, develop code. And, frankly, the implications are simply extraordinary. So everybody is talking about it. It could be doing extraordinary business, too. Reuters says the company is telling investors it will make a billion dollars in revenues next year. The Microsoft investment comes days after the tech giant said it was cutting 10,000 staff, whilst at the same time the CEO, Satya Nadella said there was going to be a greater emphasis on AI and ChatGPT.

A difficult task, as for example, Brazilian politics are volatile and prices in Argentina have doubled in the past year. CNN Brasil senior correspondent, Americo Martins is with me now.
