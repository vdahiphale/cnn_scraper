I want to bring in CNN's Will Ripley who is tracking this story for us from Taiwan. So, Will, when you think about history here, for the South Korean people, the term martial law conjures up a lot of trauma because you think about what happened in 1980 when martial law was decreed to sort of quash a pro-democracy uprising back then. It has been quite a 24 hours for the people of South Korea. Just walk us through what is happening on the ground right now and what happens next.",

There are images of people gathering outside of parliament in support now of what appears to be some calming measures taken by parliament again in overturning that martial law. You mentioned President Moon, President Yoon's predecessor. President Yoon did serve as prosecutor general in that -- in that government for two years. Will, he's not a political novice. He may be paranoid about the direction the country is headed in and threats from the North Koreans. But the timing of this all, to do this in the middle of the night, where he is deeply unpopular, even within his own party, the head of his party, then saying that this is not something that they support.

It's just impossible. It's anyone's guess at this point in time. What we do know for sure is that President Yoon is extremely unpopular. We've been talking a lot on our air about his approval ratings. In fact, there was a petition over the summer calling for his impeachment that gathered over one million signatures in South Korea in a matter of days. A lot of people view him as corrupt. They view him as, you know, the architect of a lot of democratic backsliding in Korea and also a very sort of hawkish policy and view towards the North. Some might even say that he is sort of stoking war with North Korea as well. Just give us your take on who President Yoon is and just how he is viewed by the people of South Korea.

Initially, there were reports that there were military forces in the National Assembly preventing them from meeting. There was also in U.N.'s martial law declaration that all political activities, including convening of National Assembly was prohibited. So we're uncertain what action the legislature can take or whether Yoon would comply with it. So certainly we've had armored vehicles deployed on the streets of Seoul, military forces and police forces to prevent demonstrations or the convening of the National Assembly. So it certainly is a political crisis, a constitutional crisis right now within, you know, a very important partner of the United States. So we have to be very vigilant that North Korea doesn't try to take advantage of this. I don't think they will take military action. Certainly, it'll be a propaganda coup for them. They will point to the turmoil in South Korea. But the U.S. is in a difficult situation of not condoning this, but also having to continue working with the leader of South Korea, whoever that may be.

I'm not sure if you heard our reporter there, but she's essentially saying that the U.S. is watching this with a lot of concern, especially because such a pivotal part of Biden's presidency has been, of course, talking about the value of democracy all around the world. How does the U.S. go forward in navigating its relationship with President Yoon? This is not the first time, by the way, that President Yoon has been accused of democratic backsliding, as you know.

I think, you know, immediately when we hear about martial law and the Republic of Korea, we think about the long history that the Republic has gone through as part of its democratization, moving through a couple of coup d'etats, a couple of previous martial law periods. I don't think that's what we're looking at here now. We are, as you know, previous commentators, particularly Bruce Klingner had mentioned, this is a political action by President Yoon and amidst a deadlock in South Korean politics where, you know, key issues such as budget and other very important issues, both to the president and to the country are being deadlocked by non-cooperation between the ruling and opposition parties. I think, you know, first of all, President Yoon is a lawyer, and he knows well the law, and he knows what he's doing. He knows the Constitution. And I do believe he believes he's working within some parameters of which, for him, are necessary to reestablish some type of governance in South Korea, obviously to the detriment of democracy, not the first time the United States has had to deal with a partner like that in Seoul. It will be difficult and challenging to go ahead, but I don't think it's as bad as previous martial law periods.

I think the votes are probably lining up in support of some type of impeachment against Yoon, just as they had previously with President Park Geun-hye. His ability to navigate this will really demonstrate whether he's taken a grave miscalculation in terms of -- if his play was to somehow do something shocking, a shock-and-awe maneuver that fits within the definition and what's allowed under the Constitution, to be sure, but which runs against all elements of democratic processes and principles. You know, he may -- most people are saying right now that he miscalculated and he will not survive this.

They're going to wake up and learn that there was martial law. And I mean, you can almost call it a presidential coup against the legislature. I think it's fair to describe it in those terms. So just wait until all of South Korea wakes up tomorrow morning with this also still somewhat unresolved in terms of, you know, the question of whether martial law is really open-ended. And what are the implications for the president? So, you know, how he chooses to appear or not tomorrow, that's just the first test, but that's the 24-hour timeline.

They're all going to wake up tomorrow, go to school, go to work and ask themselves, where are we in South Korean history? Because even if they haven't lived through it in their generation, it's not that far back, right? It's something that their parents went through and certainly their grandparents multiple times. So I am waiting, having also been in Korea during the protests against the president at the time, Park Geun-hye, that led to her impeachment and these incredible weekend after weekend through a cold winter of a million people marching peaceably through the areas that we're watching on the news now, demanding that she step down, that she resign.

So there were shots of joy and elation that members of the military were pulling back after, again, South Korea's National Assembly declared that martial law should be overturned. So what we're hearing right now, a couple meters behind me, a couple yards behind me, Cho Juk Hoo (ph) is a member of an opposition party, a former just minister, liberal -- from the liberal side of the equation, political equation here. He is saying that this institution of martial law was indeed illegal. We're hearing a chorus from the crowd gathered around us that Yoon Suk-Yeol, South Korea's president, should be impeached and that his days, if they're not over, should be numbered based on what happened just a few hours ago. So we have seen more and more people start to rally around the square here in front of National Assembly fighting for democracy. Such a shock to hear the news when President Yoon Suk Yeol of South Korea addressed the nation in a surprise televised speech saying that he was instituting martial law to rid the country, paraphrasing here what he said, of elements supporting North Korea and supporting communism within the government. Incredibly unclear what he meant by that statement. But I think for anybody joining us who's not familiar with politics in South Korea and what's happening, the South Korean president, conservative president, highly unpopular. His favorability ratings are in the upper 20s right now, and they've been that way for months. There are constant calls over the past few months to impeach him. Protests every Saturday echoing throughout the streets of Seoul to impeach the president. So could this have been a move to tamp down on criticism? One wonders what the end game by South Korea's president was. So now the speech is over by again by Cho Kuk, that former justice minister. We're talking to more and more people. But again, they say, such a feeling of shock that a bastion of democracy here in East Asia has been subjected to this, not under military dictatorship or a military martial rule, excuse me, since military dictatorship in the 1980s.",

And speaking impeachment, I mean, there was a petition to calling to impeach President Yoon of the summer that garnered well over amillion signatures and that number rose steadily in a number of days. Just in terms of the fact that now we know that lawmakers have voted to block this martial law decree, do we expect to hear from the president in the coming hours, Mike?",

      "sentences": "So it may be -- choosing the words carefully, perhaps not so much a stalemate, but sort of either side wondering what happens next. As youmentioned, the parliament voting to invalidate this declaration of martial law. Now the president's cabinet has to rubber stamp that vote. Under law, the president has to follow parliament's lead and abide by its decision to overturn martial law. But have we heard from South Korea's president since that televised address? No. So the ball really is in his court, to follow the lead of parliament that has decided that this, you know, martial law, no way, this is not happening. So I think that the whole multitude of people gathered around us are more than eager to hear what Yoon Suk's next move will be. That is what we're waiting for in the wee hours of the morning here outside of the National Assembly.",

And, you know, as more and more details were trickling out, people, including myself, were looking at their phones, and we thought, wait, is this a typo? South Korea? You know, is this North Korea? Is this some sort of mistake that martial law is instituted in South Korea. So I think that there still is a palpable feeling of disbelief, dismay, and shock, and wondering what will happen to the president next and seriously doubting that he can continue when parliament has voted to overturn his decision and when there are certainly multitudes of people gathered around us. And I should say when there have been protests for several weekends before this we're expecting more protests in the weeks to come.",
