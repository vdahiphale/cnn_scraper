And in fact, I actually worry that by calling it the January 6 indictment, that it allows this message that you heard Vivek Ramaswamy make and that many of Donald Trump's defenders will make is to make it about the First Amendment, right? He's allowed to give a political speech. He's allowed to say wrong things in his speech. I think if you are, however, a Republican running against Trump who wants to say, no, no, no, this is bad, the argument has to be it is First Amendment protected for you to say, gosh, I feel like I probably lost Georgia unfairly by 12,000 votes.

That happened today, whichever is later. The reason this was put into place is because you want trials to move along quickly. Why? To keep the accused from waiting in jail. Donald Trump is not in jail, but many people are. So, you want to say you can't serve a sentence waiting to be tried, then you're found innocent, and well, you're in prison anyway. That's not right. To maintain witnesses, the memory of witnesses, the availability of witnesses, people who may be involved in accidents, you want to get to it while it's relatively fresh and to remove the cloud of suspicion. If you're an innocent person, you would want your trial to go forward as soon as you could to have it prove that you were innocent. Yes, there's a presumption of innocence, but we also know how the public reacts. So, you want to remove the cloud of suspicion by either convicting or saying they didn't do it.",

For example, pretrial motions can push the calendar further down because they can be complicated. Conflicting court cases. We've already got these with Donald Trump, and there are more potentially coming. That can be a problem.The health of the defendant. Donald Trump is 77 years old. He is the same age Ronald Reagan was when he left the White House as the oldest president in history. Joe Biden is eclipsing him. But nonetheless, when you have an older defendant, there's always questions of health that may come up. Whether the case is so unusual or so complex, the argument can be made that this is very unusual. It seems kind of simple, but you can also argue it's complex because he is the president. And lastly, conflicts with the best interest of the public and the defendant. That's a really interesting one because the judge could say, yeah, the election coming up is a conflict, all the other courts are conflict. That could push it forward or back. You could have a judge saying, no, we have to get to trial because there is a vote coming up, or we can't get to trial because there's a vote coming up. That goes to the idea of being unusual and complex. So, technically, yeah, October is when this would technically, theoretically, maybe happen.

Asking Pence to suspend the count in Congress and send it back to the legislatures to overturn the vote in the states, he knew that was not legal. And as to his daughter-in-law's statement that he believed he won, in this indictment, Jack Smith very clearly lays out all the times that the defendant, Donald Trump, privately conceded that he lost the election. I think there's proof beyond a reasonable doubt here. He is entitled to the presumption of innocence.

Anyone who paid attention to the work that the Select Committee did last year, and we know tens of millions of Americans did, this is going to be a very familiar story. And there's information that the Justice Department was able to get that the Select Committee wasn't able to. But my mind goes back to the Select Committee's litigation with who we think is unnamed co-conspirator number two, John Eastman, where he was trying to protect communications with the president, and the Select Committee made the argument then that there should be a crime fraud exception to the attorney-client privilege. And a federal judge opined then, this is a year ago last spring that it was more likely than not that federal crimes have been committed here. So, seeing this move forward, an indictment is certainly validating for the committee's work, but it's also something that, again, folks who've been watching this from the beginning shouldn't be surprised to see.",

He wanted him to lie. He knew. He knew that he was lying. And he says to my former boss, you're too honest. This is a conversation that has happened in the past, by the way, when Pence was out there telling the truth at times before on other policy decisions. That was sort of the dynamic between Donald Trump. He wanted everyone to do his bidding. He wanted everyone to lie. And here's the thing about Donald Trump, when you stand up to him, we've seen the consequences.

Hey, it's your people that are being charged with election interference in 2020.

You know, if Donald Trump believed in the Easter bunny, it wouldn't justify him, you know, raiding Easter mass and turning everybody out. It doesn't -- in some ways, it's secondary, what he believed. What he did was try to steal the election after having lost it to Joe Biden. And if our nation of laws means anything, indeed, if we are governed by laws and not by personalities, then it's important that someone who incites a coup, as Donald Trump and his co-conspirators did, face the consequences of our laws.",

I mean, you got to love the idea of the commercialization of things these days, Tim. But let me ask you, I mean, the fact that Mike Pence is such a key person in this indictment, I mean, compare that to what happened in the congressional committee of January 6, the investigations, he was nowhere to be found there although he really has remained the 10,000, you know, foot elephant in the room.",

I'm glad the record is becoming more complete now. We're seeing sort of the extent to which not only was the former president pushing this scheme, but he was so hands-on with it. He was -- the details of the phone calls and the vice president's contemporaneous notes, I think, really shows that this was something that Donald Trump wasn't just consenting to in terms of the scheme, but he was very much driving it himself.",

And I have been critical of that because I think that we would be better off as a country if Mike Pence had stood up on January 7th and said, this is completely wrong. We need to start telling the truth about what happened here, told the truth about the election in that moment. I also think that the Republican Party would be in a completely different place.And I like -- all kidding aside about the \"too honest\" thing, I think, you know, there is something to be said where we need to make lying wrong again, and I think Republicans need to take a step back and actually assess that because today, for me, when I was thinking about it throughout the day, it was a somber day, but I was thinking also about today being the culmination of all of these lies that Trump has espoused over and over again and how it finally caught up to him. Finally. But all these lies that led to the violence on January 6, lies like other things that he said, right, he has talked about anti-immigrant rhetoric, he has talked about the invasion of immigrants in the country, and today actually is the four-year anniversary of a mass shooting in El Paso, my hometown, where rhetoric like that was repeated by the shooter that went in there. He repeated the rhetoric and said it was the Hispanic invasion of Texas. Those lies like that have consequences. And so, you know, I was listening to the comment about Ron DeSantis. It enraged me to hear that, that he was already threatening government employees. I'm like I'm going to stand up for the federal workforce because I was one of those people. He may say it in a very frivolous manner, but I think he should learn a lesson from what happened to Trump today because words like that matter when you're running for office, especially the Oval Office. And I just hope that we can start to get away from that type of language and kind of hateful thing because I do think that it drives threats, it drives anger across our country. And while we may think it is hyperbole, I will say that someone out there is sitting there thinking about what next agency, what next FBI agent, what next person they're going to target because they're angry, and it's all based on lies.
