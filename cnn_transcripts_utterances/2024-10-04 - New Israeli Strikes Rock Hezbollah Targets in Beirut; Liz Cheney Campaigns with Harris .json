It's Friday, October 4th, 9 a.m. here in London.It's 11 a.m. in Beirut, Lebanon, where another day of Israeli airstrikes are underway in the Lebanese capital and its southern suburbs, as you can see. A source says Israel targeted a possible successor to slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. It's not clear if he was killed. Lebanon says an Israeli strike on a key border crossing with Syria has cut off access to the international road. Tens of thousands of people fleeing the fighting in Lebanon have used the crossing over the past few weeks. This video is taken from Beirut, where Israel says it struck Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters. It reports taking out several Hezbollah commanders in southern Lebanon. The IDF says the goal of its military operation in Lebanon is to eliminate Hezbollah's ability to threaten the residents of northern Israel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GEN. HERZI HALEVI, IDF CHIEF OF THE GENERAL STAFF (through translator): We will not allow Hezbollah to settle itself in these places in the future. The severe blows against Hezbollah in all areas in Beirut, in the Beqaa Valley in south Lebanon will continue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "The unleashing of the violence that we've seen, the war and its escalation between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, it really has been, I think, stunning and startling to witness and very disturbing. The Israeli military says it carried out dozens of strikes against southern and eastern Lebanon against southern Beirut, saying it was targeting Hezbollah infrastructure. It says that there were more than 200 rockets fired from Lebanon into Israel, that no civilians were injured in that latest round of salvos. A ninth Israeli soldier was killed in ground fighting.Meanwhile, on the Lebanese side, at least 37 people killed on Thursday and more than 150 injured. Among the people killed were two Lebanese army soldiers. And this is an important distinction, Max. Hezbollah is a militant group, the most powerful military and political organization in Lebanon. But the Lebanese government and army are kind of separate and are not technically at war with Israel. In fact, the Lebanese army is funded and trained and equipped in part by the U.S. government to the tune of billions of dollars over the last 18 years. So the Lebanese army said Israeli fire killed two of its soldiers in two separate locations near the border and the Lebanese army fired back. UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, says that more than 690 children have been injured by Israeli airstrikes over the last six weeks. And listen to what the director general of the World Health Organization has to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TEDROS ADHANOM GHEBREYESUS, DIRECTOR-GENERAL, WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION: In southern Lebanon, 37 health facilities have been closed, while in Beirut, three hospitals have been forced to fully evacuate staff and patients and another two were partially evacuated. [04:05:00] And yet, health care continues to come under attack. In Lebanon alone, 28 health workers have been killed in the last 24 hours. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It is very difficult to get a seat on one of the handful of Lebanese airliners landing and taking off from Beirut airport as that city is actually being bombed. Incredible pictures and, I guess, bravery on the part of those pilots.The main way for people to escape this war zone and the deadly airstrikes from Israel is to cross the border to neighboring Syria. And the Israeli government bombed that main highway today after accusing Hezbollah of using that main border terminal to smuggle in weapons. So now the main way for civilians to escape the Israeli airstrikes, which have killed and maimed many civilians, has now been cut -- Max.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. And I think it certainly is no coincidence, Max, that the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is leading those Friday prayers today. The last time that he actually did that was in 2020, when a U.S. airstrike, of course, killed the then commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Quds Force, Qasem Soleimani, who, of course, was very important to Iran's military apparatus.And so now, as far as those memorial services for Hassan Nasrallah, as part of these Friday prayers is concerned, the supreme leader once again today will be on the scene to speak at these Friday prayers. And we can already see, we have some of the shots there, just how large the crowds are that have turned out so far. I've been at that facility many times for Friday prayers. I have not ever seen a crowd of that size. In fact, I think the last time that there was a crowd of that size was probably the funeral for Qasem Soleimani. And one of the things that we have to keep in mind, Max, is that the bond between Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and Hassan Nasrallah was a lot stronger than I think many people realize. So one of the things that we have to keep in mind is that between Qasem Soleimani, the slain general, Hassan Nasrallah, and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, there was a major bond that was formed during the time of the Israeli incursion into Lebanon in 2006. In fact, the three wrote a book together later with a massive part of that book dealing with that 2006 incursion. So certainly there was a very special place for Hassan Nasrallah with the supreme leader. Certainly there was a lot of support, of course, also from Iran for Hezbollah. And the Iranians are saying that that continues. And of course, we did have that major strike on Israeli territory by the Iranians happening not after the Hamas leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran, but after Hassan Nasrallah was then also killed in Beirut. And I think the Iranians are showing just how big a thing the killing of Hassan Nasrallah was for them. And of course, the Iranians also trying to display the power of their missile forces that they have. And one of the interesting caveats in all of this is also is that the same department of the Revolutionary Guard Corps that's responsible for Iran's missile force is also responsible for Iran's air defense systems, which, of course, right now are on high alert as the Iranians anticipate some sort of Israeli response that could happen. Of course, there are people who've been talking about possibly the nuclear facilities of Iran being under threat, but then also oil and gas installations as well. In any case, I would say right now that Iran's surface-to-air missile system is certainly on high alert -- Max.",
