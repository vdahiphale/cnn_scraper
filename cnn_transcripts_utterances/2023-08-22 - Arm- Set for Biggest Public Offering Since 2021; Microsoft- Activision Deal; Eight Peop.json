It's in a miserable sort of mood today. And the triple stack does -- so just a slightly better picture for growth stocks, but not really dramatically much. Overall, the market is down. So the business headlines that we're looking at today: The chip designer Arm makes plans to go public and its IPO could be the largest of this year so far. A daring rescue in Pakistan, six children and two adults saved after a cable car broke down hundreds of meters from the ground. And a surge in shoplifting or retail theft as it's now called, and now shopkeepers say the theft is up and it's hurting. We are of course live in New York. It's Tuesday, it is August 22nd. I'm Richard Quest and yes, I mean business. Good evening. The countdown has begun for the most anticipated IPO, initial public offering in years. It's the chipmaker or the chip designer I should say Arm, and it could go public as soon as next month. It is set to be the biggest IPO since 2021 when the electric truck maker, Rivian listed at a value of $77 billion, I'm guessing that the hope is there, it does considerably better than Rivian since that's now down about 80 to 90 percent on its IPO price. Arm's owner, Softbank will reportedly seek a valuation of around $64 billion. It had offered to sell the firm to NVIDIA for forty and that merger fell apart last year because of regulatory issues. Arm said in its filing that about 70 percent of the global population uses its technology. So just give you the idea. Remember, they're a designer, not manufacturer. So you've got cards, you've got keyboards, and bearing in mind, this is the chip that's in the keyboard. You've also course got, smartphones, 99 percent of the world's smartphones are using chips designed by Arm, and of course my producer's Garmin smartwatch, which he wants back to make sure his heart rate has not gone through the roof. Computers, obviously; even this, a coffee mug and credit cards have the chip in them. And now, the company is hoping to expand and capitalize on the wave of AI investment. Clare Duffy is with me, making sure nobody could see the numbers on that credit card. Clare Duffy is with me. Clare, Arm has had its problems, but AI could be a massive solution.",

And of course, Arm doesn't design chips that are purpose built for AI, but a lot of its chips are already, it says is running AI workloads. It counts customers such as Google, Alphabet -- Google's parent company, Alphabet; GM's Cruise robotaxis, which we were just talking about recently, so it is already moving in that direction. And another big thing it supplies for is data centers. We're going to need more and more data centers to really power this next wave of AI. It requires huge computing power. And so, I think you're starting to see a lot of the sort of trajectory, that this company has the runway that it has, on top of all of those connected devices that you're talking about. I mean, you also think about things like drones, things like the robots that they need in manufacturing facilities, those are all things that Arm is designing chips for.",

Microsoft is now proposing to sell some of Activations' cloud streaming rights to a rival. The idea is to persuade the UK competition authority to approve the deal.

And yes, it has got the approval now from the US and the EU, but it wasn't easy. The FTC in the US rejected it twice, and it actually just failed in court, and in the EU, they had to get a concession. It was kind of like what we're seeing today, albeit smaller, because it had a 10-year time limit. So this one is all about the streaming rights outside of the EEA, European Union and three other countries. Essentially, it means that for Activision's games that already exists, and anything they create for the next 15 years, Microsoft wouldn't be able to exclusively make people use their cloud gaming software to play it. So that's the concession. It might be enough for the CMA. It is quite a big concession.

Dick's Sporting Goods store here in the United States is now blaming shoplifters for its poor second quarter results. Profits fell 22 percent and the company shares are down roughly the same. Look at that. Absolutely clobbered. Dick's says it's struggling with what retailers euphemistically call shrink. Chains like Target, Waitrose and trade groups on both sides of the Atlantic have sounded the alarm on the growing costs. Take a look at what Kyung Lah reported earlier this year on the scale of theft in San Francisco.

And the CEO just coming right out and saying it saying that Q2 profitability, were short of expectations due in large part to the impact of elevated shrink, which, as you said, is known to many of us as theft. We've heard Richard from other retailers who have talked about similar things. We heard from Walgreens, Target saying earlier this year that they expect to lose half a billion dollars because of theft, but we haven't really heard a major retailer coming out and blaming such a dramatic drop in profits to theft. And we know that experts are really not so sure that theft has increased in recent years, however, one thing has changed, and that is criminal justice reform. And what folks have found is that people are trying to keep folks out of jail, and so when you talk about grand theft, which is what theft in stores is, the penalties are a lot lower. So people are not being jailed, people are not being held on bail, and that's why, Richard, you see these big organized crime rings, not just the individuals that you saw in Kyung's piece there, the big organized crime rings really doing a lot of damage, so much damage, Richard, that Dick's Sporting Goods saying it is a very big problem for them.",

The problem is the helicopter can't get too close in the case the wind from the rotor blades was to disturb the cable or the car sufficiently that it would -- the single cable would break. Another reason why they had to be careful when they dropped a rescue worker down, again, in case they hit the cable car and the cable cut. And then finally, how you get the people out of the cable car, which is not on its side and therefore, you're having to lift people through without creating enough turbulence that the cable car could fall.

A big question up for debate is whether BRICS will be expanded during the Summit or whether this will be discussed. It's something that Chinese President Xi Jinping is looking for, in particular, to become kind of a de facto alternative to the G7 group of wealthy nations. And on that front, there is talk of more economic integration. Brazil's president saying that there should be down the road a currency used for trading amongst BRICS nations, nothing like that will happen anytime soon. Vladimir Putin, of course, is attending virtually because he faces arrest here in South Africa for the alleged crimes linked to the Ukraine war, but still this venue is where he can get some sympathetic ears from world leaders and business leaders as well.

It's all to do with a strike or potential strike as an Australian LNG facility that's got supply concerns. Amanda Dart is with me, the head of Natural Gas Research at Goldman Sachs.
