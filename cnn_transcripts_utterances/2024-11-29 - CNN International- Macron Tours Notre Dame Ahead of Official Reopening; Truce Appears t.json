Ukraine is reeling after Russia launches a second night of attacks will survey the damage that day after more than 1 million Ukrainian homes were left in the dark. Also, the holiday shopping season is here, and millions of people are looking for bargains on Black Friday. Right. The stock markets in New York will open in around 30 minutes from now. The arrows are currently all pointing upwards as you can see, we're in the green. And there was no trading on Thanksgiving Day yesterday, and the market will close early today, remembering that the DOW has closed off its best month of 2024. And as you can see, the rally will be continuing today. Right, moving on. And there is joy in Paris this hour, we are getting our first glimpse inside the Notre Dame Cathedral, more than five years after catastrophic fire ripped through it. Earlier today, French President Emmanuel Macron invited the world to join him on a televised tour as France celebrates the landmarks restoration. The 2019 fire was a major setback for France, and Mr. Macron vowed back then that iconic cathedral would be rebuilt and be, quote, more beautiful than before. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that spire, of course, 19th century, a reminder of how different parts of this cathedral were built at different times. When we were able to come back in 2021 there was a huge hole at the top of the cathedral. Everything was happening sort of outdoors where the spire had been. Now the spire reconstructed, and the interior entirely closed off. And again, you have a sense of a cathedral that is reborn in a way that you couldn't have imagined, really when you looked at the damage that had been caused. Some of those relics, some of the statues, the statue of Virgin Mary, the organ, for instance, that had to be entirely rebuilt. The most important relic of Notre Dame, which is the crown of thorns, which had been kept here since the revolution, that had been taken out intact and miraculously saved, brought back now and exposed in a new way, with a sculpture, for instance, around the crown of thorns entirely of gold to put it, to make it more visible than even it was before. So, the individual works of art inside, not just restored their former -- beauty, but in some cases, really reinvented entirely.

And clearly, they're seeing that this is an opportunity to go after, to try to retake Aleppo, which, of course, keep in mind, it's not only the second largest city in Syria. It really is the industrial heartland of rather the industrial sort of center of Syria.

In fact, it works like a shuttle bus, picking up electrons and transporting them to the mitochondria in our cells. Typically, as we get older, our bodies produce less and less NAD+. And when there are too few shuttle busses, the lack of energy slows our metabolism and all cell repairs. This makes us age. Luckily, you can now boost your NAD levels through IV infusions or oral supplements.
