He did it all the way back in the 19th century. And keep in mind when he lost the first time around, he actually won the popular vote very different than Trump who never actually won the popular vote.There have of course been a number of Presidents who failed in bids for non-consecutive terms. Martin Van Buren, Millard Fillmore, Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, who ran as a third party built Bull Moose candidate back in the early 20th century so they're far more of the failures than succeeds in terms of running again. And just to give you some perspective of where Donald Trump stands in the overall electorate this point, favorable view, or approve of Donald Trump, you'll notice that the 39 percent in our 2022 exit poll is significantly lower than in 2020 was when he was at 46 or in 2018, when he was at 45. Of course, there's the big question about the Republican primary. And I think this number perhaps gives you a little insight in the Republican mindset. So this is among Florida Republicans. Keep in mind, Trump now does in fact live in Florida. Do you want to see this person run for President 2024, 76 percent of Florida Republicans? Say yes to Ron DeSantis compared to 61 for Donald Trump. So Trump is still popular among Republicans, but I'm going to be very interested once Republicans nationwide get to know Ron DeSantis a little bit better, perhaps still prefer his brand of republicanism to Donald Trump's.",

It allows both sides to come together and come up with an agenda for the American people and stop some of the acrimony. People are sick and tired of that. You see, all these election deniers have lost now there may be some down in law positions in legislatures, that one, but all the biggest, the Nationals they lost, that have to tell them something. So let's sit down around the table and figure out how to move an agenda forward, there will be a benefit to the American people. We will try to leave a country better than we found it. Our pre action and forebears left us a good country. It is a great country. But we must do what's necessary to make that greatness accessible and affordable for all Americans. That's the kind of agenda I want. I'm not saying that it has to be my way. Let's just make it a way that everybody can feel a part of this great country. And we can't maintain our greatness.

They were kicked off the site. Or suddenly the tickets just disappeared so lots of frustration.
