And Benjamin Netanyahu is in Florida, the Israeli Prime Minister set to meet with the Former U.S. President and Republican Nominee Donald Trump.

I am not able to see them on my screen but I know we're putting them up for you there as you are watching so you can get a quick look. Of course, I will continue to follow that the markets opening here in just about 30 minutes. In Paris Olympic organizers say the opening ceremony will go ahead as planned that's despite the attack on the French train system and the possibility of rain. French officials say the country's high speed train lines were targeted by multiple malicious acts including arson in what has been described as a coordinated sabotage to disrupt travel ahead of the opening ceremony. A number of trains were diverted or cancelled impacting as many as 800,000 travelers. Authorities say they don't yet know who's responsible for the attacks. It is of course, though impossible to ignore the timing here just hours before the opening ceremony in Paris. More than 320,000 spectators are expected to attend along the River Seine CNN's Melissa Bell and Coy Wire joining me now from Paris. So, Melissa first of all in terms of this attack, what more do we know about this -- about it at this hour?",

And no doubt carried out by people who had fairly good knowledge of France's railway networks. When you look at the country, nationwide, you're looking at cables being cut, signaling stations being set on fire, there were arson attacks. And all of these attacks happen in extremely coordinated way at the same time, and were designed apparently to cause maximum chaos, really crippling a large part of France's high speed rail network. Now, we don't know who's responsible. No one has claimed responsibility for the time being. Clearly, the timing just hours before the opening ceremony unlikely to be a coincidence. The consequences Erica said not just there's many tens of thousands of people who had been planning to make it into Paris by train in time for the opening ceremony will now find that impossible. But also, that the many hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of French people who had been setting off on their annual summer holidays this Friday with their children in -- France's rail network are being told that they won't be able to travel till Monday. So, we wait to hear from who is responsible. But it does seem that it was a planned sabotage attack.

The largest crowd in history ever, by the way to attend an opening ceremony in person. No doubt those crowds would be slightly lessen than but it will also have an impact on the ceremony itself since it isn't just the athletes that are going to be descending the sand on the boats.

The forecast has changed and Erica, with so much relying on dry weather forthese opening ceremonies, meteorologists and weather forecasters are looking at this very closely minute by minute. In fact, I was on the ground in Paris. A couple of weeks ago, we talked exclusively to some of the meteorologists, the weather forecasters from medial France. They're the agency in France that is responsible for advising the International Olympic Committee on potential weather hazards that could impact any of the events including the ceremony tonight, as well as the individual events over the next couple of weeks. He showed me some of the tools that they will be using behind the scenes, including the radar that you're seeing on your television screen now. That is mobile weather radar. It depicts rainfall at street level, a very small resolution, and it will give minute by minute updates of when the rain will come. Remember as they traveled down the river Seine today, a six kilometer stretch the outdoor stadium for the opening ceremony this normally is held indoors. Well, the weather it plays a crucial role, including the flow of the Seine, as well as the performance spaces that if it's wet, it could be quite dangerous for these performers as they open the ceremonies this evening. So, we got that behind the scenes look at this technology, which is astounding. They've covered all the bases. But of course, now it's just up to Mother Nature to play along. So, what does the weather forecast look for, look alike this evening? Well, we've already seen rain in Paris this morning. That doesn't bode well with anyone dealing with the sabotage with the trains in Paris, if they're lining up or queuing up outside of the train stations. But as we look a little bit broader, there's a lot of moisture coming in off of the Atlantic Ocean. So, this cloud cover is going to result in rainfall when what we believe will coincide with the start of the opening ceremonies tonight. So, not the best news for this forecast for this evening, because again, the opening ceremony is so heavily weather dependent, something that meteorologists are just going to be focusing on their tools that minute-by- minute mobile radar updates, and they will make last second decisions on whether or not certain parts of the event can move forward because of the weather, Erica.",

But when they takethese previous speeches, what they're really doing is breaking it down into specific units of speech known as phonemes, that even when you hear a speech, it's actually these individual units. And they're made up of very, very sort of specific things to the way a person speaks, the way that you speak versus the way that I speak, you can actually sort of start to create a formula for that. And it's a unique accent. It's the intonation. It's the rhythm of someone's voice to get that right. It's challenging, but that's what these AI platforms can do.",
