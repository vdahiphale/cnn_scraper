If that were to happen, Biden would be the first modern sitting president to back major changes to the nation's highest court.CNN's Joan Biskupic joins me now to discuss. Joan, how significant is this? I mean, it seems to me that this that the president is responding to a lot of, you know, fury out there among progressives aimed at this -- at the Supreme Court.",

      "sentences": "You know, Jim, that's exactly right. This is a political message for progressives who for years have been trying to get him to support any kind of reform efforts to change the Supreme Court.You might remember back in 2020, he was getting a lot of pressure from the left when he was running, and he rejected an idea of saying that he would support term limits or support expanding the number of seats on the court and said he'd appoint a commission instead. And he did. Back in 2021, he appointed a commission. The commission was not charged with making any recommendations. It was just supposed to, you know, kind of air some of the issues, and it did. And that went into a file drawer or set aside someplace and never to be talked of again. And now, if he does come through, we haven't seen the proposals yet, but it sounds like he's not talking this time at all about expanding the number of seats, which actually Congress can expand the number of seats on the Supreme Court. It sounds like what's mostly in play is term limits. And, you know, for that, that could take a constitutional amendment because the constitution says that federal judges are appointed for life. Scholars debate whether there's a chance that somebody who's on the Supreme Court now could maybe be after, say, like, an 18-year-term limit, you know, go down to a lower court, but that would really have to be tested if it even went very far. And just to give you an idea of what 18 years would mean. Currently, Clarence Thomas is in his 33rd year.",

There is an investigation going on into alleged sexual misconduct for Matt Gaetz, but Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing. At the same time, McCarthy is trying to prop up Gaetz's primary challenger ahead of his primary later this summer, and that's something that is also not lost on Gaetz himself. But what is interesting too here, Jim, Gaetz is actually speaking tonight along with Nancy Mace, who's another one of those eight Republicans who voted out Kevin McCarthy. They do have the blessing of Donald Trump, despite how much anger they caused within the GOP ranks in the House, particularly among McCarthy and his allies.

Our desks were beside each other. I also served in the General Assembly when she was governor. And one of the things I can tell you is that this surprises no one who knows Nikki Haley. She has the backbone of an octopus. And so, politically, when you have somebody who floats with the wind, this is not a surprise. I mean, I think this is one of the larger issues that Donald Trump actually had with Nikki Haley. The fact that she can do one thing in your face and behind your back, do something totally different. And so, that's kind of what we're seeing amongst the people around Donald Trump. It's fascinating to see the Lindsey Grahams, the Marco Rubios, the Ted Cruzs, the Nikki Haleys, who he talks about like dogs. He talks about their wives. He called her bird brain. Sent literal bird food to her room. She says this and that. And then they kind of just crumble in its midst.
