So this is a massive failure, something that we haven't seen since the Yom Kippur war in 73, which was our equivalent of the American Pearl Harbor, if you'd like. It's a combination of an intelligence failure, of the fact, apparently, that Hamas went off the grid, but also of the whole concept of Israeli defense along the border. I think we underestimated Hamas's capabilities. We were busy planning for a possible attack by Hezbollah. But it turns out that Hamas has quite surprised us.

I think the other question, big question that you're hearing from American officials today is where was the intelligence? Why weren't the Israelis able to see this coming? Because when you talk to American officials, they say they did not detect any indication that this attack was in the works in their own intelligence, and certainly if they had, they would have shared it with the Israelis.

You have been -- obviously, you've covered it for a long time. One of your reports today showed a conversation that you had with Hamas militants in the West Bank a year ago, almost predicting that something big was going to happen. So put it in context.

They've shown training videos in the past of using motorized paragliders in Gaza, but it looked a bit peculiar, a bit amateur. That's certainly proven to be highly effective in this incursion. They've come in by sea. They've used their tunnels. They've overrun Erez Crossing, probably the most fortified location in the whole of the strip. You and I have been through it dozens of times. It is a kind of enormous fortress with tunnels and sniper positions. They've somehow managed to get in there, kill a large number of Israelis, get out the other side, capture some Israelis. They've released propaganda video along these lines.So not only have they planned it militarily, but they planned it from a propaganda perspective.

I know we're expecting President Biden to come out within the next minute or two, but that is really what the president and his national security team are homing in on right now, is to see whether there were any signs that were missed that potentially could have predicted this kind of large-scale coordinated attack, or whether the intelligence was simply not there at all.Now, Israel has long prided itself on being able to detect these kinds of mass operations, these kinds of communications that may have led up to this. And the fact that it appears that they were completely caught off guard by this, something that Benjamin Netanyahu even acknowledged earlier today, that this was a surprise, is highly concerning to the U.S. because the U.S. does rely a lot on the Israelis to inform them about what is going on, of course, in their own backyard. And so there are going to be a lot of questions in the next few days and weeks and months as this goes on about whether the terror groups have perhaps gotten more sophisticated, whether there are serious gaps in Israeli intelligence that the U.S. needs to be aware of and needs to perhaps help them fix. But this is, obviously, very concerning to the U.S., which has a very robust intelligence sharing partnership with the Israelis. But clearly, something went very wrong here, Christiane.",

He said that he's been talking and has instructed his teams to talk to all their allies in the region, in Europe, also, of course, the Palestinians.So let us now turn quickly to our cast of experts here with us.

I don't think Hezbollah is likely to out of control. They're highly disciplined, but they might want down the line to exploit this. That would be regionally catastrophic.Then he's also a slight dig at Qatar which has condemned the Israelis and blamed the Israelis for this very spectacular and complex incursion operation that has come entirely out of Gaza. And then, of course, you've got the ones that are closer, Jordan, the UAE, of course recently normalized relations, again, trying to make sure they keep their own populations under control, that they don't join a bandwagon of this energy, which is precisely what Hamas is trying to create, is to reignite the Middle East in an anti-Israeli fervor at a time when there's been this process of normalizations.
