I'm Bianca Nobilo, in London.Israel's military is pledging to intensify its ground operation against Hamas targets in Gaza as it keeps up its strikes from the air. The Israel Defense Forces say that over the last few days it struck 600 targets and overnight the IDF says dozens of terrorists were killed in continued ground operations. According to a CNN analysis of video published by Israeli media, IDF forces have advanced about three kilometers inside Gaza. But as the ground invasion expands, the United Nations is warning of growing hunger and desperation in Gaza after people broke into warehouses to take survival essentials. The U.N. secretary-general says the situation there is growing more desperate by the hour. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: The world is witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe taking place before our eyes. More than 2 million people with nowhere safe to go are being denied the essentials for life, food, water, shelter and medical care while being subjected to relentless bomb bombardments. I urge all those with the responsibility to step back from the brink. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, some of the video that you showed just there shows the aftermath of those. We have other videos that show smoke billowing through the hallways as well. They say that there has been damage from the strikes very nearby.This hospital yesterday said that it had gotten two phone calls from Israel warning them to evacuate. This is something that Israel has been doing since the outset of this conflict, almost telling people in the northern part of Gaza to move further south and that includes hospitals and health care centers, many of whom have pushed back saying they simply cannot. But the situation with Al Quds in the hospitals more broadly, Bianca, is just one of Gaza's many, many problems. You saw there the looting of some of these aid warehouses. The World Food Program says that it is just evidence of how desperate people have become and how people are growing more and more hungry and frankly losing hope. And when you look at the latest pictures from the ground, it is pretty easy to see why. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (voice-over): There isn't much left of the Bilal bin Rabah Mosque in central Gaza. The building was flattened by an overnight Israeli airstrike. People inside the neighboring apartment blocks weren't spared either. Roofs were ripped right off. Everything now covered in a pale shade of gray. More than a dozen were killed and more injured, according to medical staff at the local hospital, where outside the bodies of those killed are wrapped in white sheets and marked with their names. Both the IDF and the Israeli prime minister have renewed calls for civilians to urgently evacuate northern Gaza. The apartment buildings next to the mosque were filled with people who had heeded those warnings, believing central Gaza would be safer. There were no warnings at all, this survivor says. We have seen the entire thing collapsing on us. We didn't know exactly where the hit was. We started running to get our children out. It's a miracle they survived. This man said there were no warnings. It was a strong airstrike. The people pulled us from underneath the rubble and took us to the hospital. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment. Israel said that overnight some 450 terror targets were hit and say that some strikes were directed by troops now on the ground inside Gaza. This was the aftermath of one of those strikes on a family home in Hanunis in southern Gaza. A desperate scramble to move slabs of concrete, hoping to find survivors. Instead, they found at least one body. By daybreak, the urgency has gone. A pile of rubble is all that's left. [03:05:03] Hospitals already at the breaking point are only getting more overwhelmed. In Deir al-Bala Saturday, doctors operated on this boy on the floor. The Palestinian Red Crescent now says that Israeli authorities called El Kut's hospital in Gaza City twice, with a clear and direct threat that the hospital must be evacuated at once. Otherwise, the Red Crescent holds full responsibility for the lives of everyone inside. That amounts to hundreds of patients and thousands more people taking shelter. Israel says it called more than twice since the war began and says the Hamas is shielding themselves inside hospitals. Foreign aid is entering Gaza at a trickle. With desperation, apparent in this video of people ransacking a U.N. warehouse carrying out bags of food. Maybe a temporary lifeline for those people but the U.N. calls it a worrying sign that civil order is starting to break down. It's a situation in Gaza only gets worse. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCLEAN (on-camera): So Bianca, when it comes to those strikes very nearby to the Al-Quds Hospital, the second largest in Gaza, the Palestinian Red Crescent says that it believes that Israel's goal of these strikes, three of them as of yesterday morning, is to essentially force the evacuation of this hospital. But look, the hospital director says that it simply cannot evacuate. There are obviously sick and injured people there, including babies in incubators, there are also 12,000 or so civilians uninjured who are taking shelter there. And he says that the vast majority of them are women and Children. He also very plainly denied the Israeli accusation that hospital and others like it are sheltering Hamas. He said, at least when it comes to his own hospital, it does not allow anyone inside the building who is armed. Bianca?",

We don't have a whole lot of information on this latest Israeli strike beyond the Israelis saying that it was in response to rockets fired in its direction. You had a few days ago.Israeli strikes on mortar positions, saying that rockets or mortars had been fired toward the Golan Heights, a disputed area that Israel effectively controls largely, but it's disputed by the Israelis. You had a week ago strikes on major airports in Syria and Damascus and Aleppo, which the Israelis did not claim responsibility for, and the list goes on and on. It is not uncommon, broadly speaking, for rockets fired from Syria to be aimed at Israel, especially when the Israeli-Palestinian conflict boils up. The difficulty now is that you have the U.S. getting involved. It says that it sustained some 20 or so attacks over the last two weeks or so against seven bases in Syria and Iraq. It blames Iranian- backed militia groups in the area, and it has not been shy about striking back. The Iranians, though, say that, look, there is no evidence that it's directing these groups. It says that they are acting unilaterally in their own interests, out of anger for what's happening in Gaza right now. But of course, all of this is feeding into fears about a wider conflict. Both the U.S. and Iran says they don't want this to spread beyond Israel. They don't want a wider conflict. But you have the Iranians issuing some not-so-veiled threats against the Americans. You also have the Americans moving aircraft carriers into the region meant as a deterrent against Hezbollah and other similar Iranian-backed groups in the region not to get involved in the situation in Israel. But at this stage, Bianca, the jury is still out as to whether or not that American tactic here is actually working.",

In a statement on X, he said the risk of violence spilling over into other regions would have quote, \"dire consequences.\" And tensions flaring along Israel's northern border. Israel says its fighter jets struck Hezbollah military infrastructure in southern Lebanon on Sunday in response to shelling toward northern Israel. It's the latest in a series of cross-border clashes over the past few weeks, as CNN's Jim Sciutto reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JIM SCIUTTO, CNN ANCHOR AND CHIEF NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST (voice- over): Towns like Arab Al-Aramshe along Israel's border with Lebanon are mostly deserted now, evacuated due to fear of attacks by Hezbollah. Makes is one of the few who stayed behind. And from his roof, he shows us where Hezbollah fighters attempted to cross the Israeli border just a few days ago. Minutes after we arrive, we see the threat is constant. Hezbollah shells fired from across the border land on the hillside just opposite us. (on-camera): We are on a border town between Israel on this side and just beyond the fence is Lebanon. And as we've been standing here, if you see the smoke off in the distance, that is the result of Hezbollah artillery fire from Lebanon into Israel. You can see the smoke rising in the distance and speaking to residents here. This is a regular event. It's happening every day. (voice-over): Makes and his twin brother sent their families south for safety, but stayed behind themselves to protect their homes. The question for them and others like them is how long before this area is safe again? (on-camera): Does anybody talk about how long people will have to leave here? MAKES AHMOOD, LIVES IN ARAB AL-ARAMSHE ALONG ISRAEL-LEBANON BORDER (through translator): He hops that a month, other people think until the end of the year, but we don't know. SCIUTTO (voice-over): As the shelling picks up, we head back south. Minutes later, Israeli soldiers block the road. Warning of more incoming Hezbollah fire. (on-camera): We're very close to the Lebanon border in northern Israel, and soldiers have just blocked the road here in both directions. We can't go either way. You can hear mortar and artillery fire going out. That is from Israel towards Lebanon. We've also heard artillery fire coming from Lebanon. And the concern is the soldiers telling us that there are possible infiltrations across the border from Lebanon by presumably Hezbollah fighters, and that's why the level of concern is so great. (voice-over): The Israeli military is focused on Gaza, but the northern front now faces daily attacks. On Sunday, a rocket fired from Lebanon landed in the city of Kiryat Shmona, setting this home ablaze. Hezbollah also claimed this strike on an Israeli tank a few days ago, with the IDF responding by targeting Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon. All the while, the constant exchange of artillery fire rumbles across the frontier. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That includes not only the land forces, nearly 1,000 troops, as well as patriot battalions and a THAAD battery, those are air defense systems, but of course the naval troops as well.One carrier strike group with the Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier is already in the Eastern Med. Another carrier strike group passed through the Strait of Gibraltar a couple days ago and it's on its way in that direction. We've also been watching an amphibious ready group, the USS Bataan, which is an amphibious assault ship and a Marine Rapid Response Force, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, or MEU for short. Over the course of the past several weeks, they've been operating in the waters of the Middle East. But according to two U.S. officials, they're now in the Red Sea on their way to the Eastern Med. First, that it's a tremendous show of U.S. power in the waters off the coast of Israel and Lebanon, a clear message to Iran and Iranian proxies not to get involved, and that message we've seen said explicitly from President Joe Biden on down in the U.S. national security chain essentially, but the MEU, that Marine Rapid Response Force, also serves another purpose. It is special operations capable, which is certainly notable and worth remembering, but it's also a critical force in a non-combatant evacuation operation, or a NEO. That's one of its mission essential tasks. Now, the U.S. said last week that there was no indication or execution for a NEO, an evacuation, right now, but John Kirby, the National Security Council's spokesperson said it would be irresponsible and imprudent not to plan for contingency operations, including an evacuation. Since he's said that, the U.S. has said the risk of this conflict spreading wider in the region is growing and remains a serious consideration for the U.S. Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department, the embassy in Beirut, has advised Americans to leave now before a crisis has begun there. There has been some contact between Israel and Hezbollah along the Israel- Lebanese border. It has not escalated too much, but any contact, any exchange of fire on that border, which is already volatile as is, is certainly noteworthy. And that's what the U.S. is watching to see if that escalates. If it does, those are the situations in which things can quickly get out of hand, and where the conflict in Gaza, which the U.S. is trying to keep separate, can quickly and violently spread to the rest of the region. So that, perhaps one of the reasons that Marine Rapid Response Force is there, in case the U.S. looks at the situation, and looks at the possibility of the necessity for an evacuation if the situation deteriorates.

And the reason, I believe, is because Israel was trying to give a chance for a rapid negotiation with Hamas via probably Qatar, Egypt, and others, in order to have some kind of a deal in which they would free at least what we call the humanitarian deal. They would release the women, the kids, the babies, the elderly people, still holding a few soldiers that they have, and maybe a few men, but in return for relieving the situation on their own population in Gaza and giving humanitarian aid in large scale to Gaza. It seems that they only stole time. and that's, I think, the Israeli understanding, and this is why Israel started some kind of a ground operation.

And one should wonder, how come you have a group of terrorists, huge group, 3,000 terrorists infiltrated to Israel, butchered 1,400 Israeli civilians.But still, this is not an existential threat to Israel. So how come we refer to that as such? Because we need to understand the bigger picture. And the bigger picture is that Hamas and the Palestinians at large are only a tool in the toolbox of the monster, which is Iran that from the day of establishing the Iranian Republic by Khomeini, they declared as an operative goal to exterminate Israel. I don't know any other president in the world that one sovereign state declared that they have an operative goal to exterminate another country. And they used two armies for that. The first army is the Palestinian army, i.e. Hamas, that attacked us. This is not Hamas attacking us. This is Hezbollah misusing the Palestinians for that matter. Excuse me. This is Iran misusing the Palestinians for that matter. But they have another arm, which is Hezbollah. Hezbollah is 10 times stronger than Hamas and is not fully activated against Israel yet. Whatever Israel would do in retaliation to the Palestinians is being learned by Hezbollah. If Israel would not make it clear to Hamas that they actually played it wrong for their own interest and would not force them to pay the price for the atrocity, the crime against humanity that they have done. [03:40:03] Three weeks ago, Hezbollah in no time will infiltrate to the north of Israel and cause ten times more damages and actually threaten, if it will be simultaneously, threaten the existence of Israel. And this is why we refer to that very, very seriously. We are fighting as we feel an existential war. And we are fighting against an enemy which is entrenched intentionally within civilian regions. We are calling civilians to evacuate certain neighborhoods in Gaza. They force them to stay there because they want them to die within the military clashes between the two sides. That's practically the situation that we are facing. And I think that the international community should understand that they have a role here. And the role is not just to stand on the fence and criticize both sides and have some politically correct statements. They have to call a spade a spade, say Israel was -- was attacked severely, savagely on a holiday with no reason for that by an Iranian army, Israel has all the right in the world to defend itself, of course, under the rules of the international law.
