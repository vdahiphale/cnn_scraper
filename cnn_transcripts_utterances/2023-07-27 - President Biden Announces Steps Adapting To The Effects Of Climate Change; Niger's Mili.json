President Joe Biden can't do much right now to stop theheat wave that is currently gripping the United States, but he is trying to respond to it. Any moment now, he is going to be announcing his plan to deal with the extreme weather that is hitting multiple states in the U.S. right now. Those measures set to include protecting vulnerable workers, investing in better weather forecasting, water storage and climate resilience. Some 140 million Americans are under heat alerts right now, while temperatures keep climbing and setting records. July is actually set to be the Earth's hottest month ever, ever in history since records started in the 1850s. I want to bring in Kevin Liptak, joining us live now from Washington. President Joseph Biden also coming under fire from Democrats for scrambling to deal with the effects of climate change instead of focusing on the cause, and that is, of course, greenhouse gas emissions.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, you know, this event today kind of demonstrates the bind that he is in. He is announcing these stepsthat adapt to the effects of climate change, but don't necessarily address the source of the problem. But these adaptations that he will announce are essential because of the heat that is racking the United States. And you hear it, feel it, even here in Washington, temperatures rising to triple digits for the first time in nearly seven years. And so, what the President will announce today, steps that will protect workers, very critically, construction workers, farm workers, including increased inspections of their work sites during high heat moments. He'll also talk about bolstering weather predictions, $7 million to improve weather prediction through the NOAA, the weather agency here in the United States. And he'll also talk about grants that would ensure clean drinking water out west in some of these states that have been so hampered by some of the high heat that you're seeing. So, the President really under pressure to do something to help Americans and particularly those Americans who are out in the heat every day because they have to work out there, helping them adapt to it. But certainly, there are Democrats who want the President to do more to combat climate change and that is something that the president will probably address in his speech today. But he isn't announcing any new steps on that front. Certainly, he is still working towards those steps. It's a very complicated issue politically for him, but certainly he is taking these steps on heat today, Zain.",

In a just released report, the World Meteorological Organization says that July is the hottest month on record for the entire globe. The global air temperature, for the first 23 days of July, average 16.95 degrees Celsius. That's well above the previous record of 16.63 degrees Celsius set in July 2019. Experts cite human-caused climate change as the culprit behind the extreme weather and the extreme heat we're seeing across the globe. Marina Raminello joins us. She's the Executive Director of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change. Marina, welcome. So, here's the thing. The eight hottest years on the planet are essentially the last eight, which tells you the direction we're heading. One thing that I'm concerned about is if these are the sorts of temperatures we're seeing right now, heat index in Iran up to 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Of course, those sorts of temperatures, unsurvivable, even though we're just talking about the heat index. What do the next decade -- what does the next 10 years look like for the climate?",

I mean, obviously, we allknow, I think most of us know, I should say, that greenhouse gas emissions do need to be reduced. You have various states, for example, California, implementing new measures like banning the sale of new gas-powered cars after the year 2030. That means that old gas-powered cars can legally still exist in California, but no new ones will be sold. That to me suggests that the pace of change is going to be very slow. What needs to be done specifically in terms of curbing greenhouse gas emissions right now?",

So, even the basics have not been yet committed to. They spacing out fossil fuels urgently and increasing our capacity for renewable energy generation has to go hand in hand with that. But most importantly, increasing our energy efficiency, reducing our energy consumption and our energy waste as much as we can, reducing from the demand side. And that's one thing that's very important to take into account when we talk about facing our fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are the main single contributor to human-made air pollution. And we know that air pollution leads to enormous burden of disease. Our own estimates from the Lancet countdown say that small particulate air pollution linked to the burning of fossil fuels leads to 3.3 million deaths every year. And there's estimates that say that it's close to eight million deaths every year. So, when we talk about the need to face our fossil fuels, we need to think not only about the need to protect ourselves from climate change, but also the immediate health benefits that that could deliver. And we have the technology to replace fossil fuels with safe renewable energies. And we need to increase our ambition very rapidly and take this very seriously, because the temperatures that you have seen will only increase.",

He knew the security situation of the Sahel really, really well and was able to advocate for the region internationally. So, he was really perceived as a strong man who knew the region really well and could advocate for the needs and the regional influence of Niger. And so, what we're seeing or what we're hearing from the ground, from Niamey, is that this coup started as the disgruntled army general who was being removed from his position and who had been in the position for 10 years and who woke up one day and decided that he was going to remove the president because he was not happy with being removed from the position. But what we saw later was the entire army, which was considered loyal to the president, joining the coup leaders in kind of a surprising way. So, it's really hard not to imagine that the leaders, the military leaders of Niger are not taking their cue from other military coup leaders who have led successful coups in their region.
