The officers really never mentioning that they went up in level of force against Tyre, when you also look at the fact that they said that he was sweating profusely and irate upon exiting the vehicle. When you watch the video, you can see it's actually the officers who approached that car with so much aggression. And then going on from there, it says that Nichols grabbed for Detective Martin's gun and listed Martin as a victim. Those are several things that stood out to us, talking to several police officers yesterday. They say in Memphis, when you have to do excessive force or you have to go up in terms of level, in terms of meeting a suspect, you're supposed to put that in the report. All of this surrounding a funeral that's going to have the nation's eyes on it, as Vice President Harris will be here as well.

Most of those happening here at Dallas-Ft. Worth International, Dallas Love Field as well as the Austin International Airport, as well. And so those nightmares will continue.And I can tell you that a drive that would normally take me about half an hour to get here to the DFW Airport took well over an hour this morning with no traffic on the road. And that is one of the good things that we've seen in the last 24 hours, is that most people really heeding those warnings of staying off the roadways. And that is because this winter weather will continue to worsen again today. We've had a bit of a reprieve over last 15 hours or so. But another round, a third round of wintry mix expected to move through the Dallas-Ft. Worth area in the coming hours. So, that will just prolong this nightmare. So, it could be well into Thursday before there's really any kind of relief from the icy road conditions that we've seen. And there has been so much sleet and wintry mix that has fallen on the roadways and the cold temperatures. Everything is very much hardened up.
