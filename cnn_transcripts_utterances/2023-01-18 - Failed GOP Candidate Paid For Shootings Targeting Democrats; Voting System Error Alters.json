I spoke to one woman who said that she didn't see the crash, she heard it. And that when she ran out towards the kindergarten, she saw children being rescued from the scene. Some of them were literally on fire because the jet fuel led to a massive blaze. And when our team arrived on the scene, saw at least four bodies on the ground. There's wreckage everywhere in there from the helicopter. We've seen them remove some large pieces of the chopper just in the last hour. But so far we don't know yet what caused this. It was bad weather this morning. Another man said he was smoking a cigarette on his balcony and he couldn't even see, he could only hear the crash because the fog was so thick.

According to him, many in our government are actively worshipping Satan, or they call Moloch. Q is saying that they participate in pedophilia and spirit cooking. We already saw there was an email that came out of the WikiLeaks emails where, was it Cheryl Mills, and she told Hillary Clinton in an email that she was going to sacrifice a chicken to Moloch in her backyard.

If she had been in charge, quote, \"We would have won.\" That's extremely alarming. In addition, the committee oversees election security. She tried to overturn an election.
