      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to our viewers joining us from the United States and all around the world. I'm Laila Harrak.Donald Trump fans the flames of resentment in a message to his supporters, telling them he expects to be arrested within days. Vladimir Putin makes a surprise appearance in occupied Ukraine. This coming just a day after the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for the Russian president for alleged war crimes. And Chinese Leader Xi Jinping headed to Moscow in the coming days to meet with Putin. We'll break down what the two leaders are expected to discuss. Former U.S. President Donald Trump is responding to a potential indictment in New York with the same angry rhetoric he used before the 2021 insurrection. In a social media post, Trump said he expects to be arrested on Tuesday, and he urged his supporters to protest and, quote, take our nation back. The case is related to a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels over an alleged affair which Trump denies. While Trump's attorneys believe he will be indicted soon, but they still haven't confirmed when it would happen, Republicans have been rallying behind the former president, condemning the potential indictment as a political witch hunt. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT:  The idea of indicting a former president of the United States is deeply troubling to me, as it is to tens of millions of Americans. And particularly happening in what appears to be a politically-charged environment in New York where the attorney general and other elected officials literally campaigned on a pledge to prosecute the former president.

But at this point in time, he doesn't actually know. His spokesperson for Donald Trump this morning said there has been no notification from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office that Trump is going to be indicted in the coming days, although everything we know about this investigation signals that it is in its very last days.Last week, Trump was invited to come in and testify to the grand jury that has been investigating this for many, many months, as would be his right as the target of the investigation in New York. He declined to do that. He we have learned that there is another witness scheduled for Monday to go before the grand jury. But right now the grand jury is finishing up its work. This investigation is about a $130,000 payment that Donald Trump's attorney at the time in 2016 -- this was Michael Cohen -- paid to Stormy Daniels, who was alleging that she had an affair with Donald Trump and they wanted to keep her quiet before that campaign or as that campaign was ongoing. There also is clearly an investigation around just general financial issues related to the Trump Organization, possible financial falsification of records connecting back to the Stormy Daniels payment. But at this point in time, we don't know when this indictment will come or what exactly the charges would be if and when the grand jury in Manhattan is asked to approve them.

I mean, he knows what he said on January 6th, he knows the reaction to it, and yet here he is delivering similar messages. It is reckless. It is dropping matches in gasoline. And what is so striking is that as so many points in his presidency, once again in this period, you do not see any mainstream Republican leaders condemning him for this rhetoric, and, in fact, you see them rallying around his argument that this is inherently a politically motivated prosecution.",

We're jumping past all that. You have the speaker of the House saying, this is inherently illegitimate and we have to investigate the investigators.

The city suffered massive damage before Russia occupied it last year. The Russian president stopped at one of the city's neighborhoods where he was reportedly invited into a family's home. The trip followed his visit to Crimea on Saturday to mark the ninth anniversary since Russia announced the annexation of the Ukrainian Peninsula. Russia carried out that land grab back in 2014 after sending in troops and staging a hasty referendum. Kyiv says it's only a matter of time before all of its occupied lands are liberated.

We've just, as you say, got that new video showing Putin himself arriving, then behind the wheel of a car driving from the airport, it seems, towards Mariupol. He is then later seen in the philharmonic theater in Mariupol, not far from the drama theater, which almost a year to the day ago was bombed by Russia in what is believed to be perhaps the worst mass casualty event of this war. People then reportedly shelters in that philharmonic theater where we now see President Putin, there you see him, of course, now in the car.He's with the deputy prime minister of Russia, Marat Khusnullin, they are discussing reconstruction efforts, rebuilding the airports. They later discussed rebuilding apartment buildings in Mariupol. This, I think, from the western perspective, looks like a pretty extraordinary act of defiance coming just a day after that arrest warrant was issued by the ICC, literally taking a tour, it looks like, of some of the scenes of his alleged war crimes, some of the worst it's believed committed in Mariupol itself. But from the Russian perspective, the message to the Russian people here is not only Putin in control, in charge, significant to see him behind the wheel of a car -- the last time we saw him driving was across the Kerch Bridge, that Crimean bridge that was blown up in the autumn. He drove a truck across it after some rebuilding efforts there. But also the effort here is to normalize these territories in the eyes of the Russian people as part of Russia. They've been doing this with Crimea since 2014 with events held to mark the anniversary. I think by discussing rebuilding, investment, stuff like that, this is what he's trying to do here. Of course, that pushes any hope of discussions with Ukraine even further away. Laila?",

He said they were hoping to recruit 30,000 new members by May, that they're already in the process of actively recruiting hundreds per day in some cases.Interestingly, the number 30,000 is exactly how many people the U.S. government estimates Wagner has lost, including deaths, desertions, and injuries. That estimate coming earlier this year. But it's also interesting, obviously Bakhmut remains a nexus of pretty heavy fighting. But in terms of the frontline overall, both Ukrainian and British intelligence assessments have estimated that the number of Russian offensives has actually gone down. There's been some relenting over the last week. That may be partly because of the scale of these heavy losses alongside what we know to be significant losses in terms of equipment and significant ammunition expenditure. Laila?",

The tests coincide with ongoing military exercises between the U.S. and South Korea.

Novak Djokovic is being denied entry to the U.S. for a familiar reason, because he's unvaccinated against COVID. The tournament says the Serbian star applied for a special exemption but didn't get it. The same issue forced the 22-time Grand Slam winner to pull out of the recent Indian Wells Tournament. He also missed last year's Miami Open and U.S. Open and was even deported from last year's Australian Open for his refusal to get vaccinated. The director of the Miami Open, James Blake, spoke with CNN's Patrick Snell about Djokovic's situation and what the tournament hopes will happen in the future. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
