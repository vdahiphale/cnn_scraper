Per University statement, she will remain tenured faculty at the university's law school and agreed to stay on while they find an interim replacement. As we've reported, students, faculty, really, the community in general has said that they lost confidence in Magill after Tuesday's congressional hearing in which she and the presidents of MIT and Harvard failed to explicitly say that calls for genocide of Jews would immediately violate their university's codes of conduct. Now, moments after Magill's announcement, Scott Bach said that he, too, would be stepping down as the chair of the university's Board of Trustees. In his statement, Bach wrote, \"Former President Liz Magill last week made a very unfortunate misstep\". He then goes on to write, \"Following that, it became clear that her position was no longer tenable, and she and I concurrently decided that it was time for her to exit.\" Bach also defending Magill, calling her a good person, a talented leader, and, in his words, not the slightest bit antisemitic. Also interesting in Bach's statement, he offered some potential insight into what may have been Magill's state of mind at the time of that disastrous hearing. As Bach wrote, that she was not herself at the time, that she was being questioned by lawmakers, that she was, quote, \"over prepared, over lawyered,\" and that she provided a legalistic answer to a moral question and that Bach says was wrong.

But if the policies don't change on these campuses, are the Jewish students at UPenn any safer today than they were before the resignation? [07:10:01] FINGERHUT: Well, many of the stated policies are adequate, some are not. But I would add that it requires leadership. It requires those who are in the positions of leadership, obviously, university presidents being the most visible to understand that their role in creating an educational environment. And being the educators of the next generation of leaders of our society is to focus not just on, you know, what the physical facilities of the campus look like or even the -- which academic programs are listed, but what are we teaching in terms of the moral and ethical role that our students need to be able to fulfill in the future.

And so while we are taking all necessary and appropriate security measures in our Jewish communities, and we are investing heavily in making sure every Jewish institution and community is safe and protected. Nevertheless, we feel it's very important to stand, to show up in our public spaces and be clear that we will not be intimidated nor give up the public square. It's one of the reasons why 300,000 Jewish advocates showed up on the National Mall just less than a month ago in front of the Capitol to advocate for support for Israel and for freeing the hostages and fighting antisemitism.

Otherwise, that country risks being kneecapped at this critical time in its war against Russia. Israel also caught in the middle of this. Can they get a deal? At the moment, they have talked all weekend. They are not near a deal. But will they punt until the New Year? That is a big question. And then how do they move forward in the House on a completely separate matter, moving forward, an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden. House Republicans want to show momentum, including the new Speaker Mike Johnson. He is putting this on the floor to authorize the inquiry, which has been actually going on for a couple of months. But they want to have a formal vote to authorize it. That means they need to have all their members in line, including the vulnerable members, and lose no more than three Republican votes. But in talking to those vulnerable members, it is clear that they are ready to move ahead on that impeachment inquiry. But they are not ready to move ahead to impeach the president because some of them say, clearly, in their view, they don't believe there's enough proof or evidence to show that the president acted corruptly in any way to aid his son Hunter, which is the essence of that impeachment inquiry.",

Well, a day after Hamas carried that October 7th attack that killed more than 1,200 people in Israel and touched off this crisis in this war, there is a militant group here in Lebanon called Hezbollah, which is a sworn enemy of Israel. They have fought -- the two enemies have fought repeated conflict against each other, and it began a -- arguably somewhat low-level border conflict where, for two months now, Hezbollah has been firing rockets and mortars across the border, drones at Israel. Israel has been retaliating with artillery and with airstrikes.And again, this has been going on for about two months. It's not at the level of the carnage that we're seeing in Gaza, but it has killed around 100 Hezbollah fighters thus far, according to this Shiite Muslim Iran-backed movement. And yesterday I attended a funeral for three of the fighters who were killed, I was told, in an Israeli airstrike. They were operating near the border. Now, there were thousands of people at this funeral in Beirut. It was being protected by the Lebanese army, which is not participating in this conflict. The Lebanese government is very weak, and it is trying to remain neutral. Hezbollah is so powerful in this country that it creates its own foreign policy and its own security policy. And it's a problem internally. A lot of people here in Lebanon don't feel represented by this movement, but don't have the power to really do or say anything about it. So, this was a rare opportunity to see Hezbollah fighters, who normally keep a very low profile. In the days that I've been down on the border witnessing, the border conflict, I couldn't see any Hezbollah fighters because they deliberately fight a guerrilla conflict, cat and mouse, to avoid being seen. And in my conversations with Hezbollah fighters and supporters, they said that this is their religious duty to fight against Israel, to help support Palestinians in Gaza, and at points they chanted, death to America and death to Israel.

It's more than $14 billion for Israel. You could see more of these, I imagine, if the Israelis hit a point where they say, we're simply running out of ammunition.
