And essentially he's saying what we have privately known to be the case, which is that Mike Johnson does not - wants to avoid the situation that Kevin McCarthy found himself in two years ago when he was trying to clinch the speakers gavel. He went 15 rounds. And in that process, he signed away a lot of power, including empowering conservatives to try to oust him with just a single vote, something that ultimately led to his demise just a few months later.One thing we're hearing from a lot of conservatives is that a way to earn their vote could potentially be to make Chip Roy, a conservative from the state of Texas, the House rules committee chairman. But that's a really powerful position because you can essentially control what kinds of legislation comes to the floor of the House of Representatives. And that is something that could potentially be problematic for Johnson because in the past Chip Roy has not supported putting certain pieces of legislation, like spending bills, on the floor of the House. That has forced Johnson to try to get Democratic votes and do it under what is known as a suspension of the rules, which requires a two- thirds majority, a much higher threshold. So, conservatives pushing for Chip Roy to be the Rules Committee chairman. But very important there, the speaker of the House saying he's not cutting side deals right now with some of these conservative members.",

LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, ANCHOR, \"WASHINGTON POST LIVE\": Well, we're going to see. That's the question. Mike Johnson is obviously projecting confidence. But what people are saying behind the scenes don't necessarily bear that out. The fact that he had to spend all day yesterday making calls and meeting with members who are either undecided or have said that they are a no at this moment on Mike Johnson is quite telling. The fact that he's going to have to work this until the very moment is also quite telling. And the thing is, is that the majority is so slim, one of the slimmest majorities in congressional history, Mike Johnson, can lose one vote. And one person has already come out against him. And that is Representative Thomas Massie of Kentucky. And that's why Mike Johnson is working so hard to round up all these other votes. And Chip Roy is absolutely key here. But he's not the only one. There are other hardline Republicans who are saying that they want commitments from him on spending bills, to ensure that there is a reduction in spending, not an increase in spending. And so he has quite a tough task ahead of him, John.",

And they vote as many times as Johnson is still in the race and until there is a speaker elected. And so people think that potentially eventually he will get there. But how many ballots it takes is another question.Now, you know, another thing that I'm hearing is that one of the things that Johnson has really struggled with is - is - is meeting the demands of this hard right faction on these spending bills. And this was - this was escalated again just last month when he came to a bipartisan agreement with Democrats on a short-term government spending bill. This is something that's going to persistently be more complicated for Johnson. Now, he was working with Democrats, and that's part of what Johnson's argument is. He's saying, look, moving forward for the next two years, we are going to have a Republican Senate, a Republican in the White House and - and it is going to be much easier to do what a Republican conference wants. And so, you know, he's hoping that these hardline Republicans buy into that and acknowledge the fact that he was dealing with a divided government before and moving forward it's going to be easier.

You know, I mean, there are a couple wild cards that are on that, you know, undecided, let's call them, category right now. But I think they even recognize the fact that there's going to be limited acceptance from their colleagues and probably from their constituents if they try to play games today and delay what inevitably they want to see happen. Most of these members are in strong Republican districts that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump. They don't want to slow down the agenda one iota. And if they're actually seen as standing in the way of that progress, voters are going to hold them accountable.And, you know, to your point, I, you know, if it were to go to a second or third ballot, and again, I don't think it will, you know, I think you're going to have to see what the actual numbers are. But I don't think you're going to see that today. And certainly we saw that Kevin McCarthy was able to piece it together eventually anyway.
