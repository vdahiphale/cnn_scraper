But on the other hand, they were also thrown away -- well, of course, they're -- with the use of force, but without much, there were no deaths, for instance. So, I don't think this will continue. We were concerned also with the demonstrations in front of the army barracks, or army departments. But this again, today, has been dismantled because of an order of the -- of one of the judges of the Supreme Court. So, I think things are getting quickly to normal as we speak.

But there is also some sort of malaise (ph) that leaves people in society to make absurd options, and believe in absurd things. I mean, there is even people who are studying what they call a collective cognitive problem. Because the, you know, people that believe in absurd things, people that believe that the day of inauguration of Lula is some national phenomenon would happen and that the inauguration will not take place. This is a real thing. Of course, there are people manipulating this, and there are interests behind this. I don't want to go exactly in the analysis of which are the forces that are behind this, but it's -- you know, you have the -- it's very similar to the United States. You know, Brazil is a country, in a way, very similar to the United States although in a different level of development of course, much lower. But the things that -- these questions that you are posing about Brazil and the division, are questions that can be posed about the United States. So, we have to go on. We have to strengthen democracy. This is the -- this actually was one of the themes in the conversation that took place yesterday, I was present, and I was able to listen to it.

It ended up with this very narrow majority. And even in the weeks and weeks since then, McCarthy was not able to pin down the victory. But, you know, you see situation here, and house rules allow it, where you have 10 percent of the Republican conference that basically was able to bring the body to a halt.

      "sentences": "Yes, I think one of the concerns in the aftermath of this fight is that the likelihood, the possibility of government shutdown, of refusalby Republicans on the hill to extend the debt ceiling. That the possibility of both of those things went way up. Now, there is a big debate again about what exactly McCarthy agreed to, but he did appear to agree to hold spending at previous 2022 levels. That has caused defense stocks to plunge in the last few days. There is a concern that even in the middle of the U.S. funding of Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion, a moment of, you know, great geopolitical peril, and broadly speaking, that has been supported by bipartisan majorities. But there is this loud and growing faction of the House Republicans, the sort of very pro-Trump Republicans, who don't support continued aid to Ukraine at those levels. And so, there is a big question about whether defense spending is going to take a hit. Whether the support for Ukraine is going to take a hit. Whether the ongoing build-up in U.S. efforts to support Taiwan at a moment when China appears to be threatening the status of Taiwan, far more so than it has in the past. So, there are some potential geopolitical consequences to this as well as, I think, the big short-term fear, which is what happens the next time the U.S. hits its debt ceiling and Congress needs to raise it. And I would point out that, you know, regular order, the appropriations process that you noted, as being like job number one for Congress, right? That is what the constitution spells out. That has broken down over the last couple of decades already in ways that are just astonishing. When I was a young reporter on Capitol Hill, those Appropriations Bills, that was the meat and potatoes work of Congress. Here's a mind-blowing statistic for you. This is in \"The New York Times\", Carl Hulse of the -- the other day. There are 12 annual Appropriations Bills. Six of them went through the house last year. Do you know how many actually made it to the Senate floor and were passed into law? Zero. Zero. The senate considered zero Appropriations Bills. And so, in this gridlock they are already ramming them altogether into these gigantic omnibus spending bills. That already signified a Congress that is basically unable to function on some of its core responsibilities.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I think that's a good question. I'm glad you brought up that motion to vacate the chair though. That is - you know, in many respects,the most self-crippling of the concessions that Kevin McCarthy made because it what -- what it means is that just one individual, a very small group, could bring down his speakership and wield that threat over him at any time. And I think that that's an example of why this has developed in the way that it has. The same thing would apply in some respects to the amendment process. Actually, House Democrats, when they took back control of Congress way back in 2007, and Nancy Pelosi first became speaker, they had a similar house rules package actually, in terms of amendments and decided that they were going to allow more amendments on the floor. What happened is that Republicans tied up the floor with a series of showy amendments and made it impossible to actually proceed and get the basic work of the House done. So, they changed that rule back. And that, I think, is a good example. Right now, the basic issue is that Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans don't have a functional governing majority in the House. They have two narrow of a majority and two divided of a Republican conference. And so, any -- very, very small rump group of individuals who are determined, you know, to bring it to a halt can do so. And I -- you know, this is the balance that they're seeking to strike between actually getting their work done and being able to govern the House to reflect the majority -- well, at least the majority party, versus some of the more transparency, the arguments. It's hard to argue on its phase that they shouldn't have time to read the bill, right? Obviously, that is a pretty basic appealing thing but, you know, it's basically lurching from one crisis to another, is how I would describe the house in modern times.",

The House Republican Conference has transformed in recent years. Kevin McCarthy has transformed. So, people could come away, I think, with a mistaken impression that it's sort of, you know, Republican establishments and moderates versus, you know, a kind of hard-core, far-right, conservative extreme. And I think that that overemphasizes the role of ideology considering that the vast majority of the House Republican Conference, even two years ago, supported Donald Trump's tax and efforts to overturn the 2020 election, right. So, think of it that way. You know, it's not -- it's really a split between two groups that all have supported Trump in his presidency and in his election denial and post presidency. So, that's one thing. There are also all extremely conservative by modern standards. Again, it's not your grandfather's Republican Party. So, that's one important observation. You know, I do think that it's also reflecting of an interesting split in the House Freedom Caucus, which has become, you know, in many ways kind of the leading edge of far-right agitation. And that the confrontational style of performative, you know, budget cutting politics since the Tea Party Movement really in 2010. Then the creation of the Freedom Caucus in 2015. Then, as you know, they became sort of the hard-core cheering squad for Donald Trump throughout his presidency. Well, they ended up on both sides of this speaker fight. So, you had Matt Gaetz who came to fame as a, you know, kind of public defender of Donald Trump as a young Florida congressman. You had him and Lauren Boebert, and some of the other Freedom Caucus members as the dissenters. But you also had some of the founders like Jim Jordan supporting Kevin McCarthy. Even someone who as once dismissed as way out there on the Republican fringe, Marjorie Taylor Greene, a former QAnon adherent. She was by McCarthy side on the floor through much of this. As now been promised a seat on committees that Democrats through her off of because of extreme statements.

And you could make the argument that the dissenters to McCarthy want even more drastic cuts. But I would say that that basically is the point of view of the majority of the House Republican Conference at this point, and therefore the majority of the majority that subscribes to these views. That it's not an ideological or philosophical argument. They have become the institutionalized party of anti-government in the government. The difference is largely about taxes. You say, what do they want? You know what they want? They want to be on TV. They want to talk. They want us to talk about them. They want, you know, to exist in this world of weaponizing, almost any issue that's in the news. We haven't talked about it, but of course they want to use the powers of Congress, the subpoena power and the committee power to have investigations. There was this really telling moment, I thought, in the middle of the speaker fight when one of the Republican members, Congress was on television talking about it, and he said, you know, I'm so angry about this, you know, delay in getting organized in the new Congress. You know, the anchor said, well, why? You know, what do you want to do? And he said, well, it's time for us to get to work. Holding Hunter Biden accountable. And, you know, I think that's just a revealing moment. That is what they hope to do with this House platform. Because as you pointed out, there is a Democratic Senate, there is a Democratic President. It's not really going to be a period of great legislative accomplishments for the Republicans. It's going to be a period to use the House, first of all to obstruct, you know, part of the Democratic agenda.

A reminder of the divisions of their opponents. In some ways, it's easier to be in the opposition right? You know, the -- being opposed to Donald Trump, being opposed to, \"Extremists\" is kind of an easier political play in many respects.

How does it inform the future, even the present? No one knows better than presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin. And she's joining me now from Boston, Massachusetts. Doris, welcome back to the program. Great to see you. And my goodness, you know, put it into context then for us. It's, you know, the first time in 100 years that we haven't had a smooth election for speaker. DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, HISTORIAN AND AUTHOR, \"LEADERSHIP IN TURBULENT TIMES\":  Yes, it's incredible when you think about it. And 100 years ago, in 1923, it took only nine ballots to get the speaker as opposed to 15 this year, which means you have to go back, way back, to 1856, and it took 133 ballots. Can you imagine? It took two months for the Congress to even organize itself. They were trying to get everything they could done. So, they took food, they took a drink away, they didn't put the fireplaces on, but it still kept going on. And I think the reason why is you had factions then, the party system was unstable. Each one of the parties were rent with factions. And so, they had to get a coalition to finally get that speaker, and I think that is what we are seeing now, a faction within a faction of a party that doesn't want compromise, that wanted concessions. And so, it took forever to get Mr. McCarthy as the speaker. But history tells us that it's happened before.",

AndClinton, with bruising, decided, I'm going to turn to the middle and I'm going to get something done. And on the other side, the Republicans were willing to do that and you've got welfare reform. You got a budget amendment. They had a balance budget amendment they had been trying to get forever. And Clinton was then able to go to his election as a bipartisan leader that's seemingly less likely, I think, for President Biden right now because it doesn't seem to be, just as you say, any kind of hunger for that kind of bipartisan accomplishment. But then the problem, I think, for the Republicans is the other side of the Gingrich Revolution was that they went too far. There were two government shutdowns. The country got upset with what was happening. And again, Clinton won that election the next time around. So, I think there's a warning sign for them in going too extreme and not governing. And then, what Biden can do, is he can go out on a train, maybe go around with all his infrastructure projects and say, look what we got accomplished bipartisan when I was there, and maybe become a little bit of Harry Truman from 1946 and 1948, the Do-Nothing House. And when people want certain things passed and they are not getting passed, you can blame the other side. So, it's an interesting dynamic that we've got presidents from history on all sides.",

The Democratic Party was split into because of slavery. And the Republican Party was formed. So, you know, I kept thinking after January 6th when the peaceful transition of power had not happened, and when the attack took place, that maybe that would be another time of a shakeup of the Republican Party. It hasn't yet happened, but I think part of the turmoil we are seeing now is still that is part of that. There is a real issue out there about the peaceful transition of power, but that's not what this is being thought about right now.

I went to college just as JFK was announced as president. I was at the march on Washington, as you say, in 1963. It was really the first time I ever felt that sense of being part of something bigger than myself. We were singing, we all shall overcome. I was carrying a sign, protestants, Jews and Catholics for civil rights. And then, came Selma. And I remember being in graduate school listening to Lyndon Johnson's We Shall Overcome speech. And all of us were crying. It was so incredible to find the president of the United States and the civil rights movement partnering for voting rights. And never could I have imagined, when I was listening to that speech, that three years later, I would be working for the man who delivered it, Lyndon Johnson, or more importantly, 10 years later, I would marry Richard Goodwin, the man who crafted those words. And then, comes the summer of 1965 when everything happens and I'm in the Congress. I'm just an intern there, but Medicare, Medicaid, aid to education, voting rights, immigration reform, NPR, PBS, Head Start, it was an extraordinary time.
