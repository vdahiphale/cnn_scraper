Thank you so much for joining me. First question is about the relief I'm sure you're hearing from your constituents, from your community right now. REP. CHRISSY HOULAHAN (D-PA): Absolutely. I think our community is breathing a huge sigh of relief with an enormous amount of thanks and appreciation to our local and state and federal law enforcement for getting the job done. We have been on tenterhooks for a long time and we are appreciative that this is finally passed and in our past.",

One member could call for a vote seeking his ouster. He would have to prevent more than four Republicans from voting to oust him, assuming all Democrats do so. That's one issue.The other thing with spending, avoiding a government shutdown, another major issue as well. That's something that Gaetz's warning could actually trigger that effort to push him out. And also impeachment, that's a question that members on both sides of the aisle have. How long will this investigation go? What will it actually produce? Will they vote to charge the president with high crimes or misdemeanors, even though a number of members are skeptical? Today, I asked Kevin McCarthy about his decision not to hold a floor vote to open up an inquiry even though he said clearly, just 12 days ago, that he would in fact hold a floor vote, but the votes were not there. He ultimately decided to order this on his own even though some members are concerned about the politics as well. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TOM COLE, (R) OKLAHOMA: Help (ph) Democrats. I mean, I haven't seen anybody do too well after an impeachment process. Didn't do well for us in 1998 with President Clinton. I don't see it as good politics. I do think there's enough stuff here, that it deserves to be looked at. RAJU (on camera): I'm talking about your words. Why did you change your words? REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R) HOUSE SPEAKER: OK. Well, let me answer your question because I have answered it every single day and you could answer me every single day. Nancy Pelosi changed the precedent of this House. RAJU (on camera): But that was (inaudible). (CROSSTALK) MCCARTHY (on camera): Nancy Pelosi changed the precedent of this House on September 24th. It was withheld and good enough for every single Democrat here. It was good enough for the judge, why does it have to be different today? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He has gone to the appeals court asking them to intervene, but he has asked this first federal judge who said I'm not moving your case to federal court. Could you just push hold on that decision? Could you just wait on that? Because I'm really concerned that the state court in Georgia is going to move ahead, we're going to get through a trial, and they're going to convict me before I've had a chance to get through this appeal?Well, the federal judge is not buying that argument. He declined to issue what is called an emergency stay, essentially a pause for Mark Meadows today and here's part of what he said. He said Meadows' contention that he would be irreparably harmed by the possibility of facing trial next month are insufficient to carry his burden on the emergency stay requested. No trial date has been set for Meadows and he admits that it's not guaranteed his trial will be in October. And Dana, this is the thing we've been wondering for all these folks, is if your name isn't Ken Chesebro and your name isn't Sidney Powell, and you are asking for a speedy trial, what are you actually going to go to trial in Georgia? A date has not officially been set for Mark Meadows, so this federal judge is saying, you know, the notion that you're going to go to trial in this whole four-month process plus is going to play out before your appeal is heard is not really something I'm going to buy at this point.",

We've been expecting him to weigh in on that this week. He suggested at his hearing last week that he would start to issue some scheduling orders.So we're waiting to see sort of out of the gate, what does the state court judge think is a fair time line. And as you pointed out, we are going to see a lot of efforts by Donald Trump's team to try to put that off. He has already said, I shouldn't be tried along these other co-defendants.
