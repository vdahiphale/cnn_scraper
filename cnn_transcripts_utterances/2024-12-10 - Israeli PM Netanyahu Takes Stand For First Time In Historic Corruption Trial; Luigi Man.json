The 75-year-old is Israel's first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime.",

      "sentences": "Of course. You know, it was kind of funny to see Netanyahu yesterday saying that, you know, he waited for eight years. The reason eight years have passed since he was first investigated by the police and until he takes the stand to testify for the first time is because he and his lawyers delayed it as much as they could.And, you know, to his lawyers credit, they did quite a good job. And only in the last few days, Netanyahu tried to even use the crisis in Syria in order to postpone his testimony. He sent the ministers of his security cabinet to sign a joint letter to the judges, something that is unheard of in Israel's history that the -- the politicians, ministers in the government are trying to intervene in a legal proceeding, asking the judges to postpone the testimony. The judges obviously rejected this request. But you know, Netanyahu personally tried to delay and postpone his trial and his testimony. And I'll tell you another thing. Today, during his testimony, three times a courier with a -- with an envelope with a huge \"top secret\" written on it entered the courtroom to give it to the to the prime minister, allegedly to update him about security issues. That happened three times a day. And it happened when his own lawyer was questioning him. When the state prosecution will question him, I believe we will see a train station of security updates -- (LAUGHTER)",

You know, people -- we had a war now for more than a year, so people forget what happened before the war.In the year before the war in Gaza, the number-one thing Netanyahu and his government were dealing with is an attempt to neuter the Supreme Court to weaken Israel's democratic institutions, including the attorney general, and to pass laws that could delay or even cancel Netanyahu's trial. That was the reason for what they've been doing. There was no other reason to do it. Obviously, they built a whole ideology around it, but it was clear to everybody. And you know how I know? Because several of -- of the ministers in his government admitted that the reason it happened is because of Netanyahu's trial. And by the way, this judicial overhaul and everything happening around it is one of the main reasons that October 7th happened. Because Netanyahu was warned four times during that year, before the war, by the heads of the security services, that what he's doing with the judicial overhaul is weakening Israel and is encouraging Israels enemies, Iran, Hamas, Hezbollah, to go after it, which is exactly what happened.",

And so they'll have to go -- the alleged shooter, Brian Thompson. It's still -- it's not an evidentiary hearing. It's rather, do they have sufficient evidence to establish that he is, in fact, the alleged shooter? That's -- and then the judge will make the ultimate decision as to whether or not it will be granted. And after that, then, he will be sent to New York to face the charges.",

There's testimony you'll probably hear from the arresting officer in Pennsylvania about his about Mangione demeanor when he was first approached.You will probably -- the judge will probably hear about the manifesto. And in the manifesto, there's specific references to UnitedHealthcare insurance company. There will be discussion, probably, of the ghost gun. There will be, exactly to your point, that there is going to be the fact that he had multiple fake I.D.s. Including the I.D. that allegedly he used to stay in the hostel in the upper west side of New York City. That's one of the places where they were able to identify him as a possible shooter. And then, of course, all the images we've seen, the images of him sitting down with the mask, just his eyes and his eyebrows are shown, the images of him where he's allegedly flirting with the receptionist at the hotel. That will come into the evidentiary hearing as well. So it is an evidentiary hearing, but it won't get to the substance of it as to whether or not he's guilty or innocent of -- of the charges.",

I mean, it could take a couple of days because they will have to be the coordination of the evidence that will have to be presented to the judge.And especially if they go just beyond the -- the evidence that we're discussing, they're going to be testimony. So it could be a couple of days. And then the judge will make the decision. And one thing we're not surprised, obviously, that he did not waive the hearing. I mean, obviously, the rantings that he said when he was taken across, when the media we're actually presented it. But one thing, too, Brianna, and this is what we discussed earlier, it has to be established, especially if the defense believes that there is some sort of mental health issue that's at play here, that he, that Mangione does not understand the proceedings. And that is such a critical function of the due process he's owed as a presumed innocent individual. So that will have to be established as well. We haven't -- we've heard whispers that he dramatically changed in his behavior just in a short period of time. Because there are those that are so shocked, including his family, including the individuals that lived with Mangione, that they're devastated, in shock, that they had no indication whatsoever that Mangione would be capable of any of these charges that he's facing. So that will be a process as well. And if the defense does step forward and they believe that, because of some mental health issues, Mangione is not capable of understanding the proceeding, that will sidetrack the evidentiary hearing regarding whether extradition is possible. And there will be a focus on whether or not Mangione understands the proceeding and can actually proceed with the extradition hearing. So there are some steps that may actually sidetrack the evidentiary hearing on -- on the extradition.",

There are 45 Trump allies in Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin, who are facing criminal charges for state crimes. So he cannot pardon those cases. He can't shut down those cases. And I'm told that more charges may be coming very soon in Nevada, where they had some technical hiccups with their previous attempt to bring a case. And some of these people are big fish, guys. They're folks like Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, Boris Epstein, his advisor, and Ken Chesbrough, one of the architects of the fake electors plot.

Ten additional forgery counts. They have their first court appearance on Thursday, where they will almost certainly plead not guilty.",
