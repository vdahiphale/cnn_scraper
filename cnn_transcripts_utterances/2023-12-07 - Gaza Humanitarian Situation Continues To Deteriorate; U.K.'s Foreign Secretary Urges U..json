So, in some instances, we're seeing that the injured are brought to hospital on donkey carts. Sort of in the big picture, what we're seeing is that every single U.N. agency, every single non-governmental organization, aid agency in Gaza is ringing the alarm bells, saying that given the level of displacement, 85 percent of the population, given that so many of them are focused, concentrated in the southern part of Gaza, given that even though some areas people are told are safe, are not safe, and they get bombed. For instance, Rafah refugee camp this morning. This was an area people thought was safe. A house was hit there. According to Palestinian medics, 22 people were injured. In that instance, more than a hundred were injured. I mean, 22 were killed. More than a hundred were injured. And sort of it all amounts to a catastrophe. I mean, there's no other way to describe it. And there doesn't seem to be anyone who has the leverage to stop this fighting from going on. There's no hint that another truce is in the offing. And in fact Oxfam put out a statement that pretty well sums it all up. It says that the Israeli military onslaught in southern Gaza is causing destruction, danger and civilian terror and suffering at such a scale that makes any humanitarian response impossible across all of Gaza. It's important to keep in mind that yesterday, 80 trucks entered Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah crossing. But because of the fighting in the Khan Younis area, because of the fact that the northern part of Gaza is completely cut off from the rest, the little aid that's getting in can only be distributed in the Rafah area. And what we're seeing is that the agencies that distribute that aid seem to be incapable of providing the absolute minimum to all of those who desperately need help. Zain.",

But nobody has a place to move back to in northern Gaza. This Gaza Strip, which a few years ago, a U.N. study said, I think by 2025, would be uninhabitable. It is uninhabitable today. So, many people have lost their homes, businesses destroyed, entire families wiped out, that it's hard to imagine how life could even begin to get back to a semblance of normal.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID CAMERON, U.K. FOREIGN SECRETARY:  What happened on October the 7th was a terrible terrorist attack. And I stood in Kibbutz Berry and saw the rooms where, you know, children were murdered in front of their parents and parents were killed in front of their children. And we have to give Israel that basic support of saying, you are right to try to get rid of Hamas' leadership and its armed personnel, because effectively you can't live next to a state that is run by a group of terrorists. And so, you know, to that extent, we should support Israel. And to people who call, you know, for an immediate ceasefire now, if we leave Hamas in charge of even a part of Gaza, there will never be a two-state solution, because you can't expect Israel to live next to a group of people that want to do October the 7th all over again.

And just to set the scene, this was not an empty campus. We're in the middle of study week. Finals are coming up. A lot of students were on campus.

But on the stand and that is why Trump is here is to watch this witness who is on the stand, it's an accounting professor at New York University and he's already sort of given some testimony that really has backed up the defense's claim that Trump didn't commit any fraud here with the inflation of value of his property values on financial statements, which is at the center of what the New York attorney general is accusing here in this civil fraud lawsuit. He basically said that Trump and the other co-defendants didn't violate any accounting principles. He also said on the stand that there was no evidence of fraud from his overview of the financial statements. And even the judge, who, if you remember, is the one who will be deciding the penalties in this case, asked this witness, in your expert opinion, the AG's claims have no merit, and this witness said that is absolutely my opinion. Now, of course, this is a defense witness, and this very much playing into the defense's argument. So, we will likely see a very robust cross- examination when the New York Attorney General's office gets its turn, but that witness is still on the stand right now being questioned by the defense. But as you guys just said, this is the last witness for the defense until the final witness, which is President Trump. He is expected to take the stand on Monday, and that will be the finality of this civil fraud case, which began in early October. And so, we'll all be ears and eyes on that testimony when that takes place on Monday, guys. All right, Brynn Gringrass in Lower Manhattan for us. Thank you.

But these candidates on the stage last night realized a couple things. One, they want to take on Joe Biden, they have to take out Donald Trump. And if they want to take on Donald Trump, they have to take out Nikki Haley. And they see her as the threat right now. And so that is why she has the target on her back. The good thing that she did last night was she didn't let it ruffle her feathers. She didn't let anyone see her sweat. She really rebuffed a lot of the attacks with facts and some of it -- she actually took humor in when the other candidates continued to pile on her. She said, thanks for all the attention fellas. And one of the attacks that came from Vivek Ramaswamy, she just said, it's not even worth my time to respond to it. But I think what she did yet again is demonstrate that she has a strong command of foreign policy with her experience. And she also has a good grasp on the economy. And she actually did, although she had to be pushed on it, she pushed back on Donald Trump and his handling of the economy and the amount that he contributed to the debt. So, a good, steady debate performance like this will go a long way for her to make her closing argument in the six weeks to come to the Iowa caucus. At the same time, Ron DeSantis did a good job showing that he is a proven winner in the state of Florida, and he has led and he has accomplished. The two of them both demonstrated they are young, fresh, optimistic, faced for the future. Chris Christie, I'm so glad he's in the race, holding Donald Trump's feet to the fire repeatedly, talking about what a disaster he would be for the next president. And one last thing on Vivek Ramaswamy, he wants to be Donald Trump, but nobody can be Donald Trump except him. But I think he demonstrated more than ever last night that he is like Donald Trump with his repeated attacks on Nikki Haley. As Chris Christie said, he is an obnoxious blowhard.

You know, all the great policies that Donald Trump has that many Republicans support will mean nothing if he cannot win in a general election. So, the candidates have been very careful to thread the needle from the very beginning of this GOP nomination process to make sure that they're not too critical of Donald Trump because they want his base to come his way -- if they --something were to happen to him. But then there's also a lot of people that supported Donald Trump in the past and they're just fed up with the drama and are looking to turn the page and looking for a new leader and that's what these candidates want to show is that you can have the policies of Trump without all of the dumpster fire that comes with him.",

Our next guest, head of the Department for Palestinian Affairs for the Israeli Defense Intelligence andis widely described as Israel's leading Hamas expert, Dr. Michael Milshtein. Michael, thank you so much for joining us. The last three years, you have been extremely critical of Israel's policy as it relates to Gaza, specifically by not recognizing Hamas' ideological convictions. And yet even you were surprised by the scale of the attack on October 7th. Now, we've seen an equally large-scaled attack and response in Gaza by Israel virtually destroying the enclave. And yet you, someone who studied Yahya Sinwar for so many years, believe that he views this all, despite all the casualties, all the number of innocent civilian deaths, as a victory for the Palestinian cause and thinks that their status has been elevated among Palestinians and other Arabs in the region. Can you expand further on that?",

This kind of leader really thinks that the most important thing to do, to promote, is the Jihad. Not any kind of, you know, real politic targets or improving the life of people but to promote the eradicating of Israel from the map. And from his point of view, the offensive of October the 7th -- and you know, this was the mission of his life. He planned this offensive for about a decade. And this was really a very important part from his personality. He really thinks that although the Palestinians -- the Palestinians suffered from more than 20,000 casualties and Gaza city and the Gaza strip was almost destroyed. It is still a very, very respected even prize for this victorious move against Israel. And right now, ISIS -- that two months -- exactly two months after the offensive took place, he doesn't really regret about the offensive. And he is insisting to promote the Jihad. And I'm quite sure that this will be the sources of disagreements inside Hamas between him and other groups in the leadership, for example, the group of the outside that sits in Qatar.",

I think that it is quite realistic to maybe to erase the military or the political capabilities of Hamas, of course, to remove Hamas from its current position as a ruling party in Gaza, but I think that even if Israel will kill 10 -- 20,000 Hamas members, there are still about 100,000 Hamas members in Gaza, and of course, there is the idea of Hamas. I do think that Israel can limit the impact of Hamas, but we should be aware to the fact that even in the day after, I mean, after Israel will complete the occupation of Gaza and start thinking or establishing the day after, Hamas will exist. Hamas maybe will be an underground, maybe in a position, but it will exist and it will always try to undermine the future political structure in Gaza. And we also must remember that Hamas is not only a group that exists in Gaza. Hamas also exists in the West Bank. And you know, I do assess, this is a very general assessment, that in the West Bank, Hamas is maybe even more powerful and maybe its public support is broader than the Fatah. So, we must remember that the aim is much broader and that the long-term mission is actually to limit its impact of Hamas and it will not be vanished.",

I think another point that is really important not to lose sight of is not just the immense tragedy and enormous death toll inflicted upon Israelis on October 7th, but the torture was actually part of the plan. And you talk about this specifically as a new generation of Hamas mentality in fighters, in leadership Generation Z that does not view the other as human beings. And it took a long time for the rest of the world to finally acknowledge the horrific rape of women. I mean, all of this we know now was in the war plans. When you talk about the impact of what the next generation of Hamas, even if they're on the underground, has on the region, if this is actually their mentality, how dangerous is that?",

And, you know, for example, today in Gaza, about 60% of the population was born after the year of 2000. It means that most of the young generation in Gaza were educated by Hamas, Hamas education systems and Hamas masks and the preachers and the political discourse of Hamas. And I do think, and here I want to be much more realistic and optimistic that even if the military aim of erasing the political and the military capabilities of Hamas will be promoted, we still have a very deep, very hard mission of changing the basic atmosphere, the basic minds of actually both people, but especially the Palestinians. And I do think that Israel cannot do it by itself. We need that the Palestinians themselves will promote the internal moves in order to change the basic ideologies, the basic opinions, maybe to really recognize that the other, I mean the Israelis, are human beings.
