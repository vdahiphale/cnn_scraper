Also ahead, Kamala Harris' new plan. In the coming hours, the presumptive nominee will lay out her strategy for boosting the U.S. economy. And later, congratulations are in order. Meet the newborn pandas that just made history. Hi, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. Well, what happens next throughout the Middle East may be contingent on the outcome of Gaza's ceasefire talks that will continue in Cairo next week. And the failure to reach a deal could lead to the threat of a wider regional war. International mediators have wrapped up their two-day discussions in Doha that were described as, quote, serious and constructive. Delegations from Israel, the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt met together, while Qatari and Egyptian mediators engaged with Hamas separately. Technical terms will continue to try and make progress over the coming days with separate teams and senior officials from the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt will meet again next week in Egypt. Here's how the White House describes the situation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And the statement was released by the mediators, essentially saying that they have put forward a U.S. bridging proposal with the support of Qatar and Egypt. And they say that this proposal builds on areas of agreement over the past week and bridges remaining gaps in a manner that allows for a swift implementation of the deal. They don't elaborate on what the areas of agreement are and no details on what remains to be worked out because what we understand now is that you have working teams that will be working on the technicalities of the implementation of this proposal. They will be working on this in the coming days until you have the high- level delegations expected to meet again in Cairo next week. And they're saying that this aims to conclude the deal under the terms put forward. Look, it has been clear, Bianna, that the mediators, the U.S., Qatar and Egypt have been running out of patience. They have been putting what appears to be unprecedented pressure on both sides to get this deal done. But the key here is, how will Israel and Hamas respond to this? Because as you mentioned, Hamas will be engaged by the Qataris and the Egyptians separately. And as you know very well, both sides, the Israelis and Hamas have been accusing each other of being the reason that there is no deal yet. They're obstructing the deal and sabotaging the negotiations. So we'll have to wait and see key here is going to be the response from Hamas, as well as the Israeli Prime Minister.",

      "sentences": "Well, we're certainly hearing more optimism from the United States, and this is kind ofa continuation of what we've heard from the past few weeks. And some might say that the U.S. has been overly optimistic. The ceasefire negotiations took a major blow when a few weeks ago, the lead negotiator for Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in an operation widely believed to have been carried out by Israel in the Iranian capital. So there were major questions about whether these talks would continue at all. So the fact that they have, over the past few days, is progress. More notable, I think, Bianna, is the fact that on the -- on the heels of this major round of talks is the announcement that they will pick up again, essentially in a week's time. And so that is a real indication that there is momentum in a positive direction. Now, if you parse the statement that was put out by the three mediators, they are -- they do sound quite hopeful. They do say that they do hope to conclude these negotiations by next week, which would be a real feat. They don't go into great detail about what remains on the table, but they essentially say that it's the details around the implementation. So essentially the choreography of how things would unfold, including the humanitarian aid going into Gaza. But they do also note that there are still questions around the Israeli hostages who would be released. And the Palestinian prisoners who would also be released by Israel. But they make very, very clear that they -- that now is the time to implement this deal, to Jomana's point, there is rising frustration. That's why we saw today this news that the three mediating countries tiring, essentially, of the proposals going back and forth, proposal, counter- proposal, put forward their own what they're calling a bridging proposal, essentially a document trying to bridge the gaps between the sides. And speaking with my sources, those gaps are significant, but what you are hearing today is optimism, Bianna. And I would just note further that the mediators, particularly the U.S., hopes that a ceasefire deal could keep any kind of retaliation that you mentioned --",

And as you know, and we've heard from reporting that the United States, if this does not ultimately lead in a deal, is perhaps readyto put more pressure specifically on publicly on Prime Minister Netanyahu, as opposed to squarely on Hamas as well, because we know there are already internal divisions within his own government about whether or not he should forcefully embrace a deal at this moment when he say it is the last big opportunity for one at this point. Alex Marquardt, thank you so much. Keep us posted with your reporting. Well, a lot is riding on the outcome of those talks. Tensions are high throughout the region following the assassinations of senior Hamas and Hezbollah figures. Iran is threatening to retaliate, but has indicated, as we've noted, that it may hold off striking Israel depending on what happens with the negotiations. Earlier, Israel's foreign minister said that if Iran does attack, he expects allies, including the U.K. and France, to join Israel in launching strikes on Iran. He was speaking after meeting with his French and British counterparts in Jerusalem. Well, people living in one village in the occupied West Bank say they've never seen anything like the violence that came to their home Thursday. Dozens of Israeli settlers went on a rampage, storming the town of Jit. The head of the local council says that some fired live bullets and teargas at Palestinians and set cars and houses on fire. You see some of these images there. He also said a 23-year-old man was shot and killed. This was the scene earlier, as mourners carried his coffin through the streets. In a rare rebuke of settler violence, top Israeli officials condemned the attack. Here's how one witness described what happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) HASSAN ORMAN, JIT RESIDENT (through translator): Yesterday, around 7:30, we were sitting here outside the house. Life was normal. Suddenly, we were surprised to see around 100 settlers attacked us by surprise with no previous warning. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He described the scenario that they haven't witnessed in this particular village for a long time. And he said never before, in fact, have they ever seen armed settlers coming in firing live rounds, firing teargas. And when we arrived in the town here a little earlier on in the day, we were witnessed to the funeral cortege of Rashid Sedda, 23-year-old young man, who was shot dead by the settlers. There was a lot of anger in that cortege at the settlers, at the Israeli government. A lot of pain being felt. This was a young man of the village that he was being carried at shoulder height, wrapped in a Palestinian flag, young men carrying him, older men watching from the sides. And at the funeral service in the graveyard, a little after the oration there, was absolutely powerful. And very clear in its message that the people of this village don't feel safe, that they believe that the settlers were acting with the support of the Israeli government. They don't feel, in this village, protected by the IDF, the Israeli Defense Force. In fact, they allege that the Israeli Defense Force was protecting the settlers. Now, the IDF did stop a second attack overnight getting into this village. The IDF and the Israeli police are investigating the incident so far. We've heard condemnation coming from the U.S. Ambassador Jack Lew saying he's absolutely appalled by this. And these attacks must stop. The Defense Minister of Israel, Yoav Gallant, has put his condemnation out as well, calling it radical violence that does not. He said, does not stand up to the values of the state of Israel. Israel's interior minister has condemned it as well, calling it violent nationalist riots. Those were his words. So the condemnation coming from Israeli officials, even from right wing leaders like Itamar Ben-Gvir, although he did say that the Israeli Defense Force should do more to protect the settlers and Israelis from the stone throwers who he calls terrorists in his -- in these villages. That's his allegation. And he -- but he did say that this is -- this is absolutely unacceptable. So this is strong condemnation coming from Israeli officials, but it just doesn't cut through in these villages. People here don't feel safe. And I think irrespective of what they hear from the Israeli government, they will continue to believe that events like last night, the settlers coming in armed in the village when no one was expecting, killing a young man, injuring others, they think these are coordinated by the government. They're in cahoots together. This is deeply divisive, particularly at the time of these very sensitive talks in Doha about the future of Gaza are going on.

So, as we heard from the former president yesterday in his very long-winded speech statement, Q and A, whatever that was, he did start to label the Kamala Harris campaign as communist, socialist. And it's interesting, your opinion piece today, specifically on the one issue that she wants to highlight that's getting some pushback from economists, and that is price controls, your headline is, when your opponent calls you a communist, maybe you don't propose price control. So let's start there, because your newspaper itself is calling her policy a populist policy agenda.

That said, there are a lot of economic policies that Democrats have historically stood for, in fact, her running mate, Tim Walz, implemented in Minnesota as governor, that are very popular. I don't know that I would necessarily call them populist, but there are things that economists would be more likely to get behind, or others who study, you know, kind of the evidence behind these policies. I'm thinking things like paid leave, free school lunches, childcare expansions, et cetera. So, you know, this was a choice that she made.

But what's especially concerning now is the spread both within the Democratic Republic of Congo and to neighboring countries, as well as to other countries within Africa. The WHO also saying it's, quote, very worrying, not just the current situation, but the potential spread further within Africa and beyond. So this current outbreak, we know, has reached at least 13 African countries. There are 17,000 suspected cases or even more so and more than 500 confirmed deaths. Of course, Sweden also just confirmed its first case of this form of the virus. And what's important is, as you highlighted, this is thought to be a deadlier form of MPOX. There are sort of two groups of this virus, Clade 1 and Clade 2. Clade 1, and a subset of it, called Clade 1b is what we are watching closely now. It's thought to be both more transmissible and more severe. And if you compare the current numbers, with the numbers from the last time we had a public health emergency around MPOX, you can really see the difference. That one swept the globe between 2022 and 2023. More than 87,000 cases, 140 deaths. So you can see the massive difference between the case fatality rate there from what we know.

Terrific operational security, which means the force didn't allow other people to know what they were doing. We haven't heard from the Ukrainian forces in the last couple of months, as you just said, probably because they were preparing, both from an intelligence preparation of the battlefield, finding out what was on the other side of this border, where they could attack without a lot of defense by the Russians, where they would move to. You know, and these kind of operations, there's an awful lot of preparations, not only by the maneuver force, but by the intelligence forces to find out where they can move. There's also a desire to repress any enemy activity. And in this case, what they wanted to repress was electronic warfare, air defense of the Russian forces, and any kind of border patrol. So all of this contributes to a very successful operation. Now, what I would say is, it appears, so far, the Ukrainians have established an incursion that's about 30 kilometers wide -- I'm sorry, about -- yes, 30 kilometers wide. About 30 or 40 kilometers deep, with about 4,000 Ukrainian forces on the Russian side of the border. Now, that's about one U.S. brigade. The Ukrainians have said they put four Ukrainian brigades, which are smaller on the other side. They've taken prisoners. They've embarrassed the Russian border patrol and any forces that were in the area. And certainly, this tactical operation, which I would call a demonstration, and it could be expanding now, has turned into a strategic embarrassment, not just for Mr. Putin, but for the Russian army. They're not defending their border. So to have this kind of thing occur, and for them to have been there now, nine days, is certainly contributing to their success from an operational level.",

But what I would be asking if I were the chairman, I would be saying, what kind of risks do you have right now? How are you mitigating those risks? What kind of defensive parameters are you putting up? How are your supply lines? Are you able to support with logistics the forces you have forward? What are you looking for in terms of Russian movement toward the frontline so you can defend against them and potentially even withdraw? This has been -- when you're on the attack like this, Bianna, you immediately find a place where you want to stop and then go on the hasty defense. So you have to prepare for any kind of activity. What's been interesting is the Russian Air Force hasn't been effective, so far, to the degree that they could. The Russian ground forces have not been effective. The Ukrainian forces have basically countered some of the missiles and rockets that have been launching from the area, as well as some of the Russian airfields that they've attacked with drones, all while basically thwarting their potential air defense capabilities, as well as their electronic warfare. And that's become a big area in today's battlefield because of you need to have a freedom of movement by your drones and other electronic systems. And if you can jam the other side, you can have that freedom of movement that will support the ground operation. So again, I go back to the intelligence preparation of the battlefield with the U.S. forces called IPB and they have -- the Ukrainians have done a very good job at preparing the battlefield and knowing what they want. But going back to your question, if I were the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, I'd be asking all kinds of questions and having a conversation with my Ukrainian counterpart.",
