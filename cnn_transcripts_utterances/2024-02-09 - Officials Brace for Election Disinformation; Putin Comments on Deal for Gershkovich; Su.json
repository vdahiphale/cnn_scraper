However, sources tell CNN that the senior officials mostly opted to defer to state and local election officials in taking the lead on public messaging for a of couple reasons. The public trusts those officials more in their local communities. They run elections. And the feds are also balancing this need to warn the public about a national security threat, but if they can't determine that it's a foreign actor, they're wary of infringing on free speech, especially around an election. So, it's a very difficult conversation that we got a first-hand look at through sources briefed.",

And just to be clear, even if they do determine that Russia or China is behind something post-2016, post-2020, everything - ever disclosure is scrutinized, every disclosure of intelligence is at risk of being called a political move of some point. So, there are national security threats that they're very clear on, but then how do you make sure that it's not blending into what -- if there's domestic voices involved in that. So, it's a very fine line, and this is the first such drill that's occurred with these senior officials.

Election interference did not come up in Tucker Carlson's interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but Putin did reveal that he has not spoken to President Biden since Russia invaded Ukraine almost two years ago. Putin also told the former Fox News host that he believes an agreement could be reached to release \"Wall Street Journal\" journalist and reporter Evan Gershkovich. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporter was arrested on espionage charges that are completely unfounded. He has being held in prison in Russia. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PRES. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIA (through translator): We are willing to solve it.

Phil, I want to start with you because President Putin, in different parts of the interview, seemed to allude to the individual that we've known through sourcing was somebody he wanted was putting on the table for a potential swap here in Vadim Krasikov.

In both circumstances, this is a great opportunity for propaganda for Putin. That is, in both circumstances he's saying, look, it's not just on me. It's not my fault. We were not the aggressor in Ukraine. We're not totally at fault with \"The Wall Street Journal.\" This is a spy in terms of \"The Wall Street Journal,\" and the Ukrainians are the aggressor. We're willing to make a deal only if you guys are reasonable.So, I think the propaganda piece here, both to the west and to a domestic audience in Russia is, Putin's ready to make a deal and he's not the only player at the table. He can't control everything. It's up to the Americans too. I think it's brilliant.",

There's obviously divisions between parties and presidential candidates going into an intense American election. There are divisions between potentially the Americans and NATO. And there are problems in Ukraine. You saw in the past week, the Ukrainians changing out generals. So, if you look at timing, you could read into this, if you're an analyst, and that's what I do for a living, that Putin sees blood in the water. He sees an opportunity to drive a wedge going into an election, and his driving of that wedge over time is only going to intensify. He sees a chance.",
