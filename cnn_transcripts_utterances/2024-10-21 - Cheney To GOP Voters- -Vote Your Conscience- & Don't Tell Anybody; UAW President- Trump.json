As Vice President Harris is going all-in on reaching those few undecided voters that are left. And from the golden escalator to the Golden Arches. Brand-new reaction to Trump's time working the fries at McDonald's, supporters say it was a brilliant move. My source tonight, the labor leader, Shawn Fain, says Trump was just playing dress-up. And inside the numbers, with 15 days to go, why both candidates are fighting so hard to close a gap that might be key to victory. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Vice President Harris is just wrapping up a campaign stop, in her third blue wall state of the day, Wisconsin, after making a blitz through Pennsylvania and Michigan, with a striking new assist, at her side, from former Congresswoman Liz Cheney, who is hoping to help Harris, in these critical final 15 days, to win over moderate Republicans and Independents, by creating basically a provision structure, for them to do something a lot of them may have never done before. Vote for a Democrat. Cheney certainly hasn't. But she is making a very public plea about what undecided voters should do, and could keep private. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LIZ CHENEY, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: If people are uncertain, if people are thinking, Well, you know, I'm a conservative, I don't know that I can support Vice President Harris.

And you think about that for a minute. I mean, the reality of this was, was they shut this McDonald's down. It was closed off to the public. It was franchisees and campaign supporters that were screened, and allowed to be customers. And Trump's standing out the drive-thru window, taking pictures with people coming in. And, I mean, this is not the life of a McDonald's worker. These workers have to work at a furious pace. They have to get people through the line, and to make money, for the company, at poverty wages. And so, it's, to me, it's a slam, and it's an insult to people that have to do that work every day, that are trying to pay the bills, at the end of the week.

Kamala Harris knows what that life is like. She knows what it's like to have to work for that money, and to be able to pay the bills, at the end of the week. She knows what struggle is.

So, if you look at voters under the age of 30, you take an aggregate of the last three New York Times polls, as my buddy Nate Cohn did over there, it's not just a little gender gap. It's a freaking valley. It's huge. It's huge. I mean, female voters under the age of 30 are favoring Democrats by nearly 40 points, while male voters under the age of 30 are favoring Donald Trump by nearly 20 points. So, the bottom line is, if gender gaps have been a thing in American politics, expect them only to become a bigger thing, as we go on and on in the years and years.",

In your, you know, as a student of history, have you ever had a former President claim that they were the greatest president, the U.S. had ever had? DORIS KEARNS GOODWIN, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN, AUTHOR, \"THE LEADERSHIP JOURNEY\": There is not a single president that I know that has ever claimed that. And when you think of it, I mean, it's an impossible thought for a president, no matter what he says, to determine how history is going to regard him. It's going to be generations of historians, who will look back at the presidency. It's going to be public sentiment, over a period of time. And no matter what, so far, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, after 250 years, historians and the public sentiment claim they are the greatest. So that history is not on the side, I think, of Mr. Trump, in claiming that he is the greatest from this moment in time.",

Humility, the ability to acknowledge errors and learn from your mistakes. Empathy, the understanding of other people's point of view. Resilience, to get through tough times. Ernest Hemingway once said, everyone is broken by life, but afterwards, some are strong in the broken places. How true that was for Lincoln, who went after perseverance, to have to educate himself, and make himself the man he was, accountability, compassion. And most importantly, the guys who become the president, after a while, your drive for success is in you. And maybe everybody is ambitious for oneself at the beginning. But in the end, you are ambitious for something larger than yourself. And in Abraham Lincoln's case, he was willing, actually, in the summer of 1864, to lose the election, because he was told he had to compromise on slavery, in order to win the election, because so many hundreds of thousands had been dead. He said, I'd be damned in time and eternity if I returned the black warriors to slavery. As a result, he was able to win the election because Atlanta fell and the mood of the North changed. But that willingness to put country over party, country over self, is the most important thing we see in these characters. And how he could claim right now that he is the greatest president of all without those qualities? Those are the qualities that make up character.",

Historians claim they were one of the biggest blunders. Joe Ellis, the great historian from the early days of the Adams administration. And the idea of invoking that Act now.
