      "sentences": "In a blow to Vladimir Putin, Finland has now officially joined NATO, doubling the military alliances border with Russia.This hour I'll speak to NATO Secretary General about what that means for European security. First up though, dramatic and violent scenes emerging from Jerusalem today as Israeli police stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque. Hundreds arrested police appearing to beat some of the Palestinians inside who they call agitators. The raid came as Muslim worshippers were praying during the holy month of Ramadan and as Jews prepared to celebrate one of their holiest days Passover. Former President Donald Trump has slammed the prosecution in his indictments overnight after pleading not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Mr. Trump is now a criminal defendant and a Presidential candidate. Ukraine's President visits neighboring Poland and meets with his Polish counterpart President Zelenskyy thanked President Duda for standing shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, pressing the West to keep up its military support. Welcome, this is the second hour of \"Connect the World\" wherever you're watching, you are more than welcome. Finland has officially become the 31st member of the North Atlantic Treaty Association now organization marking a major shift in the security landscape in North Eastern Europe. This is what NATO's border with Russia looked like before Finland's accession it shared about 755 miles or 1200 kilometers land border with five NATO members. After yesterday now looks like this adding some 830 miles or 1300 kilometers to the alliances frontier with Russia more than doubling it. Finland's bid for NATO membership was prompted by Vladimir Putin's decision to invade Ukraine last year. The Kremlin has warned of countermeasures in response. So tonight we ask how Moscow responds will. Well, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg joining us now live via Skype from Brussels. Sir, it's good to have you with us! Moscow has accused NATO of threatening Russia's and I quote, security and national interest by officially welcoming Finland into the fold. The Kremlin Spokesperson said the move will force Moscow to and again, I quote here, take counter measures to ensure our own security, both tactically and strategically. So I'll put tonight's question to you how do you expect Moscow to respond?",

That was actually the clear purpose of the invasion of Ukraine was to prevent Ukraine from become a member. But also it was a declared policy from President Putin that he wanted Finland and Sweden to never become members of NATO to close NATO's door. He's getting the exact opposite. He's getting more NATO and eastern part of the alliance and he's getting more NATO members, Finland and Sweden. And that's the way free democratic nations are reacting when an authoritarian power like Russia tries to control what neighbors can do and try to reestablish his sphere of influence.",

Finland and Sweden applied in May last year already in June, all allies invited them to become members and only now, less than a year after Finland is a member and we are working hard to also get Sweden as a full member in the near future. We also have to understand that Sweden is in much better and much safer position now than before they applied because as soon as all allies invited them they got the status as an invitee, meaning that they are now integrating into NATO's military and civilian structures participating NATO, military and civilian activities and an allies provided bilateral security assurances. And also with Finland in Sweden becomes even safer.

And in the case of Vladimir Putin, he doesn't have too many international friends who will have these kinds of summits. He has a few. But this is yet again solidifying that relationship that has been a very critical to Vladimir Putin in their fighting of this wall, a couple of days of meetings will be interesting to see what comes out of those. Then you've also got, of course, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, President of Ukraine in Warsaw for this high profile meeting with the President of Poland. And you see the pomp and circumstance of this meeting unusually, President Zelenskyy traveling with the First Lady Olena Zelenska and being given this very prestigious honor in Poland now it speaks to the very close and increasingly close relationship between the two countries and between the two presidents. Zelenskyy Becky mentioned two specific things that are important. One is the, in the immediate aftermath of the start of this war, the fact that Poland opened their arms to almost a million, if not more, Ukrainians fleeing across the western border and also the ongoing military and diplomatic support from Poland to Ukraine. There were some interesting comments from Zelenskyy after that initial meeting, saying that Ukrainian forces are under a great deal of strain. And I'm using my own words here in Bakhmut in the east of the country, saying that there could be a situation if those forces are surrounded by Russian and mercenary forces that they could look for a withdrawal from the area, but he said they still are depending on ammunitions and arms coming from Poland and other countries to show up those defenses. Let me finish with Macron in China. Emmanuel Macron unlike other some other leaders in Europe has kept this discussion open in terms of bringing a negotiated end to this conflict. More, I think out in the open then some other leaders in recent months, who said that it's important not to turn Europe's back on China, continue to have trade relationship with the Chinese government. But you know it's unclear whether any of his treaties to Xi Jinping will lead to any kind of leverage over Russia on the ending of this war at this stage. At least in the on the in the public sphere, Xi Jinping has kept very vague in China's estimation of how they will help in this world. Becky?",

Israel has conducted airstrikes on suspectedHamas targets after rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel. The strikes came just hours after Israeli police stormed the Al Aqsa Mosque and made hundreds of arrests. Now this isn't the first time the Mosque has become a flashpoint. Of course, in 2017, Israel installed controversial security measures at the mosque including security cameras and metal detectors. Those were later removed to May of 2021. A confrontation between Israeli security forces in the crowd of demonstrators outside the mosque contributed to what was a deadly escalation in violence that killed at least 248 Palestinians in Gaza and 12 in Israel. And last year, more than 150 people were taken to hospital following violent clashes outside the mosque. Well, the Arab League Secretary General has condemned the Israeli forces storming of the courtyards of the Al-Aqsa Mosque overnight saying, and I quote, \"These irresponsible behaviors in the holy places affect the religious feelings of millions of Muslims around the world, especially during the holy month of Ramadan\".
