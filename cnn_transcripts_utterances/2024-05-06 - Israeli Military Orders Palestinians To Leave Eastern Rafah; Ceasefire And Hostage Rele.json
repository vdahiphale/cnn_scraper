And that would mean the 1.2 million Palestinian -- Palestinians sheltering -- We're nearly seven months into the war in Gaza, Israel appears to be readying for its long-awaited ground offensive in Rafah. It's ordering residents in eastern Rafah to evacuate to an area outside the city that an unrest spokesperson says is not suitable for human habitation. He says the order could impact up to 100,000 civilians. And for those who don't flee, aid agencies of warning of a humanitarian catastrophe and the potential bloodbath. Well, adding to that fear and panic. There massive plume of smoke from an Israeli airstrike in eastern Rafah. Israel has been staging airstrikes in the city for months. And Gaza officials report more than 26 people were killed there overnight, including children. Israel says the ground offensive and Rafah would be limited in scale, but any offensive there would seemingly defy the U.S. president's warning to his Israeli counterpart. The moving ground troops into Rafah would cross a red line. CNN has learned that Joe Biden and Benjamin Netanyahu will talk to each other on the phone again today, as the White House closely watches the situation. Jeremy Diamond is back with us this hour. Good to have you with us, Jeremy. So, we know that more than half the population in Gaza has been pushed into Rafah. Israel says that this operation is limited in scope, well, in fact, 100,000 people who are there, they are urging to evacuate. But these people have already evacuated multiple times, right?",

One man told us that he was fleeing now for the fourth time after being displaced from different areas where the Israeli military was conducting combat operations. Now, this evacuation is, as you said, expected to impact about 100,000 people. But there is also broader concern that more panic could be spreading throughout Rafah, even beyond the area where the Israeli military has directed people to evacuate. And that is the major concern for humanitarian aid officials is that this area where they are being directed to evacuate, there are concerns that it will not be sufficient, either for this 100,000 people living in this part of Eastern Rafah, but certainly not if more people -- more tens of thousands of people from other parts of Rafah flee north out of concern that they will be next, as the Israeli military sets the stage for this ground offensive, which it has been threatening now for months into Rafah. Now, we know, of course, that U.S. officials have long expressed serious concerns about a ground offensive into Rafah over the course of the last several weeks. And there is no sense yet that Israeli plans that have been shared with the Americans have been able to assuage those concerns about a sufficient shelter being set up for the civilian population. The Israeli military, for its part, says that it has brought in additional tents, food, medicine, set up field hospitals, in what they are describing as an expanded humanitarian zone, as in Al Mawasi area of Gaza, as well as in western Khan Younis and in central Gaza. But for now, we are not able to verify whether or not that shelter and those resources are indeed adequate. And all we can rely on for now is the concern the anxiety of the people on the ground, as well as the concerns being expressed by humanitarian aid officials, including the United Nations.",

But let me tell you, I just returned fromFlorida, where we witness orderly and peaceful commencement ceremonies at both University of Florida in Gainesville, and Florida State University in Tallahassee. But there's a new controversy here in the south. The University of Mississippi, also known affectionately here in the United States as Ole Miss, has opened an investigation into a confrontation between pro- Palestinian protesters and counter protesters on the school's campus. A confrontation caught on multiple cell phone cameras, has prompted allegations of \"hostility and racist\" overtones being portrayed during the heated exchanges. One video, in particular, shows a group of mostly young white men in the counter protests yelling at a black woman. That's happening in Mississippi. The president of George Washington University, as you were mentioning at the beginning, located in the capital, of course, said last night that the pro-Palestinian protest encampment that had occupied part of G.W.U.'s campus for more than a week, it's still there, is no longer peaceful and must be this banded. President Ellen Granberg has said the following in a statement. And here, I quote, \"The demonstration she said, like many around the country, has grown into what can only be classified as an illegal and potentially dangerous occupation of G.W. property.\" And Lynda, the president gave multiple examples of inappropriate conduct to support her conclusion, saying that, among other things, in the last five days, protesters have vandalized a university statue and flag surrounded and intimidated G.W. students with anti-Semitic images and hateful rhetoric. They've also chased people out of a public yard and pushed police officers and university maintenance staff. And officials at the University of California, Los Angeles, on the other hand, announced last night the school would return to regular operations today and plan to remain this way through the rest of the weekend. Lynda, as you may remember, UCLA canceled classes last week following a night marred by violence, in which, pro-Palestinian protesters were attacked by masked men for hours without police intervention. And finally, last night, the University of Southern California posted an announcement online saying the encampment at UPC, meaning University Park Campus has been cleared.

Now, top of the agenda, trade between China and the E.U., but also the war in Ukraine. That really is overshadowing discussions that it's now in its third year. And China's support for Russia's wartime economy is a huge and troubling issue for the Europeans. Macron and von der Leyen, no doubt reiterated U.S. calls for China to stop exports to Russia of dual use and other technologies that are propping up Russia's war effort. And they also want Xi to use his influence on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war. I think it's important to note, Lynda that Putin is traveling to Beijing later this month, and it reinforces the closeness of that relationship, which is alarming to the west. On the issue of trade. She is hoping to head off a trade war with the European Union as tensions rise over exports of Chinese electric vehicles and restricted market access for European companies in China. That is something that they are really complaining about. Xi, he said that he wants more Chinese companies to invest in France. France is China's third largest trading partner. And there are reports that an order (PH) will replace with Airbus for around 50 planes. You know, that will be incredibly lucrative. Analysts say though that this visit is more than just shoring up trade. It's part of China's strategy to exploit differences inside Europe. And they also believe that Xi will use this opportunity to encourage Macron to pursue greater autonomy from the U.S., as it tries really to weaken Washington's dominance. Now, after the bilat, Xi and Macron will hold a joint press conference. Then, there'll be a state dinner, and later, they will travel to the Pyrenees Mountains for some one-on-one time.

It does seem we're entering into a next phase of the prosecution's argument in regards to actually laying out the processes of these payments that were going on. What comes after that?

It's a man who sold his soul who will lie about anything. Well, the prosecution supports his statements by showing them documents that can't really be cross examined, because they say exactly what's in those documents. So, they're setting the stage for Cohen to get on the stand and continue to explain why he got the money, how it was tied to the election, where the money was going, and who knew why the money was coming to him and why it was being routed the way it was, and that who is Donald Trump.

And in this instance, the $1,000 fines, they haven't been deterring the bad behavior, the former President goes out and he makes the same out of court statements, he violates the gag orders. And the judge is really left with no choice. Now, it doesn't mean he's going to take him and throw him in the jail cell immediately and make him stay there overnight. Although, that's a possibility. The judge has to look at political repercussions from that, what it's going to do, how that's going to work outside of the courtroom, but he could do it in incremental steps. And by that, I mean, there are breaks that occurred during the trial during which the defendant is allowed to walk out of the courtroom. The next time he's finding -- he finds him in contempt, he may say, you know what, the next time we get a break, whether it's the 15 minute breaks, whether it's the lunch breaks, I have a holding cell behind my courtroom, all courtrooms have holding cells, that's where you're going, he will be in there with Secret Service agents, there won't be anybody else back there. And that's where you're going to sit. And maybe that will impress upon you that I'm serious about this gag order. Now, it could ultimately lead to an overnight incarceration.

That's according to some forecasters. It's been several weeks of unrelenting rain and intense flash flooding. The bad weather has killed at least 228 people, with dozens more missing and more than 200,000 forced from their homes. More heavy rain remains in the forecast for northern and western Kenya. Experts say El Nino and other natural weather patterns are to blame for the onslaught along with global warming. Our Larry Madowo joins me now from Nairobi.
