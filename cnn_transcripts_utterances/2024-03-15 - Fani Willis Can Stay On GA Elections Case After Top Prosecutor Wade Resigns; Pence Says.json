What that could mean for the case, moving forward? Also, maybe not surprising, and yet somehow still absolutely stunning. Former Vice President, Mike Pence, says he cannot in good conscience endorse Donald Trump. The fallout, tonight, coming fast and furious. And it's being called Hell on Earth. CNN is the first major news network, to arrive in Haiti's capital, since gang uprisings plunged the country into chaos and lawlessness. I'm Brianna Keilar, in for Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, Stormy Daniels, Michael Cohen and Company, left waiting for their day in court; Mike Pence left without a candidate, to support for President; and Fani Willis left without a lead prosecutor, as she goes up against the former President of the United States, in court. But the Fulton County D.A. is still standing, and so is the biggest case of her career, despite a more than two-month effort to derail it, by the Trump team, and co-defendants in Georgia. It wasn't a complete vindication for Willis, though, not by a longshot. Judge Scott McAfee admonishing her many times, in his searing decision, rebuking her, for both a \"Tremendous lapse in judgment,\" and the \"Unprofessional manner\" of her testimony, after she was accused of a conflict of interest, stemming from her romantic relationship, with Nathan Wade, the man she handpicked to be the lead prosecutor, on the case.

And when you talk about judges, and when you talk about criminal defendants, it's all about notice and hearing. He would have gotten in more trouble, I think, if he hadn't had a hearing on these allegations, if he had just dealt with them on paper. So, he has heard everybody out. He has issued an order that he clearly thought a lot about. He followed the law. He explained what the law was, and he dealt with it. He saw that there was a problem, and he remedied it. He remedied the problem that he saw. So, so far, we haven't heard any political fallout about the judge himself. Of course, the D.A. is always the subject of the Prosecuting Attorneys Commission, or I'm sorry, the new law that's coming in, to deal with prosecuting attorneys.

Remember that at the outset, the state said that they expected it would take about five months, I believe, to try the case. There's no way he's going to start a trial that's going to drag right across Election Day, not to mention the fact that we have federal courts, out there, that also have cases that they typically take priority over state charges like this. So, I just really think that there's no way the case is tried this year. And that we're talking next year, if Trump is elected, that's a different thing, because typically, a sitting president would not be hailed into state court, somewhere, to have to answer charges that would be done after their term.

So, I don't know whether Merchan will want to move that or not. But that's really the issue, because bumping this one back a month, runs it straight into that.

Using repetition of very simple phrases again, and again, so that people begin to hear it, and they hear it in their echo chamber, things like Stop the Steal, drain the swamp, lock her up. And then, the idea that if you're going to lie, make it a big lie. Because as Hitler wrote, in Mein Kampf, many people will tell white lies, and not think that that is immoral in any way. But most of us would never imagine, having the audacity, to tell a big lie, about something that is very significant. And we project on to others, that same morality. And so, with Donald Trump, we see this idea of a stolen election. What could be more audacious than that with zero evidence whatsoever, to just say it is true, and hope the people buy it. And in fact, we have seen many people believe it. We've got many people, who believe the election was stolen, who were motivated to attack the Capitol, to stop the certification of that election. And then, as I said, I think there are plenty of other people, who know better. You've got someone like Elise Stefanik, the Congresswoman from New York, who now uses the term, hostages, when talking about the January 6 defendants. I'm certain she knows better.

I've known Mike Pence, for over 20 years. And this was well-thought out. He realized that he could not support Donald Trump.

Ariel Henry effectively ousted, says he'll step aside, when a replacement is named through this process of a transitional government, being brokered by a number of outside parties, including the U.S. I know that you think that is definitely not the answer. What is the answer right now, as you see it, for getting to a new government and some stability? DANIEL FOOTE, FORMER U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR HAITI: The answer is for the first time in history, the second time in history, I guess, to give Haitians the right and the dignity of self-determining their transition and their way forward. The U.S. and international community has just completed 32 months of blindly and stubbornly, backing a completely illegitimate and hated leader, Ariel Henry, in Haiti. He did nothing but exacerbate the situation, and make it exponentially worse. And the international community is getting ready to do the same thing with this CARICOM construct, out of the Caribbean multilateral organization, where they say it's Haitian-led. And here's how it works. They, the foreigners, pick seven or nine Haitians, they're still fiddling around with the numbers. And then, those seven or nine Haitians pick the transition government, as opposed to the other 11.5 million Haitian. So, the Haitians are kind of up in arms about this. And the problem is now the gangs, which were talking about genocide a week ago, are now talking about revolution, and they're channeling the populations' desire, not to have a foolish solution that won't work, foisted upon them again.",

However, if that intervention is seen as propping up an illegitimate foreigner-imposed government, there's where your civil war comes. The Haitians are going to fight the peacekeepers.
