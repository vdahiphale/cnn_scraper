Good morning to you also, Phil.This -- look, Haley's team viewed this, and I was talking to multiple aides and supporters of hers right after speech gave the speech, they viewed the speech as a gift to her. They called it weird, they called it angry, and as I was speaking to them. And it really I think showed you how much both her speech kind of her attitude toward all of this really seemed to get under Donald Trump's skin. It was a dramatic change in tone as Phil showed from what we heard from the former president in Iowa. It is really the opposite of what Trump's aides kind of wanted him to be portraying here. And I think that it illustrates to you what we're in for as Haley decides -- tries to decide what she'll do in the context of this race. She's said she's going on to South Carolina. What does that mean for her? It is going to mean every day she stays in, attacks from the former president on everything from her looks in the final days of the campaign. We heard him misspelling intentionally her given name, putting up very unflattering photos of merging her face with Hillary Clinton. I mean, that's the kind of ugliness that we are going to see I think day in and day out. If she remains here in this race. Now, there is already this -- there is a \"Wall Street Journal\" opinion page, editorial page piece out this morning that is already kind of getting attention from what I would describe as I guess both sides of the Republican Party. Trump supporters, Vivek Ramaswamy for example, pointing to this as an example of what is wrong with the Republican Party. So this editorial says if Haley can remain competitive, there is an argument to stay in through the July convention. They say that Mr. Trump faces a treacherous legal road. Haley could stay in the race, rack up delegates and see what happens if he is found guilty. On the other side, you do have -- and I've talked to a number of Republicans who want the party to nominate someone other than Donald Trump. They want her to stay in the race for this very reason. So that is kind of the frame I think that she is going to have to grapple with here. But if she wants to stay in, she has to be prepared that one-on- one race with Donald Trump is always -- really puts you in a pretty harsh and nasty spotlight from him, Poppy.",

Yes, it does allow anybody who wants to vote in their primary vote, but it is a Republican stronghold, a more conservative base, more reminiscent of Iowa than it is New Hampshire.The big question though for Trump is how big are the warning signs here. When you have independents breaking the way that they did in New Hampshire, that is a problem. When you have fewer Republicans by a significant margin identifying with the MAGA movement than they did in Iowa, that's a significant problem. When you have the number of Haley voters, more than 80 percent, saying that they would be dissatisfied if Trump is the Republican nominee, that is a problem. That is an intra-party problem, that is a general election problem that Haley has continued to outline, whether or not it does anything for her momentum heading in to South Carolina, still very much a question.",
