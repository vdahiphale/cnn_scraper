We expect the biggest crowds to show up despite all of these security measures taking effect this Thursday, or this Thursday, rather, going through the weekend and the rest of the month to be in the second and third week of March.SARA SIDNER, HOST, \"CNN NEWS CENTRAL\": Carlos Suarez, thank you so much for your reporting. John. JOHN BERMAN, HOST, \"CNN NEWS CENTRAL\": This morning, some unexpected political news. George Santos is running for Congress. Yes, that George Santos, the serial fabulist who was expelled from Congress after a series of lies and federal indictments. That George -- RAHEL SOLOMON, HOST, \"CNN NEWSROOM\": Good morning, and welcome to our viewers all around the world. I'm Rahel Solomon, and this is CNN Newsroom. Just ahead, U.S. President Joe Biden taking his State of the Union message on the road. We will be live in Washington in just a moment. And the U.S. says that it is planning an emergency aid port on Gaza's coastline. We're going to have the details on this fresh attempt to get desperately needed aid into the territory. Plus, Haiti extending its state of emergency another month, as the country continues to be engulfed in chaos. Taking their message to the American people, today, the U.S. President, Vice President, First Lady, and second gentleman, all have their backs packed and are hitting the road to sell the message that the President laid out last night in his State of the Union address. Now, with both houses of Congress and millions of American voters watching, Joe Biden delivered a fiery defense of his presidency and an optimistic view of the future in Thursday's night's State of the Union speech, repeatedly ad-libbing at times, providing humorous jabs. President Biden seemed dead set on countering that Republican narrative that he is too old for the job, and he made it clear that he thinks Donald Trump presents an existential threat to American democracy. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: We must be honest. The threat to democracy must be defended. My predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth about January 6. I will not do that. This is the moment to speak the truth and to bury the lies. Here is the simple truth. You can't love your country only when you win. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Pretty much the first thing out of the gate by President Joe Biden in a speech laid and otherwise with key domestic issues and the forthcoming campaign against President Trump. Still, Ukraine was the first matter of substance he got to, sounding an extraordinary alarm, frankly, as to the existential crisis for European and possibly U.S. security that Ukraine represents at the moment because of the lack of aids, they are currently getting held up by a Republican-led Congress, making a comparison to his moment on the podium met in 1941 and President Roosevelt back then, referring not subtly, really to Putin as a comparison to Adolf Hitler, suggesting that back in 1941, Hitler was on the march in Europe. Well, now, Putin is on the march in Europe.And indeed, suggesting that Putin will not stop with Ukraine. He will potentially continue and threaten U.S. allies in Europe. So, stark rhetoric indeed. He referred to the current U.S. plan as not requiring American boots on the ground indeed. If the aid got through to Ukraine, Ukraine hoped they can hold the Russians back there. But, I should point out, 1941 was followed by 1944, where there certainly were U.S. boots on the ground to fight the Nazis and the D-Day landings. And so, an ominous tone, frankly, by President Biden, hinting at the possibility of wider conflict. I think many Ukrainians will take the gravity of his tone and feel some comforts in how prominently their struggle, their fight featured, but he didn't produce any actual financing for them. There was no new policy behind that speech. And indeed, he sought really to point the finger at Republicans for not providing him the bill he consigned to send the $60 billion over to Ukraine that's so urgently needed. That is causing them to run out of ammunition in the frontlines that we've been seeing over the past week. So, I think the stark moments certainly in terms of the rhetoric not met necessarily by new policy. Remember, there are some suggestions, may be frozen Russian assets could be used to fund Ukraine. That's not something that's been left upon yet. But, at stark warning about the future ahead, stark words about the threat Putin poses, but also nothing necessarily new in that speech to make Ukrainians wake up this morning and feel that they've somehow got a little stronger in a fight that we've seen them, sadly, look like they're beginning to lose in multiple points. On the frontline, a resurgent Russia going forwards now, trying to attack the new defensive positions that Ukraine has put for itself in the East after they withdrew from the town of Avdiivka two weeks ago now. And so, a very tough fight here for Ukraine. The speech reminding the world how important it is, but not necessarily getting that money to them any faster. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Odessa, Ukraine.

And he went in not only as the President, but as candidate Biden, as he was trying to not just convince the Democrats that he has got this. He knows how to campaign. He has the rigor and vigor to continue going in the months ahead, but also to point the finger at Republicans. I'm not going to be so easy to beat. Specifically, he called on House Republicans for not putting on the floor a package to aid Ukraine.You saw him going after them for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, really laying out the case for what has transpired, including making it more difficult for people in Alabama to get IVF treatment in the wake of that court decision in the state. He also walked through in detail what the Senate bipartisan immigration deal would have done and what is not being done at the southern border because it was not passed out of the Senate nor was it passed in the House of Representatives. If you remember, Rahel, that bill died a very quick death after House leaders made apparently clear that they were not going to put it on the floor, no matter what, even if it got out of the Senate. That was the final death knell. So, you saw several moments where Biden was poking fun at Republicans. [08:10:00] At one point, he was ribbing them for some times going back home and touting infrastructure projects in their district, even though many of those same House Republicans didn't actually vote for the underlying bill, a notable moment when he essentially said, if you don't want the money, you can send it back. I'd be happy to take it. And Pete Buttigieg, his Transportation Secretary, smiling a huge smile there. I think that it was really a moment for him to try to show that the campaign has begun. Rahel.",

Another person I talked to, Representative Gerry Connolly, a Democrat from Virginia, someone who is stuck by the President at every turn. Going into the speech, he said, President Biden really does. They've set expectations high. He really does have to meet them. And after the speech, I got to catch up with him, and he said that he really felt like the President delivered a strong and vigorous address.He did note, however, that it matters where he goes from here. On the campaign trail, he needs to show up and he needs to be the person he was in the room last night. Gerry Connolly argued otherwise, this speech was all for naught. So, obviously, a lot of preparation, months of preparation goes into a speech like the one that happened last night in the chamber. But, I thought it was a really interesting moment, and a lot of Democrats felt like they are feeling good running under Joe Biden on the ticket come November.",

Congressional Correspondent Lauren Fox, Lauren, thank you.Well, President Biden also made strong remarks about the \"gut- wrenching crisis in Gaza\" during his State of the Union address, saying that humanitarian assistance cannot be a bargaining chip or a secondary consideration. He announced that he has directed the U.S. military to establish a temporary report in Gaza for aid deliveries, and he called on Hamas to release the hostages, and he repeated calls for a two-state solution. Let's bring in CNN's Jeremy Diamond, who joins us from Tel Aviv. So, Jeremy, we've heard Biden announce his plans on a temporary aid port on Gaza's coastline. We're learning that more Western allies are joining the effort. Walk us through -- give us a sense of how this would work in practice. JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, that's right. Well, President Biden giving this announcement primetime footing during the State of the Union address. And today, we're learning that it won't just be the United States, but also Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Cyprus, all joining in this effort to create a maritime corridor that would essentially see ships carrying aid arrive in Cyprus. They would be checked there by Israeli forces in terms of the security checks on that aid, and then be brought to this temporary port that the United States plans on building off the coast of Gaza. Now, President Biden was very clear that this will not involve bringing U.S. troops into Gaza, that this will be coordinated with the Israeli government. But, this is also important to note that this is not an immediate solution to the desperate humanitarian situation that is unfolding on the ground in Gaza, where we are seeing more and more children dying of malnutrition as a result of the lack of aid, the insufficient aid that has gotten into northern Gaza. This will take weeks to actually get up and off the ground. So, in the meantime, the United States, and you heard President Biden yesterday, continuing to pressure Israel to do more to allow more land routes into the Gaza Strip. He said last night that Israel cannot use humanitarian aid as a bargaining chip. And he also made clear that Israel needs to do more, some of his strongest remarks on this issue to date. Now, Israel, for its part, did welcome the creation of this port, saying in a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that this will allow the increase of humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip and that they welcomed this decision.

Now, the meeting will be closed to the media. Trump and Orban have often openly supported each other, and the longtime Hungarian Prime Minister is considered the EU and NATO's closest leader to Russian President Vladimir Putin.CNN's Kristen Holmes joins us now live from West Palm Beach in Florida. Kristen, Hungary is a NATO member and Orban has reportedly not received an official invitation from the White House. Curious how many eyebrows this meeting is raising. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, Rahel, not only did he not receive an official invitation for the White House, but he didn't reach out and ask for any sort of meeting. Now, this takes on significance for a number of reasons. One, Donald Trump is a former President, but he is also the presumptive Republican nominee and could very well be President again, and it gives you some insight into the kind of leader that Donald Trump wants to be if he is reelected to office. He has long admired strongman, which of course Orban is. He is an authoritarian leader in Hungary. He has praised the fact that he is a strongman, saying at one point, some people don't like him because he is too strong. Nice to have a strong man in control of the country. Again, this gives you an idea of how Donald Trump is aligning himself or would align himself if he is brought back to the White House in November. The other part of this is that the two really are politically in sync on immigration, on various issues. Orban is considered very far right, obviously, as is Donald Trump. Orban, the only other thing we know that he has done while he has been in the United States is speak at the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. So, yes, eyebrows are being raised. And I will tell you that when I asked Trump's team what exactly is happening, what kind of meeting is this? They said it was a \"social meeting\". When I asked what exactly does that mean, they said it was just a friendly meeting with no agenda. Now, when two people like Orban and Trump sit down, it seems unlikely that there is no agenda, but that is what they are telling me as of now, Rahel.",

At one point, he said that the war in Ukraine wouldn't have happened if Donald Trump was in the White House. That sounds awfully familiar, because that is something that the former President has repeatedly said over and over again, obviously, with no proof, but that is one of his talking points.Their relationship has only grown. Now, I do not have any sort of background on whether or not they have met recently before this. It doesn't seem likely. Donald Trump has not traveled overseas recently at all, other than to go to his own golf course in Scotland.

Let's take a look and see how Wall Street is trading in less than an hour, Dow, NASDAQ, S&amp;P futures, all up, although I mean, Dow and NASDAQ are up slightly. The S&amp;P futures are up about a quarter of a percent.Now, in an election year, amid concerns about the potential for a slowing economy, the U.S. jobs report has become increasingly a critical economic barometer. So, let's bring in CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich to sort of walk us through the headline numbers here. Vanessa.",

      "sentences": "If you remember last month, Rahel, we reported from the January jobs report that there were 353,000 jobs added. People's eyeballs were popping out of their sockets. But, if you look at this report, it indicates that in January we actually saw 229,000 jobs added. That is a dramatic difference from what the initial report said. And between January and February of last year, the jobs numbers were revised down 167,000. But, that's nothing to be concerned about, because you still have robust job growth, and it's probably actually more encouraging for the Federal Reserve, in particular, to see a number in January, like 229,000 jobs added, as opposed to the eye- popping 353,000 jobs added, a signal that job growth has actually been steadier than we initially thought.",

      "sentences": "Yes. It seems to indicate that the job growth is cooling in a more gradual fashion, which I think most people would argue we probably need. In terms of the Fed and the implications for the Fed and the implications for inflation, there is also a wage growth information that we always learn in this report. What do we learn in terms of where wages are going?",

      "sentences": "We just cooled on an annual basis, 4.3 percent in January on an annual basis. We just were at about 4.5 percent. Of course, as an American, no one wants to see their wages go down. But, the problem is, is that wages right now are outpacing inflation, just a little bit too much for the Fed's comfort. They want to see wages -- wage growth at an annual rate of about 3.5 percent to just help a little bit with the inflation that we're seeing at 3.1 percent.So, inflation, excuse me, wages cooling, rather. As we're waiting for inflation to cool, this may be a good sign for the Federal Reserve. Everyone wants to know off of these jobs numbers, off CPI, which we're going to see next week, Rahel, what this means for the Federal Reserve and potentially cutting interest rates at some point this year. That will, of course, be encouraging for people who are looking to buy a home, people who have credit cards.",
