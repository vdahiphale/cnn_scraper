That's the margin that they're looking for. Anything in that area they believe is a victory.Now this is a very different Trump team that I talked to you just two weeks ago when they were very concerned about what they were seeing in Haley's poll numbers. They implemented a two part strategy. Now, just to remind viewers, in New Hampshire, Independents and Republicans can vote in the GOP primary. And what Trump's team was concerned about was those Independent voters, particularly voters who might go just to vote against Donald Trump or voters who are more left leaning who would be interested in a different choice. So they implemented a strategy hitting Nikki Haley in a series of ads, one on immigration that was to target their Republican base that they believe Donald Trump is still leading strongly. The other was hitting her on Social Security, that was to try and stem what they saw as a rise in Independent voters who are interested in her and it was clear that that got under Haley's skin. We have seen her have to answer question after question about Social Security. She continues to say that she does not want to change those security, but those ads, they were effective. So that's where the Trump team is right now. They are hoping for a big margin. So this is a definitive that they can put this to bed in terms of the Republican nomination, but they are waiting and they say anything in terms of a 7 percent or more would be a victory for them.

So these are people who showed up earlier throughout the day, there are more exit polls taking place now as people are going to polls, these numbers will shift over the course of the night. But I want to highlight for you what a different electorate is, different political DNA in New Hampshire than we saw a week ago in Iowa. Look here, among New Hampshire Republican primary voters today, 24 percent say they're very conservative, 39 percent say somewhat conservative, 31 percent identify themselves as moderate. That number in Iowa last week was 9 percent.That's how much more moderate this Republican primary electorate is than was the Iowa caucus electorate last week. Obviously only 6 percent in the GOP primary say they're liberal. How about those undeclared we've been talking about for quite some time? Look at what a huge chunk of the electorate they make up, 47 percent. You see they're in the middle 47 percent of Republican primary voters say in New Hampshire are undeclared or Independents in New Hampshire, they're called undeclared, 49 percent are registered Republicans. That's even a tick higher than we saw all the way back in 2012 in terms of Independents being a share of the electorate the last time there was a Republican only primary without anything going on on the Democratic side. That is going to be welcome news for Nikki Haley's campaign to see that number. Are you part of the MAGA movement? Only a third of voters in the primary today, again, these numbers are early, they will shift as we do more interviews, but 32 percent Say yes, they're part of the MAGA movement, 64 percent say no. In Iowa last week, Erin, that was split roughly half and half in the Iowa Republican electorate. And do you think Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election? This is now an even split among Republican primary voters in New Hampshire today, whereas in Iowa last week, two thirds of Iowa Republican caucus goers said they didn't think, wrongly said that they didn't think Joe Biden was legitimately elected. Here, that's half and half. This is an electorate -- this is why Nikki Haley put all her money in New Hampshire here, this is an electorate that just by its shape and contours, as we're seeing show up today, is one that makes Nikki Haley more competitive against Donald Trump.",

Some of our rivals had called New Hampshire for Hillary Clinton. Had called -- I mean, for Barack Obama, for Barack Obama.And we did not and we waited, why? Because we were told we had people on the ground and we were told by smart people in campaigns to watch. And there were a lot of late votes down here in the Manchester area, working class people. You just mentioned 05:00, rush hour, people coming out after work. So let's wait. Let's wait. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, right? This is why we count votes and this is why we're extra cautious here. Because sometimes what you see early on is not what you get at the end, not because anything nefarious is happening, because people vote at different times of the day and you have a lot of blue collar people here who a lot of them voted before they went to work this morning. We saw a lot of people out there early at 06:00 a.m. But if you didn't do that, and you want to vote, you're going to vote at 06:00, 05:36, 07:00, right up to the last minute because you just got out of work.",

Here, though, very conservative is only a quarter, 24 percent so far. Somewhat conservative 39 combined with moderate 31 that is a dominant majority.And that is very different than what you saw in Iowa. But also, John, I'm just looking back to my quick notes of New Hampshire in 2016, it is different than 2016. But honestly by not much, moderate up just a few points.

      "sentences": "It's not a huge increase. And so a couple points about that. Number one on the surface, those numbers say OK, that gives Haley a shot. She's in play because the electorate is composed of people who we know. Again, moderates like her, conservatives like him.So the more moderate you hear your first instinct should be that keeps her in play, that keeps her competitive. That's important. Number two, undeclared, they outnumber statewide registration, undeclared in New Hampshire, Independents, they call them undeclared there, outnumber both parties. So, you think the more undeclared people that should, should benefit her. She certainly needs a lot of them to come off the sidelines. However, a lot of Trump voters also are not fans of the Republican establishment. So some of them may not be registered as Republicans because they don't think of themselves as establishment people. So we need to be careful about that. I just want to add this, though, to go back to 2016. Even as we go through all this, this is the Republican Party in 2016. As you noted, in 2016, in New Hampshire, you had a more moderate electorate than you did in Iowa while this is Donald Trump's first win. Donald Trump won here in 2016 with that more moderate, more Independent electorate. So the question is, does he still have a hold on these people? Or do those numbers say those people are looking for a new choice? Because if you look here, number one, this is the entire state. So, we know for a fact, Donald Trump is the candidate of rural voters, right? So, anything you see lit up here now is a rural township, right?",

I think all of these numbers really show some sharp contrast is what we were talking about the composite of the voter last week in Iowa. So certainly, there's hope here that Nikki Haley is able to be within a stone's throw either a couple points up or a couple points down, and then has a full month to walk into the South Carolina primary where all -- if she shows up a few points up or down in this race, I think the donors will start to come in and give her a legitimate shot to try to turn some -- change the mind.",

Hillary Clinton was running against Bernie Sanders. So you probably didn't have as many of those moderates and liberals that you're talking about. You're seeing in the electorate right now in the early exits, you didn't have them because they were all participating in a Democratic primary. So, what this means is, I wonder what this means for Dean Phillips, because it means maybe some of the people that he was counting on who might show up in that Democratic primary to try to give him a little juice to poke President Biden, maybe they're not there, because maybe they're all playing in the Republican side.",

Immigration, do you believe most undocumented immigrants in the United States should be deported? A slim majority of Republican primary voters in New Hampshire, 51 percent say yes deported, 45 percent say they should be offered a chance at legal status. And on the issue of abortion, a national abortion ban, are you in favor of banning most or all abortions nationwide? Two thirds of New Hampshire Republican primary voters oppose such a national ban, only 27 percent say they favor a ban. And then U.S. role in the world, how do you see this? You know, there's this isolationist versus more global perspective within the Republican Party, a debate.

Jennifer, thanks so much for joining us. I know you've been in close contact with your network across New Hampshire all day traveling to polling sites across the state earlier this morning. So give our sense -- give our viewers a sense. What are you hearing? JENNIFER HORN, FMR. CHAIR, NEW HAMPSHIRE REPUBLICAN PARTY: Well, there's no question that we're going to exceed it. In my mind, there's no question we're going to exceed the expected turnout. Turnout is huge. If you look in Salem, you look in Bedford, two of our, you know, largest Republican strongholds here along the southern tier. In many of those polling places, turnout has already exceeded not just 2016. But what was expected today. And to your point, it is largely, largely Republican voters and, you know, undeclared participating in the Republican primary. And Wolf, there can be an argument made for both candidates as to who this benefits. But as you just heard from that voter in Manchester, my money is still with Donald Trump.",

I was speaking to someone just a couple minutes ago who said, you know, they think he could break 60 percent tonight. I'm not going to put my money on that. But it's his night. And it's that enthusiasm at 7 o'clock this morning, there were Trump sign holders at every polling place in Salem, where Nikki Haley needs to do well and should do well. There wasn't a single Nikki Haley sign holder. Now you can say signs don't vote. Of course they don't. But people who's standing out in the cold enthusiastic enough to hold those signs, they vote and that's where I really see the enthusiasm, manifesting itself today on the ground.",
