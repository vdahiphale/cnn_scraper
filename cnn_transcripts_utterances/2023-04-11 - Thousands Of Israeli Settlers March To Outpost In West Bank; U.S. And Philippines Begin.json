The Palestinians say more than 200 people were injured near Beta with 22 people hit by rubber bullets. The Israeli military says it was responding to what it called a riot. The latest violence began after Israeli police raided a holy mosque one week ago.Elliott Gotkine is live in Jerusalem for us. Elliott, thousands of Israelis and even some cabinet members marched to an abandoned settlement in the West Bank on Monday calling for the government to resettle it.

      "sentences": "Christine, it's no secret that ministers like National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, are supportive of building out and expanding settlements and Eviatar has been a bit of cool (INAUDIBLE) -- this particular settlement -- in the West Bank, which the settler movement has been trying to legalize for a while now.For now, it remains in an illegal outpost but that's not to say that won't change. This government has already legalized nine outposts or announced that it was legalizing nine legal settler outposts just in February, and then promised the White House that it wouldn't do that anymore for the coming months. So at some point, that time clock will run down and presumably they will try and legalize some more. But for now, that particular settlement remains an illegal outpost. Beyond that we've also been watching this news conference from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he gave on Monday night here in Israel. Quite a rare news conference, taking questions and answers. And he was doing that for three main reasons. One, to show -- to show his supporters that he has still got his hands on the wheel and that he's still in control. And also to show Israel's enemies, particularly Palestinian militants with whom there have been a number of clashes, but its rockets from Gaza sent into Israel and most notably from Lebanon -- the biggest barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon into Israel since 2006 -- to show that Israel is still able to defend itself and able to strike back as and when it feels the need to do so despite those very visible internal divisions within Israel and those hundreds of thousands of Israelis out on the streets for the past three months protesting against the government's plans for a judicial overhaul that would pretty much remove all checks and balances on the government. He was also using the opportunity for this news conference to blame the previous government for the deteriorating security situation. And perhaps most importantly to officially rescind his firing of his defense minister, which sparked mass protests and eventually prompted him to pause plans for the judicial overhaul. So the defense minister officially now has not been fired -- Christine.",

So far, the Rays have not hit that speed bump. They are off to a fantastic start.Tampa, the last undefeated team in the Majors, hosting the Red Sox last night. Scoreless through seven but Boston threatening in the eighth with the bases loaded. Colin Foshay freezing Rafael Devers for the strikeout to end the inning. And then we move to the bottom of the eighth inning. You had Brandon Lowe finally breaking through. A nice little solo shot. The only run of the game as the Rays become the first time since the '87 Brewers to start a season with 10 straight wins. A long way to go but off to a really nice start. One week after the most-watched National Championship game in women's college basketball history, some of the sport's biggest stars are going pro -- none bigger than Aliyah Boston this year. The Indiana Fever selecting South Carolina's superstar with the first pick of the WNBA draft. The native of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, three-time All- American, and swept National Player of the Year honors last year. If you love college basketball you know her name. In fact, South Carolina had five players taken last night. That is the fourth time that has ever happened. They had a phenomenal year. A lot of talent on that roster. Meantime, LSU's Angel Reese and Iowa's Caitlin Clark, the stars of last week's championship game, not eligible to be drafted yet, so we'll wait a few more years to see them in the league. But the WNBA season tips off on May 19. We're looking forward to that. The NBA's Playoff Play-In tipping off tonight. Minnesota will be without Rudy Gobert against LeBron and the Lakers. They are very short-staffed heading into this game. The Timberwolves suspended the center for punching his teammate Kyle Anderson in the chest during a heated exchange on the bench on Sunday. Gobert has since apologized and will be allowed to rejoin the team either for a potential first-round series against the Grizzlies if Minnesota wins, or against the winner of the Thunder-Pelicans game if Minnesota loses. So the Wolves and Lakers -- second half of a doubleheader starting with the Hawks at the Heat, 7:30 eastern. Both of those games are on TNT. And lastly for you this morning, the Baltimore Orioles might have the best news celebration of the season so far, if you're into this kind of thing. It's called the Home Run Hose. Ryan Mountcastle and Adley Rutschman both actually decided to partake, Christine, after going long in a 5-1 win over the A's. For those wondering at home, the team tweeting, \"We're staying hydrated over here.\" Just to clear up any confusion about what, in fact, might be running down that hose, just a little bit of hydration. Just a little bit of celebration.",

We're expecting to see a year-over-year increase in the next set of numbers of about 5.2 percent. Those are getting closer to the Federal Reserve's target -- a lot closer than the high of 9.1 percent that we had last June -- but now close enough to that two percent range.
