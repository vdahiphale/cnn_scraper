LBJ's daughter, Luci Baines Johnson, on joining the children of presidents from both parties to respond after the Trump assassination attempt. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. We thought we'd start this program tonight with a blast from the past, which, nonetheless, is a tradition that still signals the peaceful transition of power. It's the British opening of Parliament, marked by ancient, some might say, anachronistic pageantry, where the constitutional monarch reads a speech laying out his government's agenda. In this case, the new Labour government, which was elected three weeks ago, after 14 years of Tory rule. A short campaign was full of the thrust and parry of politics, but none of the extreme verbal or actual violence that has rocked America. While in the United States, at the Republican National Convention, the party is reckoning with a failed assassination attempt against Former President Trump, and a bitterly divided nation looks with some trepidation to the rest of the campaign and November's election. On day three of the convention in Milwaukee, one thing is crystal clear, Trump is king of the GOP. Even his former rivals for the nomination, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, despite attacking him throughout the primaries, now pledge their allegiance. Unity is their theme, but our next guest says it risks erasing important context about this presidential race. In The Atlantic, writer David Frum argues that while all decent people welcome Trump's life being saved, his own conduct leading up to that day should not be forgotten. David Frum joins me now from Wellington, Ontario in Canada. David Frum, welcome back to the program.",

His abilities are not in question. Unlike Donald Trump at the head of the ticket, there is nothing of the charlatan about J. D. Vance. He is a formidable, formidable intellect, a formidable talent, a man of great self- discipline, and a man of great ambition, even more than usual for politician. But where he is different from most is he's a man of extraordinary moral and intellectual flexibility, to put it mildly. He has changed his mind on many issues. And the stories he tells about why he's changed his mind are not true, or at least they don't line up with the dates. For example, that he says the reason he is so in favor of betraying Ukraine now is because of his disillusionment with the Iraq war. Well, he was writing for me half a decade after he came back from military service. And he was then an advocate of traditional American global leadership.

It's hard to -- you can't disqualify anybody. In fact, you would accept anything. I think we are really in danger of losing sight of the enormity of the January 6th event, a serving president tried to organize a mob to sack Congress, maybe kidnap the speaker of the house, maybe kidnap his own vice president, maybe kill them, all in order to stop a count that they had no legal right to stop, that no one had a legal right to stop, that would prevent the winner of the election from take -- claiming the presidency and install the loser of the election as president by violence. You know, I used to do a lot of inauguration day TV and not a big fish in the Washington punditry pool. So, I would be on at the three hours before anything happened. And there wasn't a lot of time to fill. And so, we'd all natter on about the unbroken American tradition of the peaceful transfer of power as if Denmark doesn't transfer power peacefully, as if Britain, as you said, doesn't transfer power peacefully. But the reason we talk so much about this allegedly, but not true, unique event is because actually, the transfer of power is a very fraught moment in the United States, but -- year after year, administration after administration, decade after decade, century after century, with the exception of the terrible events of the 1860s and the attempt to repeat them in the 1870s, the transfer of power was peaceful despite the danger in the air. In 2020 and 2021, that did not happen. Donald trump broke that sacred tradition and the clock is reset. We don't have that tradition anymore. We'll see what happens in 2024 whether he tries violence again.",

That's for darn sure. He's a U.S. senator, but he's only been there about a year and a half. He's not an insider to Washington, right? So, there's an opportunity. He kind of brings that disruption a little bit. He's not going to do it and hasn't done it like folks have been in Washington for decades and decades. So, he has that outsider perspective, which is very refreshing, I think, to a lot of Americans. And frankly, he's just a really nice guy. I mean, he's a very, very nice guy. He's had his differences with Trump in the past, as have I have, I think most folks are -- have at some point. I mean, Kamala Harris has had some pretty amazing differences with Joe Biden in her past. I mean, if you go back to that debate where she tore Joe Biden apart.",

I'm a big believer in local government and limited government, localized control. And then there's obviously the aspects of what we're going to do internationally and the role of America that we need to play internationally. And we can all have our differences there, even amongst Republicans. So, no, I don't think he represents a -- the party going in one direction or not. As we know, Former President Trump, I think he's doing very well. My guess is he's going -- if I was a betting man, he's going to be winning in November and be the next president. He's the spokesperson for the party. J.D. is a part of that now. But that doesn't mean that their philosophies and principles represent every single Republican across the board. And that's OK. Nothing wrong with that. There can be a lot of different points of view. And at the end of the day, what you really want is to have a president and a vice president that understand their roles, that can work as a team, work with states, work with Congress, hopefully find more efficiencies in government, keep America strong throughout the world. You can have different strategies and how to do that, but I'm a firm believer that world peace comes through America's strength. And you have to support your allies and you have to put fear in your enemies. And I think, you know, there's an opportunity to kind of enhance that a little bit. I think Former President Trump did it very well in his first term. There's no doubt about that on the international side.

Because they didn't want to talk about inflation. They didn't want to talk about what's going on in the border. They didn't want to talk about the struggles of the cost of living that every American has. So, they tried to make it about this bigger existential thing, and how Donald Trump is a threat to America and a threat to democracy. And no one's buying it. No one's buying it up and down. And the more we saw these trials get mishandled and all the other shenanigans that were going on with them, the more the liberal media tripled down on that aspect, it blew up in their faces and just put more winds in the sails of Former President Trump. The other issue, let's remember, Trump won the primaries, right? I tried really hard, you know, for Nikki Haley. I think, you know, we had a lot of other really great candidates out there, obviously, but he -- unlike Joe Biden, Donald Trump and Nikki Haley went through states, went through the primaries, went through the campaigns, and the voters had their say. And so, everyone said, OK, we fought it out the right way. Everyone had their shot. They voted for Trump. We're going to get behind Trump. And everyone's getting behind him because that's what primaries are. You fight it out hard and you galvanize. The Democrats tried to coronate and they tried to consistently tell you that there was nothing wrong with Joe Biden, that everything was just fine, we're going to try to skip the first in the nation primary in New Hampshire. We don't need to have real challengers here. And now, look at where they are. It's come -- again, blown up in their faces and that's their doing. That's a hundred percent their doing. It's completely on them. So, at the end of the day, all of their attempts to \"thwart Donald Trump and the Republican Party\" instead of talking about issues and finding better solutions and doing elections the right way, they tried to do it this kind of different way, this existential way, as I like to say, and it's blown up in their face. And so, yes, there's no doubt that Donald Trump is in a much stronger position today than he has been in the last four years. He's got all the wind at its sails. The Democrats are in complete disarray. Who knows what's going to happen at that convention. You never know what you're going to get out of Joe Biden in any -- in every single interview, even all of his supporters are biting their fingernails, praying he can just answer a question.",

He's earned the right to say and do whatever he wants, as has every single American in this country. The problem I have with the liberal elite is they're judging people. They're judging people for the priority. Some people think the border is a number one issue, that it's a huge domestic -- potential domestic and terrorist threat coming across the border. And I completely understand that. And I agree with that. I think it's one of the top two issues in the country, but the Biden administration has done nothing. And so, folks are saying, we demand a change. We don't like January 6th. We don't like an election denial, but I need a change with these other things. And so, the problem is, going back to your original question, for two years, all we've heard out of the liberal media and the liberal elite are, yes, but January 6th and these trials, January 6th and these trials, they're not talking about things that real Americans want to talk about. And that's why Republicans are doing so well. They're talking about real issues. They're putting real ideas on the table. They're engaging in the conversation in the right way as elections are supposed to be done. And so, the Democrats, again, have put all their marbles and, you know, talking about trials and a threat to democracy. I mean, let's talk about the threat to democracy here. Think of all the folks that voted for Joe Biden. They did so -- I didn't do it, but they did so thinking that he was going to be making decisions for this country. Is he? Clearly not. Clearly, he's not making decisions on a day-to-day basis for this country. So, everyone voted for someone, and I can't tell you who's actually making those decisions. That is very undemocratic, right? That's not the democratic process. Vote for someone, but don't worry, someone else is going to be in charge, and we're not going to tell you who it is. I mean, really, can you tell me who's making all the day-to-day decisions out of the White House right now? No. At least with Trump, you might not agree with his positions, you might -- you know, we don't like his tweets, we don't like his personality sometimes, but at least you know he's making real decisions for the country and where things are going, and you can have a discussion about where that is. But literally, the Democrats are trying to now get behind Joe Biden, and they don't even know what they got. None of us do. So, that that gets people -- that's not even -- that's not a disagreement of ideas anymore, that's just, well, what are we voting for? Who's literally going to be in charge if we vote for Joe Biden? But the Democrats are saying, don't worry, it's just not Trump. That's all you need to worry about. That's a failed message. That's a failed strategy. And then the reason is, because it's not showing any respect to the American voter. It's not showing any respect to the fact that voters care about ideas and issues and policies and things that will impact their families. It's just saying trust us it's not Trump. And so, I think this is -- it all plays in to a failed master plan on the Democrat side that we're just going to bash on Trump, tell people he's scary, tell people he's going to bring America down, he's going to end America, the American process, the American experiment, a threat to democracy. We use all these big, scary words and be so polarizing and so fearful of him that America will have no doubt but not vote for him. That's not how it works, guys.",
