      "sentences": "Hello and a warm welcome to our viewers joining us from the United States and around the world. 4 a.m. here in New York, 9 a.m. in London. I'm Erica Hill.Good to have you with us on this election day in America. In the hours ahead, voters across the U.S. will be heading to the polls to make their voices heard. Though, keep in mind, nearly 80 million Americans have already cast their ballots for the next president, thanks to early voting in nearly every state. So now those final votes will come today. At midnight, the very first election day votes were cast and quickly counted in the tiny New Hampshire township of Dixville Notch. The results there? A tie. Three votes for Kamala Harris, three for Donald Trump. Early ballots, meantime, are being counted in Maricopa County, Arizona. It's one of the seven key battleground states that could sway the election in favor of Trump or Harris. Both candidates making their final pitches to voters in some of those other crucial states. And their closing arguments couldn't be more different. Harris held her last rally of the campaign in Pennsylvania on Monday night. She had spent the day crisscrossing the state there, telling voters they have the momentum. But she also urged her supporters to finish how they started, with optimism, energy and joy, saying they will make the difference in the election. Her Republican opponent spent more than two hours on stage, delivering his final pitch to voters at a Michigan rally, his third state of the day. His focus? Immigration, the economy and, once again, unfounded claims of election fraud. The final pre-election poll from NPR, PBS News and Marist finds Kamala Harris with a narrow lead over Donald Trump, as you see there, 51 to 47 percent among likely voters. And as we incorporate that into the latest and final CNN Poll of Polls for campaign 2024, you see Harris at 49 percent, Donald Trump 47 percent. In an average of likely voters, all of this to say, it's a dead heat, people. We are still in that place. Of the last five latest surveys, two show an edge for Harris, three show no clear winner. And it is that tight race that is really fueling the final push from both campaigns. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We are optimistic and we are excited about what we can do together. And we know it is time for a new generation of leadership in America. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out. With your vote in this election, you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them. This nation belongs to you. GOV. TIM WALZ, D-MN, VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: You know the math. It's the blue wall. The blue wall must hold. The blue wall must hold.",

Vance calling the sitting Vice President of the United States the first female Vice President, really calling anybody in public trash, just seems to me incredibly indicative of where this campaign is ending. As we said in the last segment, from Island of Garbage to I Will Protect Women, whether they like it or not, just, you know, lining up Liz Cheney in front of rifles. I mean, Trump has spent the last week reminding voters of everything they didn't like about him when he was president.And Harris has, I think, you know, very effectively tried to play off that, sometimes by portraying him as a threat, but sometimes also by just arguing this is exhausting and we don't need to keep doing this. [04:05:00] I will just point out one fact, you know, I have spent my career talking about the geographic and demographic fault lines between the parties and certainly, Erica, you know, we've been on lots of segments over this year. We've talked about college versus non-college, urban versus rural, young versus old. There is one really simple rule of thumb. Women are a majority of the vote in every swing state and nationally. Women have cast more ballots than men in every election since 1980. And what that means is that to win the swing states and to win the national popular vote, Trump has to win men by more than Harris wins women. It is a very simple equation for this election. And Vance, in particular, has just made a whole series of comments since he got on the stage that make that challenge much more formidable everywhere outside the South, where there are a lot of very culturally conservative white women. But that is a simple rule. If Donald Trump doesn't win men by more than Harris wins women, he's going to have a long night in those swing states.",

And so when we look at this, Mark, you know, Ron talked about how exhausting some of this has been.There's also a lot of this that is baked in. I mean, yes, there's a ton of terrible language, and it is certainly not what I would like my kids to see and grow up doing. And yet, when you look at it, there isn't a lot of shock factor left anymore. So given that, how much does this rhetoric and this language change things in these final days?",

      "sentences": "Well, you're right about us becoming really dulled to it all. I mean, we've been listening to this type of language now pretty consistently for the last eight years. And what we've seen that, you know, the discourse or the lack of discourse in politics has now kind of spread into civil society.I mean, we see neighbors that don't get along because of politics. We have families that are broken up because of politics. So, you know, that in itself is pretty disturbing. But, you know, as Ron talks about, he talks about, you know, so detailed and so well, is you've really got to dice and cut up the numbers and look at really what are the subset of folks we're looking for right now. You know, Ron's right about women and in how Donald Trump really needs to see not only these rallies, people to show up at these rallies, right, these quote-unquote low propensity voters, these younger men 18 to 29, 18 to 30, he needs them to go out and vote. Now, the Trump campaign says that they have gone out and vote. We don't know if that is true. We do know that the early vote numbers are up, but we don't know if those are traditional voters at all. But really, what we're going to do is really slice this down to seven states and then we're going to slice it down to probably two or three states. And I think that when we look at these states such as Michigan and Wisconsin, Kamala Harris spent five stops in Wisconsin yesterday, three stops by Tim Walls, her running mate in Wisconsin. Clearly, there's something in those two states that they either see where they can win or they may have a little concern about losing. At the same time, look at where Trump is going. You know, Trump decided to go to Grand Rapids to do his closing rally. That is the third time he has done that in the third campaign. But it wasn't just him that went to Michigan. We also saw Vance go there as well yesterday. So do they see something there or are they trying to do a head fake? Kind of late to try to do a head fake, but in politics, who knows?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Erica. And this goes to what I was saying in the earlier segment, which is that part of the Kamala Harris campaign strategy is to appeal to independents, to disaffected moderate Republicans, even disaffected conservative Republicans like Liz Cheney, who understand that we are at a moment in time that is much more important than partisan politics, that it transcends party, that it is about who we are as a nation and who we want to be in terms of where do we want to raise our kids? How do we want to raise our kids?You know, Erica, I've been working with a lot of groups that are going door to door. And one of the things that I'm hearing from them that they hear about is that they're talking to undecided voters, voters who voted for Trump in 2016, voted for Trump in 2020, but are now taking a look and they're exhausted. And they're saying, look, this man is right now what I'm hearing from him is much worse than what I have heard from him before. He has become an absolute bully. And how can I raise my kids in a time when I am trying to desperately teach them to not be this and then go out and vote for this? And so while I think that a lot of Republicans and strategists and Trump supporters are saying, look, Trump is Trump. He's who he is. People know who he is. I think a lot of Americans are looking at his rhetoric, are looking at his demeanor, and they see somebody who is much worse, much darker, frankly, much more unhinged. And there have been articles written about this, about how his language has changed and that has become a lot more divisive and dystopian. And Americans can see that. And so even those who have been voting for him and supporting him before now take a look at him and say, I can't do this anymore, which is why I think Kamala Harris's message about we don't have to do this anymore, we don't have to live like this anymore, we can turn the page, we can move forward, we can find a new pathway forward together, that kind of message I think is appealing for those kinds of voters.",

Women are more of the first-time voters, young voters, single voters, infrequent voters.The gap between women and men and all of those categories in the early vote is as big as it was in 2020, and sometimes even bigger.

And so she may be effectively delivering that message. We found that 79 percent of Democrats strongly disagreed that Donald Trump was a person of good moral character, for example, while only 58 percent of Republicans strongly disagreed with the idea that Vice President Harris was a person of good moral character.

But it may be the case that this is actually slightly more motivating for Democrats than for Republicans.And one of the questions we asked in our most recent survey was a question about, do you agree or disagree with this statement on abortion should be legal in most or all cases? And for Democrats, you know, men and women answered, Democratic men and women answered the question about the same, about 60 percent of women strongly agree, 58 percent of Democratic men. But in the strongly disagree category, which is again, mostly Republicans, you know, there's only 31 percent amongst women and 32 percent amongst Republican men.
