Four weeks after the midterms, Georgia voters are in the last days of a state Senate race, a runoff for a seat in the sharply divided Senate. Plus despite hundreds of interviews and more than a thousand tips, we still do not know who is responsible for the deaths of four University of Idaho students. But police now say a sixth person on the lease was not involved. And molten lava from the world's largest active volcano inches towards a critical highway. You're in the CNN NEWSROOM. It's the final weekend of campaigning in the last undecided race from the midterms. Georgia voters head to the polls on Tuesday for the Senate runoff between incumbent Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker. And both men are squeezing in campaign events in these last three days. CNN's Dianne Gallagher joins us now. And what's notable here, Dianne, one man squeezing in more events than the other, right?",

It's the third event of the day for Reverend Warnock. It's indicative of what his entire campaign has been like throughout this runoff period.Much more aggressive schedule with much more -- many more get-out-the- vote events. Three of them today. Three of them at least tomorrow across the state. He spoke at an AFL-CIO event this morning. Again, we're at this tonight. We're going to see Senator Ossoff with him, Daniel Dae Kim, others. This is what we've seen, many events, many surrogates coming out and doing this in an aggressive manner. On the contrary, today for his challenger Republican Herschel Walker there was a tailgate before the SEC championship game which of course pitted the LSU Tigers against Herschel Walker's University of Georgia Bulldogs. But it wasn't open necessarily to the press and it wasn't advertised as a public event. We once again trying to ask him questions. Many in the media did. We're not even allowed to get close to the candidate. That has been the case at many of the events for the entire duration of this four-week runoff period. In fact he has one event so far on his public schedule tomorrow. And that's kind of what we've seen this entire time, this more relaxed pace from the Republican as he has one or two events. In fact he even took five days off of public events during again just this four-week period -- Pamela.",

They have not concluded whether it was the students that were targeted or whether it was the house that was targeted. Now speaking to NewsNation, Xana Kernodle's mother saying this. She says, \"I do not think it was the house that was targeted. I believe wholeheartedly that it was those kids who were targeted. They weren't just acquaintances. These kids were like best friends.

And Warnock on his side has been campaigning for Senate for three years straight, so I think what he wants to do next is take a vacation.But big picture, I think what's so interesting about this is to your point you have these two candidates who seem to be offering new avenues of victory. You have Kemp, who is Trump's public enemy number one, too, for months, who had a Trump-backed opponent and beat him by 50-plus points. Went on to defeat a well-funded Democrat by almost eight points. Then you have Warnock, who, you know, came into politics after being pastor of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s church. He was something of an activist. And now he is the Democrat in Georgia who outperformed every other. He's the only one that got more votes than a Republican.

But at the same time, I mean, Warnock outspent Walker 3-1 in the general and he still only got 35,000 more votes than him.And so Democrats are feeling cautiously optimistic here, but nobody feels like this is in the bag because turnout in a runoff is so unpredictable. And to the point before, I mean, Walker has caught up a little bit, it's now I think 2-1 Democrat per Republican right now, but still all bets are off. Kemp won by eight points in November.",

You know, now we have a challenge to his residency, that he took a homestead exemption in Texas. There are all of this scrutiny that's come on Walker, and people don't trust him and we see that in the polling that people have a more favorable impression of Warnock than Walker, and he just hasn't been able to convince some voters. Now that being said, he's kind of like the Michael Jordan of Georgia, with his football career, and so that does go a long way. I mean, a lot of people who are diehard Herschel Walker fans forever, and they don't buy any of this, and they believe that he has made up for past wrongs and all of that. So I think this race is really coming down to these two candidates, because Georgia voters know them both really well. Warnock has been on the airwaves for three-plus years and Walker is an icon here in Georgia.

So for anybody out there that is saying, well, you know, Kanye, he came out previously and he has said he has mental health issues, and then, he has come back and he says, he is not bipolar. And then he says he is bipolar. He has wavered on that over the years. This is not just an isolated few weeks of a breakdown, Pamela. This is behavior that has been happening for years behind the scenes. He is finally just so brazen with it all, perhaps because every single major corporation has dropped him, and he and his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian officially finalized their divorce just a few days ago, maybe he feels he has absolutely nothing else to lose. So now, everything he's been saying behind the scenes, he's now saying publicly,",

This is not Mel Gibson, for those out there on social media that are comparing this to Mel Gibson being pulled over for his -- when he was pulled over for a DUI in 2006 and the terrible things he said about the Jewish people. Okay, that's in one bucket. But Kanye? This is a pattern for years. Will there be people, Pamela, that will support Kanye? He still has millions of followers on social media. There will always be people who support extremist behavior or turn a blind eye because they love someone's music, right? I mean, you can look at a lot of celebrities that have made headlines for bad things, whether it's Michael Jackson, or R. Kelly, and people stand by them, right, because they don't -- because they separate the artist from the person. But in this particular case, coming back into mainstream Hollywood. No, not at all. It's not a typical road to redemption for Kanye. I don't see how an apology can fix this at all.

Plus, an American killed on a cruise after the ship was hit by a so- called rogue wave, the science behind what happened, up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [19:56:19] BROWN: So, here is an interesting job posting. Do you want to live in New York City? Do you want to make a good salary? Do you hate rats? If so, then this is the job for you. New York City is recruiting a new Director of Rodent Mitigation -- such a formal sounding name -- to find a way to rid the streets of its most notorious furry inhabitants, and there are some cheeky language. The so-called rat czar posting. The city is seeking someone, \"highly motivated and somewhat blood thirsty. And you'll need a swashbuckling attitude, crafty humor, and general aura of badassery.\" That isn't the job post. An often repeated urban legend tells us that New York has more rats than people or over eight million, but in reality, it may only be around two million rats in the city. Washington DC where I am now, it needs a rat czar. It must not be far behind New York City. Well, Viking Cruises confirms a passenger on one of its ships was killed when it was hit by a \"rogue wave.\" The wave hit the ship during a storm this week. Four more people on board were injured. The wave broke several panes of glass on the cruise, and then fell onto and killed an American woman. CNN meteorologist Gene Norman joins us now. Gene, help us understand this. What are rogue waves? And where do they come from?",

      "sentences": "Well, Pamela, good to join you.Yes, that's a really good question, because scientists have been studying this for a while. Basically, a rogue wave is a wave that grows to be the height -- twice the height of the waves around it, in some cases, we've seen these get up to sixty, eighty and in some cases, 90 feet tall. They come from unexpected directions, which is really challenging, and well, they occur faster than a lot of the ship's radars can detect. Scientists believe there are two main reasons why these waves occur. One is constructive interference. This is basically where one or more waves combined to create that rogue wave. The second is primarily due to the weather, because we're talking about strong winds that interact with the waves that are out there already cause the waves to get taller and steeper building to those rogue waves. And scientists had a pretty good idea about where these are more likely to occur, in the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean, and then in the Southern hemisphere around the tip of South America and also the tip of Africa. So these are areas that we look for, and in fact, this ship that was having the problem over the week was coming from Ushuaia in Argentina and made its way all the way down across the Drake Passage to Northern Antarctica and that is where a big storm moved through. You see that big purple blob, that was a storm, it could have again caused these waves to get very intense. Good news on the horizon is that scientists are trying to track these. A European Space Agency is keeping a catalogue and new research at MIT could lead to a forecast for these. We are still a ways off from being able to pinpoint exactly when they're going to occur.",
