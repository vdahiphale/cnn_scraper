The supposedly sour peach responds in moments.Live at the table, Geoff Duncan, Mo Elleithee, Jason Osborne and Lauren Leader. Welcome to a special edition of NewsNight, State of the Race. Good evening, I'm Jessica Dean in New York. Abby Phillip is off tonight. And let's get right to what America is talking about. That's job interviews. Kamala Harris closing in on a potentially campaign- altering decision, that's choosing her vice presidential nominee. And this weekend, she's meeting with the final contestants in what's been the most watched reality show this summer. We've got our panel here to talk all about it. Good evening everyone. It's a summer Friday and we have a veep stakes going on. Is this Josh Shapiro's job to lose? I think that is what the buzz is as we close out this Friday. Mo, what are you hearing?",

He's really good, really dynamic on the stump. And this is an election where you really want a really good and dynamic running mate out on the stump and he might be worth a couple of points in a state that is a must win for her, and that will probably be decided by a couple of points. But I think when you look at him and you look at Secretary Buttigieg and you look at Governor Walz, the great thing about this field is I don't think she goes wrong with any of them.

Because, ultimately, from a political perspective, what's happened, he's done exactly what you said, he brought back to the forefront an issue that Trump absolutely does not want to touch with a 10-foot pole, because the next part of that conversation is when you bring back the clips of Trump recently, you know, within the last five years saying that there should be punishment for women who seek abortions. He has repeatedly said that he is comfortable with the extreme restrictions in states that have happened because of the, because of Dobbs. And the result of that is you have women dying in emergency rooms because they've been denied life saving care when they are having miscarriages, you have women who've been rendered sterile, because they cannot access the basic healthcare that abortion provides.

And the final straw for them, Duncan endorsing Kamala Harris for president last week. In an open letter, Josh McKoon, the chairman of Georgia's Republican Party, wrote, among other things, you are not and never will be considered a Republican ever again.
