      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy is on his way to Washington D.C. We'll have details on the dramatic visit at his upcoming White House meeting with President Biden. Then, condemnation pulls in from around the world as the Taliban ban all Afghan women from going to university.Plus, a surge in demand for cremation services and huge queues outside hospitals. We'll have a report from Beijing on what the COVID situation is really like in China. In the coming hours, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to arrive in Washington, D.C. on a visit that carries huge significance. It is his first trip outside his country since Russia invaded 300 days ago. Plans for the trip had been shrouded in secrecy until the very last minute. Here you can spot Mr. Zelenskyy arriving by train in Poland. From there, we're told he's boarded a plane headed for the United States. Mr. Zelenskyy will meet with U.S. President Joe Biden in the Oval Office. Then the two leaders will hold a news conference. Later, Mr. Zelenskyy will travel to Capitol Hill to address the U.S. Congress. President Biden is set to announce nearly $2 billion more in security assistance, including the sophisticated Patriot missile defense system that Ukraine's President has long requested. We've got complete coverage. CNN U.S. Security Correspondent Kylie Atwood is in Washington, and Clare Sebastian joins us from London. First of, all to you, Kylie, just describe the security concerns around this visit, the risk that Zelenskyy is taking, and what he's doing it all for?",

      "sentences": "Well, as you said, this was a visit that was shrouded in secrecy for quite a while, as U.S. officials and Ukrainian officials were planning it. According to a senior administration official, President Biden offered for Zelenskyy to visit the U.S. back earlier this month, December 11. And then about a week ago, there was a formal invite.And that formal invite is what launched there to be back and forth between U.S. and Ukrainian officials over the security dynamics here. What procedures, what measures had to be put in place to make sure that Zelenskyy could make this visit, because, as you said, this is his first time out of the country in 300 days since that Ukraine war began back in February. Now, we don't know exactly all of the details that really went into planning this. We'll likely learn some of those after the visit has concluded because there is still an effort to try and keep close coordination around it to make sure that this trip doesn't have any issues. We did see this morning Polish TV put out some images of President Zelenskyy coming into Poland over the Ukrainian border. He took a train, so we know that he took that train route that many world leaders have taken in and out of Ukraine over the last 10 months. U.S. officials aren't saying if Zelenskyy is going to fly to the U.S. on a U.S. military aircraft. That's, of course, something we'll be watching for. But when he gets to Washington, the message from President Biden, according to senior administration officials, is going to be a reiteration of what we have heard. The U.S. will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. And it comes, of course, as there has been this tremendous amount of U.S. support for Ukraine. About $20 billion in security assistance. President Biden expected to announce $1. 8 billion in additional security assistance today with those Patriot missile air defense systems that are highly advanced. And then, of course, we're coming on next year. And Congress is in the final stages right now of reviewing a spending bill for next year that includes about $45 billion in additional assistance to Ukraine. So you do really have the wind at the back. So those who say the U.S. needs to keep supporting Ukraine, and this will be a highly symbolic visit for President Zelenskyy to Washington.",

As I said, unclear what this means for the battlefield. Russia is clearly trying to take the approach that it is not afraid of the weapons that Washington and NATO are providing, but it does present a threat considering that Patriots are anti-aircraft, anti-missile defense systems, and that is Russia's playbook at the moment to bombard Ukraine's civilian infrastructure.",

Secretary General is speaking out after the Taliban banned women from attending university in Afghanistan. Antonio Guterres says he's deeply alarmed by the decision, saying it violates equal rights and will have a devastating impact on the country's future. The U.S. special envoy for Afghan women said the Taliban are reverting to extreme policies of the 90s. Nada Bashir is following these developments for us. She joins us live. These criticisms aren't really going to affect the decision, are they? And arguably, the more isolated Afghanistan becomes the stricter it could get.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Max. That is the concern now that as Afghanistan, as the Taliban becomes more isolated from the international community, we could see those fundamental rights and freedoms for women and girls being rolled back even further. And, of course, we've seen those rights and freedoms being rolled back over the last few months since the Taliban's takeover.We saw school girls being prevented from returning to secondary school in March, just as those schools were set to reopen to them after months of closure. And we've seen restrictions being put in place in universities, classrooms being segregated, separate entrances for women and men, young women being told they aren't allowed to be taught by young male professors. So we've seen a pretty stringent approach from the Taliban when it comes to enforcing those severe restrictions on education for women. And of course, on a much broader scale, we've seen women's rights being rolled back, of course, having to cover your face, having to work in certain sectors, of course. So there is a serious concern there. We've seen that widespread international condemnation. We've heard from the U.N. Human Rights Watch, of course, condemning this decision. And we've also heard from the U.S. condemning the decision by the Taliban to prevent girls from going to university. We heard this statement from the State Department spokesperson Ned Price just yesterday. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NED PRICE, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: The Taliban have permanently sentenced Afghan women to a darker and more barren future without opportunity. No country can thrive when half of its population is arbitrarily held back. Education is an internationally recognized human right, and it is essential to Afghanistan's economic growth and its stability. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "And look, Max, we've heard that condemnation, but it's unlikely that the Taliban will take heed of that. They have in the past, since that takeover, attempted to present the Taliban as a perhaps more moderate, more modernized entity than we would have seen in the late 1990s.But as we've seen time and time again since the takeover in Afghanistan, we've seen those fundamental rights being rolled back, not just for women and girls, but for the Afghan population in general. The real concern now, of course, is as the Taliban becomes more isolated, we could see those rights being rolled back further. And there's no telling, of course, how far the Taliban will go. But we've also seen video now emerging on social media, seeing those women and girls arriving at their universities, much as we saw in March when we saw schoolgirls upset, anguished by the fact that they weren't able to return to their schools. So, clearly, this is a moment of shock and real distress for the women of Afghanistan. Max?",

      "sentences": "Hey there, Max. A big change just in the past few hours. And you can see behind me lined up several migrants, that's actually on the U.S. side and they're at one of the border entrance gates. And that's different from where we saw them just in the past few hours before that because they were about a mile down towards where barricades were set up by the Texas National Guard as well as Texas State Police.And so it seems that there is some different opinion from the different law enforcement agencies on the U.S. side that you've got the Federal Border Patrol that are now moving the folks to this gate to try to potentially process them to get in. Now this doesn't guarantee that they're going to be able to stay in the U.S. but it does allow them to be processed for what many of them are seeking, and that is asylum. And you can see just in the freezing cold temperatures how folks have been camping out overnight. They've got about a dozen camp fires set along the U.S. side trying to keep warm, as little by little they have been letting certain groups in to start the processing. But it was chaotic if you go back just 24 hours ago when the Texas National Guard along with the state police put up those barbed wire fences, the razor wire, to try to keep away migrants. And it seems the CBP has come up with another solution and that is to try to continue the processing on this side. Now if you look on the Mexican side here where we are, these are folks who are likewise trying to keep warm, considering when they may decide to ultimately try to cross. But there's been so much confusion and uncertainty. A lot of these folks got to this point thinking, OK, the 21st today is when Title 42 will end. Of course, we know that changed with the Chief Justice's decision just about 48 hours ago to put it on hold, keep Title 42 in place. Now it's still, little by little trickling down to the folks who have made very long journeys to get to this point. And it seems that there is a determination along with an increasing desperation, Max, from a lot of these migrants to figure out anyway possible to get into the U.S. And if you talk with some of them, then you hear about the journeys that they went through, going through jungles, going through gang infested countries and territories to get to this point, it doesn't seem they're going to be dissuaded by one entrance being blocked by barbed wire. They're find another way it seems. At this point, Max, the Border Patrol is helping facilitate that bay (ph).",

President Biden is set to announce almost $2 billion in additional military aid for Ukraine. And it's the Patriot missile system which everyone is talking about. If you haven't seen them before, here they are.You can see why Zelenskyy wants them. You can also see why the Kremlin doesn't want him to have them. This is what we know about them. A few details for you. They are all altitude, all weather. They're an air defense system, crucially. Their range is 43 miles, and you can have up to 16 missiles per launcher. And they're already used in 17 countries. A lot of training is required for them, which is why training is part of this package as well. Let's bring in Oren Liebermann, CNN's Pentagon Correspondent. Thanks for joining us. How will they change the battle? Why is the Kremlin so concerned about this deal?",

      "sentences": "Max, patriot missiles are some of the most advanced U.S. air defense missiles. Crucially, they are also long range. They almost fit like an extended range dome on top of the air defense systems that Ukraine already has. For example, the U.S. provided NASAMS, have been a very effective system for Ukraine in that medium range sort of envelope.But they can't cover as much territory as a Patriot, and that's why Patriots are so crucial. There are also short-range options for air defense, like Stingers and other systems provided by some other countries, but it's the Patriot that offers the widest coverage. And that's why Ukraine has been looking for this system for so long, believing that it will enhance Ukraine's air defense capabilities. We've seen Ukraine do quite well against Russia's barrages of missile rocket drone attacks against Ukraine's civilian energy, water and other infrastructure, but it hasn't been enough. Russia has the quantity to get missiles through, and that's where the Patriot will help. It doesn't change the game all on its own, but it adds to Ukraine's ability to defend its own territory. As you point out, it takes quite a bit of training and dozens of soldiers to operate one of these, as well as maintain and sustain these. So that's part of the package. We'll see very soon how fast it is that Ukraine is able to learn this system. The Kremlin said there would be unpredictable consequences if the U.S. provides these. The U.S. has basically said, look, it's an air defense system. It can't be used offensively. So it's not like we're adding a new capability, just a better version of the capability they already have.

They don't have an inertial guidance system, which would be another guidance system, for instance. They have a radar system, that radar detects something coming in from the air. And then the Patriot is launched specifically at that air missile.As provided, it doesn't have the capability to carry out a long-range strike. It is simply a long-range aerial defense. The radar can see aerial targets coming from farther away and the missile can target those aerial targets. But it doesn't have, for example, the capability of what's known as an ATACMS. That would be a long-range offensive strike capability that could be used with HIMARS. The U.S. has refused to provide those over concerns about escalation and the ability it would give Ukraine to strike deep into Russia. Patriot missiles don't give Ukraine that capability. And that's one of the reasons that the administration has made the decision to go ahead and approve these.",

That in and of itself certainly carries a risk of escalation. One of the other key reasons that these weren't handed over earlier is because of the training required to use these and the number of soldiers required to use these from the maintenance and sustainment end.This isn't a small system that can be learned quickly. The U.S. training on these is something like 20 weeks, if not longer. And at first, the U.S. simply didn't know if the war would go that long. Was it worth sending a very advanced U.S. system into Ukraine that would take so long to learn if you're not sure how long this war is going to last? The U.S. clearly now sees how long this is going on. The time is there, the space is there, and the need is there for patriots.",
