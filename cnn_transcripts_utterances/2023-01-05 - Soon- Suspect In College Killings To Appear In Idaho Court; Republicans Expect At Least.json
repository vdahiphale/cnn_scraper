      "sentences": "Well, Kate, here's what we know. Bryan Kohberger is inside the Les Latah County Jail behind me. One hour from now he will have his initial appearance in court. The courthouse is the same building as the jail.In that initial appearance, he will not make a plea. It will be read his rights. Some bookkeeping will take place. Ultimately, there will be an arraignment where he will make a plea. This is what's very important. We have been told that when the suspect got to Idaho, the probable cause affidavit would be unsealed and released. It hasn't been released yet. We expect that could happen at any time. It's important because we don't know very much about why police arrested this man in connection with the murders of four students at the University of Idaho. This affidavit will have a lot of information. Now, the suspect traveled 13 hours to get there. He was accompanied on a private plane by Pennsylvania State Police. They made two refueling stops. They landed just across the state border in Pullman, Washington. At that point, he got out of the plane, the suspect. They gave him a vest and a helmet for his security. Put him in a Ford f150 surrounded by sheriff's deputy cars from this county here in Idaho. They raced through the streets, got here 15 minutes. And right now, he's inside the jail where he was brought early yesterday evening. This is a death penalty state. Prosecutors will have to make a decision whether they will want to seek it, Kate.",

She's a criminologist and attorney. It's good to see you again, Casey. So, he's going to be in court today. He did not quite an extradition, that whole process of getting him back to Idaho. Is that something -- just the mere fact that he wasn't fighting that extradition process and kind of how this has gone so far in being taken into custody, does that stand out to you? CASEY JORDAN, CRIMINOLOGIST, BEHAVIORAL ANALYST &amp; ATTORNEY: No, not at all because that is exactly the way that an innocent person would behave. And again, presumed innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. But this is not your ordinary killer. This is somebody who is highly intelligent, very organized, and absolutely knows the workings of our criminal justice system inside and out. He is going to be second- guessing. If we just go with the idea that we have our culprit, he is going to be streets ahead trying to figure out what are people thinking if I behave this way, if I behave another way? I need to behave the way that an innocent person would behave and that person would never find extradition. Of course, I have to get back to Idaho and find out what is this evidence that you use to give an arrest warrant for me. So, I mean, this, in an hour, he will be in court in Idaho, 12:30 Eastern Standard Time. And after that appearance, that affidavit should be released and we're going to know so much more than we know right now.",

This would be you know, a consciousness of guilt perhaps.But I think what we're all waiting for is to find out if there was indeed a connection between him and the victims. I predict it's a very tangential connection if at all, that perhaps he knew who they were, had met one of the girls in the club perhaps, had felt rejected or rebuffed something like that, that they gleaned from their many, many interviews, more than 10,000 tips. They -- everyone wants to know motive. And even though motive is certainly not required to get a conviction on anyone, human nature is that we want to know the why behind the crime.",

This is really the psychology of a serial killer. And we know that Pennsylvania is currently looking to see if they have any unsolved crimes there from the time when Mr. Kohberger lived in Pennsylvania when he was a student there, that had gone unsolved, which they might investigate to see if it's linked to him.But the savage killing at night with a Rambo-style knife in a -- in a state that we're getting guns is super easy, it really indicated that was a level of sexual overtone to it. The picquerism, that the constant stabbing frenetic motion really simulates a sexual -- a sexual action. And the bottom line is that whoever did this didn't need to kill four people. Even if it was targeted, why kill the other three? And the answer is because whoever did this, liked it, enjoyed it, and it fulfilled some personal need he has inside of himself for power and control.",

      "sentences": "Yes, we're hearing bits and pieces so far, Kate. Just a bit of context here. So, this proposal originally came from the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, a man who has been openly supportive of Russia's war effort, in fact, said in a recent sermon, that military service washes away all sin. So, his proposal was for a ceasefire beginning tomorrow, which is new -- or sorry, a Christmas Eve in the Orthodox phase through all of Christmas Day, which is on Saturday. The Kremlin took him up on his offer. A statement from President Putin ordered troops to a ceasefire at that time for this 36-hour period.But we haven't gotten a response from President Zelenskyy yet, but we have gotten one from his office. An adviser to President Zelenskyy called this a cynical trap and said that the Russian Federation must leave the occupied territories before there's any kind of a truce. And he said, keep hypocrisy to yourself. We are also getting reaction from some ordinary Ukrainians, a man in Kherson, for instance, living along the front line, living in the line of fire said he doesn't expect any of this to change the reality on the ground. Perhaps at the highest levels, the Russians may not launch missiles, may not have drone strikes, things like that, but he doesn't suggest that this will change the behavior of the soldiers who are along the front line, the line of contact as they say. Another soldier said, \"I don't believe this BS.\" And the timing here is interesting here, Kate because President Erdogan, the president of Turkey, has been trying to use his warm relations with both Moscow and Kyiv to broker a more longer lasting ceasefire in order to facilitate peace talks. Though, that seems extremely unlikely at this point, given that the Kremlin has made clear that they're not interested in talking unless Ukraine accepts that the territory reality has changed on the ground, something that the Ukrainians obviously are not willing to accept at all, Kate.",

This is incredibly damning.Now, we know where the DNA came from, and we know that this person left a knife sheath. I'm only partway through the affidavit but the next thing that was absolutely horrifying, sounds like a slasher film is that apparently one of the roommates who survived downstairs was awake. Xana had gotten a DoorDash delivery at 4:00 a.m., and one of the roommates heard the dog barking, the dog that belong to Kaylee Goncalves, and opened her door, lift up the stairs, thought she heard crying from Xana Kernodle through and then this is the most frightening part of all, male voicing, don't worry, I'm here to help you -- I'm going to help you.

I mean, this is the stuff of nightmares. This is the stuff of slasher films. We certainly cannot blame the surviving roommates for being horrified.Now, that we have an idea that they didn't actually sleep through the whole thing, they were absolutely traumatized by what they heard and witnessed that day. I mean the affidavit also talks about whimpering being picked up on a local security camera. Everyone has always asked why wasn't someone awakened by the dog barking. Well, it turns out someone was awakened by the dog barking. The dog by the way apparently was found in a separate room by police the next day when they arrived, very likely that the killer locked the dog in one of the unoccupied rooms, which would explain again why the dog was there the next day but unharmed. The fact that the figure was seen, the description, height, the dark clothing the face mask, the bushy eyebrows, this is going to be very key because we thought we had no eyewitnesses to this crime, and yet one of those roommates apparently saw the figure. And it will be really interesting to find out if this goes to court, is Bryan Kohberger ready to go to trial and face down the roommate who saw him and still insist that he's innocent, or does this change everything when he reads these details, Kate, is he going to be thinking wow, I'm in a state that has the death penalty, but does not have the insanity defense, maybe I should be talking to the prosecutors about a plea deal? And part of that plea deal if that -- if things go the way I'm predicting, would include articulating exactly what happened that night. I can almost guarantee it. So, I mean, we still need to continue reading the affidavit. You're further ahead than I am at this point, Kate. BOLDUAN: I'm also looking in here and I just skipped ahead to skim through, Casey, it looks like these officers and part of the team -- oh I'm also being told right now we have other breaking news we need to get to.
