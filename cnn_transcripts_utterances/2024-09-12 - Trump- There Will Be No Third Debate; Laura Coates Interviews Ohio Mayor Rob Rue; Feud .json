The city's mayor is live with me tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"And so, here's my question: Why doesn't Donald Trump want to debate Kamala Harris again? And does anyone know the real reason he doesn't want to do so? Is it because he thinks he lost or because he really thinks he actually won? And we watched him profess to be a winner at all times in the most consequential moments, even falsely claiming and doubling down at every turn, by the way, that he won the 2020 election. He has been relentless, fighting to prove it at every turn, even when the data is in front of him. But now, Donald Trump is doing something that's against his nature. The man who loves huge T.V. ratings, the man who says he does not back down from a fight, apparently, does not now want to fight for a rematch or a fight in general with Harris. He's now going to skip a chance to appear before an audience of tens of millions of Americans, AKA voters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You are trying to get people who only vote, maybe, in presidential elections or sitting out the rest of the year, who maybe were just depressed and anxious otherwise, who are now feeling a sense of optimism that something can change.To get to those people and that enthusiasm gap that exists, Kamala Harris painted a very different picture of America, and she actually confronted Trump directly in a way that, frankly, many people have wanted to see.

Throw in Raleigh, Asheville, Wilmington, too, sure.But if she starts going to places like Greenville and Hickory, and what about the 10 HBCUs that aren't just in the big cities but in places like Elizabeth City or Salisbury, North Carolina, that's telling me that she's seeing things a little differently and campaigning different. There's a real opportunity there. And the one other thing I would say is I talked to a Republican consultant today. Lot of unhappiness with registered unaffiliated voters with Trump that all comes down to temperament. Trump has to fix that. And the debate could have been an opportunity for him.

He's also, when we talk about the mental acuity challenges, again, it was two old men, it was a very stark contrast, adjust, frankly, by age and energy.

If you're the candidate that has enthusiasm and energy on your side, there's a value in that, rather than the, you know, one stop a day or the multiple hours of open executive time. What she's relying on, though, let's be clear, is a type of voter that has traditionally felt disenchanted. And Trump was very good about building that into his base from a certain sector.

And in this case, it's igniting a mini civil war in the MAGA movement.It all started when near -- when far-right internet personality, Laura Loomer, played into racist tropes about Indians on X, posting that the White House would smell like -- I got to say this -- curry and speeches would go through a call center if Kamala Harris wins. Greene called the post racist because it was, and said Loomer should take it down. Loomer doubled down and called Greene a sellout. Brooklyn pride themselves as fierce defendants of Donald Trump and want to be in his inner circle. Loomer even accompanied Trump to the debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday, and she sat with him at 9/11 events. So, you're probably asking, who is she? Well, she's a failed congressional candidate, once banned from social media platforms because of her anti-Muslim rhetoric, and she promoted a false conspiracy theory that 9/11 was an inside job. So, it was confusing, to say the least, to see her with Trump yesterday. Some Republicans, they worry she is influencing Trump with her conspiracies. Senator Lindsey Graham urging Trump to distance himself from Loomer, saying -- quote -- \"I think the president would serve himself well to make sure this doesn't become a bigger story.\" Too late.
