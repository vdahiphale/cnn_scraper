      "sentences": "Wolf, the supporters are gathering here in the yard of Howard University, of course the alma mater of Vice President Kamala Harris. I can say it is a much smaller crowd as of now. People are still coming in and certainly a more subdued crowd than yesterday when thousands gathered here in jubilation and they arrived in really defeat.But it wasn't until overnight when it was declared that Donald Trump, of course, was the president-elect that this truly set in. But we do know that Vice President Harris has spoken to Donald Trump. They had a brief conversation. I'm told it was a cordial conversation. He thanked her for calling to concede. President Biden and former President Trump also have called. So Wolf, all the formalities are now out of the way. We are anticipating the speech from Vice President Harris here. I am told that she is going to thank her supporters. She is going to urge her supporters across the country to accept the results of this election and find common ground even as they hold on to their own ideals. One of her closing messages in the final days of the campaign was seeking to find common ground. I'm told that will be one of her messages, but also it will be one to stand their ground on certain issues. So Wolf, this is not how any of her supporters certainly had realized this, but when you step back, we're just 108 days since she ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket here. So this was something that she had never anticipated. And now, of course, she just has a short time, a matter of weeks in the office of the vice president. But for now, at least, supporters eager to hear her. Wolf, I'm interested in seeing how much she leans into history. During this campaign, she rarely talked about how she could be a barrier- breaking candidate. Of course, unlike Hillary Clinton eight years ago, talked about that considerably. But now we know that history will not be made in this selection. That certainly is front and center on many people's minds today, Wolf. BLITZER: And looking at the crowd over there where you are, Jeff, at Howard University, it's a HBCU, a historically black college and university, and she had gone to school there. It's her alma mater. Is the crowd that has gathered there mostly students or folks from D.C., and Virginia and Maryland? Have they just all come in to watch this important speech?",

But it is also many supporters from Washington, from the area, and others who have come to Washington in anticipation of what they thought could be a victory last evening. So last night, certainly a broad tapestry of supporters. We saw mothers and daughters, fathers and sons. So certainly, you know, a smaller crowd.But when you talk to people, Wolf, it is a - you know, there certainly is disappointment. But there also is pride in Vice President Harris' own candidacy. Of course, she, you know, used to walk the grounds here. She wrote in her memoir how important this very place was to her rise. So I expect that she will talk about that homecoming here and she will push to the future. Of course, that future will not include her, at least for now, as the president. Wolf?",

So I suspect she will talk about the lessons that she has learned in this moment. And then she will be speaking at her alma mater.She said the first time she ran for office was when she was running for freshman rep at Howard. And she's going to be speaking to students. And she always talks about how much she loves Gen Zers. And she's going to be talking about not giving up, not - because you didn't win. It's not time to just throw in the towel. And I think it's really important for those students to hear that because - I remember my first election was 2000 hanging chads (ph) and it didn't go the way I wanted it to. But you know what that made me do? Get into politics, get into journalism, get into that. And so moments like this can really inspire a generation to be the leaders of the future. And I think she will take that time to talk to the folks that are present in the room and then talk to the country and try and bring us together.",

You're not nervous about anything. And so you get - in a lot of - every - most people who run for office do so out of a commitment to do public service. It's a sacrifice for most of them.

Vice President Harris formally conceding the election in a phone call with President-elect Trump. And in just a few moments, she will be speaking live. You'll see her the first time she has spoken since the loss.She will be speaking to the American people. This is the crowd already assembled at where she'll speak, which is her election headquarters at her alma mater, Howard University. A massive crowd there. It will be a difficult moment for them, for her, an emotional moment, but an important one. Joining me now is Republican Congressman Dan Meuser. He won his re-election bid in Pennsylvania's 9th District, also was one of those in charge for leading up the state for Trump's re-election effort. So let me just ask you, Congressman, does anything - you know, Trump won the state and you worked hard to make that happen. When you look at the details, whether it's the exit polls or anything under the hood, did anything surprise you? Does anything specifically stand out to you? REP. DAN MEUSER (R-PA): Well, you know, we went at this in a very strategic manner, if you will. You know, campaigns are - tend to be a lot of advertising, a lot of fundraising, a lot of handshaking, certainly grassroots. But we took an approach of embracing the early voting, getting the registration done in a heavy way. I mean, we improved here, Erin, by over 500,000. I mean, we really built a foundation to win. We made it very, very difficult for anybody to beat us with the type of manpower and contacts and everything else that we engaged in. So no, there really weren't too many surprises. Certainly it met my highest level of expectations, the win, the percentage that Trump had, as well as our other races, David McCormick. We won two House seats.
