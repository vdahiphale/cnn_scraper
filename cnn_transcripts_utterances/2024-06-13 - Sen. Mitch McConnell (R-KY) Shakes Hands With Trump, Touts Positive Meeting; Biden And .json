But there aren't too many Republican leaders. who have surgically laid out a roadblock, if you will, for Republicans to follow to gain and access power. And if you're thinking about that in the electoral context, and you recognize that former President Trump may be the vehicle to continue moving forward with that agenda, whether you like him or not, you're going to do what is politically expedient.I think this was a smart move for the former president to showcase that the party is coalescing around him, particularly on the heels of many questions about Nikki Haley voters.

Many of the candidates that he's endorsed have lost. And so I think there are a number of people in the Republican Party very concerned about the kinds of candidates that he will back and whether or not they'll be viable. And the last thing I'll just say about Mitch McConnell, what a coward, what an absolute coward. I mean, he had the courage to stand up for the United States of America, the rule of law and our democracy, immediately following what happened on Capitol Hill, and yet here we are just a short time later and he's kowtowing to Donald Trump.",

I mean, this could have really challenged their regulatory abilities, the pharmaceutical industry also watching very closely, as well as anyone running for office in 2024. Now, because they sidestepped this issue, they did not actually decide it. It's possible, even likely that it will reappear on the docket in the coming years. And in the interim, here's what Justice Kavanaugh suggested for people who have concerns about Mifepristone. He said, quote, citizens and doctors who object to what the law allows others to do may always take their concerns to the executive or legislative branches and seek greater regulatory or legislative restrictions on certain activities. So, he's basically saying if you have an issue with Mifepristone and you don't have standing to bring a case, call your congressman. Now, right now, all eyes will be on another abortion case before the justices and that case comes out of Idaho and raises questions about what you do in a state that has restrictive abortion laws and they come up against more permissive federal laws.

Every single word he says can get him -- can gum up the case further and jeopardize the chances of convicting the defendants that he was trying to investigate and go after.So, that timeline question is proof positive of sort of the pitfalls here for, for prosecutor's staff talking. He could end up contradicting himself, making a statement that could undermine public faith in their work, but more to the point, could just taint the jury pool. So, there's all kinds of reasons this is why it's so rare. You very rarely see prosecutors, you know, or senior staff speaking publicly in the media.",

And an appellate court does not like to disturb those factual findings. They can review to see if Judge McAfee was wrong on the law but not really on the facts.So, I think they have -- the D.A.'s office has a very good chance of prevailing here in the sense that she will not be disqualified and I don't think Nathan Wade's recent appearance nor Fani Willis' public comments at the church will have any impact on the court's ruling.",

This last week, despite all our best efforts, only 95 trucks on average got into Gaza each day. That's in part because of the fighting, IDF military operations, Hamas fighting, Hamas hiding, of course, among the civilian population. But it's also -- it's so difficult for aid workers to move around inside Gaza. With a ceasefire, you would have multiple crossing points, open a full flow of assistance going in, and that mobility on the ground that would allow the displaced population because almost the entire population has been displaced since October 7, to be able to get access to food, to shelter. So many of them are living out in the open air rather than in tents, and, of course, to vital medicine as well.So we need this so desperately to be able to support our humanitarian partner, who in turn are supporting the people of Gaza.",

It's incredibly important for that crossing point to be open, its incredibly important that the Erez crossing be used.But we have Kerem shalom open and we have the capacity to move trucks by land in two Gaza. But what's also important is that those convoys be able to move that they not be looted. And by in some cases desperate civilians, but also there are gangs at large there. And the conflict itself gets in the way of humanitarian partners being able to do their work. With regard to the pier, look, the pier, of course, has had challenges whether is a major factor. I mean, this is why land is our first preference. It's much more reliable. But if we get the pier up and running and get proper throughput going through the maritime pier, that's going to be enough food to feed 500,000 people for a month. So this is still an additive part of the solution, but the foundational means of getting food to people in Gaza has got to be by these land crossings.",
