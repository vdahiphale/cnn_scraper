Influential Iowa Conservative Bob Vander Plaats, host of the Family Leadership Summit, says he learned last night that Trump will not attend the major Republican cattle call event this Friday.My panel is back with me. David Chalian, I was told my reporting is that there was pressure from some of Trump's allies to try to get him to say yes. Bob Vander Plaats was on the show last week. He was leaning into the fact that he thought Trump would come. Not happening.",

And that this group is a largely evangelical group that's gathering in Iowa.And so, there's no doubt that Trump and his team have heard from some quarters of that support, saying, hey, you got to make sure you maintain this relationship and keep growing it and keep it in check with what you need. But here's the reality. Bob Vander Plaats, who runs the Family Leader program there in this summit, he has said very publicly he doesn't think Donald Trump should run in 2024. He has said that after the aftermath of January 6th, that Donald Trump is not likely going to win and would probably be the worst proposition for Republicans to put forth in 2024. So if you're Donald Trump, who is particularly attuned to personal grievances, and that is what this guy is saying, you know, I kind of understand. I wouldn't expect something different from Donald Trump that he wouldn't show up to this event.",

Now she wants to remain neutral. I didn't invite her to events\". By the way, a source tells CNN that Reynolds does have a standing invitation to his events.So I guess maybe it is consistent because you're saying he feels slighted by her because she is staying neutral.
