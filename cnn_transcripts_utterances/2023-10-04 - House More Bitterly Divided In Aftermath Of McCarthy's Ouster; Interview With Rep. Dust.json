Let's think about earning that motion to recommit, this motion to vacate. Let's think about this. Do you really think a single Republican, if the script was flipped, would have voted to not vacate Nancy Pelosi from the speakership? Of course, they all would have voted to vacate. You think Kevin McCarthy -- this is the point -- he, as you mentioned in the opening, he opened an impeachment inquiry without the promised vote. He went to Mar-a-Lago and resurrected Donald Trump. I mean, literally, he took like the, I guess not literally, figuratively, he took the paddles out of the ambulance and brought him back to political life.

The question is, what does this do to Ukraine aid? Because what I really worry about is, whoever is running for speaker is going to promise no Ukraine aid. Now keep in mind, those that move to vacate Kevin McCarthy with the exception of like Nancy Mace, I have no idea where she came from on this, but they have all been talking about things like regular order, and to the viewers, regular order means if you're a member of Congress, you should be able to bring up, you know, a resolution or you should be able to bring up an amendment, and it should get voted on, kind of the regular way of the order of business. But these are the same people who are now saying they don't want to come to the floor, an up or down vote on Ukraine, because that would pass overwhelmingly.

Because the support has been so strong and it has been so important also for Ukraine's war effort.I think one of the things that our viewers would be surprised by, if you go around the battlefield here in eastern Ukraine, is how much U.S. kit is already on the ground here, U.S. vehicles, but then of course also U.S. guns and U.S. ammo as well. And the thing about the ammo is the Ukrainians really say that with the counteroffensive, they need a lot of it. And certainly, NATO countries could replace some of the ammo that the U.S. has been giving, but there is also certain kinds of ammo that only America can get, like for instance HIMARS, guided missiles are very important. And then also for some of those surface-to-air missile systems, that's stuff that only the U.S. can replenish. So, the Ukrainians certainly acknowledge if U.S. support went away, it would be catastrophic for them on the battlefield. They say they could maybe continue to defend themselves, but they personally would have very big problems making sort of gains on the battlefield in the future then, Anderson.",
