So on this particular one, we did door to door because it was just a little bit different scenario with much less people. So Florida Highway Patrol and local Sheriff's Office agencies again down at Levy County had about 100 people that stayed at homes. And then, anecdotal -- or, I shouldn't say anecdotally but up in the Taylor County, it was more in the 50-ish range that was confirmed. But I'm sure other people did stay as well. But, it's a little bit different way to do it (ph).",

And so, I would say Leon, this was -- from where we were when it was going there, this is the shift Leon wanted for sure. I mean, you go out there, I mean I have been out. There's been rain and wind, there's some debris, but nothing I think like if that wall would have impacted Tallahassee, I think you would have seen significantly more damage.

I don't think we identified that. There are, of course, in the Tampa Bay Area, some of those bridges were closed. Some because of water, some because of wind, but structurally, I haven't gotten any reports that they are problematic. And then, as you get in closer to kind of the ground zero, those bridges are not passable, but that's primarily because the water is overflowing. Is that accurate to say? PERDUE (on camera): Yes, that's accurate, governor. I'd say we're still in the process of doing damage assessments. We haven't seen anything anywhere close to what we saw (inaudible) Sanibel Island. For the locations where there's still high water, we have to wait till the water recedes to really find out what's going on there. But, we have not seen any major damage yet.",

GUTHRIE (on camera): So the short answer is, we're starting to see some reaction. All of this rain is going to have to drain into those basins. So usually what happens in these incidents is, we don't see the actual river action for 24 hours, 48 hours, sometimes as much as 72 hours after the fact. The St. Johns River is a very slow-responding river. If you remember back during Hurricane Ian, that almost took 45 days to correct itself on that particular body of water. So again, it's going to take a little bit of time for them to completely react, and then obviously, go back down. DESANTIS (on camera): Yeah, I will say I mean, the one thing of this, the storm moved a little bit faster than some of the other ones have moved. Some of these things will just dump water and they go so slow. This one moved a little faster, which is at least when you're talking about the flooding, it's a little bit better than when they are slow.",

They're all doing very, very well. Most of them are going to be reopening today if they haven't already done that. And of course, they have a footprint further up into the nature coast. Do you want to talk about the others? GUTHRIE (on camera): Yeah. So, we did have a couple of (inaudible) facilities and nursing homes that did have to do some evacuations, but they did that as a part of the evacuations that we called for two days ago. To date, as of this minute, there have been no reports of any issues inside the health and medical industry, whether that's assisted living facilities, skilled nursing facilities, nursing homes, or hospitals. So, everybody is reporting what we would call green and they're good to go, and everything is all right.",

      "sentences": "Can you talk about the discrepancy between some numbers that are being reported on fatalities and citing FHP and you saying that there is no fatality?DESANTIS (on camera): So, right. So, there's a process for confirmed facilities. It just goes through law enforcement and medical examiners, and then they do that. And so, that has not been done yet where we've had a confirmation. Now, I know there's unconfirmed reports. Those may end up becoming confirmed. And then, of course, we deal with this in every storm, what is a fatality that is a direct result of the storm versus what would be something where you have a fatality that's unfortunate, but may not necessarily have a causal factor with the storm. For example, in Fort Myers beach, people -- there were fatalities because of that storm surge. No question. Well, if you're out the day after the storm and you're picking up debris from the yard and somebody has like a fatal heart episode, does that count as a storm- related death? So they always argue these things backwards and forwards. But when there are confirmed fatalities, those fatalities will be put out by the authorities. But there's just a process that goes through with that. Now, the unconfirmed, I think there have been unconfirmed reports of traffic fatalities and that may be storm related, it may be not. Obviously, it was happening within the time that the storm was either approaching or was on target in these various parts of the State of Florida. OK. We'll have more updates as the day goes on. We probably will end up visiting some of these areas as soon as it's safe to do so, and we'll be assessing on the ground and mobilizing any additional resources as is necessary. Thanks.",

Specifically, he talked about the idea that 250,000 people in the State of Florida still do not have power. He did say 100,000 lost it but then have had it restored. He also mentioned the -- if there is a silver lining here and that is that this hurricane is going faster than perhaps they had anticipated which the governor said could help with the dreaded storm surge and flooding.I want to go now to Leon County. That was one of the counties that the governor was talking about. It happens to be where the governor is. It is where Tallahassee is. Vincent Long is the Administrator there. Mr. Long, thank you so much for joining me. Do you agree with the assessment? I wouldn't say he's breathing a sigh of relief because it's really bad.

That constitutes a real threat to us even though it's a magnificent feature in our community. And so, as we get more soaked over this period of time with continuous rain, we continue to be concerned about that.Downed power lines, of course, and then our thoughts turn to recovery and people using things like generators and using them safely and we can't emphasize enough that without proper ventilation, those generators can be very dangerous and even deadly in just a matter of minutes really. And so, just always important to make that type of emphasis.

There's still a lot of danger on the streets, on the roads even though the brunt of the storm has passed. Take a look at this. We're on Big Oak Street in Tallahassee, look at the way this tree came down. Our Photojournalist Jonathan O'Beirne is going to follow me over here, as he kind of pans over and shows you this tree. This happened, according to the people who live here, at about 9Part of the problem here, part of the danger is that these trees are covered in Spanish moss and other things, and it just makes them much heavier when they come down. You have got these downed power lines, very, very dangerous to navigate around whether you're walking around or trying to drive on these streets. But, take a look at this, Dana. Look at this. This is an old pine tree and look at just how much of the roots were uprooted because the ground was saturated underneath this. It took the fence completely off the ground and then just violently slammed into the fence over there. The couple who lives here, Abila and Curvin Rene (ph), they told me they're OK. They have a child. They have three children. One of them lives with them here. They escaped injury, but they were praying when this happened because the storm was very violent for at least a few minutes when it came through here. And again, this is just an illustration here of why navigating some of these streets is dangerous. And it's dangerous for you to try to either get back in your house if you evacuated or just to navigate around your home. Because just -- again, just walking around, you could step on a power line. It's still very dangerous here and crews are just coming out to assess all of this, Dana.",
