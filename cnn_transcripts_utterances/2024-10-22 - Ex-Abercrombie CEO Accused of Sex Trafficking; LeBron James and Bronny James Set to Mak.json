It's also a county that Obama performed well in back when he was running in 2008. So this is a state, of course, as you just mentioned, and a crucial one for the Vice President and her team as they try to fortify the blue wall. But it is also a state that they are keenly aware they could only win by a few thousand votes. So it is counties like this. They want to repeat what President Biden did and build on it by expanding those margins.So the former President will be here with Walz. They'll be on the stage behind me where they were going to do what we have seen the Vice President do over the last several days, which is underscore the stakes of the election. Expect to hear more of that as we get closer and closer to Election Day. That is where they're putting their focus. And so the two will be doing exactly that. Now, Tim Walz is someone that the Vice President's team has been deploying to also appeal to men and appeal to voters in rural counties as he, too, criticizes former President Donald Trump on the campaign trail. So the two of them joining forces here today. Now, as you also mentioned there at the top, the former President will continue on to Michigan, another of those blue wall states, before then joining the Vice President in Georgia on Thursday. This will be the first time that the Vice President and former President Barack Obama will be campaigning together and yet another battleground say. So all of this as the campaign pulls together the -- their final messages, including on reproductive freedom, sources tell me that's going to feature prominently in the next several days. On Friday, the Vice President going to Texas to amplify that message because sources say, that is the epicenter of the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Now, in addition to all of this, as again you mentioned, there are the interviews. So this is a combination of the Vice President hitting the trail along with surrogates and star power, be it celebrities or former President Barack Obama, and also increasing exposure through interviews, traditional and nontraditional alike.",

I think I've said this to you once before, that Donald Trump reminds women of their first husband's divorce lawyer, that it really is a tremendous -- I see that joke did as well here as it does in my speeches. But it's legitimate that we have a gender gap that has never been this large in modern American politics. If you're underage 30 and you're a woman, you are absolutely voting for Harris. If you're male, you're voting for Trump. The gender gap narrows as you get older. Women tend to vote more than men. They make up 53% of the electorate. Trump has to do as well among men as she does among women. He's doing it right now. This race absolutely is dead even. And at some point, were going to start to talk about what happens the day after the election and the day after that and the day after that. You're probably going to ask me who wins? And I'm going to say to you, when is that decided? Is it Wednesday, Thursday, Friday? At this point, it is so close. And the way that states count their votes, I think it's going to go well into the weekend before we know who won. And that's dangerous for our democracy. That's dangerous for how polarized we are, how divided we are. And at some point, we're going to have to start talking about what we do the day after and the day after that in terms of voter integrity, in terms of protecting the legitimacy of the electoral process, and most importantly, for the loser to accept the loss and embrace the winner.",

And Harris would do much better if she talked with some detail about exactly what she will do, not what she wants, not her objectives, but how she's going to get there. Trump basically has reached the ceiling of his vote and it's enough for him to win. Let me be clear about that. Harris has a higher ceiling. I agree with her campaign in that assertion. But she's not going to get there until she gives voters what they need to know to have faith, trust, and confidence in her.It's a good strategy that she's doing.

It's going to be what they say and how they say it in the last 48 hours that will determine these final votes. The key for Haley is absolutely turnout, 18 to 29 women.

They're saying about a seven-year period, part of that time, Jeffries was the current CEO of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. And prosecutors say he was using his power, his wealth, to basically find men who wanted to be models and essentially have them try out in sexual ways to come to what is being described as sex events. And those sex events would happen in hotel rooms. They'd happen at houses that Jeffries owned all across the world, really. And at those events, they were sex fueled events where their prosecutors are saying these prospective models would be given drugs, they'd be given alcohol, Viagra, muscle relaxers to perform sex acts on Jeffries and his romantic partner. I want you to hear more from the prosecutors who laid out this 16 count in indictment earlier this afternoon.

It's important to note that Abercrombie &amp; Fitch certainly has changed its image since then. They have hired new management.

So that element of forced fraud and coercion is something that's going to be the prosecutor's burden to prove.Now, of course, when it comes to the defense, they're going to look at each one of these individuals, the specific allegations relating to them, and try and potentially make arguments that some people may have been engaging in these acts willfully. And so that's where you see the prosecutors in the indictment setting out that there were other substances involved, that there were other issues, that would make them unable to consent to these sexual acts. But the defense uses that in a different way to say, this might not be a sex trafficking ring. It might be a case of state sexual assault.

But the timing here, not only do you have this BBC expose where a whole group of people coming forward alleging that they had been a victim of this conduct and of this sex ring, there's also that class action civil lawsuit. So the standard of proof in a civil case is much different than what is in a criminal case. It's preponderance of the evidence versus beyond a reasonable doubt criminal standard much higher.That being said, a lot of what's in that civil complaint is reflected in the allegations in this criminal indictment. So there's most certainly overlap between the two. And from the perspective of both the prosecution and defense, you don't look at this case in the vacuum.
