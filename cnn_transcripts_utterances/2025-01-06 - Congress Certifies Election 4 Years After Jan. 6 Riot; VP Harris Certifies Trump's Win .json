We're going to show you how the haunting events that day were marked by lawmakers and the unprecedented security inside the halls of Congress.Plus, Trump's legal battles may be far from over. How his defense team now wants the sentencing for his hush money conviction to be set for Friday, they want that delayed. Will the court agree to set it aside with his inauguration just two weeks away? Plus, President Biden heading to New Orleans, the site of last week's terrorist attack. But with only days left in office, he's adding more to his to-do list in ways his successor may not like. Some important policy decisions coming from the White House. We're following these major developing stories and many more, all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Thanks so much for sharing your afternoon with us. I'm Boris Sanchez. My colleague, Brianna Keilar, has the day off. Despite a major snowstorm hitting the nation's capital overnight, members of Congress converged on Capitol Hill to carry out a routine task that shook our democracy to its core exactly four years ago. On this January 6th, though, no drama or disruption as lawmakers certified President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the Electoral College. A stark contrast to 2021, when a violent mob of Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, protesting his loss, delaying certification of Joe Biden's free and fair win, and putting democracy to the test. This time, Congress returning to a sense of normalcy on Capitol Hill, the ceremony signaling the peaceful transfer of power, largely unremarkable. Vice President Kamala Harris, who Trump defeated in November despite her warnings that he was a danger to American democracy, today presiding over today's historic certification. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One advisor described it to me as pure vindication. But it is clear now, this is soon to be Donald Trump's government. The confirmation hearings will be coming in the Senate. Certainly, the order of the day will be the burden is now on the Republicans in control of Congress and indeed the White House to carry on and try and carry out what they promised to the American people. But for today, at least, certainly watching this with, you know, a very normal proceeding on Capitol Hill, that's how this has normally been. Even former Vice President Mike Pence putting out a statement. He's saying, I welcome the return to order and civility.

Getting back to the certification of the 2024 presidential election. Manu, what stood out to you about today's ceremony? Well, I talked to a lot of Republicans and Democrats who are happy about a return to normalcy. Democrats are more willing to speak out about all the events that happened four years ago. I asked a lot of Republicans, too, about whether or not they agree with the way Donald Trump has characterized this event, downplaying the violence that occurred, calling it a day of love, as Donald Trump has said time and time again. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, I just asked him about that. He said that, I suppose he's getting what I've said about that day. And he said that I am moving forward. And that's really how a lot of Republicans, they don't want to talk about what happened four years ago. They want to talk about the Trump agenda, what they plan to do now, rather than what happened then. But there are still some Republicans who are making it very clear they disagree with how Trump has characterized the events from January 6, 2021. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But that's one area in which Republicans are uncertain about how the President-elect may act when he takes office.

Sadly, the people around the former president have chosen to lie.In terms of pardons, if the president and President-elect chooses to pardon anybody who was rightfully convicted, and that's what I'm saying, rightfully convicted of what has taken place here, the crimes that took place here, because they are crimes, our eyes are not deceiving us. I know that what it is, is actually an attempt to pardon himself. That's what it is. I really call upon our leaders. I was listening to Leader Thune over the weekend, and I was unfamiliar with his voice, and I want to get to know his voice. But I was stunned at how he had an inability on Sunday to answer the question how he felt if the President-elect were to issue blanket pardons. I call upon the leaders now, just as I did as an impeachment manager in front of the Senate, to stand upon the truth, to call out simple right and wrong, constitutional crimes, criminal acts by United States citizens who beat Capitol Police officers and would have killed any one of us.",

It did snow a lot, even across parts of Maryland, all the way to Easton at almost a foot, goes all the way down to the ocean, you know, the ferry there, nine and a half inches right there on the beach. So, this was a significantly cold storm.Now, a lot more snow fell out west where Kansas, you had over 20 inches. And then the ice - the ice, even in parts of Bluefield, some of this ice is just bringing still power lines down, branches down. And, of course, the electricity. We're still seeing some snow across parts of West Virginia, parts of Pennsylvania. But for D.C., really, it is just about gone. We're not going to see anything else. That Earth Camp shot that we showed you a little bit earlier, that really seeing the visibility pickup. We can see across the river, not that visibility that was down to a quarter mile at times, delaying or canceling all of those flights. Likely, less than two to three more inches of snow. But look at this stripe, Boris, all the way from Salina, Kansas. This is somewhere between 10 inches and a foot in this entire pink zone all the way to the East Coast. So, yes, it was a widespread long track storm, still warnings in effect, but they will likely be canceled or expire somewhere around midnight tonight. Still seeing some of that snow into West Virginia, passing on by D.C. for one last fluffy look, probably Philadelphia as well. But that'll be over by about midnight tonight, Boris.",

The White House says that includes the waters off the entire East Coast, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Pacific coast and portions of the northern Bering Sea in Alaska.

But now it might take an act of Congress.In 2019, Boris, a judge said the president has the power to sort of ratchet up protections, but it's only a one-way ratchet. It can't go the other way. That could end up in the High Court. Mike Lee, a Senate Republican, said they may be able to use reconciliation to open up especially the Gulf of Mexico right now. But again, this has zero effect on gas prices today. It takes 10 years to build an offshore oil platform, Boris. The global market determines prices as well.
