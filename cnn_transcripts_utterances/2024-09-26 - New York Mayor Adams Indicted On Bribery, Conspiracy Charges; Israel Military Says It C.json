DAMIAN WHITE, U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Mayor Adams engaged in a long-running conspiracy in which he solicited and knowingly accepted illegal campaign contributions from foreign donors and corporations. As we allege, Mayor Adams took these contributions even though he knew they were illegal. And even though he knew these contributions were attempts by a Turkish government official and Turkish businessman to buy influence with him.

Well, Hurricane Helene is intensifying over the U.S. Gulf Coast and is likely to cause catastrophic damage when it makes landfall in Florida in the coming hours. Torrential rain has already flooded parts of the state ahead of Helene's arrival. We're also expecting damaging winds, life-threatening storm surge, potential tornadoes and power outages that could last for weeks. Hurricane Helene is forecast to grow into a massive sprawling monster as it tracks north. Eighty-six million people across five states are on alert. CNN's Derek Van Dam is in Apalachicola, Florida. And, Derek, give us a sense of what Floridians are in for in the hours to come. It's expected to make landfall. I believe 8:00 P.M. tonight.",

This is near the Big Bend of Florida in Franklin County, where there are mandatory evacuationsfor all residents, although there are clearly still people who have decided to ride out this storm, as we've seen a couple of vehicles onlookers kind of pass through the city streets, check on their businesses, check on their homes. There's been steady rain since about 10:00 P.M. last night, kind of cooling up and then draining. And, of course, the residents here, this is not their first hurricane, right? So they know what to expect in terms of how vulnerable this area is to storm surge. So some of the local businesses here already boarding up or have boarded up. They've rushed the preparations to completion here ahead of the storm that will make landfall, as you said, this evening. There's some sandbags. You might think that that's a little bit futile because the expected storm surge values here within Apalachicola, the Big Bend Region, are well over twice the height of me. I'm nearly five-foot-ten. So we're talking maybe 10 to 15 feet of storm surge within this general area. But I want to talk about the immediate threats that we're facing across the southeastern U.S. as a whole, because before Helene even has made its landfall, it is overperformed in terms of the amount of rain that has fallen from the sky, not even associated with Helene. So this is new to the national -- to CNN from the Weather Prediction Center. And I want to highlight this area here from Tallahassee, Apalachicola, where I'm located, including Atlanta Metro all the way to Asheville, North Carolina. They had upgraded to a high risk of excessive rainfall that could lead to flash flooding. This is extremely rare. It only happens about four percent of the time, but when it does happen, 40 percent of fatalities occur within those locations and 80 percent of damages occur from those flooding areas. So this storm is just knocking up, kind of backing up against a cold front that is ringing out all this tropical moisture. I mean, you can see it basically on our radar here, stretching from Atlanta to Charlotte. This is causing a lot of traffic problems, the air problems at the airports. And then the eye, of course, still well off the center of the Gulf of Mexico here, so several hours before landfall. But the rainfall rates here, one to two inches per hour, will only pick up and that is why we have flash flood warnings for many locations here across the Florida Panhandle. Hurricane Helene officially 290 miles to my southeast here in Apalachicola, but it's now getting more of a defined look to it, indicating to meteorologists that the storm is strengthening. And it's not only strengthening but it's expanding. And this means that the impacts of the storm will be felt well outside of the center. I am deeply concerned about not only its landfall locations. So Tallahassee to the coastline, the Big Bend, the storm surge threat, the tornado threat and the flash flooding. But I want to highlight the inland threats as well because this is equally as important. It can catch people off guard who maybe are used to tropical systems moving in. This storm will have such an expansive wind field that hurricane force winds will be felt across the central parts of the state of Georgia, maybe even in the higher elevations of South Carolina. Atlanta Metro. You're anticipating tropical storm force winds. And there are so many trees between here and that part of the southeastern U.S., so it doesn't take much to topple these trees in an already saturated environment. And, Bianna, believe me, just looking at this map. This is incredible as a meteorologist to see the entire state of Georgia, South Carolina, Florida under some sort of tropical threat. Tropical alerts, whether it's hurricane warning or tropical storm warnings, as this system will move in so quickly, it'll bring the brunt of its impacts, minus the storm surge, to the inland communities. So we need to keep our heads aware, the eye to the sky, because this flash flood threat, the tornado threat, will be very real, come tonight and into early Friday morning across the southern Appalachians, into the Atlanta metro region, and the strongest of winds really look to be over eastern and central portions of Georgia and to South Carolina, where we expect hurricane-force gusts at times.

      "sentences": "Yes. First of all, you are absolutely right that as Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainianpresident, is there in Washington, D.C., we certainly have had a flurry of air raid sirens that were going off throughout pretty much all of last night. We did hear some impacts in the Kyiv area as well, but really that all went into this morning and into the better part of the day here as well. One of the things that we've heard from the Ukrainians is that once again the Russians launched dozens of those drones towards Ukrainian territory. Most of those were shot down. But one of the troubling things for the Ukrainians is that they also say that the Russians launched several hypersonic missiles called Kinzhals towards Ukrainian territory. The Ukrainians, of course, try and take those down with their air defenses. But in total, there were several people once again who were killed on the ground here in Ukraine, and of course several people who were wounded as well. So you're absolutely right that as the Ukrainian president there is in Washington, D.C., trying to drum up support, the war certainly has not stopped or has not slowed down in any way, shape or form on the battlefield, but also for Ukraine's critical infrastructure and for Ukraine's civilians also. And I think that's also one of the messages that Volodymyr Zelenskyy is going to present to the U.S. president, to President Biden, saying that the Ukrainians want to bring this war to a close, but they want to be able to do that on their terms, or at least favorable terms, where they essentially try to force the Russians into negotiations. And that's what that four- point plan for victory, as Volodymyr Zelenskyy calls it, appears to be all about. And there are certain outlines that we've already heard about. One of the key components Ukrainian president has said, these Ukrainian incursions into Russian territory, of course, that's been going on for a couple of weeks now. And the Ukrainians appear to want to trade some of that territory that they've taken inside Russia, possibly for territory that the Russians have taken for them and continue to occupy in the eastern parts of Ukraine. But one other thing that I think is really crystallizing now and is really becoming ever more clear, as the Ukrainian president is on the ground there in the United States, is that a key thing for the Ukrainians is to be able to use some of the longer distance weapons that the U.S. and other NATO countries have already given to them to be able to use those, be allowed to use those, to strike deep into Russian territory. That's something that, again and again, on the ground here, we hear from Ukrainians they believe is key to their own effort if they want to try and blunt the big Russian offensive that's still going on in the east of the country, where the Ukrainians right now are having a very difficult time trying to hold the Russians up. And also for the Ukrainians to possibly try and turn things around. The Ukrainians have long distance strike capabilities, but they say they'd be able to do much more if they were allowed to use those U.S. and Western- made weapons, Bianna.",

And the Europeans will have to actually probably double down on support to deter Russian aggression. They have to send the signals, especially with the U.S. absent, that they're going to be there to defend their interests, because Russia acts on weakness and believes it could act with impunity. But I think that -- you know, what we have here is -- I don't know. For some people, it might be additional clarity on where the Trump administration would be. For me, it was evident since 2019, certainly evident by the time we had the beginning of this war, starting in 2022, that Trump was going to be in Putin's corner. He's going to be in Putin's corner cheerleading him. He was going to be in Putin's corner, even to the extent of damning the U.S. as the culprit behind this war. And what we have is maybe for some people take the blinders off that Trump is, in fact, in Putin's corner. He could care less about our allies and friendships. He will be who he said he's going to be. He's going to be a friend to our enemies and a threat to our allies. This is exactly what I've been talking about.

As we continue to go through the recovery though for all of these disasters that also takes personnel and we're going to continue to work through with our states about what they need and how we can best adjudicate those resources, but we are seeing an increase and we're seeing a strain on our staff with more of them deployed for longer periods of time helping to support these communities recover.",

Thank you so much for joining us. So we heard from the FEMA Administrator saying that they have enough resources, but also acknowledging that these storms and the increased severity and number of the storms that we've seen over the course of the last several years has had an impact on staff, on the resources at hand. She said they're sending 700 personnel to multiple states now. Eight search and rescue teams are already going to be in place. But just walk us through what you will be looking for specifically in some of your top concerns as Helene is making its way towards the Panhandle there in Florida.",

And withthe geography of the Big Bend Region, if you think of a garden hose and you put your finger at the end of the nozzle, the speed of the water increases. So as that storm surge gets kind of tightened into this area and trained up in the coastline, that's why we're expecting a 20-foot storm surge. The freshwater flooding is the other element where we could see feet of rain across parts of the Southeast. So those are the two aspects, meteorologically, that we're concerned about. From an emergency management perspective, we are seeing a billion-dollar disaster every two and a half weeks in this country. That is disaster fatigue. The response, which only lasts a couple of days, is exhausting, but it's the recovery that can last months and years, and that is what's taxing with climate change, Bianna, we're seeing a lot more of these disasters. Again, already this year 19, this is sure to be number 20.",

You canmaybe go to the attic and gain a little bit of elevation. You cannot survive this kind of storm surge. If you're in a one-story home, forget about it. In a two-story home, it would be very difficult to survive. And because of the large size of this storm, not just the intensity, but the geographical size of the storm, there are going to be many communities facing dangerous storm surges. So if you are in an evacuation order, I cannot stress this enough, please get out and get away from the coastline, gain a little bit of elevation and get yourself out of harm's way, Bianna.",
