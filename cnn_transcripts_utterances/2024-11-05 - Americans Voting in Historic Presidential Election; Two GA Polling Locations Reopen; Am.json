And so, that's the -- look, there are a lot of people that are going to vote for Donald Trump today that didn't vote for him in 2020, that didn't vote for him in 2016, but you know what they're saying to themselves? When Donald Trump was president, life was more affordable, our country was safer, and it was stronger and more respected in the world.And ultimately, that's what's going to matter. When people go put gas in their car, when people have to pay their bills at the end of the month, they believe they're going to be better off under Donald Trump than they do under a Kamala Harris presidency, and that's what's going to matter on a daily basis. It's going to matter for the future of our country. There is no doubt, both sides are saying, that this is a definitional election that's going to determine the future of our country. I agree, that's one thing we can all agree on. And so, let's go out and vote today. And make our choice. We're blessed to be able to make that choice at the ballot box. And I strongly believe that our country is going to be better off, not just over the next four years, but for future American generations if Donald Trump is elected the 47th president of the United States.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Anderson, as much as I desperately want to mock the most tired cliche and politics of it all comes out to turn out, they're not wrong here. Look, this is the map right now as things currently stand, it will start to fill in red and blue over the course of the coming hours this evening.But let's flash back a little bit and try and get at what that trump adviser who's talking to Alayna Treene is saying here. We'll start in Pennsylvania. Obviously, it is kind of the most critical state based on visits to candidates, based on spending by candidates, based on pathways to 270. What they're talking about is this, it's not just how they do in their strongholds for the Trump campaign or for the Biden campaign. It's also if they're able to keep the margins down in the places where their opponent is going to win. And what I mean by that is this. If you're the Trump campaign and you watch what happened in Montgomery County, one of the critical collar counties outside of Philadelphia back in 2020, you know that margin and Joe Biden's ability to run up more than 319,000 votes was a borderline kill shot when it came to how they're pulling votes together in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and that carried throughout the collar counties. Can Donald Trump keep that margin down? Back in 2016 in these suburban areas, Hillary Clinton won 58.9 percent. So, the Trump campaign right now is trying to hold some of those collar counties down in terms of their overall output. They're also looking at Philadelphia County, obviously, where they believe they have made some inroads. They believe there's some softness, particularly with black male voters. But the interesting thing for the Biden administration campaign back in 2020 is when you actually look at the results. Yes, they ran up huge vote in the color counties. Yes, they did very well in Philadelphia County. Yes, they did very well in Allegheny County as well. But if you actually track through this part of the state here, as well as Scranton -- the Scranton area where Joe Biden is from, what the campaign was able to do was actually hold down Trump's margins in these Republican counties compared to 2016. The story wasn't just the color counties, it was their ability or Joe Biden's ability to hold down margins there. Two things I want to quickly get to, which is population shifts over the course of the last several years. This is the Atlanta Metro area. This is, yes, the critical driver of Joe Biden's victory here back in 2020, but also pushing out into a couple of Republican counties. There's been 136,000 new people that have moved in to this area, the Atlanta Metro region. White voters down population wise, 63,000 individuals. Hispanic, Asian, black, huge influx and surge of new more diverse electorate in that area. What's that going to mean? I think we know there's a realignment. Will the realignment continue along the trend that we've seen over the course of the last couple of cycles or will there be some surprises? There likely will be some surprises. And then here, Maricopa County and Pinal County, total population, it has been a surge down here in Arizona, 219,000 people across the demographic groups. There's been thousands of people added over the course of the last several years. What does that mean going forward? Joe Biden was able to flip Maricopa County back in 2020, the first time in generations that Democrat was able to do that. That drove his ability to flip Arizona to the blue column for the first time since 1996. Can he do that again? The answer will likely lie within that population surge. There's new voters in that critical county. Anderson.",

Can the Trump campaign effectively target and mobilize them? If they can, then it's going to be a good night for the former president. If they can't, it's a significant vulnerability that will likely cause him the state. And I would also add quickly not utilizing Nikki Haley may also reveal itself to be a mistake. Now, I know the former president views her as rather perfidious. He doesn't like disloyal people. I get it. But in electoral politics is about addition, not subtraction.
