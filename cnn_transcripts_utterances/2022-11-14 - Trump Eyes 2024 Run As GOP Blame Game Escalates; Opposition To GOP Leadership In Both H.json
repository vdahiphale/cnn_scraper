And it comes as various party factions are sparring over who's to blame for the GOP's lackluster midterm performance.Let's discuss with CNN senior political commentator, Scott Jennings, a former top adviser to Mitch McConnell, and CNN political commentator, Karen Finney, who's a former senior spokeswoman for Hillary for America. Good to see both of you. Scott, as we ready for this announcement tomorrow, do you think Trump could win 2024 or did Tuesday change everything?",

Whether or not Trump jumps in, it's clear the Republican Party can't seem to quit him and that his power -- he's got his hands all over what is happening right now in this leadership fight on the Republican side for the House.And he will certainly have a hand in trying to drive the House agenda. And what that will do, when we see the various investigations and what I think will be extremism and overreach, that creates a further bright line for the American people about the differences between the two parties. About the future and the past, about the very same things that they so loudly rejected past Tuesday.",

I think when you look at the record, President Biden has accomplished a lot. He has a strong record to run on if he chose to run again. And I think we would do perfectly well. And, again, there's a difference between the extremism that we're seeing on the Republican side and these issues that are playing themselves out right now in these leadership contests on the Republican side, even before, frankly, all the votes have been counted.",

I think there's a small group of people, for their own personalreasons, personal ambition reasons, are making noise about this. They don't have a candidate to oppose Mitch McConnell. And as Senator Tom Cotton, of Arkansas, said, in order to beat a man, you have to beat the man. He was channeling his inner Rick Flair in that moment. But that's a true story. McConnell's record on the election is pretty clear. Raised and spent almost $400 million on behalf of candidates. He elected all that on the field. Versus the person they follow, I think, Donald Trump, who hoarded a lot of money in his account and I think scrambled our chances to win. I mean, Dr. Oz, in Pennsylvania, for instance, was his choice. Oz was trying to run on a campaign of moderation and balance, that he said all the time. And Trump shows up the last week of the campaign, like the last night of the campaign, and throws his entire message into disarray and we lose the race. So I think, if you look at whose fingerprints are on what, most Republican Senators know McConnell did everything possible to win and people did everything possible to help themselves. And to Karen's point, Independent voters don't want chaos and they don't want extremism. They want stability in their government. And",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.-ELECT MARIA GLUESENKAMP PEREZ (D-WA): It really feels like folks that work in the trades, rural Democrats, it feels like we're a dying breed. And it's critical that, if we want to be relevant in those cases, Democrats have to stop explaining things to rural people and people who work in the trades and start listening. Because, you know, we know things that, you know, other folks might not know. And we feel overlooked and no listened to so often. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This is because there was new vote counting, the new vote release from Pinal County, a ruby red county. You can see where Kari Lake is leading.Let me give you exact numbers because it will give you a sense of how this race is moving or changing or might change. OK, Pinal County, this vote in. There was a dump of 3,397 votes. Kari Lake, in that batch, got 2,309 and Katie Hobbs got 1,070. Kari Lake, that was 68.3, and for Katie Hobbs, it was about 31.7. So you can see how this was enough to have her close that gap, Kari Lake was able to close that gap by about 1,200 votes. Tonight, we're expecting a lot more votes from Arizona, including 95,000 from Maricopa County and also about 40,000 those from Pinal County, both of which skew a little bit Democratic. Kari Lake still needs to win about 58 percent of that vote if she wants to close in on Katie Hobbs. This patch from Pinal, she got more than that. She got 68 percent. So this is what she needs to do to have any hope of getting on top of Katie Hobbs.",

This study really adds to our understanding of the mental health impact the pandemic has had.And separately from this research, we knew that nearly three-quarters of high schoolers reported having some kind of childhood adverse experience during the pandemic, like abuse in the home or like not having enough food to eat. And those experiences can really increase your risk for having suicidal ideations. With this new study, researchers found, before the pandemic, in the years 2016 to 2017, compared with after the pandemic, the years 2019 through 2021, there was a 59 percent increase in the frequency of E.R. visits tied to having suicidal thoughts. And the researchers called this, quote, \"a continuous increasing mental health crisis.\" What they mean by that, before the pandemic, we did see a steady rise in these E.R. visits. You should see, Ana, on the chart here this rise before the pandemic. But then after the pandemic, as you see, towards the end of the chart, there were spikes where we saw even more E.R. visits tied to suicidal ideation. This is among kids ages 5 to 19. So the takeaway here, Ana, this is a sign of the mental health services we need and support we need for our young people -- Ana?",

So my advice to people, whether they're small business owners or, you know -- is take some risk off the table. If you were going to make a purchase, maybe slowdown that purchase a little bit.
