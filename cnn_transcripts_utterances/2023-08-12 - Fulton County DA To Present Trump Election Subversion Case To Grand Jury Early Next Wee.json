Just a short time ago today I spoke with former Georgia RepublicanLieutenant Governor and Geoff Duncan, who told me that he will testify in the next 48 hours before grand jury in Atlanta. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has subpoenaed Duncan to testify about efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. And we also now know that an independent journalist has tweeted today that he was also called by the Fulton County District Attorney, and also was asked to testify before that grand jury on Tuesday. Geoff Duncan is now a CNN political commentator. And this is his entire interview with me earlier today as Duncan talks about this subpoena and his plans to testify. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)",

Let's hear the whole truth and nothing but the truth about Donald Trump's actions in the surrounding cast of characters around him. We watched a series of events happen here that were tragic and untruthful. And he's got a chance to present these facts and say, Hey, I didn't know what was going on or I think what's what reality is going to be as they knew exactly what they were doing. And I think the interesting part to this indictment that's different than the others is that there's going to heavy signaling that there's going to be well plus co-conspirators. And these folks don't have the same level of loyalty they had to Donald Trump when he was trying to to change the election outcome in 2020. And so it's gonna be interesting to see which way they go. And you know, these are serious charges that are being signaled racketeering, conspiracy, RICO. I mean, these are things really, you know, kind of garnered for the the mafia or the mob. And so what we'll certainly see, this gets ratcheted up in the next few days. WHITFIELD: Well, tell me more about that people who you believe once were very loyal to Trump now, as a result of the investigation and the ongoing investigation no longer have the same kind of loyalties. How do you believe that may have changed the building of this case against Trump?",

I said every time we lower people's taxes, it's not just for Republicans, it's for Democrats, too. And I got booed by 30,000 MAGA hats.And then I said, every time we improve education, it's not just for Democrats, it's for Republicans, and I got booed even louder. And then I made this this crazy statement and said, you know, our policies are so good. They even help the people that don't vote for us and I got booed even louder. It was at that moment that I realized that that crew of 30,000 people were not conservative, they were angry. And within hours of the 2020 election, when I started hearing Donald Trump talk about his notion that the election was rigged, and the machines were corrupt and whatever else conspiracy theories, I quickly turned the page and I tried to get to it as quickly as I could, so that I could try to stop the the little grass fire from turning into a forest fire, but unfortunately, I was unsuccessful. There wasn't enough of us out there doing it. But instead, we're gonna have this slow, painful process of realizing what the truth actually is. And that's Donald Trump ran the worst campaign ever. And if we let him be our nominee again, he will get beat by Joe Biden again because it will be the worst campaign a Republican could ever put forward. (END VIDEO TAPE)",

This is her big moment to give this presentation to the grand jury probably expect it to begin on Monday could spill into Tuesday, where she is expected as CNN has been reporting for a while to seek indictments against Donald Trump and many of his Republican allies in Georgia, possibly more than a dozen defendants.

First of all, the information needs to get from the special grand jury into the new one, instead of reading the testimony, in other words, you could have someone just read the transcript of what happened before the special grand jury, it's obviously more powerful if it's presented in person. They can ask some additional questions, put some, you know, for example, new things that they've learned over the course of their investigation.But ultimately, the main purpose here is to take the information they already have. I don't think there's going to be any big surprises about what for example, the lieutenant governor is going to say, since they've already spoken to him. But they're going to put that all in front of this grand jury. So the grand jury has an opportunity to see these witnesses see the evidence, and this way that the district attorney can make sure that the grand jury is going to return the indictment that she puts before them.",

There's a pardon board. So it's a more complicated process.He also would not be able to shut down the investigation in the same way. In other words, Trump could try to make some argument to courts in Georgia that, as president, he can't be subject to a state indictment. But if he, you know, was president of United States, he could order if the attorney general install an attorney general, something like Jeffrey Clark, who could literally shut down Jack Smith's investigations. You can't do that to Fanni Willis. She's an elected official, you know, in the state of Georgia. But separate and apart from that, Fred, you know, unlike the other state charge, right, there's a Manhattan DA indictment that's also not a federal charge. This is for conduct that occurred while he was president in the United States, not beforehand, not this is not just some sort of books and records violation. This is a chart for him over trying to overturn the election in Georgia. And as I think, you know, Marshall pointed out a moment ago, there are potentially others that can be part of this. And, you know, there is an interplay between this and those other cases. If, for example, John Eastman, or Rudy Giuliani faces a charge here, and ultimately decides that it's in their best interest to cooperate, that could have an impact on these other investigations as well. So definitely important. There's really a multiplier effect and an interplay between these different prosecutions that we should keep in mind.",

A lot of the attacks have been racial in character, you know, and I would be remiss if I didn't point out that Donald Trump himself regularly accuses Fani Willis of being racist, and Marxist and a lunatic.And he actually, in the past several days, spread some incredibly ugly claims that are totally false about her that I won't even repeat. She has had security beefed up not just in the courthouse but for her personally. And, look, if he does end up as a criminal defendant in the state of Georgia, he will have to answer to a judge. And those comments may be brought before the judge, just like they have been right here in Washington DC, as we literally saw yesterday, with a hearing in his federal election subversion case where prosecutors were flagging to the judge, Trump's post on Truth Social, if you come after me, I'll come after you and whether that type of rhetoric where that falls on the line between free speech defending oneself and a serious threat to to the interests of justice.",

Of course, we heard that call for ourselves when he was asking the Georgia Secretary of State for more votes.

So he gains more attention and notice than some of his rivals might. But he talked about his standing here in Iowa. And now he plans to campaign aggressively and remain the front runner.

And in fact, they put out two pictures of side by side comparison, showing the public the suspect who they were looking for. And then the 12-year-old boy that they mistakenly detained.This all caught national attention due to a TikTok video put out by a neighbor who shot this confrontation on their cell phone showing the boy right there in handcuffs. And then the father later on in the video shouting from several feet away. That boy is then placed in the back of a police car. He is then after a short time released, uncuffed and released back to his father. This TikTok video right here about over nearly 5 million views and thousands of comments. Now the boy's father Michael Bernard spoke with WILX an affiliate of CNN. He says that he was washing the dishes and then told his son Tashawn to take out the trash. And here's what he said happened during an off camera interview with our affiliate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHAEL BERNARD, BOY'S FATHER: I get concerned when I didn't see him come back within that period of time. And I walk out to here, look out and to my surprise the cops had him in handcuffs. I was mad about it. That was my sudden never do it breaking the law. So I rushed down and asked the cop what's the problem? Well, you have my son in handcuff just like that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Here's part of the statement he put out, as the chief of police, I want to apologize that this incident had such an effect on this young man, and again 12 years old here, and his family. I'm asking for the community to consider all the facts of the situation before making a judgment. The relationship with our community has been and will continue to be a top priority for the Lansing Police Department. And Fred the family here, the Barnard family has gotten a hold of an attorney. And they -- the attorney is claiming that his client was wearing a gray shirt not a white one and was visibly much younger than the suspect. CNN has not independently been able to confirm the color that the child was wearing during that incident. And the family is considering legal action against the city.",
