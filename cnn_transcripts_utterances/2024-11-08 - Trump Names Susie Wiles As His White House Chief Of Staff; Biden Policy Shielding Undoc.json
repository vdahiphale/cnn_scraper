That includes this commitment to trying to get additional aid to Ukraine out the door. There is also the implementation aspects of various legislations. Things like the CHIPS agreement, the infrastructure law, and climate emissions in that Inflation Reduction Act. There are still many agreements that need to be finalized, for instance, relating to CHIPS. There's also just this week the Biden administration did move to limit drilling in one of Alaska's arctic wildlife reserves. That could be significant, especially going forward if Trump would maybe take aim at a policy like that. Pardon the noise. I know it's very loud here at the White House. There is also the issue of judicial nominations trying to get some people potentially across the finish line going forward. But still so many questions about how much the Biden administration can try to get done in these final weeks as they're trying to safeguard a lot of these initiatives that there are some concerns that Trump could try to undo when he comes to office.",

It was one of the biggest actions meant to help migrant families in years. And what it would have done was to protect from deportation the undocumented spouses of American citizens who had been living in the United States continuously for 10 years. It would have also protected their children. It could have potentially affected hundreds of thousands of people. But it was challenged in court by Texas and a number of other Republican-held states who said that this would strain their state resources and potentially encourage more undocumented immigration into the United States. Of course, this now leaves those hundreds of thousands of people in a great deal of uncertainty that's layered on top of the uncertainty that already exists as President Trump is coming into office. Of course, he has promised mass deportations. There was no question that he would have reversed this executive order once he entered the Oval Office. And there is certainly no question that the incoming Trump administration will not defend this in court.

Because right now, the Russian forces are actually advancing in Donetsk.And I'm sure from Putin's vantage point he's looking at what's happening in Washington and saying it's unlikely that a Republican Congress is going to continue funding Ukraine. So why would he be satisfied with only taking part of Ukraine? Why wouldn't he want a march on Kyiv? And I think the challenge for Trump is going to be not just how to coerce Zelenskyy but how do you coerce Putin? And I think the best way to do that actually would be to make clear that if Putin does not agree to this -- to end the war, that Trump will radically increase weapons deliveries to Ukraine. That's how he can actually create pressure for an actual settlement. But whether he'll do that or not who knows? BOLDUAN:  And to -- I mean, great, great question. And on that point, Jill -- I mean, Vladimir Putin offered his congratulations to Trump yesterday, which was his first public comment on the outcome. The way it was said is his behavior at the moment -- well, part of what he said was his (meaning Trump) -- this is Putin talking. \"His behavior at the moment of an attempt on his life left an impression on me. He turned out to be a brave man. He manifested himself in the very correct way, bravely as a man.\" Though his spokesperson said just the day before that he had no plans to congratulate Trump, saying, let us -- Peskov saying, \"Let's not forget that we are talking about an unfriendly country that is both directly and indirectly involved in the war against our state.\" What's going on here, Jill? JILL DOUGHERTY, CNN CONTRIBUTOR, ADJUNCT PROFESSOR, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, FORMER CNN MOSCOW BUREAU CHIEF (via Webex by Cisco): Well, I think Putin is playing around a little bit here. I think he's playing coy. He didn't immediately jump into congratulating Trump because I think Putin wants to show he is the president -- he is a strong president of a country, and he doesn't have to sit on pins and needles waiting for another election. But, of course, he wanted to congratulate Trump. And I think it's interesting the way he began to talk about Ukraine. You know, I'm open to discussing things. And it bears listening to what the American, soon-to-be president will say because it would deal with dealing with Russia in order to solve Ukraine. And I think that's one of the problems. If Trump really wants a big win, which apparently he does -- a big deal right at the beginning -- then Ukraine is the perfect thing. So Trump and Putin apparently could come together and say well, let's solve it ourselves. Zelenskyy is never going to go for that.
