Though this is the fourth time the Former President has been indicted in recent months. The breadth of the charges and the scope of the case make this one different. Our Nick Valencia has the story.

That's not been officially confirmed as yet.Although you can see from this makeshift memorial that has sprung up here in St. Petersburg, where Yevgeny Prigozhin was from its right outside the Wagner headquarters, in fact, where they ran their operations from in this city. They're memorials like this, all over the country in various cities were ranked Wagner recruited from people coming laying flowers like these, paying their respects, lighting candles as well. It's an interesting photograph over here, let me show you this. As I think that was the latest picture that appeared of Yevgeny Prigozhin somewhere meant to be in Africa, it says, in Russian in this hell, he was the best, you know, speaking about him, of course, in the past tense. You come over here you can see as well, Wagner arm patches that have been put here. You've seen a lot of people coming here paying their respects. There's a sort of constant stream of people doing that, and laying things like flowers and writing messages and things like that. This is something that we've all noticed. And it's quite interesting. It's a sledge hammer. Pretty heavy, I can tell you, and it's a, you know, a potent symbol, it became this hammer, a potent symbol of the extreme violence, that Wagner used because it was with a hammer like this, that they executed, someone they regarded as a traitor. And they feel that they videoed it. And it became sort of an iconic picture of just how extreme and how violent this Russian group restriction group was, or is, in its actions, particularly in Ukraine, but elsewhere around the world as well. I mean, there's a bunch of other stuff here, Wagner flags here, as well, photographs, various other memorabilia. As people in this city come out, not in great numbers, I have to say, but come out and pay their respects to Yevgeny Prigozhin. There are a lot of people who really believed he spoke for a lot of Russians. Yes, they may not have said it. Some people have said to me, you know, he said out loud, about corruption in the military. What many Russians are actually thinking inside their heads, but don't want to say. And so it was for that reason, I think, along with the fact that a lot of people joined Wagner. There's a lot of family members of people who are coming out who are in Wagner to pay their respects as well. It's for that reason that Yevgeny Prigozhin to enjoy a certain degree of popularity across Russia. Now, it's not clear whether that population will increase if it's finally officially confirmed that he's dead. Or whether this will become you know another sort of forgotten chapter in history in in Russia's recent turbulent history, Max.",

Well, that's something that Russian investigators say they're going to try and get a handle on.There's also been I think you mentioned it already. There's also been a response from the Kremlin to the allegation that they may have been behind that airplane crash, where they categorically denied that Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesperson, saying that's absolute lies. But I think that won't do much to, you know, answer the suspicions of many people in this country and outside the country that two months to the day that Yevgeny Prigozhin led, essentially an uprising against the Kremlin and the biggest challenge against Vladimir Putin's authority in 23 years, two months to the day. That's when the plane that he was apparently traveling on crashed. I think most Russians if they're honest, and they are saying this to us off camera, I believe that's far more than a coincidence.",
