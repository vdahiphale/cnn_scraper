      "sentences": "Good evening. It is 3There is new video and accounts of what these killers inflicted up close on young and old, men, women, children, innocents. You'll hear from survivors tonight. President Biden weighed in on it today and confirmed there are Americans being held by Hamas and we'll bring you that as well. But first the latest on where things stand. We are in Ashdod again, about 19 or 20 miles north of Gaza and it is there in Gaza within the last few minutes, there were more strikes and we could just hear a large thump of a distant explosion. To the immediate south, in Ashkelon, Israeli Forces say they killed three Hamas militants overnight during a gun battle in the city's industrial area. Above Ashkelon, in recent hours and throughout the day, more incoming rockets for the Iron Dome defenses to cope with. You see the images, part of an especially heavy barrage that Hamas launched at the city. Now, compounding matters, danger on another front. Israeli Defense Force is saying a number of rockets were fired into the country from Syria. They landed in open areas. No word though on damage or injuries. Israeli Air Force in the meantime spent all day hitting targets in Gaza, killing they say members of Hamas leadership. The IDF says the airstrikes are focused on the group's infrastructure and operations, but does admit to striking mosque if there's Hamas activity going on inside they say. And as I mentioned a moment ago, we've got even more video that shows nothing which could even remotely be described as an act of war, which is why as hard as it might be to stomach, we want to show it to you. It was taken from a car's dashcam. It's a little hard to make out. It's from Saturday morning. It's near the Nova Music Festival where the slaughter of more than 260 Israelis took place and others and it is at a bomb shelter where people had taken refuge. In the video, you see Hamas gunmen arrive. One immediately approaches a shirtless man who is against the wall outside the bomb shelter at the top of the frame and forcing him to the ground kicking him several times. Another man approaches, menaces him but is pulled away. The doorway you see there is to the shelter, more gunmen gather around the entry, some wearing fatigues, some in civilian clothing, all carrying assault rifles and they kind of mill around briefly taking turns kicking and stomping the guy on the ground. Then as others back away, one of the government unclipped some kind of grenade from his belt and lobs it inside the bomb shelter. Seconds later, a man who had been sheltering inside actually then runs out, we just saw him lobbing it, runs out of the shelter. The gunman then open fire on the man firing on automatic and we don't know what happened to that person. Nic Robertson visited this very shelter yesterday. He found bullet holes empty shell casings, evidence of gunfire inside at the people taking cover inside. We're going to hear more from Nic in a moment about that as well as his visit to a border kibbutz where he spoke with an IDF Major General who finally late yesterday cleared the area of dozens of Hamas attackers and is now frankly unable to comprehend the civilian carnage he himself has seen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJOR GENERAL ITAI VERUV (RET), ISRAELI MILITARY: Some people are out with their children and they killed them. They killed babies in front of the parents and then kids and the parents, they kill parents and we found babies between the dogs and the family that killed before him. He cut the head of the people. I heard during my childhood about the war in Europe and the Holocaust, of course. All of my family came from Europe and they are survivalists et cetera et cetera. I never think that I would see my eyes picture and scenes like this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We could still smell that fire and sort of see it glowing in the distance back there, but really underscoring that despite what Israeli Forces had said earlier in the day that they were confident that all Hamas militants had been effectively killed or captured and pushed out of southern Israel.

It is very hard for the IDF to keep track of where lone gunman may be lying in wait potentially. We saw along the roadside in a different part, along the Israeli-Gaza border today another situation where the IDF have closed off the road. They were very clear with us that we couldn't go beyond a certain point because again, they thought they had cleared most of these militants, but they are still finding incidents where they are popping up.

And this is what the general was explaining. It taken the Israeli Defense Force 48 hours to be able to ultimately defeat Hamas. And he said when he got in there, of course, that's when they began to realize and see just how bad the situation was, as he described it. Real concentrated brutality. Families killed together.

So finding these people is going to be difficult. And the intelligence necessary to find them is going to be difficult as well. Keeping in mind that what we've seen from Saturday is that Israeli intelligence isn't quite what many people thought, despite the fact that when you're in Gaza, the sound you hear 24 hours a day is drones overhead are all around the perimeter of Gaza. There are balloons with surveillance cameras. There are cameras all around the walls around the fences around Gaza. In addition to the fact that there are many collaborators for Israel inside Gaza, despite that the Israeli -- the intelligence system failed. And keep in mind that in 2006, Gaza militants captured Gilad Shalit, who was a soldier with the Israeli army. And he was held for several years, I think, until 2009 when he was released in an exchange of prisoners. But the Israelis were never able to get him out. And it's going to be even more difficult trying to get out more, perhaps, in a hundred hostages who will be probably deployed all around the Gaza Strip, which I think as I've pointed out before, is twice the size of Washington, D.C.

He refrained from asking Israel to hold back in any way militarily, oftentimes in statements in the past. There have been a condemnation of activities by Hamas, but also calls for restraint. There wasn't a call for restraint. He did talk about, you know, operating by the rules of war. But I'm wondering what you made of what the president said.",

The obvious place for refuge for these Palestinians would be in El Arish, south of Gaza in the Sinai Peninsula under Egyptian sovereignty. Again, the Egyptians have always been resistant to that. This is going back a long time. There have been long time plans to try to resettle some of the Palestinian refugees in El Arish. But that would be the only sort of exit for them.On the Israeli side, it's populated, as we discovered much to our horror and that as Hamas knew in crossing the border and massacring Israeli civilians. So that would be non-starter. I think that probably those discussions also are touching on the question of humanitarian disasters. So Israel has affected a total blockade on Gaza. Now, it's long been misunderstood, I should say, put my cards on the table, Anderson. I was in charge of that blockade for the Israeli government for about a year. I wouldn't wish this on anybody, but it was a purely a military blockade. It was blockading armaments or what they call dual use items, things that could be used as armaments, could be a two by four, which could be used to building a tunnel, for example. But in other, in any way cut out -- cut out electricity. It didn't cut out food or medicines. In fact, if there were any restrictions on the food and medicines going into Gaza, it was Hamas that did that because Hamas like keeping a certain level of humanitarian disaster in suffering in Gaza to keep the population dependent on Hamas and keep the population angry. But there was a -- there was a terminus through which Israel had the capacity of put out -- handling about 1,200 huge trucks of food and medicine every day. Hamas would let in about 400. And that was very frustrating for us. But Israel also worked to improve the electricity, the water supply in Gaza thinking erroneously. This would somehow incentivize if Hamas to focus on running the Gaza Strip and not killing us. It was a misconception. But having said that now Israel has cut off electricity. It's cut off a lot of the food going in. And that's going to create a very dire situation in very no -- in a very short period within Gaza. I don't think that Israel wants to see Gaza starve, but we're going to have to figure out a way, perhaps with international organizations like the Red Cross, where essential food stuff can be brought into the Strip.",

There's no doubt about it. But the reason we're showing it to you is because it shows a level of planning and potential knowledge of how to infiltrate this particular kibbutz that is striking. According to the IDF, the video begins outside the main gate of one of the kibbutz that was attacked on Saturday. You can see two Hamas gunmen in camouflage holding rifles at the top left of the screen. Now one of the gunmen eventually crosses to the other side of the road. You can see him standing next to what looks like a guard house or a security station. Both then wait for someone to arrive and open the gate. A few seconds pass. Eventually a civilian car arrives. As the gate then opens, the two gunmen rush from either side of the car begin firing into it. We have cut that part out, murdering the people inside. Moments later, the gate is now open, the two gunmen are then able to enter. The car with the apparently lifeless body of the driver rolls forward. One of the gunmen then appears to try to knock or tip down the camera filming the scene. The car keeps rolling forward. You then see one of the gunmen walking calmly into the kibbutz. Now according to Israeli authorities, more than 100 bodies have been found at this particular kibbutz. That's how bad this slaughter was. I'm joined now by the international spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus. Lieutenant Colonel, what is your assessment on when you see a video like this of the level of training and experience of some of these Hamas fighters who took part early on in this terror attack?",

And many of the people who live there, I know, because I have friends there, are people who believe in the two-state solution who had friends in Gaza, and who really believe that a long-lasting peace could be achieved with Gaza and Palestinians.I've had discussions with people in the kibbutzim, friends of mine, who believe in that. And then they wake up to hear gunshots in their kibbutz, and they fight for their lives, barricading themselves inside their bomb shelters, only to have their houses torched for them to flee out of the burning house, and then massacred on the lawn in front of their house. And today, we saw the bodies that were left outside of the houses and the kibbutz and it is appalling. So there's no -- you know, for anybody who is seeking to justify and explain, you know, on an academic level, why would Hamas attack these targets, there's nothing to it. This is pure, unfiltered hatred, fueled by crazy religious extremism, and some crazy idea that by killing Israeli civilians, they can somehow beat Israel and create some Sharia-based political entity in the wake of what they will destroy. All of these are, of course, dreams that never ever will come true. But it just goes to show the kind of organization and the kind of beasts that we have on the other side of that border, their line of thinking. And again, this wasn't, you know, some local initiative and an operation that went astray or people, operatives on the ground who got carried away with themselves. This was the plan. The Hamas spokesperson, a day and a half after the attack happened, he said, the attack went according to plan, and we are happy with the consequences. So that is what we're looking at.",
