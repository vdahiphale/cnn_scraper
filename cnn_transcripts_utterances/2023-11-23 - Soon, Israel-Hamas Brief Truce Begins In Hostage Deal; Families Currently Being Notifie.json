This is a special edition of THE SOURCE, because hours from now, a deal, if Israel and Hamas can keep it.Weeks of negotiations have led both sides to this point where we are right now. If everything falls, what has been a very delicately choreographed script, some families will finally be able to breathe a sigh of relief. But failure would spell heartbreak for many of them. What we know right now is that 13 Israeli hostages who have spent weeks in Hamas captivity are now scheduled to have freedom. Dozens of Palestinian prisoners are also slated for release in exchange for the release of those hostages. All of that is happening in addition to what is expected to be a complete pause in the fighting in Gaza, as we have seen aid trucks already lining up at the Rafah crossing to go into Gaza, desperately needed aid there, as you just heard. But we've already watched one delay to this deal followed by an intense burst of fighting happening on the ground in Gaza. We should also note this is only roughly a quarter of the number of the Israeli hostages that are being held by Hamas, leaving many other families left to wonder if or when they'll ever be able to see their loved ones again. We also know that President Biden has been very hopeful tonight as this clock is ticking towards that expected release of the first group of women and children in hostage in Gaza. CNN's Arlette Saenz is in Nantucket, where the president is spending his Thanksgiving with his family. And, Arlette, as we heard from President Biden earlier tonight, he was asked about the release of these hostages. What did he tell reporters?",

And you really don't know, even if this deal is already signed and put together, nobody knows if this will really happen. Now, these stories that are coming out, I don't want to call them -- they're tragic stories. Yarden here, you have a mother who manages to escape after she's been kidnapped with her child. Then she says, they're going to get me. So, she gives her child to her spouse. They run off and she gives herself out. And she doesn't know if it worked or if it didn't work.

I don't envy the people who have to decide, we're going to take a deal where not everybody is going to be released.

The deal is complicated. It is delicate. There are still a lot of questions about what could happen at the last minute. Joining me now is a man who has negotiated hundreds of hostage negotiations, former Navy SEAL Commander and Coordinator of the Hostage Working Group for the U.S. embassy in Iraq, Daniel O'Shea. Daniel, you know, there are so many risks here at play. What about notifying the families, as Israel has done here, of the 13 names that are on that list, you know, with the caveat that they are still in Hamas control as of this moment? DANIEL O'SHEA, FORMER NAVY SEAL COMMANDER:  That is the challenge. And I can tell you family members and many of whom I met after my tour ended in Iraq, I got to meet family members back in the state, some of whom lost their loved ones, some who got their loved one home. And communications from the government, or I should say a lack of communication, was always one of the first and the most ardent complaints that a lot of these families had. So, I understand the need to share that information, but from my side, that is nothing we would have ever presented to these families because you're giving expectations and high hopes that can be dashed because this is such a tenuous situation. Yes, we should be cautiously optimistic, but I would be very hesitant. Less information shared is better, to be frank, because a lot of things could go wrong.",

Because I think part of this is, you know, either the families aren't all here in Israel, they need to come back, if that is going to be their loved one who is the one being released, what do you think is the right way to go about this?O'SHEA:  Well, the point is when you raise information about what families are being released, then you turn everyone else into, you know, asking more questions. [22:15L00] It's very challenging, but the goal is to raise the value of the hostage in the eyes of the hostage taker and diminish the value, perceived value of those hostages. And when you have all this press and speculation, the president weighing in, all that does is raise the stakes and gives Hamas even more power about holding on these hostages. So, it's a tightrope. It's a balancing act. But I just know that this deal was not made directly between Hamas and Israel. Both have sworn to wipe each other out. This deal was made through third party intermediaries and backdoor channels. And I just would be very cautious going forward and tell -- you know, let's get the these first batch of hostages out and hopefully that lays a groundwork for a few success. But this could this could turn -- it could go wrong very easily. And it's less information before you actually have accomplished something is a smarter course of action, in my experience.",

Hamas has hostages, Islamic Jihad. There probably may be even criminal or splinter groups that might have some of these hostages in Gaza. So, there's just so many variables. And even a third party actor, Hamas, what if Hezbollah shoots a missile from the West Bank to throw this all under stray (ph), a checkpoint at Israeli defense holder might have a car come up too quickly and fire off around. So, the ceasefire is very tenuous and it would not take a lot for it to end before the, quote, four days that was agreed upon. But we will see what happens. But, again, I don't have -- I would proceed with caution on giving expectations and hope to these families.

AMIR TIBON, DIPLOMATIC CORRESPONDENT, \"HAARETZ\":  Hi, Kaitlan. Thank you so much for having me. I think right now, Israel is facing a situation where we only have bad choices. After the October 7 attack, which as you said, I personally felt, together with my family, because I'm a resident of the Gaza border area and our civilian community was attacked and 14 people, my neighbors were murdered and five people from my small community were kidnapped. And when we look at the broader picture, we know what happened on that day. Israel only faced bad choices. And we had a choice to make this deal and to start getting back some of our people, mostly women and children, even though it comes with a price. We're going to have to stop the fighting, stop the momentum of the military for at least four days, release Palestinian prisoners, many of them convicted of violent actions, attempted murder and things like that. Personally, I'm not going to say it's a good deal, but I think it's inevitable. I think we had to do this because the choice of not doing this and leaving behind our people, women and children, especially in the hands of Hamas, to me as an Israeli citizen was unacceptable. From the first place, we have to admit that these people were not properly protected by the government of Israel on October 7, and now we have a commitment and a duty to bring them back. So, in a choice between the impossible and the terrible, we chose the impossible.",

And while civilians are working with private companies and the military to produce as many drones as possible, these soldiers say they are not nearly enough.COREN (voice-over):  As Russia's full-scale invasion approaches a second year, there is now a critical shortage of drones. China's decision to shut down exports of parts, citing national security concerns, is part of the problem. However, the biggest issue is Russian electronic warfare. A Ukrainian official tells CNN, the military uses roughly 30 to 40,000 drones per month. They're cheap and expendable. But soldiers on the ground say they need at least 10 times more. A grassroots army of civilians are heeding the call, including Vera and Oleksandr, encouraging others to do the same. Their operation has taken over their one-bedroom apartment. He makes drone parts with his 3D printer, while she creates camouflage dressings for soldiers' helmets. Their work acknowledged by grateful troops in Bakhmut, who sent them Ukraine's coat of arms made of bullets. OLEKSANDR SIERKOV, CIVILIAN DRONE MAKER (through translator):  Instead of getting married and having a wedding, we spent that money to start making drones. Now, we are happy without gold rings, but with the drones. COREN (voice-over):  Companies like Victory Drones are training up civilians online to help build these little birds to then distribute to the military. HENNADIY, VOLUNTEER, \"VICTORY DRONES\":  If you attach the payload to the bottom, if you attach the battery on top, you have a perfect shell which is a guided missile. COREN (voice-over):  Volunteer and soldier Hennadiy says to compete with Russia's industrial output, Ukraine must innovate or there will be no future. He's already lost his best friend, seen here in this video, singing lullabies to their children. He knows too well the painful price of this rule.",
