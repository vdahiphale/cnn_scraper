We'll be joined, tonight, by Cindy and Jack McCain, the wife and the son, of the late Republican senator, John McCain. Plus, the first Biden impeachment inquiry hearing, not off to a strong start exactly. One senior Republican aide, calling it, quote, an \"Unmitigated disaster,\" as every single Republican witness agreed with Democrats. All with nearly 48 hours left, before the government is said to shut down, and run out of funding, millions of Americans stand to stop getting their paychecks, including members of the U.S. military. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We're live, from Capitol Hill, tonight, the citadel of our democracy, where democracy is not exactly working, as it should be. The government is on the brink of shutting down, tonight, with House Republicans voting, in this hour, on some of these standalone spending bills, though, even if they can get these votes passed, tonight. And that is very much still an open question, as we're speaking right now. That alone would not prevent a government shutdown. A shutdown, of course, is not just a formality, or something procedural. It would actually create a lot of pain, for a lot of regular Americans. Tonight, House Republicans are essentially at war, with one another, not just over funding the government, though. Even with no agreement in sight, on funding the government, House Republicans held their first hearing, in the impeachment inquiry, into President Biden, today. But it did not quite go as they expected or at least had planned for it to go, as the hearing was deemed, by even their own Republican colleagues, an unmitigated disaster, mainly because of things like this.

Even in that situation, there are 16,000 military spouses, who are employed by the federal government.
