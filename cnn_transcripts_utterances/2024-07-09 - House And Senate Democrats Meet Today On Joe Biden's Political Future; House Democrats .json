All of that playing out in this private setting. The first time they were able to meet. Now, it was clear -- this much was clear, there is no consensus about whether Biden should be replaced. In fact, some of them said they would support Joe Biden simply because he has insisted that he's going to stay in this race. And they simply have no other choice. So they're deciding they're going to need to get behind the top of their ticket. Now, at the moment, Senate Democrats are meeting. They're having -- they're having their first meeting ever since the -- ever since the debate from late last month, they were on recess last week, and now they're behind closed doors airing out their concerns. I caught up with one senator earlier today, Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, an endangered Democrat, and I asked him about whether he's willing to abandon Biden. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, you're hearing how Nadler has come around and that is really the view of so many other Democrats that I spoke with today. People like Ritchie Torres of New York telling me that I'm viewing this pragmatically. He's our nominee and we got to get behind him. Some calling for Biden to do more to alleviate their concerns.

He will be the nominee at the convention in August. He will be the nominee on Election Day in November and then it's really up to leadership to say that.

This has just really upended all of that.Talking to Democratic advisors all morning long, they're worried about the growing sort of gap between where the president stands in battleground states and the Senate candidates. I'm talking Wisconsin. I'm talking Michigan. I'm talking Pennsylvania. Of course, Arizona, Nevada, also a deep concern. The only reason Georgia isn't, because there's not a Senate race there. But look, the reality here is, things seem to be moving in slow motion. Talking to one Democrat just shortly before lunchtime, he said, last week it seemed like this was sort of heading in one direction, and Democrats were getting around the idea of moving on. It does not seem like that at all. So, time is on President Biden's side. But look, it is a pivotal week as we've been saying.

PETE AGUILAR (D-CA): Every single member of the House Democratic Caucus is clear-eyed about what the stakes of this election are. Donald Trump cannot be allowed near the Oval Office and his extremist allies must never be allowed to pass a national abortion ban or their dangerous Project 2025, which would erode our democracy and enable Trump's worst impulses. And we've seen firsthand what the Republican majority will do if given an opportunity to govern. Chaos and confusion are the order of the day and the will of the American people is completely ignored. The extreme Republicans in charge have not passed a single bill to create one job, but they have voted to roll back thousands of clean energy jobs. They have not passed legislation to combat rising prices, but they have promised to repeal a $35.00 a month insulin guarantee for our seniors. They've not done a thing to address the situation at the border. In fact, they've killed the most significant border security bill in decades, while the policies of President Biden have brought border crossings down to pre-pandemic lows. The choice before the American people this November is moving forward with a stronger economy, lowering costs and safer streets, or the chaos and extremism of Donald Trump. Together with the Biden-Harris administration, we'll continue to increase economic opportunity in every zip code and deliver for working families. Vice Chair Lieu. REP. TED LIEU (D-CA): Thank you, Chair Aguilar. Donald Trump's campaigned on overturning Roe versus Wade. Trump then appointed extreme MAGA justices who lied to the Senate and then proceeded to overturn Roe versus Wade. And then Trump bragged about overturning Roe versus Wade. Now, Trump is trying to run away from that, but he can't. Why? Because in fact, Roe versus Wade was overturned. That's a thing. That's a fact. And millions of women have now lost rights. We also know that with Project 2025, this creepy document written by Trump's closest advisors and confidants that they want to ban abortion nationwide. Project 2025 also wants to eliminate the Department of Education and it wants to eliminate the National Weather Service. I mean, you're not going to get accurate weather forecasts anymore, you're just going to get stupid weather forecasts. I mean, this document is creepy, it's a takeover of the American form of government, and it's a collection of extreme MAGA ideas that's going to ruin our way of life. That is what is at stake this November.",

They want an imperial presidency under Donald Trump. They are not guided by the ethic standards that other judges are. I think we can start there. That has been a discussion among both sides of the -- of the Capitol dome. Let's start there.

He's going to sign it. That's the difference. That's what's at stake this election. Donald Trump would veto such a bill because Donald Trump caused Roe versus Wade to be overturned.We're also going to fix what the Supreme Court did when they overruled precedent for no good reason in what was known as Chevron case. The Supreme Court has now essentially said that, hey, judges are better than the technical experts at agencies in looking at congressional statutes. Well, guess what? Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote an entire opinion where he confused laughing gas with another kind of gas. No, judges are not better than technical experts at federal agencies. Who do these justices think they are? Did they really know biology and science and chemistry and all the things that experts need to know? No, they do not. This was a power grab for the conservative Supreme Court. And we're going to fix that if we flip the House, hold the Senate, and we keep Donald Trump out of the White House. (INAUDIBLE)",

We also have the benefit, the vice chair and I, of being from California. California is no friend of Donald Trump when it comes to politics and ideas. I benefit from having independents, we call them declined to state voters in California who registered as the fastest growing political party in the state has declined to state. And I've got a lot of those folks who are supporters and friends and overwhelmingly they want to prevent Donald Trump from being in the White House. And so, that's what I hear. I -- we hear other things too. We hear -- we hear theories and cases, and of course, you know, that's fine. But when it comes back to it, and I -- and I remind people that my focus as a -- as a -- as a leader here, is to ensure that Hakeem Jeffries becomes speaker, you know, overwhelmingly people say, oh yes, of course, like we have -- we have to do that. Like, the region, the state, the country will be better with Democrats holding gavels. I'm just convinced of that. I'm convinced of the work product that we are able to do together because of our proven track record when we are guiding these committees, what we can do, the bills that we can put in front of the president, how we can help people. That's overwhelmingly what we -- what we hear. Of course we hear different, you know, theories and different ideas about the top of the ticket.

There are pictures of him with Jeffrey Epstein. He's taken multiple plane flights with Epstein with young girls on board. He is on call logs with Epstein. One of the highest trending hashtags on Twitter right now is about Trump and Epstein. I'm not going to repeat the hashtag because we're in a dignified setting. But yes, you all might want to look at that because that's highly disturbing. And again, it shows that Donald Trump is unfit for office. And by the way, he was convicted in a civilian court for sexual assault, convicted in a separate court of 34 felonies. Donald Trump should drop out of the race.",
