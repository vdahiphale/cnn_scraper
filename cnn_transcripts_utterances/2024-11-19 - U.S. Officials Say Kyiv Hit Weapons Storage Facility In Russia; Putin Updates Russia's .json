Tonight, we begin in Ukraine with some fast-moving and potentially significant developments that could mark a dangerous new phase in this war. For the first time, Ukraine has fired U.S.-made longer-range missiles similar to those seen here. Fired them at targets inside of Russia, according to two American officials, the missiles hit a weapons arsenal. Following that attack, Russian President Vladimir Putin updated his country's nuclear doctrine to say that Moscow will now consider aggression from any non-nuclear state, but with the participation of a nuclear country, a joint attack on Russia. This comes as Ukraine marks a somber milestone, 1,000 days since Moscow's full-scale invasion. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has so far declined to confirm the attack inside Russia, but says that Ukraine does plan to maximize its use of those long-range capabilities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT, UKRAINE (through translator): Ukraine has long-range capabilities. Ukraine has long-range drones made in Ukraine. We now not only have the long Neptune missile, we now have the ATACMS, and we will use them, all of them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It was quite interesting Oren was talking a little about that attack in the Bryansk area. The Russians claiming that of the six ATACMS missiles that were fired, they were able to shoot five of those down and that the debris from one of those missiles then landed on a military installation there. They didn't say what kind of damage was caused. Now, of course, we don't know the Ukrainian side of that story. However, what we're seeing here play out in Moscow is a lot of anger and some serious steps by the Russian federation. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (ARTILLERY FIRE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): Ukraine not wasting any time striking deep into Russian territory using U.S.-supplied ATACMS surface-to-surface missiles, only days after getting the go-ahead from the Biden administration, the U.S. confirms. Ukraine's President coy when asked about the strikes. \"We now have ATACMS and we will use them\", he said. Moscow up in arms claiming Ukraine targeted military installations in southwestern Russia overnight. The Foreign Minister ripping into the Biden administration. \"The fact that ATACMS were used repeatedly tonight in the Bryansk region is of course, a signal that  they want escalation and it's impossible to use these high tech missiles without the Americans\", and Putin has spoken about this many times, and now Putin has reacted. Breaking news on Kremlin-controlled TV after the Russian President signed an order changing the country's nuclear doctrine. \"The use of western missiles for strikes into the strategic depths of Russia means direct involvement of NATO in the war\", the host says, and now Moscow's hands are untied. Among the changes, the Russians now consider attacks by non-nuclear nations like Ukraine with the help of nuclear nations like the U.S. worthy of a nuclear response, at least on paper. (on camera): The spokesman for the Kremlin says the reason why the Russians decided to update their nuclear doctrine is so potential adversaries of Russia know that retaliation will be inevitable if Russia is attacked.

That will -- significantly should reduce, especially if combined with other strikes, it should reduce the ability of Russians to accumulate forces and to prepare the forces for the battle.

Those six ATACM him long- range missiles, we understand, aimed towards the Briansk region with five, according to Moscow, stopped on route. But an important escalation from the point of view of Moscow, certainly, and that's what we've been hearing over the course of the day from Sergey Lavrov, the foreign minister, speaking on the sidelines of the G20, but of course, from the Kremlin itself in the shape of this revised nuclear doctrine, lowing the threshold for when Moscow believes it is entitled to reply to -- with its nuclear arsenal. Those threats taken seriously, but follow a pattern, of course, Erica, that we've seen over the last couple of years, the brinkmanship that has led to so many changes in the policy of the western allies supporting Ukraine. Again, this time, to your question, the United States has led the way. We understand that London and Paris have signaled their intention of making that change and allowing Kyiv to use their long-range missiles on Russian soil. It is Berlin, the most recalcitrant. And again, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, has been speaking to this again at the G20 of the fact that he believed it was a mistake and could represent an escalation too far. He's -- we've also been hearing from President Zelenskyy himself today, Erica, who's been speaking to the European Parliament about not just the fact that he hopes that 2025 will be a time for peace, but speaking to the presence of those North Korean soldiers that we understand was such an important part of the American decision to change its policy so far. President Biden made that decision on Sunday, the missiles were launched two days later. It was the presence of those North Korean troops estimated, Erica, to have been around 10,000 strong. Well, President Zelenskyy told European lawmakers today was that he believes that that presence could rise as far as 100,000.
