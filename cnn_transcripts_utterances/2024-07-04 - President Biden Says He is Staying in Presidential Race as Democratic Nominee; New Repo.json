As you noted, there are two House democratic lawmakers who have publicly called for Biden to step aside, and we're told that in a private call with a top party leadership in the House last night, some top Democrats also said it was time for the president to step aside.President Biden himself gathered about 20 Democratic governors, some joining in person, some virtually, to hear out there concerns about this campaign. But in a video call with campaign staff yesterday, President Biden stressed that he is remaining in this race until the end, and that he will not be pushed out. It does come, though, as the president has privately acknowledged, to at least one key ally that these next coming days in his campaign will be critical in trying to convince Americans to give him a second term in the White House. Part of the president's goal is taking this pitch directly to voters. He will sit down for that major interview with ABC News and also travel to battleground states like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. This morning, that new interview aired in Philadelphia, and as part of that interview, the president really tried to make a pitch to black voters who he has already struggled with pre-debate and that he argued will be in this next election. He specifically pointed to the diversity within his administration and to the Supreme Court as something voters should look at. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Imagine what it says to a young girl who is in school having trouble wondering what she can do, and look up and see a Supreme Court justice who is a black woman, or a black vice president of the United States, or a secretary in the cabinet, or a famous, famous political figure, and say, I can do it there. I can do that. I can do that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Jean-Pierre said that the president has had not.But this morning, the White House is acknowledging that President Biden was examined by his doctors following that debate night during which his team has said that the president had a cold.

One White House official says that this check-in was a brief check-in.

Town halls. They want to see that interview go well.

There was hope from the campaign that that would be the turnaround moment. And instead, it seems to have pushed at least some voters further away from Biden.And so this is not the highest topic of conversation probably for most Americans in the same way that is for most of the elected officials who are in Washington and beyond thinking about what to do here, and most of the top Democratic operatives and donors. But it is something that is clearly on the minds of a lot of Americans, whether Joe Biden is up to the job, whether he's up to the campaign, whether he's up to another term.",

Look, Joe Biden has been counted out many times before, and that is part of his self mythology at this point. And he looks back at 2016 when people, including Barack Obama, steered him out of running, and Donald Trump won. And he looks at in 2020 when he came in fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary. Everybody counted him out. He, actually, at one point thought that he might be done, and of course, rallied into Super Tuesday. Then in the election in 2020, many people thought he couldn't win against Donald Trump the way he was doing it. Obviously, he did.And so there is this sense that this might be another one of those moments. But you talk to people around the Democratic operation when it comes to top party leaders, what they say is this may be a case of him thinking that it's like every other moment when it's not like any of those moments, when it's so much more intense. And that is the question that all of them are wondering, whether Biden is going to come to a different conclusion or not.",

One of the most powerful hurricanes that I've ever seen.And the prime minister is right, we experienced the thunderstorms overnight, very powerful ones. And so even though Hurricane Beryl is now history, at least here in Jamaica, the damage, the devastation is quite a significant. I was showing you guys last hour how the powerful winds pushed the boat behind me across the bay, made it crash against the old pier here in Downtown Kingston, and as you can see now, it is sunk, and we are getting new data, new weather data about how a powerful the series of storms was. We are learning that Kingston reported wind gusts in excess of 80 miles per hour for multiple hours yesterday. Also, wind gusts near 50 miles per hour started at 1:00 PM. That situation remained for about 12 hours, imagine that, and the damage that it might have caused. And then, another significant piece of information that we got is that Kingston totaled four 4.4 inches of rain yesterday, which is more than double what they get in a typical month here. So that gives you an idea of the things that people here had to go through, not to mention that around 500 people had to go to shelters because they were displaced. That prime minister here also saying that there is significant damage to coastal areas because of the storm surges that we went through.

CNN's security correspondent, Josh Campbell is following this for us. So Josh, hello to you. You spoke with an FBI profiler about key warning signs that could help stop the next massacre. What did they say?",

So let's look at some of those threat indicators noted by the FBI. If you're seeing someone who is making comments or jokes about threats against violence, that's on the list. Someone who you see, maybe is having a particularly difficult time coping with stress, someone who might be receding into isolation, whereas once they were maybe outgoing, they were involved in activities, and now no longer so. There is also this concept of what's called the injustice collector, the grievance collector. That's someone who starts to feel like they've been slighted over and over and that builds and that builds and the bottom line, the FBI says that it is up to all of us to essentially take an interest in those around us, those that we care about. Have a listen here to one FBI behavior analysts that I spoke with. She leads one of the FBI's teams looking into this and she talked about just how critical it is that we maintain interest in our loved ones. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. KARIE GIBSON, FBI BEHAVIORAL ANALYTICS UNIT CHIEF: You have somebody who at one time in their life was functioning in a way where they were handling the stress, and now we are seeing marked changes to that. We are seeing someone who once was able to deal with different challenging situations, now absolutely struggling with that. When you have the grievance collector, you have somebody that's keeping score, that's keeping track of those slights and those humiliating events and the different factors that have impacted them, negatively and they're really using that to fuel their justification for violence.
