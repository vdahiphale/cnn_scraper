Signs of movement in the D.C. negotiations are helping boost the U.S. futures all the major U.S. stock markets are indices set for a higher open. Europe is trading mixed amid news that Eurozone inflation ticked higher again last month. Now shares of regional U.S. banks are higher pre market after key player Western alliance said deposits are on the rise again its shares set to rise some 13 percent in early trading. That's encouraging news for investors worried about the stability of America's Regional Banks. In earnings news, shares are the retail giant target set to open higher, these latest earnings beating expectations but sales are slowing as consumers spend less on non-essentials a busy show. As always, let's begin with the latest debt ceiling talk so congressional leaders left today's meeting with President Biden unable to point to any major progress on a deal to raise the debt ceiling. But they did say they've agreed on a process for getting there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Nothing has been resolved in this negotiation.

And that means somebody won't get paid social security, federal contractor interest on our debt, when presumes that would be the last thing the government wouldn't pay. But it's just a very, very dangerous game that's happening here. And that's what these CEOs have said 150 CEOs with some very, very big companies saying look, high inflation has already created stresses in our financial system, including several recent bank failures. It'd be much worse if a nation default on our debt obligations. So we know this is dangerous territory. And you will hear and I've been hearing some political people in Washington saying, well, we don't know how bad it would be, oh, maybe one or two days over the line is OK. I talked to Mark Zandi earlier this morning from Moody's Analytics who said that is not a black hole you want to jump into. It is a very dangerous situation. It has to be resolved. One of the ways they're starting to talk about resolving it here. They have this format for negotiations, Max, that's helpful here. Again, they don't have much time they have this format for negotiations, they're going to have to find a way to yes. Does that mean some caps on future spending? Or does that mean toughening some work requirements for welfare programs in United States like food stamps, specifically for people who are 50 to 56 years old, able bodied adults? Are you going to put in a 20 hour a month work requirements for those people who continue to get food stamps or Medicaid is something progressives don't want? It's something that Republicans definitely want? Where can they find yes? Where can they find that? That common ground, we're just seeing little hints of the contours here, but boy, not enough to really think that you can get this done by the final day.",

So there is a general understanding that the President has to address that because what could begin as an American problem could be a worldwide problem. And as we have seen, so many economies across the globe are just very fragile right now. I should also point out, Max, that even though he is not going to be traveling to Australia, the President will have contact with members of the so called quad that's Australia, India, Japan, and of course, the U.S. that make up the quad. They will have representatives here at the G7 meeting in some effect. So it's not as if these conversations won't happen.
