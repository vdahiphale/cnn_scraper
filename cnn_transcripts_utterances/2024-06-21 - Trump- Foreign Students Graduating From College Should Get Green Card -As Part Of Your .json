But this comment that he made on the podcast is very -- it's a contrast not only to his anti-immigrant rhetoric that he's made very central to his campaign, but it's also a contrast to the policies and restrictive immigration policies that he applied towards legal immigration during his own administration.And I think it's telling that his campaign has quickly tried to walk back some of what he said. His campaign spokesperson shortly after Trump made these comments essentially said that, well, the students would go through heavy vetting and that essentially this would not apply to people who hate America and what have you. And so it's definitely -- it does not seem like this is going to be a common feature on the campaign trail, just given what -- how his campaign has reacted in response to his most recent comments. RAJU: I mean, since you've mentioned the campaign, if you want to say clean up job, clean up job. This is what this spokesperson said in a statement after Trump said this. \"President Trump has outlined the most aggressive vetting process in U.S. history to exclude all communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters, and public charges. This would only apply to the most thoroughly vetted college graduates who would never undercut American wages or workers.\" And perhaps that response was after there was some backlash on the right. Just look at Congressman Chip Roy of Texas who tweeted, \"Wrong\" immediately after the news broke. Is Trump trying to have it both ways?",

But it is clear that it is taking place. And the one point I'm trying to convey, again through my own experiences, through the stories that I can appropriately tell consistent with attorney-client privilege and client confidence and whatever. The one point I'm trying to make is that at the end of the day, if we care about norms, we care about democratic norms that are so important to sustaining our democratic way of life. The people who have responsibility in government and politics have choices to make every day, those who write speeches, so to write campaign ads, those who give legal advice and on and on, those in government who have decisions to make about how to advance a public policy debate. They have decisions to make every single day that bear on the health of these institutions. And if all that matters is winning, by the way, a particular debate or a particular election and they're prepared to sweep aside all of those other considerations having to do with the health and robustness of our democratic norms and institutions, we're going to be in a sorry state because the people have it in their hands to really make a difference day by day will have failed us, and that is a profound concern.

The Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice has twice ruled that the president has complete immunity from prosecution as a matter of executive branch law. Complete immunity from prosecution while in office.
