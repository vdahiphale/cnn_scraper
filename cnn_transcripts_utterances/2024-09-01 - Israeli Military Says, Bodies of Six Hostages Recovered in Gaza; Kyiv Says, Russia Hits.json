This is breaking news.The latest now on what is happening in Gaza. The Israeli military says it recovered the bodies of six hostages from an underground tunnel in the Rafah area on Saturday. The IDF has now identified all six, saying their families have been notified. Israel's defense minister says the six were killed just before troops could reach them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, IDF SPOKESPERSON:  According to the initial assessment at our disposal, they were brutally murdered by Hamas terrorists a short while before we reached them. They were abducted alive on the morning of October 7th by the Hamas terror organization. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Make no mistake, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes and we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. The news had led to protests in Israel and new calls for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to a ceasefire and hostage deal. The group, Missing Families Forum, is calling for more public protests on Sunday and for Mr. Netanyahu to address the nation.

General, tell us what are you learning about this operation? MAJ. GEN. MARK MCCARLEY (RET.), U.S. ARMY:  I think what we've thus far seen which points to the recovery of the bodies of these individuals, the story itself, the pain that's associated that's now circulating amongst the friends, the family, the loved ones of those hostages who lost their lives. And what is even more difficult to comprehend is the most recent information, and that is that these hostages were very, very close to recovery and being reunited with their families only to lose their lives. And to comprehend that, to be a parent of a son or daughter or a spouse, it's just too difficult, as I've said previously, to fathom the pain associated with that. Now, certainly from a military perspective you have to make, and this is what Minister Gallant brought forth, and he clearly identified the options that are present and that at some point the prime minister will have to choose. And that is, you can either continue with the pursuit of this conflict. You can demand this corridor of sorts, this protective corridor on the south side of Gaza between Egypt and Gaza for purely military reasons. Or you can say to yourselves that there is equally and perhaps in many cases much more important needs and requirements that you've identified, and that is to bring forth a ceasefire, the release of all the hostages, and, of course, in exchange, some semblance of the opportunity to bring significant quantities of humanitarian assistance to those in need. That doesn't say that there'll be victory on either side, but this is a humanitarian crisis, and I think it's going to demand, an action on the part of the prime minister. This event in the last day or so has brought that to the forefront.",

      "sentences": "It was of no surprise to me at all because this operation, at least the manner in which Hamas has pursued its attack on Israel the most, one of its most lethal, both offensive and defensive measures, was the long-term development of this network of tunnels. It operates in the tunnels, not only from a command and control perspective, but certainly logistically, and it has certainly positioned its leadership and those who are fighting its battles within those tunnels. So, when the information comes to us that a day or so ago when this became quite clear, this loss of these hostages underground, absolutely no surprise. It would not be consistent with what Hamas has done to say that these hostages were located in any other area.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that is consistent. But at the end of the day, the most lethal systems that have been put in place by Hamas consists of the tunnel network. So, if there was intent to retain these hostages and to put them at distance from the IDF, the location would indeed be these tunnels and you can move around the tunnels to a certain degree. I'm sure that the IDF is developing some sort of network picture of the interconnection of the tunnels. So, there's a tunnel if there's a requirement and the hostages must be removed, then they go, as we've seen in a couple of instances early in the last few months. There have been hostages who have been located in buildings, but, again, the tunnels happen to be the most effective mechanism for hiding and retaining hostages in this conflict.",

We've seen real tension between U.S. President Joe Biden and the Israeli prime minister that is often, you know, boiled over into public. But how much influence does Joe Biden have over the Israeli prime minister? And could he be doing more?EL-GAMAL:  Absolutely. That's a great question. And this is one of the things that we've been talking about for months now is, has the U.S. been using all the leverage that it (INAUDIBLE) in order to get them to sign that deal. And, of course, the answer is no. The reason I say that is because the U.S. is not only Israel's greatest ally and best ally in the region, as we know, but it is also its greatest supporter in terms of military assistance, in terms of financial assistance. Much of the weaponry, in fact, the majority of it that the Israelis have been using in this war over the last ten months now has been U.S.-made. And what critics of the war have been calling on the U.S. to do is threatened to withhold some of that assistance if the Israelis continue to drag their feet on these negotiations. Now, President Biden's has been unwilling to do so. He withheld one shipment for a short while. He was heavily criticized by that, by the pro-Israel side in the U.S., and he quickly released it. But in terms of activating serious American leverage over the prime minister, we have not seen that since the start of this war, in order to get this ceasefire deal done and to get these hostages home and stop the horrible, horrible situation that we're seeing in Gaza right now. That leverage has not yet been used. And, of course, the question that everyone asks is when the stakes are so high and when there's so much death and destruction, why is the U.S. still unwilling to use its leverage to get this deal done?",

But Palestinian health officials stress that brief ceasefires will not be enough to get the job done. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOUSEF ABU AL-REESH, GAZA'S DEPUTY HEALTH MINISTER:  We call for a real ceasefire so that this campaign can really succeed because all the arrangements that have been done cannot secure its success, although our teams will go to all locations, and wherever there is a Palestinian person that is in need of this vaccine, despite the dangers.

      "sentences": "So, that's a good question. I do want to say that Netanyahu owes his political survival not simply to the far right within Israel. What you've seen over recent years is the mainstreaming of far right sentiment within parties that traditionally were not far right. And that's important because that also explains he has been able to remain for quite so long. You've had many members of his own party of Likud be very clear about their support for policies that traditionally one would have expected only to belong to the far, right, and Likud is not the far, right? So, I think that you do have to keep in mind that mainstreaming of quite extremist political opinion in the mainstream.Now, does this make his position untenable? I don't think it makes it untenable. I think it brings about more pressure, but it doesn't make it untenable, because, again, he maintains the support of a sufficient number of the Knesset members in order to continue his government. What would make his position more untenable would be actual leverage being used by the United States particularly regards to arms transfers, offensive arms transfers and protection of the U.N. Security Council. I don't expect that anytime soon. I do think that that's partly what would eventually mean that Netanyahu would have to change course and his government would come down. But, you know, we've been in this position multiple times over the past sort of nine to ten months now, where Netanyahu's position seems untenable, but actually he manages to hold it together because his allies and his rooting coalition are unwilling to let him go. And he's also willing to bend as much as possible in order to make sure that his government survives, even if it means, unfortunately, that there's an expense when it comes to policy that could bring about a ceasefire in Gaza that would save the tens of thousands of people that are suffering and, you know, tens of thousands of people who have died as a result of IDF attacks on Gaza, which I think is important for all of us to keep in mind.",

The strikes reportedly hit civilian infrastructure in the town of Sudzha, which is now held by Ukrainians.They say Moscow is, in their words, wiping the town off the map, sometimes using the so-called glide bombs.

Two people were killed there, but importantly, the Ukrainians are saying that the Russians used what's called a FAB-500 bomb with a guidance system. Now, that bomb has half a ton of explosives in it and obviously causes massive damage. The Russians also using glide bombs to attack the city of Kharkiv on Friday, killing several people there. Now, the Ukrainians are saying that they are continuing their push into Russian territory, trying to advance further into the Kursk region, but they're also saying that the Russians are using their aviation there as well to use those heavy weapons to attack Ukraine's frontline troops. All this, of course, one of the reasons why top level Ukrainian officials, including the defense minister, went to Washington, D.C., to try and convince the Biden administration to allow Ukraine to use some of the most long distance American supplied weapons to try and hit Ukraine some of Russia's airfields that they're using for their aviation. On the whole, the Ukrainians are saying they're still able to advance deeper into Russian territory, but they are on the back foot in the Donbas region on the eastern front, specifically around the city of Pokrovsk, where the Ukrainians continue to say that they're trying to hold the line, but they also acknowledge that the Russians are making slow but steady progress.

And indeed, as you saw last week, I think we find that all of the services that children and families need have been impacted by the floodwaters when they were high and now following the recession of those waters.I was in Feni at the same time as you were, and we've had teams on the ground ever since. And what we've seen is that the health facilities that children would normally go to for vaccinations were inundated with water, so they are not able to happen at the moment. The water facilities that people use to get clean water to bathe from (INAUDIBLE), we estimate that around 7,000 schools in the impacted districts are not able to function as schools. Instead, they're either acting as shelters for people who have been made homeless, or they are themselves not usable because their (INAUDIBLE) covered in water. This all means, of course, that many of the supplies that either health facilities held or schools held are no longer usable. They've all been destroyed by the high flood waters. So, UNICEF has been on the ground providing many of these supplies. We estimate to have reached around 850,000 people so far. We've provided 3.7 million water purification tablets to make sure that people have clean water to drink, 250,000 oral rehydration salt, so that as people get dehydrated, they're able to rehydrate properly. We're providing a lot of psychosocial support to families. This is, as you mentioned, the first time this has happened in almost 40 years. And so these families are absolutely devastated by the loss of their livelihoods, all of their household items. And so the mental stress that they're suffering is significant. And finally, also providing therapeutic for malnourished children, we're seeing increasing numbers of children who are suffering from malnourishment because they haven't been able to get either clean water or good food for at least the last week.",
