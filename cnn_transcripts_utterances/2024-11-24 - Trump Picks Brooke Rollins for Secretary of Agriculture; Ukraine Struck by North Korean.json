      "sentences": "President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday continued to quickly move to finalize his cabinet picks, announcing his decision for who he wants to lead the Department of Agriculture. He named Brooke Rollins, his former Policy Advisor, to that role. She is someone who, in Donald Trump's first White House, served as the Director for the Domestic Policy Council.But she also led one of the top policy tanks after her time leaving the White House. She was the president of the America First Policy Institute, one of the key shops that really began shaping Donald Trump's policy priorities and the priorities that he could take on if he were to win a second term. Now, Rollins is someone who has known Donald Trump for several years. She is viewed as someone who is very loyal to him. And she has been in close communication with the transition team ever since he won the election. Now, she was actually one of the candidates and one of the names that Donald Trump had initially been considering to serve as his White House chief of staff. However, we had reported that she had withdrew her name from consideration once it was clear that Susie Wiles, Donald Trump's 2024 campaign manager, was likely to get the role. Now, I'm told that Rollins had made it clear to Donald Trump's team that she was interested in serving in the top job in the Agriculture Department. But she also is someone who could be confronted with some controversy in that role, particularly because we know that one of Donald Trump's key policy priorities, his promise to impose sweeping tariffs on imports, could directly impact the agriculture community. We've heard many economists argue that farmers could be hit by those tariffs in a negative way. So that's one thing to keep in mind if she is confirmed to that role.

For his part, Trump said last July that he could settle the conflict in just one day, but he didn't and still hasn't provided any detail on how he'd do that.All this happening as Russia's use of North Korean missiles in the war is going stronger, it's growing. And manufacturers in the West are helping to make it possible, too. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has more. But a warning the video you're about to see is disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The scramble for the dead or the living. Horrifically commonplace in Ukraine. Yet, this series of homes in Kyiv turned to rubble by something other, not Russian, but a North Korean supplied ballistic missile. And made able to fly here to cause this barbarism, killing a man and his four-year-old son by circuitry from the United States. Ukrainian officials told CNN ballistic missile attacks by Russia were rising fast, 194 so far this year, and about a third of them, at least 60, were using North Korean KN-23s. But these crude missiles, part of growing aid as North Korean troops also come to Russia, rely on a sophistication smuggled into the hermit kingdom. One on display by Ukrainian investigators at this Kyiv warehouse of missile fragments. It is a house of horrors, drones that haunt the night skies, rockets that tear down lives. They pick through the dust to learn how the killing machines work. Here, rebuilding a Shahed Iranian drone's circuits. WALSH (on camera): Parts from a Kinzhal missile, a Shahed Iranian drone and a Russian Orlan reconnaissance drone, all things Ukraine has been subjected to for many months, but key, these North Korean KN-23 missiles rely on -- they say, on components from the United States and the Netherlands. WALSH (voice-over): This box, containing dozens of small bits of circuitry made by household names in the USA or Europe. Subject to sanctions globally, but smuggled often via China to North Korea. WALSH (on camera): When you open all this up and find American components, how do you feel? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): Like sanctions are failing. ANDRIY KULCHYTSKYI, KYIV SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF FORENSIC EXPERTISE (through translation): All the electronics are foreign. There is nothing Korean in it. The only thing Korean is the metal, which quickly rusts and corrodes. WALSH (voice-over): The journey the chips and circuits take to Russia may lead through North Korea, even China as a middleman, that, ultimately, they are U.S. Design and make. OLEKSANDR VYSIKAN, KYIV SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF FORENSIC EXPERTISE (through translation): The chips most often from the United States, but the country of manufacture can be China, Malaysia, Taiwan. However, it means that the headquarters is in the United States. WALSH (voice-over): As the toll from these missiles deepens, Ukrainian officials say the western firms need to be held accountable. From Thursday's Russian launch of a new weapon to their growing use of purloined North Korean missiles, the global reach of this war grows. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, Kyiv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

He is -- he had gone missing on Thursday, and it was reported by his family to authorities in the UAE, who then quickly started searching for him along with Mossad and other Israeli agencies.There was a real concern late last night that terrorism was involved. And with the discovery of his body, of course, those worst fears have been realized. The government here, the Prime Minister's Office, saying that this is a heinous act of anti-Semitic terrorism, and the government will use all its resources, all means to bring those responsible to justice within the use of the law. So this is being taken very seriously here, but also taken as a reminder for Israeli citizens and the Jewish community more broadly around the world that anti-Semitism is on the rise. And in particular, in the case of the UAE, the Israeli government has reissued its warning to citizens not to go there unless it's really necessary, and telling those Israeli citizens there and Jewish community members that they should avoid gathering in business and leisure environments where typically the Jewish and Israeli community do gather. So that's a very, very clear warning. His wife, who is Rabbi Zvi Kogan's wife, is an American citizen, and she is the niece of another Chabad rabbi who was, along with his wife, murdered in a terrorist attack in Mumbai, in India, back in 2007. So this Chabad community is no stranger to this sort of terrorism. But, of course, it sends real levels of concern among the Jewish community worldwide, and this commitment by the Israeli government to find the perpetrators and bring them to justice within the reach of the law.",

It's been known that before 2025, a new climate finance target was due to be negotiated. And the demands were placed very clearly on the table by the developing countries, asking for $1.3 trillion, the majority of which about $600 billion should come from public money from the governments, the government budgets of developed countries.But what we have here in Baku is an astonishing disappointment. We see a commitment of $300 billion as a part of a larger mobilization of a $1.3 trillion vague target. But the $300 billion may not just come from country governments. It's expected that other sources like the private sector and multilateral development banks may play a role. So there's a lot less predictability and certainty that these funds will flow to developing countries. So this is, I would say, a historic moment. But it's a historic moment of disappointment, because we have been waiting for this for a long time. And essentially, it locks us in for the next 10 years to what is essentially an inflation adjusted sum of money equivalent to the previous goal of $100 billion up until 2035. FOSTER: There'll be many in developed countries who'll be saying, you know, this is a tough time for them. The cost-of-living crisis, economies are shrinking. In America, there isn't the same focus on climate now. We have a Trump administration coming in, many would argue.

But the issue for us as educators is ensuring that we have educator voice in what happens in our schools. We want people to pass curriculums and make sure that we are doing the best for our students, listening to people that are actual experts in what happens in our schools.And this is not happening right now in Texas. The other thing is that this is being incentivized. And our school districts did not get money from the legislature last year. And this is one way where they can get money. So it's also being sort of like they're being bullied into using this curriculum.",

So you set that bar and then you win seven of the first ten races this year.So the frustrations that he and Red Bull have felt in recent months are certainly real. But in the end, all that matters is how things end. And it was a spectacular night for the second edition of the Las Vegas Grand Prix. Some 300,000 fans soaking up all the glitz and glamour that the Strip had to offer in Vegas across the weekend. And for Verstappen, the goal was simple. Cross the line before Lando Norris and the title is yours. And that's just what he did with a very steady performance throughout. For Verstappen, starting and finishing in fifth. His friend and rival Norris right behind him in sixth. And there were all the fist pumps and the hugs, the champagne celebrations all around as the 27-year-old in the end became just the sixth driver to win the driver's championship four times. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAX VERSTAPPEN, WON 4TH STRAIGHT DRIVERS' CHAMPIONSHIP: As a team, you know, we kept it together. We kept working on improvements. And yeah, we pulled over the line. I mean, got to be proud of everyone, what they have done for me. And, you know, to stand there as a four-time world champion is, of course, something that I never thought was possible. So yeah, at the moment, just feeling relieved in a way, but also very proud. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
