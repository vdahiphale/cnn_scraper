You see the tweet there.The airfield is operating normally but some terminals, traffic lights and other systems may not have power. Our teams are working on the issue with DWP now. Follow us for additional updates. Now, that tweet continues to say that due to that power issue, TSA has stopped screening passengers in most terminals. So, if you have to fly today out of LAX, they're asking you to allow extra time here. Crews are responding as quickly as possible to restore all the systems. And the airport says that most of the terminals are impacted by the loss of power, that some departing flights may be impacted due to no power, to jet bridges, and, again, to please allow extra time and check flight status as the airport teams learn more. Now, in just checking the department of transportation's national air space system status online, I'm looking at the number of active airport events that they have listed. So far, LAX is not listed on here. There are, of course, other issues at other airports around the country, some of them weather related like de-icing. But so far, perhaps it's just happened so quickly that it hasn't updated yet. But thus far, what we know so far is just from LAX officials themselves putting out that notice that if you are going to fly out today, that you will need to allow for extra time because TSA has stopped screening passengers in many of the terminals. There are seven terminals there at LAX. You're looking at that image of World Way. It goes around in a loop that way. And so there could be some issues that we will definitely be following to see if they can resolve this power issue, Wolf.",

Contradictions between the video of the fatal beating and the initial police report have prosecutors looking into further charges, including charges of false reporting and that police account for every other officer and fire department personnel at the scene. Personnel files for the five former Memphis police officers charged in Nichols' death show several received written reprimands or short suspensions for violating department policies, including Demetrius Haley who received a written reprimand in November of 2021 for failing to document his role in the detention of a suspect who said she suffered a dislocated shoulder as she was arrested, and Desmond Mills Jr., who received a written reprimand in 2019 for failing to document the use of physical force during an arrest.

They were there on behalf of the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York, who has been investigating Santos' finances. And Osthoff told CNN last month that this was years ago, during a very tough point in Osthoff's life that Santos helped raise around $3,000 on a GoFundMe, again, for this life-saving surgery, but became uncooperative when it came time to collect that money. And not long after that, Osthoff's dog died. Take a listen to some of how Osthoff responded when we all talked about this last month.

They had won the Super Bowl in Tampa, the seventh of his Super Bowl wins after six in New England the year before that. And they lost in the playoff last season to the Rams in a close game and the Rams went on to win the Super Bowl.So, up until this year, he was still elite among the elite. He fell back a little bit this year. The team around him was not quite as good.

Manning went to four Super Bowls, won two, Tom went to ten and won seven. Now, the player that Tom Brady grew up idolizing in the San Francisco area is Joe Montana. Montana's 49ers went to four Super Bowls, they won them all. Montana was the MVP in three of the four Super Bowls. And in those Super Bowls, he threw 11 touchdown passes and not a single interception. But by -- so if you're just comparing let's say Brady in the regular season to Manning, you've got an argument. In terms of accomplishment per game to Montana in the Super Bowl, you've got an argument. But in terms of overall volume, the 23 seasons, the ten Super Bowls, the seven Super Bowl wins, the nod has to go to Brady as the most accomplished quarterback, no question about that.

They actually believed they had sufficient evidence. They were wary of some of the political factors that would come with an indictment of Donald Trump. They also believe that because Donald Trump had done so many other things since the hush money payments, including January 6, which had just happened, it ultimately decided not to charge. And it is fascinating to me that now in 2023 them had India is looking at the collecting evidence, including talking to Michael Cohen who it is up to them whether they trust him.
