Back here in the U.S. right now, former president Donald Trump is set to speak at a rally in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania. Trump is on the campaign trail after weeks of struggling to adapt to Vice President Kamala Harris entering the race. Allies and advisers pushing him to focus on their policy differences as the former president, though, continues to focus on personal attacks.CNN's Danny Freeman is joining us on the ground in Pennsylvania. Danny, a packed crowd -- a packed house there behind you. What can we expect from tonight's rally?",

And just to note, this particular arena is actually filling out quite a bit here. It's like you said, a packed rally here at this arena. But the big question in terms of what we can expect is, will former president Trump stick to script? Will he be able to actually stick to the message of going after Vice President Kamala Harris on crucial issues of the economy, of crime, immigration?Like you noted, Jessica, this has been something that Trump's campaign and his advisers and his allies over the course of the entire week have pleaded with him both publicly and privately to do, to stay on message, to hone these attacks against Vice President Harris. But there have been many distractions throughout the week. One, of course, has been focusing on his older opponent, President Joe Biden, quite a lot throughout the week. Another issue has been being distracted by crowd sizes and then there was even just in the past 48 hours this issue of saying that the Presidential Medal of Freedom, this is something former president Trump said is, quote, \"actually much better than the Medal of Honor.\" The Medal of Honor, of course, awarded to service members who have shown extreme valor in the line of duty,. Now, but let's get back to where we are right here, Jessica, because, you know Pennsylvania well. We're in northeastern Pennsylvania in Wilkes-Barre in Luzerne County, a more broadly, I should say. And Luzerne County is very important because it's one of these spots that went for former president Obama twice and then went for former president Trump twice. This area of northeastern Pennsylvania, really the heart of former president Trump's base. So if he has any hope of carrying the great commonwealth right here, he's going to have to drive up numbers in this exact spot. And that's what we're looking to see if he's able to hone these messages to really energize his base right here -- Jessica.",

You know, they brought inflation down to the lowest level in three years. We've got the most robust growth we've had in decades.We've got, you know, the stock market, you know, really burgeoning. We've got retail sales high. We've got manufacturing coming back. You know, we've created more jobs, 15 million jobs than any presidency in recent memory. I think they've got a lot to be proud of, especially when you remember four years ago this economy was tanking. People were hoarding toilet paper. People were being laid off from their jobs by hundreds of thousands a week. Small businesses were collapsing by tens of thousands a week. The GDP was contracted. So I think there's a lot to be proud of, a lot to build on, but obviously Kamala Harris is going to have her own ideas about which aspects of the economy she wants to focus on in particular, and I think she laid some of that out just a few days ago and I think that's something to work with and be very proud of.",

We've got to focus on building more affordable housing all across America, and to hear the presidential candidate, presidential nominee of my party, laid that out in specific terms was a very welcome policy plank.

There's no doubt about it based on the numbers where they were when President Biden was still in this race and where they are now. What do you think is the message that voters most want to hear from her right now as we head into this Democratic National Convention, which frankly, she's going to be introducing herself in a way to a lot of voters who know who she is, but maybe don't really know her?",

Whether or not it would be larger is certainly something that is really unclear at this point in time.I think there's several things, though, that we can discern from what we're hearing in Tehran, but also in general in the region as well. The Iranians appear to want some sort of coordinated response, coordinated retaliation. That would mean obviously them at the very least Hezbollah as well and possibly some of the groups that are allied with Iran in the region, for instance, in Iraq. Now that does not mean that such a response would be simultaneous, that would happen at the same time. It could be a different points in time, but certainly the vibe that we're getting here from Iran is right now they have that revenge or retaliation is still very much on the table. They have not said when, where, and how but one of the things that they do say is they do believe that they have the means for a crushing blow. And it was quite interesting because you were mentioning that retaliation last time that it was pretty big.

My personal opinion about the Chinese economy, which is the big one we're really hitting tariffs with, increase the pain even higher until they come to the table and then get rid of all these tariffs. Because that's really what we need is a fair-trade agreement with China that's reciprocal. Access to their markets, access to their litigation, access to policy and I.P. control. We don't have that.

You see the blast there.Russia says Ukraine likely used U.S.-made HIMARS rockets in this attack. Potentially the first time such rockets have been used to hit inside the Kursk region. Let's discuss now with retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, Mark Hertling. Always good to have you on, sir. Thanks for joining me. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Great to be with you, Jim. Great afternoon for you.",

Of course, we don't have any reason, based on a track record, for taking Russia at its word. But there has been concern among some U.S. officials about the use of U.S. weapons for attacks inside Russian territory. This goes back months to the start of the war. Are those concerns warranted in your view?",

      "sentences": "They are not, in my view, Jim. And what we're talking about is the use potentially of U.S. weapons, which I agree with, in a tactical fight against military targets, a bridge that was being used to resupply Russians as they we're trying to counterattack against the Ukrainians that went into Kursk.Not a strategic target, not something like an apartment building or a school or a hospital that Russia has hit so many of inside of Ukraine to cause civilian casualties, infrastructure damage, against a violation -- it is a violation of the laws of land warfare. So what we're told talking about is using tactical weapon systems, not strategic systems and long-range, to contribute to what Ukraine is trying to accomplish on the battlefield. And that is to stop Russia from continued invasion and continued criminal activities against Ukrainian soil. Now, you can say that that's a nuanced approach, and it is. But what we're seeing is Ukraine is applying force on a battlefield to counter the kinds of attacks that they've been susceptible to by Russian forces from a safe position across the border inside of Russia. So they're striking not only bridges. It's stopping reinforcements, but also airfields, radar sites, and the kind of military targets that the U.S. military would call -- we call deep strikes. And at the same time, you've got to remember, if this is a U.S. weapon system that Ukraine is using, we have to remind ourselves that Russia is using Iranian drones massively. They're using North Korean artillery and rockets. And of course, some other equipment supplied by other members of their alliances.",

So let's talk about goals here, because this is clearly not a raid, right, not a quick cross-border raid where they come across, do some damage and go back.And we're coming up on two weeks here. What is the goal, in your view? Is it to take and hold territory, if it can, right? I mean, it's difficult to hold territory inside Russia. They don't have the defensive positions lined up yet, the trenches dug, et cetera. But is the goal to take and whole territory, do you believe, to present the possibility of an exchange for Russian-held territory in Ukraine?",

There was too much forces to be in a raid and they were planning on staying there a long time? It could be a demonstration, first of all, that they can do it. But it had a strategic purpose to it. And the strategic purpose was to strike targets that are -- that are contributing to Russian assaults inside of Ukraine. Like I said, the airfields, the radar sites, the EW sites. Could it also be used to -- as a potential bargaining chip eventually? To show Russia, hey, you're not going to get away with saying we're just going to take your territory and end this war. You know, now Ukraine has a tit for tat, if you will. And they also have the capability to further embarrass not only Mr. Putin but also the Russian military that doesn't seem to be able to defend itself in these kinds of offenses. SCIUTTO: Yes, and those electronic warfare sites, Q2, because Russia has had some success in neutralizing some of those Ukrainian weapons systems.
