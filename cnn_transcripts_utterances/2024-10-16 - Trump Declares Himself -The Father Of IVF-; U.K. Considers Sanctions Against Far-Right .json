It's still not enough, according to the United Nations and other nonprofit organizations involved in this relief effort, but it does show that the Israelis are taking the American pressure seriously. Whether or not they take it as seriously as the United States is demanding is an entirely different question, because we saw in this letter, the United States is calling for some very, very specific and actionable steps to be taken by the Israeli government including 350 trucks per day going into Gaza through all four crossings opening a fifth crossing. There's just a slew of demands here. And what's different about this demand by the United States which certainly isn't the first one that we have seen from then regarding humanitarian aid is that it is also tying a potential consequence. And that consequence is being laid out quite clearly in terms of potentially withholding future military aid to Israel, not supplying certain weapons to Israel as a result of Israel not doing enough on the humanitarian aid front. So, you know, the Israelis are clearly taking this seriously. Whether they will actually comply with all of those steps remains to be seen.",

So I think it depends on what they're trying to achieve. Since they've taken the nuclear target off and the oil targets. I think that means they're not going after a strategic -- after a strategic outcome or an economic outcome, so it's military. I would assume that they would go after ballistic missile launcher sites, launchers, production facilities, things like that, which represent probably the greatest threat that Israel -- I'm sorry, that Iran presents to Israel, which is long-range ballistic missiles.

But otherwise, there's a prescription on doing that. But, look, I'm really troubled by it for a number of reasons. First of all, the fact the impact would have on those Americans that were targeted would be number one. Number two would my concern that would -- it would break the bonds and the trust between the United States military, which is less than one recent of the population and the other 330 some million Americans. It would break that bond between the military and the civilians they serve and protect. And then third, I'd be very concerned about the institution of the military. It's remaining apolitical and it's not getting involved in domestic matters such as this.

They were very wealthy. They lived in Beverly Hills. And that wasn't available during the trial. So that right there could be very, very strong. But we cannot forget what the jury convicted on. This was a premeditated murder, according to what the jurors said. The brothers talked for a long time that they wanted to kill their parents, figuring out how they were going to do it. They went to go get a gun in Beverly Hills. They couldn't get it. They went to Orange County, California. There was a waiting period. That didn't work. So they drove to San Diego County, which is about three hours away from Beverly Hills. They bought the shotguns. They had them in their car. They planned it out. The parents were watching TV one night on the sofa in the living room. They came in and they literally blew their heads off.  And when the mother they thought was still alive, they just plummeted her with even more bullets. And that brings up one point before we end. I've got to tell you this. There's two life sentences here, right? One life sentence is for the father. The other one is for the mother. Now, they said they killed their mother because she knew about it. In reading this letter, there's a point where he talks about his mother and he says, you know, I'd really like to talk to my mother about this, but she tells my dad everything and I just don't think I can trust that we could keep it in confidence. Did the mother actually know what was happening? So there's two sentences the judge is going to have to look at here.
