SpaceX's largest most powerful rocket ever gets off the launch pad, then blows up just minutes into its mission. Plus, Mike Lindell learns the hard way, don't offer to write checks, your conspiracies can't cash. Mediators, order the election denier to give an expert $5 million for debunking Lindell's election lies.And an IRS agent says he can blow the whistle on Hunter Biden investigation. The allegations are both unproven and stunning that the president's team is mishandling the investigation into his son, that the Attorney General Merrick Garland lied to Congress. Up first though, SpaceX starship rocket exploding in midair. 33 engines see them there. 33 engines fired at full force to get that unmanned 400-foot-tall behemoth off the ground. SpaceX calls that a win. But the mission was at least a partial miss. Starship broke apart just minutes into its flight. It was supposed to separate from its booster, it didn't. It was supposed to leave Earth's atmosphere, it didn't. It was supposed to make a near full lap in orbit around the Earth, it very clearly didn't. Let's get straight to CNN's Ed Lavandera. He's live for us in Texas near the launch site. And this is critical to the plans by NASA to get back to the moon. What are they saying today about will that be delayed and what went wrong?",

But clearly a lot of work needs to happen still. But for several minutes, the exhilaration of that rocket clearing the launch pad, been in flight for several minutes, the thunderous roar of that rocket ship was absolutely stunning for the thousands of people who gathered here on the southern shores of South Padre Island to be five miles away from the launch of this rocket system. And as you mentioned, it did not make it into orbit. It did not make almost a full orbit of the Earth crashing in the Pacific Ocean around Hawaii. That did not happen. Remember several days ago, Elon Musk was saying and trying to prepare and lowering expectations to the point where we thought we were going to see an epic fireworks explosion on the launch pad. So that did not happen.And Elon Musk tweeted shortly after the rocket launch saying that the SpaceX officials and the team learned a lot and that they will regroup and get back to launching another test rocket in the months ahead. So, a rather quick timeframe on their turnaround to be able to get back on the launch pad once again. So, officials here say, we're the SpaceX officials, hopeful and confident with what they have learned. Many people here in the space world saying that this is a good first step. Even though you saw that dramatic explosion. I can tell you, John, it was incredibly dramatic. As we saw the smoke trail moving east out over the Gulf of Mexico waters. It was shortly after we heard another thunderous explosion. And we thought that that might be the point where the booster was separating from the rocket. Clearly that's not what happened. It was the explosion. John?",

So, let's tap on that test pilot experience, in the sense that when you test a new fighter jet, or you're testing something new in the weapons sector, you tend to do that in private, you do it on an air force base. So, you know, nobody is watching you. I mean, the experts are watching. But the public's not watching.So, the public sees this player. How important is it then you heard that lay out the timetable. Elon Musk saying in his tweet, he thinks that in a matter of months, they could have test number two. In terms of the timetable to get man back to the moon, which of course is a steppingstone to eventually try to get man to Mars. How important is it that they quickly get to round two? Even if to echo your point, they haven't some additional setbacks, more learning curve, if you will.",

So, we have people going to the moon late next year, early 2025, which is great. And we have using that same Artemis rocket to take people to the surface of the moon and the flight after that. But this vehicle starship, it's the one that we want to use long term because the cost will be so much lower for going to the moon and back. But this was not a surprise to anybody in the business.I think everyone was sort of delightfully surprised today, because they got so far into the profile that gave them a chance to test and learn so many different systems, that when they do that next test in a few months that Elon is talking about, they will have -- they're not just guessing, they will know the things that failed. And so, it gives them a much higher probability of even greater success next time. You got to remember the Wright brothers, you know, the first people ever fly a powered vehicle. They crashed a lot too. In 1908, five years after they first flew, they crashed really badly, and Orville was almost killed in the accident. So, early test flying, you know, it may be fun to watch, but it serves a really important purpose. And today we got a long ways down the road towards learning how to make this spaceship as successful as we all want it to be.",

And this man, Robert Seidman, a cybersecurity expert who actually voted for Trump took Mike Lindell up on it, because he thought there would be something legitimate there.Well, he goes through the data, he realizes this is bogus. And then he goes to arbitration as the contract requires and sues Mike Lindell. And so, now we are learning that this arbitration panel said, you're right, this data is nonsense.

You always hang up on me, that's also kind of offensive.I think that it's -- there's a level of satisfaction in seeing people actually have to pay some price whether monetarily or otherwise for what happened, both during the election and in the weeks and months afterwards. I think it's probably not nearly significant enough to have a tangible effect on to your point the people who believe otherwise. I think the reality remains that the person who led the vast majority of this and led the drive towards insurrection is still the leading presidential candidate and almost bury by a wide margin in 2024.

This playing out as the court heads into overtime on a very significant major case. The justices put two more days on the calendar on the clock to consider medication abortion question that could have enormous impact on abortion access.

The court has until then, to settle questions raised by lower court rulings about the FDA authority and about how or if women can get abortion inducing pills. The government warns and adverse decision, could let judges substitute politics for cold hard science on not just mifepristone, but on drugs designed to cure all manner of ailments (Ph). There's also this new wrinkle. A drug maker that makes the generic version of mifepristone has now sued the government, sued the FDA to keep its version on the market.

It's unusual, SCOTUSblog put it this way. The court's extension of its administrative stay is unusual. That suggests that exchanges are ongoing between the justices.
