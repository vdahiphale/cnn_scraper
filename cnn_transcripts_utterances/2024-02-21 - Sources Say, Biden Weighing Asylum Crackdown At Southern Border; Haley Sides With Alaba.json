CNN has learned President Biden is now considering a new response to the immigration crisis, similar to a very controversial action attempted by then President Trump.Also breaking, Republican Presidential Candidate Nikki Haley declares that she believes embryos are babies, siding with a stunning decision by the Alabama Supreme Court. We're tracking all the fallout from the ruling as a major provider is now pausing in vitro fertilization treatments in Alabama, fearing prosecution. And defiant House Republicans are trying to push the Biden impeachment inquiry forward, grilling the president's brother behind closed doors despite the very damning indictment of a former FBI informant accused of getting bogus dirt on the Bidens from the Russians. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get right to the breaking news, President Biden now weighing new executive action to address the immigration crisis. That's a huge concern for many Americans at the southern border and beyond. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is over at the White House. She's got details. Priscilla, what are you learning?",

And the way that they're considering doing this is invoking an authority in immigration law between the ports of entry. Therefore, this would apply to migrants who are crossing the border unlawfully.Now, an administration official telling me that many options are being evaluated at the White House and no final decision has been made. In a statement, a White House spokesperson saying the following, quote, no executive action, no matter how aggressive, can deliver the significant policy reforms and additional resources Congress can provide and that Republicans rejected. We continue to call on Speaker Johnson and House Republicans to pass the bipartisan deal to secure the border. What the White House is referring to there, of course, is that Senate border compromise that was tanked by Republicans. And in that compromise that included extraordinary powers for the homeland security secretary to shut down the border. This appears to be an extension of that. While it's unclear what the details are, the White House clearly taking a tougher position on the border and one that President Biden welcomed over the course of these negotiations. Though, of course, Wolf, we should also note here that former President Donald Trump also tried to invoke a very similar authority during his time in office, trying to shut down the border entirely to asylum seekers. He was ultimately challenged in court and that effort was blocked.",

But what the White House is trying to make clear is that nothing quite equates to what would be in legislation because this action, if the White House moves forward with it, will likely also be challenged in court, and the president making clear that he is open to shutting down the border. Take a listen to what he said last month. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: It would also give me as president, the emergency authorities shut down the border until it could get back under control.

So, you know, as he was weighing decisions, at least during my time there, he was really serious about ensuring that we were protecting the right for people to come illegally, I should say. Now, in terms of what to do with people who arrive illegally, you know, he was always looking for the best way to stem some of the flow to the border. And I think what they're trying, I would imagine, assuming that this, if they decide to move forward with this reporting that Priscilla was talking about, you know, what they're really trying to do here is drive the contrast between Republican inaction and Democratic action. And we saw this work successfully in the special election in New York this past week, or last week, rather. We saw a Democrat really take on this message aggressively.

Number one, they just finished arguing that they needed legislation to do anything. Well, that's obviously not true. And, number two, if you could take executive action today, why didn't you do it for the last three years? And so I really do think they're sort of scrambling and responding to a massive political problem but I think they may be creating more by essentially admitting that their argument on the legislation was false and that they've been sitting on their hands or making it worse for the last three years.",

One, he potentially could look at using his emergency -- National Emergencies Act, emergency power authorities. Another possibility is there's a provision in immigration law, it's called Section 212F, that would limit the entry of individuals deemed to be detrimental to the interest of the United States. So, we'd have to see exactly what he hangs his hat on in an executive action. But, Wolf, I can guarantee you that if he relies on executive authority, it's going to be challenged in the courts. And so the justification that is used in the executive order, whether they try to tie it to fentanyl trafficking, for example, or they try to track it to the limited ability to detain individuals and a lack of resources and places to put people when they come over the border, they'd have to find something that would be able to stand up in court because it absolutely will be challenged.",

And reproductive rights advocates are warning that this will have huge implications on IVF going forward, making it less accessible, making it more costly, that it could skyrocket liability costs, that if an embryo, as we're seeing here from the Alabama Supreme Court, equals a child and destroying one could open them up to a lawsuit, well, that could force would-be parents to pay fees to store embryos, even embryos that they don't want for the remainder of their life or beyond.

I can understand why this is being sort of lumped in with the abortion debate because it's certainly under the umbrella of reproductive rights. But, again, politically, the people, the families who are seeking IVF are not broken down into political boxes the way abortion can usually be broken down. People seeking IVF are Democrats, they're Republicans. Many are pro-life, many are pro-choice. There are Trump voters, there are Biden voters. So, it's politically unclear where voters are going to come down on this issue. So, for now, she's speaking personally, but I imagine she'll have to get a lot more specific as she's asked this question, I'm sure, over and over and over again about those very real implications and where she comes down on the law itself.",

And so for Nikki Haley, as she has to clarify this comment or expound on what her own personal belief would mean for her policy if she were president, she is going to have to explain whether that means under a Haley presidency, IVF, you know, whether there would be protections for IVF if she considers them babies. This gets into really a space that we've seen over the last couple of years, since the fall of Roe, has been really, really motivating for, again, Democrats, independents and some Republican voters, particularly women and particularly suburban women who don't want to see the government tell them what they can and can't do with their bodies.

So, he's very unclear in his messaging. And you hear from pro-life Republicans that they are a little disappointed in his messaging and not really committing to what they believe they elected him to do and getting those three judges on the court to do, which they successfully did.
