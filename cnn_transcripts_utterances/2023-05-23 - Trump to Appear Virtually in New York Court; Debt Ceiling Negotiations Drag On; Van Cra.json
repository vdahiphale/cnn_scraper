And it does present a fairly disturbing picture of his intentions, at least. According to a law enforcement source who spoke to CNN's Josh Campbell, the suspect exited the vehicle after it had crashed into that security barrier at the White House with a Nazi flag on him. The suspect -- the suspect, when interviewed by law enforcement, according to our source, said that he did want to kidnap and harm President Biden. Authorities are now considering what role that mental health may have played in this episode. The suspect is identified as Sai Varshith Kandula, 19 years old, from Chesterfield, Missouri. He has been arrested for a myriad of charges here, and I will name them for you, threatening to kill, kidnapped, or inflict harm on the president or vice president, assault with a dangerous weapon, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, destruction of federal property, and trespassing. This incident occurred only about 200 yards away from the White House. The suspect, according to witnesses, rammed a U-Haul truck into a security barrier, then pulled back and rammed it into it again. Then he exited the vehicle, according to our law enforcement source, with a Nazi flag on him, and, when interviewed at the scene, said he wanted to kidnap and/or harm President Biden. Now, the president, of course, we have just said, was in no danger, according to the Secret Service. But the Secret Service is not really giving much detail at all about whether they tried to move President Biden around or any security measures that they might have taken to protect the president last night. We can tell you that the suspect is likely to make a court appearance this afternoon in this courthouse behind me, U.S. district court here in Washington -- Jim.",

But all that we have really seen from the White House so far since that meeting is these negotiators heading up to Capitol Hill to meet with their Republican counterparts. Now, negotiators have been up there meeting for around two hours on the Hill, as they're trying to work out some of these differences, the very vast differences that remain when it comes to trying to reach an agreement. As Manu laid out, we know one of the items that the White House has proposed is freezing spending levels at the current year's level, something that Republicans have opposed. Also, the president has pushed for raising new revenue, including taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans. That is also something that Republicans have called a nonstarter. But, really, at this moment, one of the main challenges for both sides is trying to find some room for compromise. You heard yesterday in those Oval Office remarks the president said that they will need to come to an agreement that they can then sell to their members, Democrats and Republicans. And that is one of the issues arising in these negotiations. The president has stressed that Republicans also need to be making some concessions.

Tens of billions of dollars of military pay is scheduled to go out. And also, around that time, Medicare provider payments are going to go out.

He can talk about anything that's kind of publicly known about the case already. But this protective order says that Trump can't reveal any material that they have received from the prosecution. That could include grand jury minutes. It could be witness testimony. Anything that the prosecution turns over, Trump cannot use and post on social media. And there's also restrictions about what Trump can -- what kind of evidence he can see.
