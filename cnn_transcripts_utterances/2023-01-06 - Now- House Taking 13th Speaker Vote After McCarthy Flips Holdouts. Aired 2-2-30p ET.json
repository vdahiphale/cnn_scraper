The 13th ballot has started. The big question, of course, can Kevin McCarthy, who finally came in first, although not with enough votes to become speaker, can he pick up any more votes he needs? We're not sure whether it's three or four, I believe it's four more votes to become Speaker of the House from his 213 total right now. Can he get any of these seven holdouts to change? Right now, there is obviously a huge effort going on, as Dana Bash says arm twisting. Also, I'm sure it's some encouragement in terms of reelection races and from committee posts and every possible tool at their disposal. I'm told Congressman Patrick McHenry of North Carolina who is a Kevin McCarthy deputy is doing yeoman's work out there trying to convince some of these reluctant individuals. There's Congressman Barr who is one of the big flippers. And we'll see what happens. I am not hearing right now of any news from my sources about any potential flips, but I guess for the McCarthy camp, I hope springs are turning.",
