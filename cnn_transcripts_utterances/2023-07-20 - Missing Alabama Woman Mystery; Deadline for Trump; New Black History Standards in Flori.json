It's an odd thing to say about a group whose labor went uncompensated for generation upon generation. Here are some of the other examples we have, we can put them up on the screen, of things that are involved in this curriculum. One of them is the teaching of the Ocoee Massacre. Teachers are required to mention acts of violence perpetrated by African Americans. Similar standards are applied to other massacres, the Tulsa Massacre, the Atlanta Race Riot, Rosewood Massacre. And I want to be clear, these are all cases of violent armed mobs of white people attacking black Americans, and yet these standards say you have to talk about acts of violence perpetrated by blacks. They're also not required to teach African American history past reconstruction to elementary and middle school students. And they omit the fact that Florida, in 1957, the legislature passed a resolution opposing the Brown v. Board, landmark decision by the Supreme Court that ended legal segregation in public education.
