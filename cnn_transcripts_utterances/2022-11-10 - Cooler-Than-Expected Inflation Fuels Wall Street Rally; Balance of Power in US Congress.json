      "sentences": "Hold on to your hats. We've got the biggest rally of the year and away and what a rally it is, too. Look at thebig board. The Big Board is up over a thousand points. The best of the day, three and a third percent. And if you factor it out, as we'll show you at the Dow and all the others later, that you really see the big gains. The triple stack is even more impressive. The NASDAQ is up over six percent, and if you want to know why, well the markets and the main events they are one and the same. US inflation has slowed to 7.7 percent. It's the first real glimmer that prices may have peaked. On the other hand, a crypto currency giant is teetering on the brink of collapse. FTX is on its way out. And John Kerry, US climate envoy tells us he hopes the US and China can restart climate talks soon. Obviously, with the market in such buoyant mood, we are at the New York Stock Exchange today. Thursday, November the 10th. I'm Richard Quest, and here at the NYSE, I most definitely in business. Well, you know that saying about swallows and summers, well, today Wall Street is surging, and the US dollar is down. Are these signs that the battle of inflation may have turned a corner? That's what we need to get to grips with tonight. The three major indices are all up very sharply and have held their gains on the inflation number. CPI rose only 0.4 percent in October. That's month-on-month. Year-on-year, it is 7.7 percent. Both figures cooler than expected. Everything points to inflation falling from the June peak of 9.1 percent, and that suggests, although that 300 basis points of interest rate rise is finally doing its job. The cost of food, energy, and shelter, they continue to rise in October. Accommodation including rent hasn't climbed sharply in one month since 1990, which does suggest we might be missing something here. Food and energy are no longer rising as fast as they were, and if you're adding groceries, they were the smallest amount since last December. So used cars and truck prices fell sharply, down 2.4 percent, the sign of COVID era supply chains, unwinding, with airfares, clothing, and medical supplies all declining, too. Matt Egan is with me in New York. Is this the canary in the mine of good news?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wall Street certainly thinks it is, right, investors have been desperate for signs that inflation is finally chillingout, and it looks like we did get it. You know, it is funny because at any other point other than this year, if you had a 7.7 percent increase in consumer prices year-over-year, I think you would have a thousand point move for the Dow going the other way, but everything is relative, right? So this is an improvement. It is much cooler than that nine percent inflation reading in June, and some of the economists that I've been talking to, they are really encouraged by the fact that month-over-month, core inflation basically got cut in half and that was not expected. And we did see these price declines for airfare and apparel, and you mentioned used cars which was a big one. Moody's economist, Mark Zandi, he told me that this does seem to show that inflation is definitively moderating and he thinks inflation will be much lower a year from now as long as we don't see a lot more lockdowns in China over COVID, and as long as oil prices don't go crazy. But Richard you know, this move by Wall Street is pretty dramatic. I mean, a six percent increase for the NASDAQ. I mean, you can go through a whole month and not see a six percent increase and we're seeing it all in one day. Some people are worried that maybe that's a little bit overdone. The Former New York Fed President Bill Dudley, he told me, look this is just one report. He said it does lower the risk of the Fed raising by 75 basis points next month, but he said the jobs market still remains way too hot.",

They do their balloting largely by mail, and it takes them often a couple of weeks to count them all. It is when the margins are this close that people really notice, and the laws are different in Arizona and Nevada. In Arizona, all ballots need to be in by Election Day. They needed to have arrived by last Tuesday to count. You're correct,. In Nevada, now, the law is that if the ballots are postmarked by Election Day, if they arrive before Saturday, they will be counted. The thing people need to know is that the law -- these are the laws and so the ballots that are being counted now are every bit as valid as the ones that were counted a month ago before Election Day are the ones that were counted on Tuesday.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  About 1,200 kilometers south of the Chilean capital of Santiago sits the quaint waterfront city of Castro. The area is known both for its cultural and natural splendor. And this group from around the world comes filled with anticipation. But they are not here as tourists. They've come to mark a milestone occasion. Barcelona based professor Michel Andre is among them.",

It is a network with more than 150 acoustic observatories all over the world, developed by Michel and his team. Named Suyai, which means hope in the local Mapuche language, this buoy is now connected to the vast network. In addition to collecting other scientific data, it will use its artificial intelligence software to identify the type and location of sea mammals, alert the authorities, who can, in turn, notify nearby vessels to slow down or change course, thus avoiding impact.",

If we look at the Dow itself, the Dow 30 and see that the makeup of the Dow 30 then hopefully we can get an understanding. Only one bit of red, McDonald's. I can only assume that's on a frolic of their own. But Boeing is up 5 percent. That is a huge number which, of course, has dragged the market up. Salesforce, there you might expect it because -- but it's Home Depot, it's Nike, it's Microsoft. It's broad based and Apple being up so strongly is very telling for what this means for the market because clearly, it's retailers. And Apple, of course, is suffering as a result of Christmas and we know the Foxconn problems there. Plenty for us to get our teeth into as we have our \"Profitable Moment\" after the break.
