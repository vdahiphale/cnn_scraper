So there's a lot more to follow here.But there is other news, right? As this is happening, the news of Jamie Dimon's deposition broke just as some major Wall Street players began publicly encouraging him to run for President of the United States. Our chief business correspondent and anchor for \"EARLY START\" Christine Romans is here with all of that. Really interesting -- Bill Ackman. CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR, \"EARLY START\":  It really is. So he is also a legendary investor and he's out there saying that he thinks that Jamie Dimon should run for president. This is what he said yesterday in a long tweetstorm. He said, \"We need an exemplary business, financial, and global leader to manage through what is likely to be a critically important decade for our country in determining our destiny. Jamie Dimon is that leader. There is only one better job for Jamie than CEO of JPMorgan and that's POTUS. He can beat Biden in the primary and he can beat Donald Trump in the general election. He needs to start now, build name recognition, and raise -- and raise billions of dollars.\" It's sort of a remarkable endorsement of someone who has been known recently as the president of Wall Street -- because when there's a problem he comes in. When there's a question, presidents and prime ministers have Jamie Dimon on speed dial. He is really the only banker of that kind of stature that I can think of in modern history. And he's been asked many times. He was asked by Bloomberg would you ever -- you know, in an interview from China this week, would you ever consider running for public office or for accepting a cabinet position?
