He said he, you know, he thought he'd earned another term, but then he but he did pivot to this idea of democracy, which has been a huge theme for him through his 2020 campaign, through the '24 campaign until now, the idea that democracy is at stake, and that ultimately, as he said last night, he felt that nothing was more important than that.",

You can go ahead. I'm releasing you. I'm encouraging you, quite frankly, to move forward without me. But I think there are, you know, there's the staff, you put in a lot of hours. You put in a lot of emotion into a job like working in the White House. Of course his family, the family has to sacrifice a lot to see their patriarch in the White House and now to see it in not on his own terms, I think there is a lot of emotion there. And so I think it's very gracious of him to kind of try to ease that transition, not just for himself, but for those who love him most, for those who dedicated a lot to him by working in the White House and again, kind to the party, trying to be this unifier, even when we know privately, this has been difficult for him.",

Max, good morning to you. This, of course, a significant moment for the Israeli prime minister sir, who faces all sorts of challenges at home. But these scenes particularly of the American flag burning, they were also burning in effigy of Netanyahu, it underscores the division and also, quite frankly, the violent nature of some of the protests of this war. MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Yeah, I mean, seeing the American flag burning is something I think resonated around the world. I mean, that is taking it to a really personal level for many Americans. The message behind it is that they feel that America is arming this war. They're complicit in this war that they don't I believe in. I mean, many of the protests of course, in America have been legitimate protest by people who are sympathetic with Palestinians generally. You also saw the Hamas sign being written on that monument. I mean, this is crossing the line, isn't it, for many people, I think a lot of people felt quite insulted though, but Netanyahu's line that people but oppose him are effectively Iran's useful idiots. A lot of the protesters against what Israel is doing are legitimate protests, but it crosses a line here and doesn't really help anyone, does it, when -- it doesn't help the legitimate protests, when it turns this nasty.",

Ripping down flags on public property to burn them is a whole other category of thing. Max, I guess I'm curious in terms of the pressure on Netanyahu here. Clearly, in many ways, these protests might actually underscore help kind of buttresses argument for people in Israel because he is on shaky ground at home and one of the other things that happened here was that some people associated with the hostage families were removed from the galleries due to disruptions during the speech, et cetera. It's not like this is a this is very complicated and multi-layered situation when it comes to how Netanyahu is dealing with this from his own domestic political perspective.",

Remember Butte County is where the camp fire ravaged the area back in 2018. So not what we want to see off in the horizon with some of these fires quickly spreading. Of course that time lapse shows quite a picture of just how fast these fires can spread. Eighty-eight active wildfires over the Western U.S.But I do want to take note of something that occurred that has been occurring over the past 24 hours across Alberta, into Canada. So we're talking western Canada now, several large active wildfires, but one that has encroached on the tourist town of Jasper. There were mandatory evacuations there, and were starting to get in some information that that area has received significant losses in terms of structures and buildings. So more information to that coming. Now, this is a look at what's happening in California. You can see the Park Fire here, 3 percent containment. So that's some slight improvement. It was at 0 percent contained came in about an hour ago. So that's good news. We do have a red flag warning for many Western U.S. states, particularly across Montana and to Oregon, are our greatest chances of wildfire activity exists for the day today. This, of course, on the backdrop of extreme dream heat over the Western U.S. and drought conditions for many Western U.S. states, including the state of Oregon, where our large active fires continue to burn. Here's the Falls Fire and the Durkee Fire, which still sits at zero percent containment. So, wildfires, that is our big story today. Certainly, Kasie.",
