      "sentences": "A warm welcome to \"First Move\", fantastic to have you with us this Tuesday and two big hearings today in Washington D.C.Testimony from the head of failed bank SVB as well as the CEO of AI phenomenon ChatGPT. And debt ceiling talks today too, but will policymakers agree progress is needed soon. But there are no guarantee details on today's headline Popery and perspective from two key voices. Ian Bremmer, President and Founder of the Eurasia group and GZERO Media will discuss the debt ceiling drama, Turkey's Presidential election runoff and Ukraine's spring offensive. Plus, Eric Schmidt, the Former CEO and Chairman of Google and Author of the book The Age of AI and our human future, we'll be discussing the dangers he sees for an AI driven amplification of all the worst traits of social media think floods have easily made deep fakes and endless levels of misinformation. He thinks we should in fact rise the age of internet adulthood to 16 years old to protect our children and enforce it. Congress, are you listening? All of this ahead of Titanic Tuesday tests U.S. stocks on track as you can see there for a slightly softer open. Europe little changed overall, though, in the U.K., Vodafone shares are down some 6 percent on news. That it will be cutting some 11,000 jobs that are around 10 percent of its global workforce. It's part of the new CEOs turnaround plan to try and boost profits. That's an interesting investor reaction to that news, a whole host of fresh data pointed to weaker global growth too. Chinese retail sales, and industrial production numbers all coming in below expectations in April and just now U.S. retail sales numbers up a weaker than expected 0.4 percent. That's actually half of what was expected. It follows credit data this week in the U.S. too showing rising debt levels, and consumers finding it more difficult to repay loans. Tied to that Home Depot today cutting full year sales guidance and warning that consumers may be more cautious about spending going forward their shares down more than 2 percent pre market now where Wall Street ends up today however, will have a lot to do perhaps with the tone of this afternoon's debt ceiling negotiations. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warning again yesterday on Monday that the U.S. government could run out of cash as soon as June 1. So that's just over two weeks away. In the meantime, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says the two sides remain far apart. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I appreciate the President finally willing to talk after 97 days. But there is no movement. We're only a couple of weeks away. And if you look at the timeline to pass something in the house and pass something in the Senate, you're going to have something done by this weekend and we are nowhere near any of that.

Arlette Saenz, thank you so much for that. And we're about to discover how much U.S. lawmakers know about artificial intelligence. Sam Altman, the CEO and co-Founder of open AI, that's the company behind ChatGPT, is testifying in Congress about the risks and benefits to society. Donie O'Sullivan joins us on this. Donie, the hearing comes what just a few months after some of the biggest players in the industry warned that we need some kind of pause to get to grips with how we best handle the application of artificial intelligence. What do we hear from Sam today? And let's be honest, how much do we think lawmakers actually understand about this? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I think you hit the nail on the head there. I mean, Julia, it's hard to believe but it was only about five years ago, I think that Mark Zuckerberg was called in front of Congress for the first time in 2018, Oxford or Cambridge analytical scandal. So at that point in Facebook had been around for about 14 years and had already changed the world. So they are catching open AI and Sam Altman a bit earlier in the AI process, as it were, open AI has been around for seven or eight years. But look, this, I expect to be a pretty surface level hearing. I mean, there is so much that, you know, it sounds cliche, of course, but AI is going to touch every part of our lives, whether it's from disinformation, which we know all about ahead of next year's election, to jobs to the music industry, to fill them to everything else. So, you know, having one hearing over the course of a few hours is not going to solve a lot. But I think really what it is going to be as an introduction to this issue, and perhaps some congressional oversight of the issues around AI. But to your point about lawmakers and how they understand this look, we all remember, you know, over the years, particularly the early social media hearings in light of the 2016 election here in the U.S. lawmakers asking pretty clueless questions about how Facebook are about how Twitter works? We may see questions like that today. But look, I will just say sometimes even you know, Altman himself. And also we saw the head of Google recently talked about they don't even necessarily always know how these systems work, right? There are certain things that these AI models do. That expert the people who designed them still don't quite understand how they end up doing certain things or how they're so good at doing certain things. So we might be able to give lawmakers a bit of a pass today.",

And what needs to be done to protect us from things like deep fakes, as Donie was saying and misinformation and the potential amplification of the risks from social media. In the meantime, the Former CEO of Silicon Valley Bank plans to apologize before a Senate committee in the next hour. Greg Baker also plans to testify that no bank could have survived the run that gutted SVB back in early March. In his statements, the Former CEO said he was \"truly sorry\" for how it impacted SVBs employees, clients and shareholders. And Christine Romans joins us now. Great to have you with us, Christine, as always, he's going to blame a combination of rising interest rates and the steep level of withdrawals, which is not wrong, but they should have been managing those risks surely.

And I think you're going to see somesharp questioning of this CEO and a couple others from Signature Bank as well, who will be there. So he points out very specifically, the language from the Fed. Remember early on in the inflation crisis, saying the inflation issue would be transitory. And he points out in his testimony that language like that the bank could not have foreseen. That it would have been the brisk pace of tightening in 40 years that they would have to manage through. So on the one hand, saying I'm truly sorry, on the other hand, saying, but it's not only our fault here. You know, the federal regulators had said this was primarily a case of mismanagement, bank mismanagement. While also in its own post mortem, the Fed as the regulator, saying that there were mistakes that were made, there should be some tightening of regulations. But it is a moment here where I think it will be humbling for these CEOs, some of whom will, there'll be one, Founder of Signature Bank, who will be speaking later today, but just shows you how swiftly the rug was pulled out of these three companies. I mean, you look at that and this is something that Greg Becker is going to mention today. The fact that the previously largest run bank in the U.S., bank run was $19 billion in deposits of that over the course of 16 or 17 days, that's when he says, I do not believe any bank could have survived a run of the velocity and magnitude of this one, social media, a new element here. Now you can have people on social media, essentially, you know, in the 1980s last, you know, crisis, you had to have people had to stand and wait in line to get their money out. Now, all you have to do is click a button, there were billions of dollars moving at a speed we've never seen before, so, clearly a very different environment today.",

Also, is there any kind of potential claw back here for those who are because shareholders were wiped out in this case here, right? So if a lot of this compensation was based on an equity right should there be claw backs of some of the income from these executives and of these big banks? That I think is a big question, which will be interesting. You will, I don't know that you're going to hear Congress ask those questions, since there are very weak rules among members of Congress, who whether they can be selling stocks or financial institutions when they are briefed about things that are happening in the financial sector.

Recent leaps in artificial intelligence are given humans new powers of creativity. But with it come new risks and also responsibilities. For an example just take a look at these fake images. Now, clearly the Pope hasn't been out and about wearing a puffer jacket. And take a look at this one as for Former President Donald Trump, yes, he was arrested. But it didn't look like this. But the point is they actually look real. Now our next guest argues we're about to see a lot more of these kinds of deep fakes, created without special skills or big budgets. And the more we see, the more hesitant we're likely to be able to trust anything. It's just part of a warning from someone well qualified to raise concerns. I'm talking about Eric Schmidt, the Former Google's CEO and Chairman. And now he's co-authored an op-ed in the Atlantic, which I recommend you read, where he argues that artificial intelligence has the potential to amplify all of the worst aspects of social media. And he's also calling for five reforms to help protect our societies. And Eric Schmidt joins me now. Eric, great to have you with us, I'm really excited to speak to you about this. And the starting point, I think for the conversation is that social media has already been pretty toxic to our society. If you overlay that, with the power of artificial intelligence, you amplify everything, the addictive nature of it, the toxicity of the misinformation, and it's bad. ERIC SCHMIDT, FORMER CEO &amp; CHAIRMAN OF GOOGLE: You're exactly right. The mistake we made 15 years ago is we didn't understand human behavior. We thought that everybody in tech, everybody in the world was sort of like tech people sort of reasonably well behaved in the rules of our society as tech people. It's not how the world works. People use a lot of these tools to misinform to manipulate to do even worse things. And it's going to get a lot worse, because of AI. AI will allow you to individually target people and make them believe things which are completely and utterly false.",

But there's one other angle too in your warnings, which is the influence of autocratic leadership around the world, the TikTok equivalent in China, for example, and how they flood the system with pro government information, similar story with Russia around the Ukraine war too, the power to influence politics around the world, also an important factor.",

So when you producea fake video, which is going to happen a lot in this next cycle of elections, even if you tell people that it's fake, even if they know before they watch it, it changes their behavior for reasons we don't fully understand. So I will tell you that everyone, all the players, whether there are governments and or opponents, or corporations, or special interests, are going to be producing things which are intended to either manipulate or misinform us using technology that has spread very, very broadly. It's extremely easy to use this technology it's extremely easy to find it. The fact of the matter is the diffusion of this technology is accomplished and it's available globally.

Remember that the platforms have an exemption because of Section 230, which was in 1994. But now the platforms are recommending information, they have a rule in spreading good and bad information. And if they do really bad information, they should have some level of liability for it. That's just seems obvious. You need to know who is on your platform. You don't necessarily have to tell everyone. But how do you know it's not a bot or an evil Russian person or something like that. And you need to know where it came from? I want to know if this is an authentic picture in the sense of it was taken at the right time? Or was it modified with the puffer jacket and the Pope, the actual Pope is bent over from illness and age. You'd know that if you'd met the Pope, most people say, oh, it looks like a great Pope. How do you discover these things? There are technologies that people are trying to do to detect whether these things, are fake. But the truth is that when the picture is written, we need to note that it was written by a computer. It needs to be generated and marked in a watermark of some kind to do that. We know how to do all of this we've just chosen not to do it. Part of the reason we've chosen that is because the social media companies are essentially trying to maximize revenue. And the way they maximize revenue is by maximizing engagement. And the way they maximize engagement is by maximizing outrage. Part of the reason that everyone seems so upset is because the systems are designed to make us, push us to the sides left or right. Right, they're not pushing us to the middle.

They have to have what is called AI alignment. They have to have what are called guardrails built into them. But many of the open source pieces of software that had been distributed already have no such guardrails; they don't prevent you from making evil images and bad outcomes and spreading them. So the whole system has to get ready for an onslaught of immoral, illegal or manipulative images that we should not be presenting to every person. This is not because it's not free speech.

And I'll put my hand up and say, I've tried this with ChatGPT too. One of the things that they were talking about was stealing nuclear launch codes, creating novel viruses.

And the reason I'm optimistic is that we should recognize that when this stuff when the really bad things happen, which I believe will happen in the next few years, people will really be harmed, and nobody wants that. So this is a case where the industry needs to do a little self-reflection, and the government needs to be a bit more aggressive. There's every reason to think if you look at the European regulations, which are coming in place, Europeans are trying to get ahead of it. The U.S. should do this in such a way that's consistent with free speech. We are in no way proposing limitations on free speech. What we're saying is that it needs to be human speech.

And the air defense is standing up to that test by the Russians. Six of their high speed hypersonic consul (ph) air launched missiles fired at Kyiv from the north of the city, according to officials there and this is a missile that goes 10 times the speed of sound, all of those were told intercepted. Then there were the nine cruise missiles more of a standard speed cruise missile fired from the south coming off ships in the Black Sea. Those were intercepted. And then there was three of the land based S-400 missiles, which were a big land based missile fired from the East Russian territory. So clearly the picture emerges here of Russia trying to target and get missiles through to Kyiv the capital from multiple different directions at the same time in the night, apparently defeated. Russia was claiming to have hit U.S. patriot battery defensive battery system in Kyiv no evidence to support that at the moment. Its areas like this in the East of Ukraine, however, were those air defenses that have been supplied by Ukraine's allies are not so dense on the ground and not able to protect the front line in the troops and here in this area still very intense fighting around Bakhmut. The push and pull for territory in the center of that city is intense. We know that Russia has been forced to pull troops out of the line in other areas to put them into Bakhmut and the Ukrainians offensive in the areas around Bakhmut, ongoing but not apparently at the moment taking a lot of territory.",

And yet he was still able to pull out almost a majority. It was almost a first round win. He will almost certainly win this election in the second round. I mean, it's a slam dunk; it's not really open to much question.

There was no stuffing of ballot boxes illicitly and indeed Erdogan said before the election that he would accept any outcome that's rather different than what we saw Former President Trump say on CNN just a week ago. But in part, that's because Erdogan feels comfortable that he has so much more control, vastly more media attention given to Erdogan than his opposition that is structural and by design. The state either owns the media or overwhelmingly influences the media. And that's even true with social media. We saw that with Twitter, they were going to be shut down if they weren't prepared to shut down a number of targeted opposition supporting accounts, literally in the days before the first round election.",

Some of that will be Sweden's willingness to behave differently going forward with Kurdish opposition members that are living within Sweden, that's been a sore point for the Turks. Some of it will be from the United States and a willingness to sell advanced military equipment, including aircraft jet fighters to the Turks, which had been held up in the United States politically. I think that's going to go forward as well. So Erdogan wants to always squeeze as much leverage as he possibly can, from his geopolitical position. He is, you know, one of the only leaders in the world that's in NATO that can talk to both Putin and Zelenskyy, for example. He was critically involved in the negotiations of the food and grain deal that we saw on the Black Sea between both sides. That's been useful, but an every step of the way Erdogan wants something for his involvement. And given how badly his economy is performing. It's not so surprising he does.",

Putin's level of control in the country, it remains near absolute. So it's not as if you're going to break his regime, his economy has managed to be more resilient over the last year, despite all of the sanctions, despite the freezing of their assets than most in the West had anticipated. But the performance of his military has been disastrous, and they have lost either through deaths or injury. Almost all of the troops that were originally fighting on the ground in that initial invasion, it's staggering to think about the Russian losses, 50 percent of their tanks, 40 percent of their total armed infantry, vehicles all gone. And they're not going to be able to rebuild them anytime soon, while the Ukrainians are getting billions and billions of dollars of the most advanced Western weaponry and training and intelligence. So I mean, hopefully what this means is that the Russians don't get another bite at this apple. That if the Ukrainians take significant land back and you have negotiations, that the Russians don't come back and threaten Ukrainian sovereignty in three or five or 10 years. And Ukraine gets to have security guarantees from the west gets to join the European Union and gets to rebuild their country, because let's face it; Ukraine has been fighting in a war for almost a decade now since 2014. And for most of that decade, the West largely did not care. There is a level of necessity of responsibility of the West to the Ukrainian peopling that and I think an obligation that now is starting to be fulfilled.",
