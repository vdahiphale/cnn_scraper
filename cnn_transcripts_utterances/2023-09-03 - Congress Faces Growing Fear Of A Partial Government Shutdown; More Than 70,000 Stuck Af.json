Good evening.Tomorrow is Labor Day, which means this week the presidential campaign is about to get a lot busier, and same for Capitol Hill as lawmakers begin to return from their August recess. The big item on the agenda, avoiding a partial government shutdown. To stop that from happening lawmakers have to pass at the very least a short-term spending bill to keep the government funded. If a spending bill is not passed by the House and the Senate, a partial government shutdown begins four weeks from today on October 1st. Members of both parties say they want to avoid that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MIKE ROUNDS (R-SD): A government shutdown is not good for anybody. We want to avoid that. And that means Republicans and Democrats are going to have to come together to get a consensus in divided government. Let's not have a government shutdown but let's begin the process of talking about our spending. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They're the hosts of the podcast \"Hot Mics from Left to Right.\"Ladies, Happy Labor Day weekend. Great to have you both on. Thanks so much. Alice, let me start with you. The House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has privately urged his fellow Republicans to back the short- term spending deal so we're told to avoid a government shutdown. What do you think his chances are given what we've seen before in his dealings with that far-right wing of the caucus?",

Well, Kevin McCarthy is having a difficult time wrangling fellow Republicans together. As you mentioned the very vocal, far-right fringe of the Republican Party, the Marjorie Taylor Greenes and the band of brothers are being extremely vocal and determined in their request.And Kevin McCarthy is in a pickle really because he's faced with the decision, does he fight with the far-right wing of the party and not get anything done, and in essence have a government shutdown, or does he work across the aisle with the minority, Hakeem Jeffries and the Democrats and get something actually passed? But then that does him in because we have Republicans with their hand on the motion to vacate lever and basically in essence kick him out of his position if he were to do so. So he's got some very serious consensus building within the old Republican Party in the next few days and weeks ahead.",

Look, we need to look at the appropriations and funding the government in one area, and we need to look at the impeachment completely separate. Look, Kevin McCarthy really needs to work across the aisle to get this appropriations agreement passed. And that works with Republicans and Democrats, and specifically Republicans on board to include spending cuts along with all of the other aid that is in this package.But aside from that, the impeachment is absolutely valid. There are serious questions about Biden's foreign business deals and Hunter Biden, and the possibility of influence peddling when his father was vice president. That is a serious consideration. We do have evidence as much as my dear friend Maria and Democrats love to say that President Biden had nothing to do with it. Their narrative and communication has changed from he had nothing -- no knowledge of this whatsoever to now saying, well, he wasn't actually in business with them. Well, the fact that their story has changed goes even more to the need to have a further investigation. I think Republicans should fully move forward with the investigation and potential impeachment on this. And Democrats need to let the information flow as it will. And whether or not there is a vote for impeachment will be determined when we get all of the information on the table.",

So my dear friend Alice is saying that we should go forward with this impeachment, well, I say to the GOP, bring it on.It will only underscore what a lack of leadership the Republicans are demonstrating and how the American people frankly are going to look to them in 2024 and say they don't deserve another run at leading the House of Representatives because this is what we get, a game of chicken. You get somebody like Kevin McCarthy trying to point to something shiny over here, Biden impeachment, to make sure that his immature, incredibly lack of leadership, full of MAGA extremists Republicans don't try to shut down the government and ruin the American economy.",

He's seen wearing a backpack. The video is kind of tough to see but nonetheless there is certainly sort of breathing new life into this search here. Yesterday's sighting also prompting authorities to really narrow in on this area. This particular area about 30 miles west of Philadelphia. In fact today authorities said that hundreds of SWAT team members, U.S. marshals, local, state, federal law enforcement officers are really just focusing on that particular area where the sighting happened over the weekend. A bit of background on the 34-year-old who's actually beginning to serve a murder sentence of life without parole. He'd just been convicted of first-degree murder in mid-August after being found guilty of stabbing his girlfriend to death in front of her two young children. Hence the Chester County district attorney has repeatedly urged residents to remain on high alert. And just today, Jim, he called this individual an extremely dangerous man.

According to Ukrainian officials, the target of the attacks appear to be infrastructure in the port area. Odessa firefighters battled fires started by those attacks. Ukrainian officials say 22 of 25 drones launched in the attack were destroyed.Even as Russia continues to target Odessa, some Ukrainians are now heading to its beaches for some temporary relief from the war. And CNN's Christiane Amanpour has more on that. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR (voiceover): In the waning days of a second summer at war, under the blazing Black Sea sun, you find, well, people at the beach. It's actually the first time some of this Odessa coastline has been open for business since the Russian invasion. And while Olga has brought her family for a change of scenery, there is no getting away from it. (On-camera): Here, can you forget the war for a little bit? OLGA, ODESSA RESIDENT (through translator): Sirens at night don't let you forget. No, we don't forget. At least I don't. But I hope my kids and parents get distracted a little bit. AMANPOUR (voice-over): Still, those who can make the most of it. Life goes on even in wartime. And here at the Kaleton Beach Club, it's somehow comforting to watch parents slap protective gear onto their infants as if sunburn is the worst that can happen. But of course it's not. (On-camera): So does that mean orthopedics or anything? (Voice-over): Fifteen minutes away in the center of town is a modern private recovery and rehabilitation unit. One of 10 set up around the country by a Ukrainian philanthropist. Here in a full body sling, 41-year-old Vitali (PH) tells us that he volunteered for the front as a deminer until he was blown up by an anti-personnel mine eight months ago in Kherson. The first wave hit my face because I was bending down, he says, and shrapnel entered my eye, another bit hit my finger, and three of my toes were blown off. On the rehab bed next to him, 43-year-old Ruslan's (PH) injury is less dramatic, spine and back problems from suddenly having to haul heavy gear around. (On-camera): Do you need to get into better shape? (Voice-over): If I was 20, he tells me, it would be different, but I'm 43 and so it's difficult. But he wants to go back to the front like Vitali (PH) does just as soon as they're patched up. Still motivated, still sure of victory. But then the talk suddenly turns. (On-camera): Vitali (PH), what do you think you need? (Voice-over): Immobilized and prone he's crystal clear. We need more weapons and jets to close the sky from the Russian missiles, he says. When a soldier is fighting there and his family is here, I'm protected. What do you think goes through our minds? Andriy (PH) tells me his psychological trauma is worse than the shrapnel to his hand because he like all of them want to be back at the front with their comrades to fight for their country and their family. I have a mother, a father, a wife, and a cat, he tells me. Back at the seaside, Sergei (PH), a 59-year-old conscript based in Kherson, defends his beach time break. (On-camera): In the middle of war you don't feel strange?",
