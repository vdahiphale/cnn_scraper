      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin the hour with Donald Trump fuming over the testimony from porn star Stormy Daniels and his hush money trial. Trump has the day off in that trial, but he's lashing out on social media, on his social media account, calling D.A. Alvin Bragg all kinds of names and complaining that he's being persecuted. Tomorrow, he'll once again come face to face with Daniels, who's scheduled to be cross-examined after offering up lurid details of their alleged sexual encounter. Yesterday, the judge in the case rejected Trump's request for a mistrial after some of the tawdry testimony clearly got under the former president's skin. Judge Merchan chastised Trump for cursing and shaking his head throughout Daniels' turn on the stand, saying he won't tolerate that conduct because it could intimidate the witness. And Trump is already on thin ice. Merchan previously warned Trump could face jail time if he continues to attack jurors and witnesses. Donald Trump did catch a break though in the classified documents case, a federal judge he appointed and definitely postponed that trial. That means Trump's hush money trial could be the only one that he'll face before the November election. Joining me now is former Trump White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Matthews. And, Sarah, I mean, lots to go through this morning after what we all witnessed yesterday. You worked for the former president. How much do you think his attorneys are just sort of waiting to see if the volcano explodes today? I mean, as we were just saying, he's on thin ice. If he tweets the wrong thing or posts the wrong thing, I mean, it could land him in jail. They have to be worried. And what do you think is going through Trump's mind right now after all that testimony yesterday?",

He's upset after that testimony.Look, Stormy Daniels disclosed a lot of salacious details, personal things about their interactions, whether he wore a condom, details about him and his wife not sleeping in the same bedroom. So, he was definitely upset. And we saw that. He said -- the judge had to warn his lawyers to tell the a defendant to stop shaking his head and swearing under his breath and things like that. So, I think he definitely is on thin ice with the judge, but I don't know if we'll see Donald Trump break the gag order again. I think that he is worried about going to jail. Look, he's a germophobe.

I mean, I think he'll push it up until the edge.He'll continue to, for sure, go I don't think he's going to be able to go after the prosecutor, as we've seen, the judge, but under his gag order, he is allowed to attack them.

And so the fact that voters are probably not going to see these trials on classified documents and January 6th happened before they had to the ballot box in November is quite disappointing, because I do think that those are the more substantive cases. The charges that he's facing are much more severe in those cases.And so I do wish that voters would be able to have that knowledge heading into Election Day.

Now, the district attorney's office is not commenting on this matter today, but we did hear from Trump's attorney in Georgia, Steve Sadow, who called this an unjustified, unwarranted political persecution and said he looks forward to presenting arguments in the appeals court about why Fani Willis should be disqualified from the case and why the case should be dismissed entirely. So, look, this is a pretty good day for Donald Trump. We obviously don't know how the Georgia Court of Appeals is going to handle this, but the fact that they can keep this disqualification issue alive in this case is a win for Trump's team.",

But I think the prosecution got out what they wanted to out of her testimony, which was, you know, this was stuff that Donald Trump didn't want to see public. Now, on the other side of that, nobody -- I think it's kind of a given that Donald Trump didn't want it to be public. It was an affair with a porn star.

They kind of wanted it to go out there so they could then claim, oh, this is too far over the bounds.But I don't think that it was gratuitous. I don't think it was deliberately salacious. I mean, people characterize it that way because it's a sexual encounter, but it was effective in putting her story out there.

We should also note that the U.S. officials said that they are continuing to review future transfers of additional U.S. weapons to Israel. So, that's something for us to watch. And in the backdrop here, Jim, there's also a report that's due to Congress today. congressional sources tell us it's going to be slightly delayed, but it's the administration making a determination as to whether Israel is using U.S. weaponry in accordance with international humanitarian law. They're also going to be making a determination as to whether Israel has impeded the delivery of humanitarian assistance into Gaza. Of course, U.S. officials have said Israel has made strides on that front, but they've also said that Israel needs to do more. And it's important to note that we have reported on the fact that here at the State Department, there is not a unanimous view as to whether the assurances from Israel that they are using those weapons in accordance with international law are legitimate.
