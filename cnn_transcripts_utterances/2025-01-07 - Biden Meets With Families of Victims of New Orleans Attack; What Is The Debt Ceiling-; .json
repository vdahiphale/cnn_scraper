      "sentences": "Ah, the debt ceiling. The eternal Washington food fight. So what is it and why is it so contentious?The debt ceiling is the legal limit set by Congress on how much money America can borrow. Because the U.S. spends more than it takes in, it borrows to make up the difference. The debt ceiling caps how much. The problem is, it`s not enough. So, every once in a while Congress needs to raise it. If it doesn`t, the Treasury Department won`t be able to pay all the country`s bills in full and on time. Now the Treasury does have a little wiggle room before it gets to that point, what it calls extraordinary measures to move money around. But eventually, the accounting tricks run out and there`s no more avoiding the debt ceiling. That`s when the fireworks usually break out. REP. MIKE JOHNSON, (R-LA) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: I want you all to remember that it was just last spring that the same Democrats berated Republicans and said that it was irresponsible to hold the debt limit, the debt ceiling hostage. What changed? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): The problem here is that they`re asking only to get rid of the debt ceiling for a short period of time to allow them to do a massive new tax cut for billionaires and millionaires. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC): There are some Republicans who`ve never voted to raise the debt limit and never will. YURKEVICH (voice-over): Now, many say raising the debt ceiling is just a license to spend more money and grow the debt. But it`s not really. Raising the debt ceiling just lets Treasury pay the bills America already owes. REP. MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): It`s about prior debts incurred. And obviously we have to pay our debts just as every American has to pay down their credit card.",

Failing to raise the debt ceiling won`t keep a lid on debt. It just risks the U.S. defaulting on its obligations, something that could forever stain America`s global reputation. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Water, soil, rocks or sunlight. If you said soil, yes sir. The scientists who study soil health for growing plants are called edaphologists. Now to laser shooting robots. Have you heard about this AI technology that just might become a game changer for farmers as they look to tackle one of their biggest problems, weeds? With farms looking to replace toxic herbicides with sustainable practices, one company has developed a Star Wars-like machine that zaps weeds with lasers like an Imperial Stormtrooper. They say it`s eco-friendly. But with laser blasters costing upwards of a million dollars, how many already struggling farmers could actually use this force to help them turn a profit? Take a look.
