There's so much business you want to do. You want to do some of the, you know, personal bio. You want to do some of the forward-looking agenda. You want to frame up your opponent. And I thought one of the things she did so effectively was just tie all of that into a narrative that just felt like common sense. I mean, she told her own story in a way that I think resonated with people across the country, talked about her family, talked about why she's motivated by the things she's motivated by in public life, based on her own growing up. You know, and then kind of -- I think pretty effortlessly transitioned into how that will shape her term if she's elected to office. And I think at the end of the day, it felt like a speech that I think, to a lot of people, was just reasonable and common sense. And I think that contrast with Trump is powerful. But I also think she just did a terrific job introducing herself, selling herself in a moment that's -- it's not always easy to do that.",

And yesterday was her opportunity to take that away. And also, I mean, I think Kate was absolutely correct in what -- what she was trying to do yesterday was weave in these personal narratives about who she is, frame her opponent, and also say, look, I am Kamala Harris, and I'm for the people. And yes, she didn't wear white, right? And one of the things that I believe everybody recognizes at this table is this campaign has not been a campaign about identity. You know, you can see the history in who she is, but not one time did she mention that she's going to be the first of anything. Not one time did she talk about I'm going to be the first this or that. You can see that history. What she wanted people to understand, though, is that, while I am a historical figure, I'm also someone who's going to make your life better.
