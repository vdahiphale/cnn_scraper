So, I think that comparison on the one hand works in his favor.But of course, the cancelling of that immortal regiment march speaks to another side of this. And it is the case, John, that despite the fact that Russia has made those gains on the battlefield, in recent months, they have not -- it's not been a route. This has not been a strategic success for Russia, that we're talking sort of villages, not even towns, they are making progress but it has, as you say, come at an enormous cost. They are still able to bring men to the front, they are able to conscript people, and they do have a very large, regular army still but it is something that is pretty a major strain on society.

The U.N. is talking about some of these mass graves and the summary executions, that there has been evidence of torture. The images of children, it breaks anyone's heart to look at it. And obviously, we've seen that frustration here in the U.S. on college campuses.And Mr. President, signs at college campuses, some say Genocide Joe.

There's a legitimate right to do that, they have a right to do that. There's not a legitimate right to use hate speech. There's not a legitimate right to threaten Jewish students. There is not a legitimate right to block people access to class. That's against the law. That's against the law.And so -- and if you look at the data, these demonstrations are real, but they're not new. I mean, look, and everybody has made a speech on the holocaust the other day. And I pointed out that, you know, it took seven decades to get to the place where after the holocaust occurred and there is still antisemitism. Look, what has happened. In seven weeks -- 70 -- I mean, what is happening? Everybody has sort of forgotten about what happened in Israel. Those 1,200 young kids murdered. I saw pictures -- I went over there swiftly after. A mother and a daughter being roped together and then kerosene poured and burned to death. Not like that has happened in Jewish community since the holocaust. So, when I went over immediately after that happened, I said to Bibi, don't make the same mistake we made in America. We wanted to get Bin Laden and we'll help you get Sinwar. But we went into Afghanistan to -- it made sense to go get Bin Laden. It made no sense to try and unify Afghanistan. It made no sense in my view to engage in thinking that in Iraq, they had nuclear weapon. Don't make the same mistake. Focus, and we will help you focus on getting the bad guys. But -- and we've got to think through what is happening after Gaza, after this is over, who is going to occupy Gaza. I've been working with the Arab States. I won't match them, as I don't want to get him in trouble. But five leaders in the Arab community were prepared to help rebuild Gaza, prepared to help transition to a two-state solution.",
