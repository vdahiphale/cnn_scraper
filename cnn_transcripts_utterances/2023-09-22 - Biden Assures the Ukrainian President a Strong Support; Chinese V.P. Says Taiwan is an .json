So for many independent analysts, it's still a question why they're not provided because there's no explanation coming, like real explanation that we would understand. And I'm not talking just about Ukrainian analysts, I'm talking about the whole coalition. But in the other respect, yes, it's a powerful package and indeed we are -- we are receiving a lot of weapons which are working, which are helping on the counteroffensive and also to protect the cities. For example, every second day, the Kyiv is bombarded with the either drones or rockets. Just a couple of days ago, Kyiv was a subject of the massive attack of the rockets and all of them were destroyed by, including by the American equipment. So people in Kyiv can live and work relatively normally despite being like bombarded by an absolutely immense amount of missiles.

And so those complaints about the counteroffensive are based on expectations, which were developed very far from frontline and actually very far from Ukraine, but then expecting this to resolve everything. And it's also was quite unrealistic because we're talking about a very substantial effort and substantial war. But I don't think Biden needs to, you know, is to specifically like it must be expected to resolve this within the next months or so. I mean, seriously, we're talking about the war against Russia, and Russia is still a very powerful military country, and they have massive budgets and a huge amount of soldiers and so on.

It seemed to be a direct response to much of the news over the last day or so, which is the interview that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia had with Fox News, where he talked about the talks, negotiations towards normalization with Israel. And a big question in this normalization will be what will the Palestinians get or what will happen to the Palestinians?And what we hear from the Palestinian Authority president is essentially, you cannot have this piece that you seek in the Middle East without a full recognition of a Palestinian state. It was interesting to hear from the Crown Prince, Mohammad bin Salman, in that interview, not even mention that we're necessarily a state for Palestinians, but instead talking about ways that they could ease the lives of Palestinians in this normalization deal. We do know that the Palestinians have set out certain things that they would like to receive as a result of this normalization deal, that's according to media reports, as well as statements we've heard from Palestinian officials. These are things like U.S. backing for recognition of Palestinian statehood at the United Nations, which is something that Mahmoud Abbas mentioned in his speech. The U.S. reopening its consulate in Jerusalem that was closed by former President Donald Trump, and as well as Israeli transfer of certain parts of the West Bank territory into Palestinian control. Now it is going to be hard for much of these things to get through this current Israeli government. The most right-wing extremist in Israeli history, something that Mahmoud Abbas addressed, calling it a right- wing racist government. Otherwise for the rest of a speech, much of it is things that we have heard before from the Palestinian leader, things like demanding an end to the occupation, asking for full recognition of the state. But Palestine talking about what he called a double standard, saying why is Israel recognized, but the state of Palestine is not recognized. He also is calling for Israel, he said, to be held responsible for its actions, saying that there have been so many U.N. resolutions in that very body that he says have not been upheld. But definitely the biggest takeaway from his speech was that first line, his sort of direct response to all the discussion about the normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia.

Most recently, that would be China, with an underground test conducted in 1996. The U.S. has been conducting for years tests that it calls subcritical tests, and they're meant to ensure the reliability of existing nuclear weapons, some of which have been around for some 30 years, longer than many people might keep a car in their garage.

And so having Poland, one of Ukraine's staunchest allies throughout this war, have this major U-turn in terms of reflecting that they may no longer be given weaponry to Ukraine is really something Ukraine can ill afford to have.So this might be why this compromise, this de-escalation is starting to happen and why we're seeing this language perhaps optimistically saying that there is no crisis here, that they can talk about it and they will find a solution. Now it's worth remembering that Poland was one of the first NATO countries to provide fighter jets to Ukraine just in the spring. They have continued to be a major route for a lot of Western equipment to get through to Ukraine. So not just Polish equipment, but a lot of Western aid goes via Poland to get into Ukraine. All of this means it's quite critical that Poland is very much still onboard. The language we've seen overnight indicates that they are starting to move towards a compromise. And let's not forget it isn't just Poland that had instituted a ban on this Ukrainian grain, this grain being what started all of this dispute, Ukrainian grain being exported at a cheaper price and as a result Poland and various other countries instituting a ban. It isn't just Poland, it's also Slovakia and various other countries. Now just yesterday we saw that Slovakia and Ukraine reached an agreement, they reached a new grain trade agreement where there would be an issuing and controlling of licenses of Ukrainian grain. We don't have many more details on it yet, but there is an indication there that compromises can be made in this area. And clearly, when it comes to supporting Ukraine with weaponry for this counteroffensive, that is very much something that Ukraine wants to ensure they still have the support of Poland. Particularly as we enter these winter months, and particularly as we now look at U.S. funding becoming increasingly uncertain, it's more and more important to Zelenskyy and all of the Ukrainian leadership that security from their European allies very much remains in place as we head into these winter months.

There is significant hope that this round of talks could potentially lead to a lasting resolution for the decades-long conflict that has ravaged again that ethnically Armenian enclave. Why these changes now? Well, the supporters of the ethnically Armenian population, again, in tens of thousands living in that enclave. Those supporters are wavering, among them of course Armenia, which has said that it is not party to these mediations, that it does acknowledge of course that this region is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan. That sent demonstrators into the streets in Armenia where many felt that their government was not protecting the Armenians. Regardless, you also have Russian mediators as well on the ground.

Now, both parties agreed to resume talk soon without providing a specific date. A few questions here that remain. How will disarmament take place? And to what extent will Azerbaijan require that disarmament? What happens? What is the fate of the tens of thousands, an estimated 120,000 Armenians that live in that enclave, in that region, and what does integration into Azerbaijan look like for them?

He says about 5,000 people have crossed the border in the past few days in his town of Eagle Pass, Texas, and that's where we find CNN's Ed Lavandera. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Dozens of migrants stand in the Rio Grande, moments after forming a human chain to cross the river and through layers of razor wire, trying to reach Eagle Pass, Texas. They tell me they're from Venezuela, among them a woman and her toddler. The danger for them is real. Two people, including a three- year-old boy, have drowned this week after being swept away in the river current. But after a nearly 3,000-mile journey, they accept the risk. (on-camera): How long are you gonna wait here? They said they're gonna wait here until they let them in. (voice-over): The migrants tell us they've been robbed and attacked on the Mexican side of the river. After hours of waiting, the migrants figure out a way to crawl under the razor wire. In a surreal scene, one man instantly apologized. (on-camera): They wanted to apologize for crossing illegally into the U.S. and that they're begging and asking for mercy. But to understand that they're coming from a country where they're persecuted and they feel like if they were to be returned home, they would be killed. (voice-over): The mass influx of migrants causing tension between federal and state authorities. Texas Governor Greg Abbott posted this video accusing border agents of cutting razor wire at an undisclosed location in Eagle Pass, allowing trapped migrants to turn themselves in. DHS officials refused to comment on the governor's allegation. On Wednesday, about 3,000 migrants crossed in Eagle Pass alone.",

We know there's a chance we get deported, but it's in God's hands.
