So, today, they are saying they're letting the deal expire.The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, saying that this is unrelated to the attack overnight on the Kerch bridge -- the Crimean bridge. He says they are separate events, and once the concessions that Russia is looking for have been fulfilled, then they could look to reinstate the deal. But this is a deal that -- just for some background -- that has allowed Ukraine to safely, through several maritime corridors, export some of its grain and other agricultural products to the global markets. Ukraine, a major supplier of things like wheat and corn. And the blockade of those ports on the Black Sea led to a huge uplift in food prices around the world. A hardship for developing countries who were already, in some cases, facing famine. So this really is the only diplomatic achievement of this war so far that has allowed those food prices to come down and some relief for those developing countries. Now it looks set to expire -- Rahel.",

It -- you know, the controversy -- one of the other controversies that Russia has been bringing up is they are saying not enough of it has gone to developing countries.The Black Sea grain initiative says about 750,000 metric tons has gone through the World Food Program, specifically to some of the hardest- hit countries. So not an enormous proportion but the impact on bringing down the cost of food globally has been much more significant by getting these foodstuffs out to global markets. I think now that the Kremlin is saying they're essentially canceling -- terminating was the word that Dmitry Peskov used -- this deal, we may see the reverse effect. And don't forget that when this grain deal was signed and, in fact, many parts of the world still are, inflation was a major issue affecting not just developing but also developed economies. This helped alleviate elements of that as well, so it is intensely concerning that it is being now allowed to lapse -- Rahel.",

They really are stepping up efforts now that the war has been going on for almost 17 months to bring the message of patriotism -- you know, feelings of pro-war sentiment into classrooms.They're doing this in various ways but one that we have been particularly looking at is really an acknowledgment, I think, that they can't really fully conceal the true cost of this war to families so they are attempting to make a patriotic virtue out of it. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  The marching not perfectly in time but what this ceremony lacks in military precision it makes up for in the propaganda value. These children in central Russia will now get the chance to sit at a new desk emblazoned with the face of one of Russia's war dead, a former pupil at this school, killed just three days into the invasion. His grieving mother struggling through. These so-called hero desks turning classrooms into bleak memorials of a death toll Russia has otherwise tried to hide are actually part of a government initiative. Russia's ruling party says they now number over 14,000. They apparently include veterans of other wars.",

Basic military preparation, a throwback to Soviet times, set to officially reenter the school curriculum for older classes. KEN (through translator):  It's a cheap, simple method of reaching a very large audience and to get across the government's position. It is, in essence, moral violence against children. SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  CNN has reached out to the Russian Ministry of Education for comment on the purpose of these changes and gotten no response. Sitting at these hero desks, in many schools, a reward for only the best students. A morbid incentive designed to breed a generation patriotic enough to accept a war whose consequences they are sure to inherit. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

These layoffs were part of Elon Musk's global cost-cutting plan just four days after Twitter opened an office in Ghana's capital. The staffers had accepted Twitter's offer to pay them three months' severance, but they say Twitter has not followed through since they left seven months ago. Let's bring in CNN's Larry Madowo.

They fear that they may not get paid a cent because their last day at Twitter was officially December fourth, even though they lost access to Twitter systems earlier than that, and we're in July. Not a word from Twitter.They already feel that this has been a hugely arduous process. Even the negotiation process only took place after CNN reported on that case. They feel that they were lowballed into accepting this three months of severance and they didn't want to get into the extra burden of a legal case. They didn't get any stocks vesting or any of the benefits. And then they agreed to that back in May and Twitter has gone silent on them. I want to read a quote for you from their lawyer, Carla Olympio, who has been representing them from the beginning. She says, \"Unfortunately, it appears that after having unethically implemented their terminations in violation of their own promises and Ghana's laws, dragging the negotiation process out for over half a year, now that we have come to the point of almost settlement, there has been complete silence from them for several weeks.\" And the lawyer representing these former employees for Twitter in Africa say that they're considering legal options in different jurisdictions, including in Ghana. But the problem here is if Twitter no longer has a presence in the country, can Ghanaian authorities realistically compel them to comply? It's not clear. And when you think about former Twitter Africa employees you think it's a big team. No, it's not hundreds of people. It's literally 11 people. So are we seeing that the world's richest man cannot pay severance for 11 people who worked for the company in the African team?

She says this. Quote, \"The data suggests that China's post-COVID boom is clearly over.\" Now, economists say this -- that China is counting the cost of weak demand both at home and abroad. There was fresh-out data that came out last week. The data revealed that China's exports fell at their fastest pace in three years in June.

You can see Asian markets are mixed, with the Hong Kong up nearly positive right now -- about one-third of a percent. European markets are all solidly lower. Paris is off 1.4 percent. Let's take a look at U.S. futures really quickly if we can. Across the board, red arrows with Dow futures worse among them. U.S. stocks closed mixed on Friday. JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Citibank all beating estimates after a week full of encouraging economic data. But investors still bracing for the Federal Reserve to once again hike interest rates later this month. A key inflation gauge has now declined for 12 consecutive months. In March 2022 -- since March 2022, the Fed has rolled out 10 consecutive interest rate hikes and finally pressed pause last month. Let's bring in John Leer, chief economist at Morning Consult. John, we know that the Fed is expected to raise again, as we said, but with the last CPI inflation report at three percent, at what point do you think the Fed is ready to declare victory on inflation? JOHN LEER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MORNING CONSULT (via Webex by Cisco): Yes, thanks for having me. I think the Fed is quite a long way actually away from declaring victory on inflation. There are two reasons for that. One is while we got really positive news last week that the CPI had started to fall it's a bit of inside baseball here. But the Fed focuses on another reading of inflation called PCE, which we won't get until the end of the month. And PCE has been less -- has been falling less dramatically than CPI. So the preferred indicator of the Fed is actually looking more flat than what we got last week. I think on top of that there's a lot of history sort of at stake right now and so the Fed certainly doesn't want to be known as the institution that eased on inflation prematurely and ultimately maybe gave rise to persistent inflation.",
