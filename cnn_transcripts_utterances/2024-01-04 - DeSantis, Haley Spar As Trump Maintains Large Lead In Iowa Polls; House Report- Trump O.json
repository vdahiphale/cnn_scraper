As part of their aggressive final push to sway any remaining undecided caucus goers, things are getting a little heated. Haley recently made comments that seemed to downplay her chances in Iowa. She joked, in New Hampshire, that voters there would correct Iowa's results. Ron DeSantis is now seizing on that today. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY, (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE &amp; FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR: You know, Iowa starts it. You know that you correct it. You know that you continue to go -- (APPLAUSE) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL) (voice-over): It was incredibly disrespectful to Iowans to say that somehow their votes need to be, quote, \"corrected.\" I think she's trying to provide an excuse for her not doing well.

Who is the candidate endorsed by no labels, some other third-party organization?What we keep hearing among those few undecided voters is that they don't like Donald Trump's behavior. They don't like Joe Biden's age. And so it is a pox on both houses. Their question is, can a third-party candidate truly be viable? Is it someone they can vote for that could win? Or is it just a spoiler? But there is a lot of animosity towards both political parties because it feels like 2020 all over again.",

When you've got almost 70 percent of Americans saying that they would vote for a third-party, at least consider voting, if they thought that person could win, that's higher than any time in my lifetime.And I worked for Ross Perot in 1992. So I know what it is to have a viable third-party candidate. Three things. Number one, they are looking for results. Number two, they are looking for someone with experience, other than Washington D.C. Number three, they want to be told the truth. If any third-party candidate can hit all of those three attributes, they are certainly viable.",

China is not enemy number one but they are not well liked. And if a candidate or president is making money on the side, doing business in China, that will not be received well at all.",

The court sending out a statement saying \"Judge Holthus experienced some injuries and her condition is being monitored.\" Boris and Bri, as you alluded in the intro, the Marshal who was trying to protect her had injuries that were bad enough where he needed to go to the hospital. His condition was in an OK state at our last check. And something else that we did not anticipate, he was supposed to answer for these charges earlier today. He was supposed to go back into court. He refused to leave his jail cell. So his next court date has been pushed back to Tuesday of next week -- Bri and Boris?",
