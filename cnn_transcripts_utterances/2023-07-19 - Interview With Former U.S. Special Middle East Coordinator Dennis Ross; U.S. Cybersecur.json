I think, very much, what's been going on with him when he makes this statement in talking about while this is painful, he's also saying this is a manifestation of our democracy because the grassroots in Israel have produced this movement.

He also addressed the simmering tension while he was welcomed broadly from both sides there in that chamber. There were a handful of progressive Democrats who sat this out, and there has been a week of headlines here in the United States in anticipation of this speech where you actually have the progressive chair, the Progressive Caucus of the Democratic Party, Congresswoman Jayapal, call Israel a racist state. She then walked those words back, but clearly that was seen as an opening for Republicans to quickly hold a vote in support of Israel and that got overwhelming support. You saw him address some of these issues and say, it is reasonable to question some of the Israeli government's policies and to disagree with them, but to draw a distinction between what he viewed as antisemitism and Israel's right to existence. He went on to say, the bond between these two countries is strong, though challenged, and yet unbreakable. What do you make of what is happening now, particularly in the Democratic Party, even if it's a fringe, is that more in terms of what's happening in Washington, in the divisions there, or does this speak to a greater issue about the relationship between these two countries?",

But President Herzog was saying, criticism is understandable. It's fair game. That's a part of any democracy. Look at Israel, you see how much we're prepared to criticize ourselves. So, when there's criticism, we can accept that. But when you say we don't have a right to exist, or you say we don't have a right to defend ourselves, that's -- that is when you cross the line. Then it becomes a question, you're saying the Jewish people don't have a right to a state. That really does move you into an antisemitic posture, not just a critical position of Israel.",

We saw a phone call between the two on the eve of President Herzog's arrival, but there's still some debate as to the wording and whether an official invitation was offered and what that date would be. And it centered around some of the tensions between these two administrations. President Biden to CNN just last week said that this was the most extreme government he had seen in his history, and in the last 50 years. And two huge issues, as you noted, Hoover over this government and in Israel right now. We'll talk in a moment about the judicial reforms, but specifically the extreme fringes of this government that, on top of the raid -- the recent raid in Jenin, continued pushing for settlement expansion. There are some inside of Israel itself who are calling for this administration to do more and to pressure the Netanyahu government more.

Let's talk about the judicial reforms in the final minutes that we have. As you noted know, you've seen nearly 30 weeks of protests. We're expecting to have a second and third reading of what is called the reasonable standard, and that's expected this week.

And I think the concern on the part of those who are opposed to this is that this means that there is no break. Anybody can be appointed to any position even if it makes little sense, or even if this is someone who is - - has a track record of corruption. So, they're suggesting you can't lose that ability to create that kind of a restraint. It does seem to me that there were those even in the negotiations representing the opposition at the president's house, between the government and the opposition, who are saying maybe the concept of the reasonable has been applied too liberal leads (ph), it's too elastic, it's too open-ended. So, there could be some definition or some ground rules, some criteria for reasonableness. Right now, there really isn't. So, the truth is, there is some room for compromise on that issue. The legislation that's being adopted doesn't seem to provide very much room for any some compromise. The question will be, will a second and third reading go through without any readiness to walk that back?

And that is one of the top takeaways that I understand the U.S. federal government has, is the lack of transparency into how these Cloud systems are managed and what the threat activity is happening on what's known as the back plane, or the actual systems that these tech companies manage on a daily basis, that due to the Fourth Amendment and other constitutional protections, that the intelligence services here in the U.S. cannot look into on a regular basis.",

And that is something that the government has been asking for, for quite some time, for many, many years. And it's great to see that Microsoft is opening up the ability of a broader range of organization to be able to take a look at what's happening across their networks to detect any sort of anomalous activity. Because the real takeaway here is that you're going to have a bad day. There will be a cyber event. There will be more cyber events at Microsoft. There will be more cyber incidents in the federal government.

And the U.S. government under the Biden administration in the recent national strategy is taking a hard look at software liability. Software liability is not a thing that's really existed where you can hold these software providers liable for some sort of previous flaw.

And that's what Isaw last week with this Chinese hack, that it's the same or a similar sort of using a token to be able to authorize access to accounts that you shouldn't have otherwise have access to. But what it also shows is that these sophisticated actors, whether they're Russia or China, are starting to target some of the, kind of, aggravation points or concentrated risk points in internet and technology provided services. So, rather than knocking on the front door of the state department and trying to hack directly in, they can go to a -- of that point of aggregation or a service provider and, kind of, tunnel up. But not just hit one agency or organization, they can hit multiple organizations with the same technique, and that's something, I think, we have to expect will increase going forward. But to your earlier point about how it's not just Russia and it's not just China, as I see it, over the course of the next three to four years, just about every country on the face of the earth will develop some sort of offensive cyber capability, because the barriers to entry on the thresholds to developing capabilities are radically dropping on a regular basis. And even with the advent of things like generative A.I., it is going to help previously locked out bad actors the ability to be more efficient, more productive, and faster.

As I think about the threat actors that we had to deal with and we were worried about in 2020, and it's the same old players of Russia, China, Iran, and a handful of others. I think their motivations have shifted dramatically since 2020. Back then, I think the Russians and the Chinese were probably happy to just kind of let the election play out. That we were going to tear each other apart, and that, you know, they could just sit there and watch from the sidelines. This time around, I think their motivations are significantly different. I think as you look at what Russia is attempting to accomplish in Ukraine, and that we continue to provide support to the Ukrainians and that sees battlefield defeat by the Russians, I think it's possible that Putin may change his calculus a little bit and actually try to influence and interfere in the 2024 election. Same goes with China. Last night in one of the opening sessions, Admiral Aquilino from INDOPACOM, the commander of INDOPACOM was talking about preparing for a Russian -- Chinese, rather, invasion of Taiwan. And if that -- if President Xi has ordered his military to be ready for that by 2027, then we need to be ready for it now. And part of my calculus or my thinking is that one way to undermine our preparation to help defend Taiwan is to throw our political apparatus into total chaos, and so that we're more worried about what's happening here.",

It's a travesty ifthe fees you're being charged on an account are multiples of the balance in your account. That means that you are using this account as a way of getting a payday loan, essentially. You are taking the money out, knowing in many cases, and we do see that there are people who do this in excessive number of times. So, what's happening is they need access to funds right away. They don't have another access. So, they knowingly will create a situation where they are getting a feel for the use of that money, right? And that has to stop. We have to be able to educate people because whether you take the fee away or not, they are still not managing very well. And we have to provide education to assist in that. We do that not only indirectly, but we do that indirectly by supporting organizations that are providing that kind of information and education and literacy, financial literacy to customers. That is where it starts. It also has to continue through to our policies and practices on how we charge fees, and recognizing the problem and communicating with customers.

What we do though is we do want to see the eradication of using financial services systems to commit gun crimes, that's the distinction that we made. And again, we think that's the right swim lane for a bank. But right now, we have a problem in this country in that, in fact, it can happen anywhere around the world in that illegal activity using credit cards for the purpose of buying guns to do something wrong.
