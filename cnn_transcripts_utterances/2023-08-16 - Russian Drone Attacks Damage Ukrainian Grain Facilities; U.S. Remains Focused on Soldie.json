This is happening in the shadow ofRussia's threat to attack Ukrainian shipping interests after Moscow's withdrawal from the Black Sea grain deal. Well, Ukraine brushing off the threats and creating what it calls a humanitarian corridor for cargo ships that have been trapped in its ports. The departure of the Hong Kong flag vessel came as Russia again attacked Ukrainian grain facilities in the Odessa region. Meantime, Ukraine is reporting success on the battlefield. Troops recaptured the city of Urozhaine in the Donetsk region, this video showing Ukrainian soldiers raising their country's flag inside the village. CNN's international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson has been in and out of both Ukraine and Russia over the past couple of years. Specifically, he is here in London. Let's start off with that ship setting sail from the port in Odessa. Moscow had threatened to treat any ships leaving Ukraine as potential military targets. What do we know at this stage about what has happened there?",

It's we them this week bordering boarding a Turkish vessel on the way toward Ukraine, in the Black Sea. So this ship is headed toward Turkiye, headed through the Bosphorus, making steady speed. It has got about 30,000 containers on it, 30,000 tons of goods, rather, just over 1.25 thousand containers on approximately. But for this crew, it's a mission to get the ship out of Ukrainian waters and back to where it can be used around the globe. It's been stuck in Ukraine since the war began. And this has been a priority now for Ukrainian officials, to get ships that were stuck in their ports when the war began, over 1.5 years ago, to get them out and back onto the high seas, if you. Will So a voyage into the unknown. At the same time, Russia targeting grain facilities in the port of Ren (ph) on the Danube River. Remarkably, again, this is another Russian drone strike, where most of the drones were intercepted. But at least one got through here. Incredibly close to NATO country, Romania. The river there is a couple hundred meters wide. Just across the river is Romania. Ren (ph) itself, the port was actually hit was actually closer to Bucharest than it is to Odessa. So again, Russia striking very, very close to NATO territory. That, in itself, is a risk but for this ship at the moment on the way to the Bosphorus, if it gets through then that is a positive signal for the Ukrainians.",

But the reality of that micro battle there is the Russians are trying to take back one of those villages, the Ukrainians have been pushing them backwards and forward. So even that a battle that seems to be a game is over gains of less than kilometers, is what we are talking about here, where the Russians have been pushing backwards and forwards. We've heard on the eastern front, in Kupyansk, further north and east in the country there, the commander of Ukrainian land forces has spent his day there, trying to sort of strengthen the defenses because the Russians are making an almighty push for that town, which the Ukrainians recaptured late last year. So it is a picture of micro battles along the front lines. And this is -- micro gain makes it sound too small, because every gain is significant for the Ukrainians.

It has been a thrill a minute,compelling storylines, fantastic players, great games. And first of all, huge shout out to Australia. The Matildas have so much to be proud of after getting themselves to the semifinal. But the Lionesses just had too much know-how, too much savvy, too much big game experience. If there are any European, champions they get a job done and they win 3-1. It was a rollercoaster of a game and it featured a wonder goal, at least one, from Sam Kerr, the Aussie star. We'll have that in the up and coming edition of \"WORLD SPORT.\" And we're looking ahead to the final as well because Spain's La Roja have just had a phenomenal tournament themselves. We have got a final featuring two countries, looking to win the Women's World Cup, Becky, for the very first time in their history. So it's going to be fascinating to see how it all plays out. But the Lionesses, you're quite, right I'm sure enjoying the celebration tonight in Sydney.",
