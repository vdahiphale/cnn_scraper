Another deadly day in the Middle East as Israel continues to strike throughout Lebanon. The IDF says it killed several Hezbollah commanders in the last three hours after strikes hit southern Lebanon. Earlier in the day, an Israeli airstrike further north and central Beirut killed nine people. This is the first time Israel has struck in that area of central Beirut since its war with Hezbollah back in 2006, 18 years ago. Israel's attacks have killed more than 1,000 people while they have also displaced a million residents since this war escalated. Humanitarian agencies are saying they are now operating beyond capacity. Amidst all this, Israel has not slowed down the war in Gaza. Israeli airstrikes killed 99 people in Gaza in the last 24 hours, you could see some of the aftermath there. Our Ben Wedeman is in Beirut, Nic Robertson here with me in Tel Aviv. Ben, first, describe this series of strikes in central Beirut. They were taking place throughout what I imagine was a daunting afternoon there.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, that strike that happened in Central Beirut, Jim, happened during the night, that was a single strike. Most of the strikes today have been on the southern suburbs. In fact, just a few minutes ago, we heard a distance thud, hearing and seeing on the Lebanese media that it may have been a strike near Beirut's international airport. It continues to function despite all of this, the national carrier Middle East Airlines is still flying in and out, putting on additional seats for people who want to leave Lebanon at the moment, and there are many.One of the strikes claimed by Israel they said it's one of -- it's on one of Hezbollah's intelligent intelligence headquarters. Now, I know the building they struck. To the best of my knowledge, that is where Hezbollah's media office its located. However, there was nobody in the office at the time. So these things are always hard to get to the bottom of, you get claims from Israel, counterclaims from Hezbollah, but yes, it continued strikes in Beirut, intense strikes on the south as battles rage down there. Hezbollah puts out hour by updates on what its fighters on the border are doing. It appears that they've been busy targeting Israeli soldiers, gathered on the other side of the border preparing probably for entry into Lebanon. My count says that at least 17 strikes on Israeli troops so far on the other side of the border. And what we're also seeing, of course, what appears to be Israel lane plans for a broader invasion. At this point, Israel has given evacuation orders to 76 villages in south Lebanon. So, that would certainly indicate much broader plans than what we've heard from the Israelis, talking about localized, limited, and targeted raids inside Lebanon. This would suggest something much more. Of course, people here have been watching since the last October, Israel's military actions in Gaza. The fear is that Israel is going to come in, destroy everything and nobody knows when if they'll ever be able to go home and if they will have homes to go back to -- Jim.",

The aide rushed to the dining room to inform Trump in hopes that he would take action to ensure Pence's safety. Instead, Trump looked at him and said, only \"So what?\"So what? That's the words of a sitting president in the midst of a violent attack on the Capitol about his sitting vice president. Legally, how important is that new detail and others you saw/ HEAPHY:  Yeah. Some new details, first of all, they just corroborate the core story that the select committee told. The skeleton and the core narrative of this multi-part intentional plan to disrupt the joint session was laid out by the committee, but there are important new -- there is new flesh on those bones and new details. A lot of them, Jim, go directly to the former president's intent comments like, so what when he is told that Mike Pence is being evacuated because of the capital, his lack of concern, it's almost as if he welcomed it almost as if he acknowledges that he somehow caused it. That's powerful evidence of his state of mind, which will be a central element of Jack Smith's proofs. So, the pleading is full of little anecdotes like that direct communications by the president that are windows into his state of mind.",

And that's essentially what Jack Smith has done. He has laid out his facts of great detail and may pretty strong arguments that those acts are done by the defendant, a former president, in his capacity as a candidate, not in his capacity as president. I think it's pretty compelling. It'll ultimately be up to Judge Chutkan. And then again, the Supreme Court to decide if that's accurate.",

I think the Department of Justice was a bit slow footed in pursuing this. They were very focused on the violence at the Capitol as they would be, and perhaps were a little bit reluctant until the select committee showed some of our evidence to pursue this sort of political angle. I'll give him credit though for moving quickly once they focused on those allegations. Jack Smith has been extremely aggressive, has gotten beyond where we were by getting through some executive privilege assertions using the tools that he has in the grand jury process. So while they were late, they have aggressively pursued it appropriately, aggressively proceeded it then.",

They've won three legislative chamber in them. And they have more of a conventional get out the vote operations. Trump is outsourced at largely to Charlie Kirk, and Elon Musk and we'll see whether they can find these younger Black voters, man in particular, who are indicating in polls that they are more open to Trump than in the past. I give Harris a slight advantage in those states, but you seeing Trump is pounding away at them around one argument above all, Harris cannot take on immigration and crime, ending that it, blue collar voters, especially women, but in those days, I think that's the critical, kind of pivotal of a battle that is underway between now and November, because there's the support she now among blue collar white women in those three states.",
