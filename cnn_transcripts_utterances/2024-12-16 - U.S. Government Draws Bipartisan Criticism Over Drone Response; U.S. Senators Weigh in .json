It is Monday, December the 16th, 9 a.m. here in London.And we begin this hour with those mysterious drones spotted over six U.S. states and the growing pressure on the Biden administration to release more information about what's going on. Federal agencies have drawn bipartisan criticism for downplaying the concerns from state and local governments, even as they've acknowledged the unusual nature of the reported sightings. Now, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are speaking out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) REP. JIM HIMES (D-CT): There's a lot of us who are pretty frustrated right now. You know, the answer we don't know is not a good enough answer. When people are anxious, when they're nervous, and this has been true, you know, since we've been a species on this planet, people will fill a vacuum with, you know, their fears and anxieties and conspiracy theories. And, oh, my God, there's an Iranian mothership hovering off the coast of Asbury Park, or it's the Russians or it's the Chinese. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): The administration has repeatedly assured people that they are safe. However, one, we need a briefing for the members of the Senate to figure out what's going on here.

This system will support state and federal law enforcement in their investigation. Now, something we're not clear on just yet is exactly what kind of technology New York is going to be receiving. If it's going to be anything like what Boston deployed and help them to find the drones and conduct those arrests. I have been asking about this technology, but I've been told that because this is now an issue of national security, the state is not going to share more information about what the technology is or where it will be deployed. However, I am told by sources familiar with the conversations that the governor and the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, held a few phone calls over the weekend to discuss the need for more resources. In the meantime, still a lot of frustration and a lot of questions being asked by local officials across the Northeast who want to do more and to make sure that their local governments have more resources to respond to these sightings.

If you're trying to surveil a military installation, you're probably not going to have red and green blinking lights and a strobe light on your drone. Although there is a circumstance here where maybe an individual or a group of individuals will purposely test it in an obvious way to make their drone seen so they could see what the response mechanisms are, to see what the government does and how it responds to a known visible threat, which would then give them some insight into what they could do if they didn't have those lights on or they weren't broadcasting remote identification.So that is a possibility, I think, that the intelligence community is talking about. But for the most part, if someone wants to do something harmful, they won't do it with lights on their drones. They'll fly them surreptitiously and at a high rate of speed into sensitive areas.

In fact, President Macron spoke to the Pope about it yesterday and said there's going to be a crisis meeting he'll preside over tonight at the Elysee Palace. They're trying to get as much aid as they can. But one of the problems is this is a very remote island. It's off the coast of Africa. It's on the closest French territory is Reunion, which is about 900 miles away. And they're going to set up an air bridge between Reunion and Mayotte to ferry in supplies and help.

I mean, we're talking only nine tornadoes on average happening here in California. The storm was so powerful. We had winds up at 78 miles per hour at Monterey, 83 mile per hour gusts at the San Francisco airport. That was clocked during a tornado warning that was triggered in the San Francisco Bay Area. Their first ever tornado warning in history. No tornado was confirmed out of this, but those 80 mile per hour gusts did do some damage to trees and power lines there as well. That storm working its way east, but we have another one that's already on its way in. An atmospheric river will develop as we go into the week, so more rain and snow is likely. We're looking at a level four out of five when it comes to impact for the atmospheric river, meaning it could be potentially hazardous. Some of that rain will be beneficial, but with the amount of rain coming in a short amount of time, we could be looking at some hazardous conditions. I mean, look at how healthy these rain chances stay as we go into the work week, especially Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday for a place like Eugene, Oregon. Two to four inches of rain is likely some isolated totals up to six inches possible. You could see all that moisture starts to move in as we go into the work week starting on Monday. Rain and snow from Washington down towards Oregon and northern California. Even as that clears, another round comes in going into Tuesday as the atmospheric river continues to pump in some of that moisture. Overall, rain totals will be about two to four is some of those totals up to six inches are possible, and we're going to add to the snow depth in the mountains as well.
