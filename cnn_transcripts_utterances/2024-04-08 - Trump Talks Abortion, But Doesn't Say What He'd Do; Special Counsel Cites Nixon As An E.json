But still, really unclear, and landing really with a thought on both sides of the aisle. Also, landing at the Supreme Court, tonight, a new filing from the Special Counsel, Jack Smith, is just in. The case that he's making against presidential immunity, just about two weeks before both sides will face the justices, in person. All as we are getting our first look at what the potential jurors are going to be asked, when Trump's first criminal trial starts next week, one week from today, here in New York. On the list of topics, QAnon, Antifa, and Truth Social. Our best legal sources are here to break it all down. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, Donald Trump did what he promised he would do. He said something about abortion. What he didn't do is tell anyone what he would do about it, if he is president again. On a day when most Americans were looking away amazed, but also distracted by the eclipse, and without any reporters present to ask him follow-up questions, Trump tried to take abortion off the table, as a political issue. But he basically just stated where things currently stand on the matter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: My view is now that we have abortion, where everybody wanted it, from a legal standpoint, to states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both. And whatever they decide must be the law of the land, in this case, the law of the state. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Because if you actually do, and you listen to what he said, in that statement about abortion, he doesn't say that it should be left to the states.He says it will be left to the states, which yes, is indeed the case after the Supreme Court overturned Roe versus Wade, which they did because of the three justices that he put on the Supreme Court, setting all of this in motion. This was Donald Trump's doing. All of this, today, led to a nasty back-and-forth, with one of his staunchest defenders, Republican senator, Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina. He criticized Trump, for not staking out a position, on a federal abortion ban. And Trump has been absolutely pummeling him, ever since, ranting on social media repeatedly, against a member of his own party. But that wasn't the only Republican, who did not like what Trump had to say, about abortion. His former Vice President Mike Pence, also called Trump's statement a quick, \"Slap in the face,\" and suggested that he was retreating on the issue. But behind the sniping, there's really not a ton of substance here. Trump did clarify that he wants to protect IVF access. And he claimed that he favors exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. But what he did not say is exactly what he would do, if a national ban, at any number of weeks, whether it's six or 10, or 15, landed on his desk as president. It's a dance that Donald Trump has been doing for decades, on an issue that really he's taken just about every position imaginable on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Look at Texas and Missouri. He also supports bans there. So, I'm not quite sure what the Senate Republicans are driving at. Trump was quite clear. He has been quite clear. And once again, he said, for the millionth time, in the last year, that he is going to take away, and supports taking away women's access to abortion. And unfortunately, Kaitlan, in states like Massachusetts, and in others, where we stand up, for reproductive freedom, we protect our patients and providers? We're continuing to face increasing pressure, and see the real harm that it's causing women, in our state, and women across this country. And it is heartbreaking and shameful.",

Donald Trump, today, whether it was the eclipse, he's trying to distance himself from things or distract, I don't really know, Kaitlan. But we cannot let Donald Trump lie his way out of this.I mean, let's take his words at face value, today, once again, where he says he is proud to have overturned Roe. He's proud of the fact that we have abortion bans, all across this country, in so many places, where it's now the case that one in three women live under an abortion ban. So, he's been clear. I mean, Donald Trump, if there's anything we learned, from 2016, Kaitlan, is that when he says something, it's going to come true. I mean, those are promises that he kept. And as a former Attorney General, we took him to court many, many times, on the promises that he made, that he tried to implement as President. And I think he's been really clear that he doesn't believe that women should have an access to an abortion. He doesn't care about the women who, just since the Dobbs decision have died, who have suffered, really, life-altering medical ailments, as a result of the Dobbs decision and his court's, his own court's decision that he's so proud of, and that millions more today are having to travel hundreds of miles for needed care. The other thing he doesn't care about is the other women, and patients, in places like Massachusetts, and in other states that have abortion, who right now, don't have access to cancer screenings, to pregnancy test, to pregnancy care, because we're seeing so many people have to come from other states, in order to access abortion.",

Whether it's Florida, which is coming up in May, or some of these southern states, where abortion's outright outlawed, he could say, that's up to the voters, it's up to the governor and the legislature in those states. Now, there's a lot of intellectual dishonesty in that. But that is what he's planning to do. And one thing I would keep an eye on, I think he's going to go a step further, as he develop this -- develops his messaging on this. I think he's going to start challenging the notion that Joe Biden can do anything to restore abortion rights in this country. And what I mean by that is short of a major change, on the Supreme Court, or a massive shakeup of the Senate, the law is as it stands.

Because he might have said this, and I agree he is trying to have it both ways. But that's not working for him, right now. We're seeing the conservative-right is completely pissed off at him. Democrats, as you heard the governor, and she's absolutely right, we're going to paint him, as not just wanting to have a national abortion ban, because there is audio of him saying that, but that he literally said he now supports what the states are doing. What that means, Kaitlan, is that he supports the most egregious, the most dangerous bans that have put women's lives at risk, that have put women's reproductive futures at risk.

You just spent the first 30 minutes of this show, talking about all his troubles.

And the reason why is that we always felt that once the general election began, and voters started tuning in, that you were going to see Biden's numbers come up. And they have. I mean, he's in a -- he's clearly in a better place today than he was a month ago. He's now leading in more polls than Trump is in national polls. And so, I think we feel good about where we are.

But I think, on balance, it's clear now, that Biden's gained a point or two, in recent weeks, the election is changing. It's improving for us. You're seeing similar movements, in what's called the congressional generic, where things are getting better there. The Senate polls for us are holding all across the country. And one of the evidence of strength of the party is how much money we're raising, and the fact that we've been winning elections again and again and again and all across the country, since Dobbs happened in the spring of 2022. We've had an extraordinary track record. Remember, Kaitlan, usually, a party out of power loses ground in a midterm, and in the off-year elections. We've actually gained ground. We've gone -- we've done something really dramatic. And I think it's because the most powerful force in our politics today isn't disappointment in Joe Biden. It's fear and opposition to MAGA. It's what's been driving our politics, since 2018. We had good elections in 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2023. And I think we're going to have another good one in 2024.",

Maybe it's more limited military operation. The Biden administration is saying, well, we got to think about the humanitarian implications.
