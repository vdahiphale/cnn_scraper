      "sentences": "Well, Boris, this agency is known as UNRWA. And essentially Israel brought these allegations directly to UNRWA rather quietly several days ago saying that these employees had been involved in October 7th in some way, which we are still trying to find out exactly what they are accused of doing.The agency UNRWA took these so seriously that they immediately terminated the contracts of these employees and launched an investigation. Now, UNRWA has been absolutely critical not just in wartime but in peacetime as well in terms of bringing aid to Palestinians. They maintain and run schools in the Gaza Strip and clinics. And now during this war they've been really at the center of trying to get food, medicine, shelter to these desperate Palestinians. But clearly UNRWA is taking this very seriously. We learned that several days ago UNRWA then told the State Department. And so when UNRWA made their statement earlier today about the actions that they're taking, including launching an investigation, we very quickly heard from the State Department as well. And it was the U.S. that actually put a number on this, 12 staffers who are accused of taking part in October 7th, again in some capacity. The Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has spoken with the U.N. Secretary General. He praised the U.N. for taking steps and investigating and announced that the U.S. will be holding back, temporarily at least, this additional funding. How much that is, we don't know, but it could certainly have an impact. The U.S. is one of the biggest donors to UNRWA. So there's certainly still a lot of questions about what exactly happened here.",

The U.S. is sending the CIA director over there to sort of oversee the process. What's the latest there? MARQUARDTthe point person for the Biden administration when it comes to negotiating this hostage deal or another hostage deal that would hopefully, the U.S. says, lead to a ceasefire. The U.S. really sees this hostage deal as a key to unlocking a longer pause in the fighting that would allow the arms, the weapons to be put down, the guns to fall silent, more humanitarian aid to come into the Gaza Strip, Gazans to be allowed to go home. So very notable, Bill Burns is traveling to Europe. We believe there's a meeting in the coming days with his Israeli and Egyptian counterparts as well as the Qatari prime minister. These are the main players when it comes to getting a hostage deal done. We are hearing a warning from the White House today that it does not appear that a deal is imminent, but certainly these players have to get together to try to get on the same page and bridge some of the very significant gaps between the Hamas and Israeli positions.",
