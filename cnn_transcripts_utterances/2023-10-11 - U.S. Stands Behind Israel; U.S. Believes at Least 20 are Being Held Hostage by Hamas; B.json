In addition to the 14 Americans killed, the U.S. believes that at least 20 are being held hostage by Hamas. This is a live picture of Gaza City, where the IDF, Israel Defense Forces, have been hammering targets following Hamas attacks, devastating surprise attack on Southern Israel over the weekend. Israel now says at least 1,200 people were killed in the terrorist assault. Hamas says 950 people have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war. The president on Tuesday apparently aiming a warning at Iran and its proxies like Hezbollah not to interfere in this war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Right now, that is 20 or more people according to Sullivan, that number could grow because, right now, we don't have a lot of answers as to these folks' whereabouts their conditions.So, the administration is working hour by hour. This is a top priority for them to try to get information about where these Americans are, if they are OK. And we know not only the Americans, but all of these hostages. This is something the administration is pushing to secure their release. They are working with countries who are able to pass messages along to Hamas to urge them to release these hostages immediately. And now, when secretary of state goes to Israel today, Secretary Blinken, we know this will be a top priority for him there as well to work with the Israelis to try to get answers, to try to figure out how to get these hostages home. And this is also just a major show of support after those devastating attacks we saw over the weekend. He will be meeting with top Israeli officials. We expect him to meet with Netanyahu, for example, to try to figure out what exactly the Israelis need. moving forward, how they can be supported by the U.S. Kasie.",

That is going to have a huge impact, as will the trauma of what seems likely to come, which looks like a full-scale Israeli move into Gaza, a place where civilians are packed in tight proximity and refugee camps separated by tiny passageways. This is going to be a very bloody affair, not just for Palestinians, but for Israeli reservists. So, that will ripple through the politics of those places and through the wider Arab world, for example. And that will condition how leaders in places like Saudi Arabia will react in Jordan, where there's a massive Palestinian diaspora. It's very hard, for instance, to see how the peace drive or the normalization of diplomatic relations effort that the U.S. was shepherding between Israel and the Saudis can go ahead anytime soon in the coming years. So, that's the regional impact. It'll also play out into U.S. politics.
