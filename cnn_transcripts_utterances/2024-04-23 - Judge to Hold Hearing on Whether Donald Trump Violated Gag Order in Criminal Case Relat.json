The New York judge is taking this all on this morning as the former president heads back to court. College campuses across the country grappling with growing pro- Palestinian protests, and the schools struggling to diffuse campus tension over Israel's war with Hamas. More arrests overnight. I'm Kate Bolduan with John Berman and Sara Sidner. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. SARA SIDNER, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Happening now, a live look at Trump Tower, a scene you'll become very familiar with where were standing by to see, and potentially here from Donald Trump before he heads directly to that gag order hearing. This morning for the first time since his historic criminal trial began, trial proceedings will be delayed while the judge first decides if Trump violated the gag order in this case as many as 10 times. That is what prosecutors are alleging. If the judge finds he did, there are some options. He could warn Trump. He could fine Trump. Or he could jail Donald Trump. All three on the table before day two of testimony resume. CNN's Brynn Gingras is live outside of court. Brynn, the contempt of court, a possibility for Donald Trump this morning. How will this hearing go down? And is there any sense of how long it might take before they get back to the crux of the case and the witness that had first taken the stand yesterday?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Sara, so the judge already said they're going to start this hearing at 9And what we expect is what we've seen previously in court filings from the prosecution. They believe Donald Trump has violated this gag order 10 times, as you said. And like you said, there are a couple options that they're asking for. They want the judge to fine Trump $1,000 for each time the judge believes that he may have violated this order. But they also said that they want the judge to remind Trump that he is a criminal defendant in this case. And because of that, that means that he's subject to court supervision, meaning they can put them in jail if he continues to violate this gag order. So we will see exactly how the judge rules on this, but it's certainly a hearing that we have been waiting for since we have seen many social media posts that have come into question. We have seen Donald Trump go to the cameras and talk about witnesses, which of course is part of this gag order. And just a reminder for the viewers as we get into this hearing, that gag order was put in place at the end of March and it forbids Trump from talking about or putting on social media anything disparagingly about the jurors in this case, the witnesses in this case also, also family members of the prosecution and the judge. So we'll see what the judge says when this hearing gets started at 9:30 this morning.",

Remember, he is the former publisher, like you said, of \"The National Enquirer.\" He's on the stand due to a subpoena. He had his own lawyers in the courtroom yesterday. And essentially what we've learned from the prosecution in openingstatements is they are going to lay out how they believe he was a coconspirator in the entire scheme that is sort of at the center of this entire case, the fact they believe that he helped Donald Trump and Michael Cohen find this story about Stormy Daniels, pay her off, and then keep it from the public eye. And it's very likely we are going to hear how David Pecker would do that numerous times for Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign, different examples of stories that they would quote, \"catch and kill\" to keep the negative, any negative stories about Donald Trump out of the spotlight. So it's likely we will hear how all those plans allegedly took place, and he's a main witness for that. Sara?",

And I'm not saying that Trump didn't violate some things technically in the order. But when you look at the allegations of the order, it's things like, well, there were reposts. There were things that he said about Michael Cohen, despite the fact, of course, that Cohen has been all over the issue with Trump.So I think the judge will probably look at some type of admonishment. I think he's going to say, look, are you trying to intimidate jurors? That doesn't seem to be the case, Mr. District Attorney, because we picked a jury fairly easily and without much consequence. We were able to get them in the box within a week. And then, whether or not they're spent some effort to intimidate witnesses. And I think that's an uphill battle, too for the district attorney's office. So have there been technical violations? I'd yes. But at the same time, even if you read his April the First order, I believe it was, where he talks about, the judge talks about that there is a First Amendment right. This is a political season. He has, the defendant Trump has a chance to respond to attacks and that type of thing. The argument will be made likely by Trump's team that the comments by Cohen and about Cohen are sort of tit-for-tat, and what may be good for the goose is good for the gander. But it wouldn't surprise me to see some small fine. I think that's probably the way the judge will go in this case for some of the violations.",

I think that likely there will be some type of monetary fine, but I think more than anything else, this is a chance for him to sort of scold the children in the classroom about behaving improperly. And so before he brings out the switches and the paddles and those kinds of things, he's going to give them a good scolding at the chalkboard, and that's what you're going to see probably at 9",

And so he really does begin to talk about how this works, the way that these stories come to him, the way that there's an effort put in place to keep them out of the media, and that type of thing, keep the stories, the salacious stories, at least, away from the news.And so it's a good witness to start with. And I think the prosecutor probably put him up first because he is a witness the defense is likely to attack somewhat as a conspirator and whether or not he was actually doing something that Trump may not have known the full extent of, that type of thing. But he doesn't have the same baggage that some of the witnesses we expect later in the case, like Cohen and maybe even Miss Daniels might have.",

And the jury is looking at everything they do. I used to tell clients don't even smoke a cigarette walking from the parking lot in because a juror may see you and any little thing may catch their attention, so just don't do it. And so I think it's important that they see that he's cuttable.He has one thing that might actually hurt the prosecution, and that is if he makes this whole idea of catch and kill sound normal, if he seems to say, look, this is just how we do it. This is the normal thing. This happens in all kinds of stuff. We've done it for politicians throughout my time as the owner of \"The Enquirer.\" If he talks about that and that seems to come across as something that there's nothing unusual here. There's nothing particularly nefarious about Trump's efforts to do this versus other politicians or other public figures, that begins to sort of take the edge off the idea of how this was just constructed solely to have some interference in the election. It becomes more of a this is just how things are done. If he does that, that could come back and be a problem that the district attorney's office has to overcome to show, in fact, this was an elicit conspiracy with criminal intent, which is ultimately what they have to have to prove.",

And so, there sort of still remains an interesting divide there, but undeniably there has certainly been antisemitic incidents that have also kind of happened in the surrounding of these events of these protests and have been in some instances, quite severe, led to violence, violent rhetoric. And so that is certainly undeniable, but there is also sort of ongoing conversation because there is actually quite not only Jewish students, but quite a contingent of Jewish faculty who are also navigating that space as both a Jewish member of our community, but also as someone who may have a diversity of viewpoints on this particular issue. And so I think very crucial to this has been, you how do we at the same time advocate for free expression, the academic expression of students and faculty on our campus, while also mitigating the fact that there is incidences of rhetoric that goes too far, of rhetoric that is inciting, at times violence, but also there is an important differentiation to know between what is happening on our campus, what is happening off campus, which is to say, people who are not affiliated with the university and what they are saying, and that is certainly having impact on people. But being able to differentiate that from the parties that are on campus and also always being specific about who are the actors in this and who do we hold accountable? And I think that is what our reporting has also aimed to do is to really identify that and to really make clear and avoid overgeneralizations that can be very harmful for all the communities involved in this.",

The other thing that is interesting is how they released it. So normally, we would have got a version before it was actually released, so we could prepare. This one was just put straight onto their own social media accounts, which is a different way of doing things. A Royal source told me it wasn't edited. We can't see anything in it that suggests it was manipulated any way, but the reason that is important is because the last picture they sent out was edited. It caused a storm of controversy and all sorts of conspiracy theories. So, I think this is a case of the palace sharing this moment. They have said they wanted to thank everyone for their best wishes to Louis, but also taking control of their own content, taking control of their own narrative, but also being as honest as possible, so they don't prompt all of these conspiracy theories that we had last time -- Kate.",
