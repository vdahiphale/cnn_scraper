We could get that answer any moment.But in an entirely different case, will Donald Trump be on trial this summer? The former president will soon leave Mar-a-Lago for a critical hearing inside a Florida federal court. This morning, the judge overseeing his classified documents case will hear arguments from Trump's team to dismiss charges or delay the trial. The trial was initially scheduled for May. Prosecutors now want July. But if Trump wins his delay, which has been a winning strategy so far, the trial might not start until after the election. And if he wins the presidency, he could then order the DOJ to drop his charges. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is outside the courthouse in Florida. I guess in the coming hours, what are we expecting to happen here just in light of this hearing that is going to be happening and the ask to throw the case out?",

Criminal defendants that are going to trial always get to make attempts to tell the judge, this case should be totally dismissed. And that's what Donald Trump's lawyers are doing today.There's a series of argument that they're going to need to over probably a serious of hearings. But today, Donald is not just any criminal defendant. And the argument his lawyers are going to be making is he was president, he took documents out of the White House, that's because he wanted to say they are his and they were not the presidential records that should belong in the federal government because he had the power as the president to say they we're personal records. That's the argument. We're going to hear from Trump's side today. But the Justice Department has been very clear since the very beginning, the National Archives has been clear, that is not how it works. The Presidential Records Act, which is what's going to be talked about in court today, that says that records just can't be deemed personal by the president if he sees fit. There are certain records that are the property of the U.S. government. And in a situation like this where their national security records, the Justice Department says it's criminally problematic for someone to take records even if they were the president while they was still in the White House if they where national security records because they could jeopardize the entire country and those records belong to the government and the people of America. So, that is what's at stake today. We're going to be watching to see what Judge Aileen Cannon does. There is quite a bit at stake for her. She previously is a judge who had ruled in favor of Trump, giving him a lot of deference as the former president. So, we'll see where she's leaning today. We don't expect a decision from her on this argument today and whether to dismiss the case. But it is quite a critical hearing where Trump is expected to be in court.",

But when you're talking to his team, they're really just waiting to see what happens with the district attorney. They are obviously happy that there are less charges, but they would like no charges at all. They would like to see Fani Willis pulled off the case. They would like to see a way for them to get out of that case all together.Now, when you look at the broader picture, we have seen Donald Trump now wanting to participate in these various legal trials, one today going to Fort Pierce. Keep in mind, there are no cameras. There are no speaking engagements. There is no opportunity to see the former president, yet he is still going. This is obviously not one of his traditional campaign stops in the courtroom. Instead, we are told that he wants to participate, that he has told people he wants to be there for every single day, every single hearing, up until this potential trial, partly because, and this is Katelyn Polantz who was just reporting this, that they want the judge to see him, and he wants the judge to see him, to show him as a willing participant in this trial. And that actually extends to the trial that we know is going to happen later this month in New York. I am told that Donald Trump is still planning and his team for how exactly it's going to look between a general campaign election trail and going to court every single day. Now, remember, in New York, this is a criminal case. He does have to be in court every day, but early on, there are some procedural days that he wouldn't have to be there, including jury selection. I am told that he wants to be there for every single part of this. So what this is going to look like is how a campaign goes on the trail, actually campaigns in these critical swing states, and then also, on the other hand, is in court every day. Trump himself saying, oh, I'll go to court in the morning, I'll campaign at night. When you're talking to his advisers, they acknowledge that this is likely not possible. So instead, they're looking at ways around that. Can they campaign on Wednesdays? That's the one day in New York where they're not in court, as well as Saturdays, obviously, no court on the weekends. Can they send surrogates into these critical battleground states? This is all being figured out now, but we are really in unprecedented times as we head towards this actual trial date. And as you see, Donald Trump gearing up to run for president, gearing up to try to go back into the White House with all of these impending trials and legal issues.",

In fact, she was just here last week in Milwaukee talking about abortion rights. She will be in Minnesota today, as you said.And it's really part of the Biden-Harris campaign's plan to try and remind American voters that this election, in fact, is not the same. Yes, the same two candidates are at the top of the ticket, both Joe Biden and Donald Trump, but there are many different issues. Of course, first and foremost, is the Supreme Court overturning Roe versus Wade, and the fight for reproductive freedom is at the center of this campaign. But with the vice president visiting this clinic in Minneapolis, it raises a couple points. One, that there is no state, really, in this part of the country, in the Upper Midwest, that is politically secure for this campaign. They realize that, so they're going there to campaign as well in a political context. But conversations we are having with voters in the week after the State of the Union Address certainly is bringing up this point. We had a long conversation with a certified midwife here in Milwaukee who said abortion rights is one of the reasons that she, in fact, is supporting President Biden and Vice President Harris. She also had this to say about what she thought of the president's address last week, a week ago today, and why that motivates her in this campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
