He looks to those who`ve come before him, like Wang Qun, in the U.S. now for more than a year and a half.

      "sentences": "This temple near in completion in India`s holy city of Ayodhya has divided the nation. Built on contested land, theconstruction of the Ram Mandir is said to have cost about $180 million and is seen as a political win for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It`s also widely expected to help him secure historic third term in office later this year. But why are these 1.12 hectares of land so controversial? To understand, we need to go back hundreds of years. In the 16th Century, the land was home to a mosque, the Babri Masjid. But Hindus believed this site is where Lord Ram, one of the most irrefutable deities in Hinduism, was born. They say the mosque was built on the ruins of an old Hindu temple. As the dispute escalated, in the 19th Century, authorities sealed the mosque to both Muslims and Hindus. In the early 1980s, a group of Hindu nationalist organizations, which include in Modi`s Bharatiya Janata Party, started a movement to build a new temple at the site. A campaign which stirred strong emotions in India ramped up in 1989. The issue is credited with helping the BJP win more than half the seats in the 1991 state elections in India`s most significant Hindu vote base, Uttar Pradesh. One year later, right-wing Hindu mobs stormed the site and demolished the mosque. It sparked some of the worst violence in India since its independence, with more than 2,000 people killed in riots around the country. In 2019, after decades of legal battles, India`s Supreme Court issued a ruling that said the destruction of the Islamic structure was an egregious violation of the rule of law, but granted Hindu groups permission to build a temple there while giving the Muslim community another plot of land, officially ending the dispute. But the ruling was seen as a blow towards India`s Muslim minority, many of whom say the government sees them as second-class citizens. A few months later, Modi laid the foundation stone for the Ram Mandir. Since then, the city of Ayodhya itself has undergone a full infrastructural makeover. It has a new airport and its roads, railways and other historical sites have been revamped. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
