Well, I'd like to point out the fact that the American people fired Donald Trump and we're not going back. But the fact is I agree with much of what H.R. McMaster said. I would almost couch it a little bit different. I would say that Trump, if he was successful, it was in spite of himself. It's because at one point in time in his administration, he had competent folks in his inner circle, H.R. McMaster, James Mattis, you know, various --various -- John Bolton after H.R., a number of folks that actually were steady hands, practiced national security experts, that made some recommendations, couched them in a way that was reasonable to Donald Trump. And Donald Trump signed off on them. He did that with the national security strategy, with the Russia strategy, which I helped author. So, that doesn't exist anymore. The people that would be in a second Trump administration would be sycophants, would be folks that were entirely loyal and would be engaging in flattery and a game of one-up (INAUDIBLE).

So, if the French government wasn't investigating other apps, they wouldn't necessarily be bringing in their CEOs for questioning.

Variety of reasons, but I think what it mostly comes down to is the fact that Telegram is really committed to free speech over privacy, and so they are less likely to monitor things, they're less likely to pull stuff down, and that's why it has become a hotbed for a lot of, you know, terrorist organizations, criminals, et cetera.
