He'll be remembered for stepping aside and also a return to democratic norms. So after, of course, we had for the first time in our almost 250 years, a break in the peaceful transition of power, we saw Biden not only accept power with responsibility and humility, but he's also leaving it that way. He'll surpass FDR as far as legislation. He'll be known as one of the most progressive presidents in all of American history. And certainly anyone even coming in in the 21st century will have a really hard time. His lifelong service, of course, and that we can once again return to these norms and these sort of accepted values that we know Joe Biden for, for example, empathy. Before it seemed selfish, like he wanted to finish two terms. He wanted to be president. And now we understand that he sees our anguish.

Well, as you mentioned, Netanyahu's speech to Congress was less partisan than the last one that he gave in 2015, when he openly attacked the then Obama administration and openly called for Republicans to torpedo President Obama's plan to strike a nuclear deal with Iran.So in that sense, the speech was more conciliatory to President Biden than he had been to his predecessor, President Obama. On the other hand, as you also mentioned, it was a full-throated defense, not necessarily of Israel's position, but of the Netanyahu strategy for prosecuting the war in Gaza. He defended against criticism that his government has been denying Palestinians humanitarian aid. He defended criticism that his government is resisting a ceasefire. And he doubled down on criticisms of anybody, especially protesters in America, who he called useful idiots of Iran for objecting to these practices. So while it had a veneer of bipartisanship, deep down, it was a very partisan speech in the sense that it was partisan in terms of Israel's politics and in terms of Netanyahu's personal politics and his personal self-interest. That's my take.",

And in Israel, of course, the main speculation is that he's doing it to preserve his own political standing, that once the war ends, he'll be deposed and possibly prosecuted and possibly jailed.So that's on the Israeli side. On the Washington side, it's very clear that he's been resisting the Biden administration's efforts to come to terms that would allow for the ceasefire deal to move forward under the specifications that President Biden announced a couple of months ago and that the U.N. Security Council endorsed. And he just won't do it. And now that President Biden has taken himself out of the running for reelection, you know, the November elections, it seems like Netanyahu is content to wait it out. It seems that he no longer believes that President Biden can bring the pressure to bring him to the deal that President Biden wants. So it seems as if he's going to just stick his ground and resist calls from President Biden or Vice President Harris or any Democrats, for that matter, who think that he should make any concessions that might make a deal more possible at this point.",

And that's exactly what the slow walking is meant to do, is to delay and thereby deny the ability of both sides to strike this deal.Now, of course, Hamas has its own domestic reasons for not coming to the terms that President Biden has laid out. So there's plenty of blame to go around. But it's certainly true that, at least from the Biden administration's perspective, they think that Netanyahu should do more, could do more. And again, a majority of Israelis agree with that. So I don't think it's controversial or even harsh to say that Netanyahu is suggesting that Netanyahu is sabotaging the ceasefire deal. He's certainly slow walking it, and that in itself is sabotage as far as anyone is practically concerned.",

We have been seeing very heavy rains throughout the day here in Beijing. It is from a separate system. It's not related to that typhoon, but it is representative of the immense rain China has seen. So that's why this typhoon is causing so much concern as it moves closer to the Chinese shoreline.A big issue has been in the Philippines, specifically in Manila, where we have seen rescues, we have seen vehicles submerged underwater, people's homes are underwater. It's a very serious scene there. In fact, some new data that we've been getting shows that about 55,000 people have been evacuated, 16,000 of which are families. So the human impact on the Philippines from the typhoon is tremendous. It has led to schools being canceled, businesses have had to close, and about 150 flights were canceled. I should point out that the damage that we're seeing in the Philippines is not because the typhoon hit the Philippines itself. It actually went along the coastline. It didn't actually hit the Philippines proper, but it is full of strong wind, heavy rain, and the storm surge and such is just causing that many problems. Also Taiwan, dealing with the aftermath of the typhoon, heavy rain there again, but also very strong winds that have been very difficult for people to stand up. One thing that we have seen in Taiwan is that the mountainous terrain actually prevented the typhoon from moving closer inland. That is a good thing, but it did cause some problems in areas that thought that they wouldn't be as hard hit as other parts of that region. Finally though, Rosemary, we are watching the arrival here in China. There is a very good chance that the storm could weaken, which would be good news considering all of the extreme flooding and weather that we've seen here in China so far this summer.",

But really, this entire part of the French capital really blocked off to ordinary traffic because of that extraordinary ceremony we expect tomorrow along the River Seine. The first time that an Olympics has been organized really in the city center, which means, of course, for Parisians that it's much harder to get around the city. And that's led to a lot of grumbling, as you can imagine. Very difficult if you don't have the proper accreditation, because they've had to secure such a large part of the river. It is 20,000 Parisians, Rosemary, who have had to be checked their identities, their security status in order that they can ensure that that opening ceremony happens safely and securely. And really, the river is all decked out now, very little traffic along its banks in order to make sure that it's safe. It promises to be spectacular. We don't have word yet of exactly what artists are going to be involved, but there are rumors circulating of Lady Gaga, Celine Dion and Parisian authorities certainly have made this ambitious bet that they would hold it in the river. You have to imagine that the boats will carry the athletes along the River Seine through all the marvels of the French capital. There are questions, of course, about the weather, whether the rain will dampen those expectations. But for now, Parisian authorities appear to have succeeded to meet that pledge that they would hold the opening ceremony there. There is really no plan B, so they're hoping at this point that the weather holds. But for ordinary Parisians, these have been difficult times. What the mayor's office says and keeps telling them is that, look, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity to showcase what they believe is the most beautiful city in the world, urging patience and calm. Many Parisians have left altogether, assuming that the French capital would be fairly chaotic. It is certainly difficult to get around, but there is growing enthusiasm about this opening ceremony and the spectacular nature of it, what it suggests, what it promises to show the world of the French capital, Rosemary.",

When you consider the number of events, the number of people who made their way here already, Rosemary, we've heard of these allegations. An investigation has been opened by the IOC of spying down further south in France, where Canada's women's football team is preparing to take on New Zealand's allegations of spying in the shape of a drone.One member of the enlarged Canadian team who apparently used a drone to spy on the training of the New Zealand women's football training. That now being investigated, the French press even reporting that that particular person has been sentenced already to eight months with a suspended sentence. So that's one of the controversies already hitting the Games, those allegations of spying. But also there are fears about COVID. We've heard already, Rosemary, that several members of the Australian women's water polo team have tested positive. Now, we've heard authorities reassuring people Paris is not Tokyo. And if there is -- if there are some COVID clusters, there are special procedures in place to ensure that other athletes don't get sick. So those are the really two big stories that already have hit the Games, even before that opening ceremony takes place. And these inevitably are part of the Olympics. Such a huge endeavor, again, such spectacular ambition on the part of Brisbane authorities who really wanted to make these Olympics like no others. Still, the hope is that by the time we get to the opening ceremony tomorrow, those controversies early on will have been overshadowed by the opening ceremony along the River Seine and all that it promises in terms of spectacle, Rosemary.",

I Appreciate it.And Paris is bracing for 15 million visitors to attend the Summer Olympics. If you are one of them, maybe you're wondering how you can blend into the city without being a tourist cliche. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne has some advice. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SASKYA VANDOORNE, CNN SR. PRODUCER: Ah, Paris. Millions of people flock here every year for the culture, couture, cuisine. But how do you avoid being a cliche? Well, this summer, the Olympics are coming to town and in a city that 7.5 times smaller than New York, trust me, it's easy to spot a tourist. There are a few simple ways to navigate Paris like a local. I'll be your guide. Suivez-moi (Follow me). A classic faux pas, asking for alternative milk with your coffee. Almond Milk, please UNKNOWN (translated): Sorry, Madam, I don't have Almond Milk here. VANDOORNE: Short and black. That's the traditional way. Craving a baguette.

      "sentences": "Merci beaucoup. Tra-dee-si-onThose in the know will avoid traveling by car. Paris traffic is notoriously chaotic. Use a Veline, the city's public bike-sharing service. They're pretty much everywhere and cycle lanes are plentiful. The city's metros are often super congested and in the summer, unbearably hot. So try walking instead. In Paris, it's easy to get distracted, but beware of pickpockets. Don't keep your phone in your back pocket and do keep an eye on your belongings. If you're lucky enough to be here for the Games, the first thing to know is that tourist sites like these have been turned into Olympic venues. So it's probably best to avoid them. Places like Trocadero near the Eiffel Tower, or right here at Place de la Concorde, metro stations will be closed and areas will be shut off to the public. Make sure you know how to pronounce the event venues properly. This place is called Les Invalides. It's a former military hospital. It's pronounced Ahn-vah-leed.",
