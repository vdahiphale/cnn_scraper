The derailment of another Norfolk Southern freight train prompted a temporary shelter in place for nearby residents, and CNN's Polo Sandoval joins me now. Polo, we're getting some new wrinkles of information about what was on that train yesterday. Very interesting. What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. In the last couple of hours, we heard from an initial at Norfolk Southern, who is the owner and operator of the train that derailed in Springfield, Ohio, yesterday afternoon, confirming that the train was transporting hazardous material. However, that it was not on train cars that derailed. Roughly 20 of the 212 train cars that were going south from northern Ohio down to Birmingham ended up leaving the tracks.Officials there saying that this accident happened in an area that does not have any protected water source. And most importantly, according to the state's EPA director, that there was no release of any sort of chemicals into the air, soil, or water. Those certainly continuing to keep a close eye on the situation there. They're saying, as you're about to hear from that official from Norfolk Southern, that those hazardous materials were on the train cars that were not affected by yesterday's derailment.

The rest of the train was made up of mixed freight, a lot of steel, finished automobiles, and a lot of the cars that were actually derailed were empty boxcars.(END VIDEO CLIP) SANDOVAL: So, sure, there were many of those that were empty boxcars, but there were two tanker train cars that were certainly concerning. I should say four of them. Two of them contained diesel exhaust fluid while the other two contained residual amounts of polyacrylamide, which is described as a water-soluble solution, often used to treat wastewater. But again, an important point that we heard from officials there in Springfield, Ohio, is that even those four tanker train cars that ended up being derailed did not have any sort of leakage. So that's certainly important, and no spillage. But of course the question of why did this happen, especially a month after the situation in East Palestine, Ohio, that is certainly still something that authorities will have to answer in an effort to try to prevent this from happening again. Because, Jim, as we now know that there were hazardous materials being transported on that train, we now know that it certainly could have been much worse than what we saw play out yesterday.",

But those efforts up on Capitol Hill have really stalled.First Democrats were unable when they had control of both the House and Senate to get voting rights legislation pass, in part due to the Senate filibuster. That rule requiring a 60-vote threshold in order to advance legislation. But now they are facing an even steeper climb as Republicans are in control in the House. Now, even as the president has pushed for voting rights legislation, there are still many activists who are frustrated with the White House and members of Congress for not getting voting rights signed into law. But the president once again trying to use his position, the power of the presidency, to make that case, and doing it today against the backdrop of a very important moment in civil rights history as he walked across that bridge just as hundreds of activists did 58 years ago.",

We've been disappointed because we weren't able to pass significant voting rights legislation in this president's first two years in office, and we note that it may be more difficult now.But, Jim, here's the point. This attack on democracy and voting continues. In 2023 alone, and we're not even into just the third month, there have been 150 more restrictive voting bills introduced in 32 states, bills to eliminate vote by mail, to create a situation where you have longer lines, to further restrict voter IDs in some states to require people to show proof of citizenship when they vote. So this movement against American democracy and voting continues unabated. I think the test for the president will be for him to use the powers of the presidency, to lobby the Congress, to persuade the Congress and to make a case amongst the American people that this issue is not just about black Americans or Latinos or disabled Americans or young Americans, but that this is about American democracy. We are, today, spending billions in Ukraine to protect the democracy in Ukraine against Russian aggression.

I remember when I was covering election night and how the Trump campaign was just livid with FOX. So I can see why FOX was concerned about that.But, Oliver, were you surprised to see how the anchors of the network's political coverage were weighing in because there are quotes from them as well?",

I think in the past couple of weeks, we've seen a lot of detail about how Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, some of these people were reacting after the election in the wake when viewers were upset. But you don't necessarily expect to see that perhaps from the people who are supposed to be leading the so-called news division over at FOX. And in this report, you see some, you know, some evidence that these people were also concerned about the feelings of individuals, Trump voters who were watching the network.In one e-mail that \"The New York Times\" obtained from Bret Baier, who is the chief Washington anchor over at FOX News and the face really of election night over there, I want to read to you what he said. He wrote, \"Jay Wallace,\" the president over at FOX, and he said about the Arizona call, \"It's hurting us. The sooner we pull it, even if it gives us major egg, and put it back in his column, the better we are in my opinion.\" So you have Bret Baier talking about putting Arizona in the Trump column. Of course it never was in the Trump column because Biden ultimately won that state. Just because he said in another part of this report that it was hurting the viewers' feelings. He said it was -- it became really hurtful having to take this viewer feedback as the face of the network. And so this is really striking to see because it's not Tucker Carlson, not Sean Hannity, but Bret Baier over at FOX really worried about how the viewers were reacting.",

They call races as soon as they're confident in the math. But over at FOX, it's obviously another story.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, this was a pretty interesting study. I think so many exercise studies sort of look at things in a bit of a binary way. If you do this much activity, you get these benefits and if compared to no activity. And I think what the researchers here wanted to know was what if it was less than the currently recommended amount of activity? But if you, for example, said what happen to people who do half that amount of activity, how much benefit do they get? And first of all they described the types of activity as brisk activities. Think of these as moderate intensity, walking fast, you know, pushing a lawn mower, playing tennis. Things like that. Things where you can still talk but probably can't sing. They wanted that degree of breathlessness. They looked at 30 million people through this meta analysis over 10 years and here's what they found. It is pretty interesting. The sweet spot really in the middle there, 150 minutes a week of activity which is what is recommended gave people significant reduction in mortality as you see there, but if you did half that you still got a pretty significant reduction, 23 percent. Even more if you exercise 300 minutes. And you could see what happens to cardiovascular disease. Do you get as much benefit as you're doing 75 minutes of activity? No, but you're still getting quite a bit. And the same for cancer even. So this was really interesting, trying to give some context as what is the value of even a little bit of activity. Now, it was interesting. It wasn't sort of a curve where it kept going the more you did always the better. If you start to try and find what was the point of diminishing returns in terms of activity and the benefit on health, you found that around 300 minutes a week typically so double of what is currently recommended, that's when the benefits really started to plateau. So again, not saying you can't do more activity than that but if it's the benefit of health in terms of mortality and health disease and even cancer, around 300 minutes was the max but 150 minutes is the sweet spot but you get credit, as this studied showed, for doing 75 minutes a week.
