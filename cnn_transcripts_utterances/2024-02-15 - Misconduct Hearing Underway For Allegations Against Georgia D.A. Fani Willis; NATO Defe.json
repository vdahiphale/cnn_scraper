It's supposed to begin March 25 with jury selection here in New York. This is the case where the Manhattan district attorney has charged Donald Trump with 34 counts of falsifying business records as a way to pay off his personal attorney to reimburse him to keep Stormy Daniels quiet so that she wouldn't hurt his 2016 presidential campaign prospects. Quite a significant case. Trump's lawyer says that this case will take two months and it is election interference for Trump to be on trial and not on the campaign trail between March and May. Now, the judge says back to him, is that your legal argument? That is not a legal argument. That's the words of the judge today to Donald Trump's lawyers. It's not a legal argument that you have politics to deal with and a campaign to deal with. Donald Trump will be in the courtroom for these, we would very much expect as a criminal defendant. The judge says he also expects this case and this trial to last six weeks. Once the jury is seated, that they won't be in trial much past the end of May or even the middle of May of this year before the Republican nomination is solidified with its conventions over the summer. But the way this will work, Donald Trump as a criminal defendant has a right and is very much expected to be before the jury of peers on this case. That would be 12 people and six alternates in that courtroom in Manhattan beginning in March. And they will be sitting four days a week, basically for the entirety of a business day.

What the judge here presiding over this case, Scott McAfee, is most concerned with is he wants to see evidence of a financial benefit, a personal benefit from this personal relationship that Fani Willis has had with the man she tapped to be the lead prosecutor and take on the former President, Donald Trump, and 18 other co-defendants, and they appear as the day got on that we weren't going to hear from anybody. It didn't seem that any of those that had been subpoenaed wanted to be here to testify. In fact, one of those that was called initially was a no-show. She ended up appearing via Zoom, Robin Yeartie, a former employee of the district attorney's office, a roommate of Fani Willis, somebody who was a long-time friend of Fani Willis. And she testified under oath that she observed and was told by Ms. Willis that a relationship began with Nathan Wade as early as 2019. That is important because in a written legal response by Fani Willis, she said that this relationship began in 2022 after she had already hired Nathan Wade. Now, I mentioned the financial issue here that the judge wants to see right now. Nathan Wade is on the stand and it appears to be all about his credibility. Did he mislead the public when he swore under an affidavit? Did he mislead or mischaracterize things in divorce proceeding documents? That is what Ashley Merchant, the defense attorney who initially leveled these claims and brought them to light about this personal relationship, this affair as she called it between Willis and Wade, that is what she's drilling down on right now. And as this hearing continues, it goes without saying that this has been a mortifying experience for the District Attorney's Office. You see Nathan Wade up there on the stand. He appears, he comes across, you know, smirking, uncomfortable. And he is repeatedly being questioned about whether or not he told the full truth about his relationship and whether or not this was a financial profit for Ms. Willis. We expect more questioning to happen as these hours tick away. But again, this has just been a very, very bad day so far for the D.A.'s office. Bianna.",

In the New York hush money case on the other hand, even if he's more legal trouble there, in terms of the charges against him being very serious, just 31 percent of Americans believe that they are very serious. Now, if you look on a slightly different question, did Trump do something illegal? Again, look here, the majority of Americans believe, in fact, he did do something illegal on the Georgia election case, while in the New York hush money case, just 34 percent, just a third believe he did something illegal there.

I mean, obviously by that time, Super Tuesday would have happened and he would have obviously gotten enough delegates to be the presumptive nominee. He is technically already the presumptive nominee.

So, we shouldn't use that as the sort of silver lining or silver bullet, if you will, in a democratic strategy running against somebody as dangerous and as much of an existential threat to our democracy as Donald Trump is when we can already use what people have seen images in their own TVs of January 6th. When we can already use what Donald Trump has said himself, not only about what he would do on day one, which would be acting like a dictator, but implementing the kinds of draconian, horrific policies that would take away our rights and freedoms, that would, you know, continue to destroy our democracy, that would hand over our allies in Europe to Putin, right? There are plenty of things that Democrats can underline, will underline from now until the election that we've already seen resonate with the American people. And look, in terms of these cases, we've already seen polling that if there is a conviction, Donald Trump's numbers go way down. But even if there isn't, all of these cases might work for him. Like you said, he will lock up this nomination probably in March. It has worked for him for his base, but it is not a popular thing with independents and with Republican suburban voters that he needs to get in order to win in November. They don't want the chaos.

What I think Democrats will continue to focus on are the facts of the case, right? That hasn't changed, regardless of what's going on with Fani Willis and even if she gets kicked off of this case. The facts of this case have not changed and they are still a very, very strong set of facts that go against a former President who tried to do everything that he can to overturn a fair and free election. And that right there is the underlying, incredibly powerful message that Democrats will continue to take to the American people because if anything is true in all of this, is that Donald Trump continues to prove with everything that he says and does, that he will want to cling to power and has tried to cling to power no matter what it takes. There was a quote that I just heard him say in one of the sound bites that you all rolled that was just kind of, I mean it really took me aback. He said, look, even if I'm guilty, there's no crime. And to me, that just says that this man has a mindset that he can do no wrong, that he is above the law, that out of everything that is happening to him, he is pissed off not because he got caught, but because he doesn't think that the law should apply to him. And so another really, I think, important message for Democrats is to underscore the fact that no one is above the law, not even a former President of the United States, and that is what each and every one of these single -- of every one of these cases is going to prove. Even if it doesn't come out that he's guilty, it's going to prove that our system of justice holds everyone to the exact same standard.",

Now, that's a huge setback if that happens, and that also will take a long, long time. Fani Willis actually got herself disqualified off a piece of this case two years ago when it was still in the investigative phase, and that piece of the case has still not be reassigned.

And why you played that particular clip is so important because that man, Nathan Wade, who is one of the lead counsel in this case, had filed affidavits to suggest that he did not have any relationship, that he was not engaged with her in some respect, that he did not have receipts of different restaurants or bars or anything else with respect to finding Willis.

We're talking about whether there was, in fact, this relationship. This judge is holding this hearing with the express purpose of figuring out whether there was a financial benefit, whether there is credibility for the people who were testifying -- Nathan Wade, and possibly even Fani Willis. She is on the witness list. There have been others testified today, including a former friend who says they were involved in a romantic relationship even before he was appointed counsel. That's important because they have said that they were not involved in any relationship. You've heard from a former law partner and associate and counsel for Nathan Wade, who was very aggressive in his decision not to want to give any information. He does not want to be seen as having disclosed any attorney, client, this judge wants this hearing, wants to get to the bottom of it, because remember, everything is at stake as to whether this trial goes forward, this team prosecutes, or it is in a slow walk for another agency to appoint special counsel.",

      "sentences": "That's right. So many of the comments, statements being made by NATO Defense Ministers, by the NATO SecretaryGeneral that you just heard there, going in and coming out of this meeting have been about not just, of course, re-pledging the unified support to Ukraine, but also really trying to counter that criticism and the impact that it might have. Because, I think, Bianna, you're right, it did rattle European allies earlier this week. Last night's doubling down didn't go quite as far as Saturday's comments from the former president who said at the time not just that every NATO ally had to pay, but that he would encourage Moscow to attack. And I think the reason it rattled everyone so much is because this concern here in the European continent that the latest security assessment is that Moscow could well try and test a NATO ally and this within the next few years. So that solidity of the support that there is for that fundamental pledge, the Article Five of NATO, the common defense promise, is so important right now for Europeans, especially where we are with the war with Ukraine. So, it did dominate a great deal of the sentiment going into this. And we heard it also, by the way, from the American defense secretary, although he's not been here in person. Lloyd Austin did address his counterparts as the day kicked off, saying that this was about NATO. It was about Ukraine and that the United States would stand unwavering, that they would not surrender any more than Ukraine would. So, a strong social support there for an alliance that is really looking to go much further than it has already to funding the war effort. Now, we have been hearing a lot this last day also about the American money now held up in Congress. Lloyd Austin saying that he believed it would make its way to where it needed to go. But clearly a lot of concern now that beyond the words of the former American President, the divisions within the Republican Party clearly on display with regard to getting this bill onto the floor of the House could lead to further delays. And I think that's been given fresh momentum, the pressure there is to get the money to where it needs to go. By what we've seen on the ground in Ukraine only yesterday, that successful taking down of a Russian warship really suggests that the U.K. Defense Minister as he arrived here in Brussels, that Ukraine has a chance of winning. And I think that message here is a hopeful one for the first time in a very long time with regard to Kyiv's hopes should the support continue.",

And he even said this yesterday, it's unclear why Congressman Mike Turner chose to come out with this in such a public way. Here's what we've been able to learn to this point about this system or about this capability. According to multiple sources familiar with the intelligence, this relates to a nuclear anti-satellite capability that the Russians are developing. Keyword there, developing. It is not operational yet. It is not a threat to U.S. satellites yet, and it's certainly not a threat to the U.S. at this point. It's also unclear, according to sources, whether it's nuclear-powered and uses some sort of electro-magnetic pulse or electronic warfare to try to disable satellites, or whether it has a legitimate nuclear warhead and tries to use a nuclear explosion to disable satellites. Crucially though, again, this system is in development and it's not an operational system, so some have accused Turner of over-blowing the threat here. But clearly, it is a significant capability even as the Russians are working on it. The question, of course, why is that? And that's because, first, the U.S. has the greater concern of the militarization of space. But second, the U.S. also has its nuclear commanding control satellites in space, as well as its early warning and early detection satellites in space, and any threat to these, the U.S. views as a major threat, nuclear command and control is obviously something the U.S. views very seriously and any threat to that would be and the U.S. has suggested it would respond forcefully to a threat to those. And then, of course, early warning satellites or what the U.S. government uses to see what's happening and figure out the best way to respond and essentially to have good situational awareness of what's happening. So, any threat to all of this and this is a threat even if it's one down the road is something the U.S. will take seriously. Lastly, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said they'd have more to say on this soon. We are very much waiting.",
