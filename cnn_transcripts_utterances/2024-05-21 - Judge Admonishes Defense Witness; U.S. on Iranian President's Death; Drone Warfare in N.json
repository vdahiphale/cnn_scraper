DIAMOND And the Israeli prime minister also calling this a \"disgrace and a distortion of reality\" vowing that it will not deter Israel from continuing to carry out its war in Gaza, and it will not deter Israel from accomplishing its goal, as he has laid it out, of defeating Hamas. But this notion of moral equivalency of carrying out the search for arrest warrants on both Israel as well as Hamas is something that Hamas actually picked up on themselves as well. In their statement reacting to this request for warrants, Hamas says quote, that it strongly condemned the attempts of the ICC prosecutor to equate victims with aggressors by issuing arrest warrants against the number of Palestinian resistance leaders without legal basis. Now, what is ultimately clear here is that the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants for war crimes as well as crimes against humanity on both sides. On the Hamas side, they focus in particular on the murder of civilians on October 7th, the taking of hostages, the sexual violence that has been committed by Hamas against hostages as well as against women on October 7th.

VILLALONA: So, we know from the very beginning, from opening statements, that, look, the prosecution was going to have to deal with the credibility issues of Michael Cohen. So that was no big surprise. But I will say that the defense did land a blow in the sense that they did put him out as a thief. I don't think the prosecution when they directed Michael Cohen brought that out or flesh that out that actually Michael Cohen benefited a lot by taking this money and charging, and access to Donald Trump. But still, in the end it's going to come down to closing arguments, and the prosecution is going to have to bring it home as to despite Michael Cohen being a thief, despite Mr. Cohen having lied before, despite Michael Cohen having some kind of a debtor against Donald Trump, that you can still believe what he's saying as to the material issues in this case. Look, Paula, I've tried dozens of cases, and usually witnesses, you don't get the perfect witness. They are no angels. You don't get the perfect witness. I said this before. When you cast a play in hell, there are no angels to play the part. So I wasn't expected Michael Coleman to be this perfect witness. But if you bring that to the attention of the jury, and show the jury how his testimony could be corroborated, then it's more likely that a jury will be able to accept Michael Cohen.

This has been an ongoing conflict for more than 70 years since the end of China's civil war. But this particular administration is quite infuriating for the powers that be, the communist leaders in Beijing, because not only do you have President Lai Ching-te, who six years ago stated that he was in support of Taiwan Independence, even though he's now toned down those views as president. He also has a vice president who served until very recently as the U.S. -- the envoy to the United States in Washington. That's Hsiao Bi-khim, the vice president.
