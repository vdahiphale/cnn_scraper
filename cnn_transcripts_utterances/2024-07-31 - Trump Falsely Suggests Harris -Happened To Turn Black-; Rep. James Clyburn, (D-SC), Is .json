It seems to be evidence that victims families have been pleading for to be released for years. So are they closer to any answers?Well, the head of 9/11 justice who lost his father in the attacks is going to join us. Plus, one of the political leaders of Hamas assassinated. It's a move the White House says, well, complicate efforts to get a ceasefire in hostage deal negotiated with Hamas. And it comes just hours after a top Hezbollah commander was killed. We're live on the ground in the Middle East with new details. And leading this hour, Donald Trump making a play for Black voters, speaking at a conference of Black journalists this afternoon. But the interview was not friendly with the president -- former president repeatedly calling one of the moderators rude, falsely claiming that Kamala Harris, quote, \"happened to turn Black\" a few years ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've known her a long time, indirectly, not directly, very much. And she was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black. And now she wants to be known as Black. So I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?",

ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: You definitely, Jake, you know, heard some gasps in the crowd at that point, particularly when the former president questioned the race, the identity, the ethnicity of the vice president. That's like, just to paint the picture here, I mean, this is NABJ. This is the National Association of Black Journalists. So, you have many Black women in the crowd as well who are hearing, you know, the former president at this point, who had already been disrespectful at that point to one of the moderators, ABC's Rachel Scott. And you haven't basically sharing a stage with three Black women asking respectful questions, but good driven questions, and then turning to questioning the race of the vice president. I mean, there were definitely some that were surprised in the crowd. And you heard that. And look, that was only one piece of this really unusual event thus far in the campaign. The former president also kind of went back to his usual playbook of spreading falsehoods about immigration, trying to almost, you know, point to, you know, soaring border crossings and illegal immigration, almost as a way to sort of pit the immigrant community against the Black community. He once again was asked about his Black jobs comment during the debate. He dodged questions on his pick for vice president for his running mate, JD Vance. So just -- I mean, the -- throughout the room there was tension kind of hanging over the room beforehand as journalists and attendees just prepared for this event. But that, that one where he questioned the vice president's identity will definitely go down as one of the more sort of moments we look back on when reflecting on this.",

Because based on the unhinged and unprofessional commentary directed toward President Trump by certain members of the media, many media elites certainly or clearly want to see us remain divided. This is unacceptable. It goes on to say, today's biased and rude treatment from certain hostile members of the media will backfire massively. You would think that the media would have learned something from their repeat episodes of fake outrage ever since President Trump first came down the escalator in 2015 but some refused to get it.This will be their undoing in 2024.

They didn't get that. They got a lot of going around the question, they got a lot of avoiding the question and a lot of attacks on the moderators, but not substantive answers to many of the questions asked. Although, you know, he should be given credit for showing up into a place where he was going to get some hard questions that any candidate should be able to field and to answer.And there is also a lot of consternation, to be honest with you, about whether or not this was the right thing to do without having both candidates here, whether or not to go forward. But, you know, look, if someone could potentially become the next president of the United States, any journalist is going to want to take that opportunity to ask questions. And in particular, the Black community has some very specific questions. And one of the things that I think he could have done that he didn't, it didn't seem he did his homework on some of the questions asked, particularly one asked about Sonya Massey, the woman who was a mother killed in her own home after calling police to help her, to protect her, and ended up dying within seconds of what no one can figure out why the officer responded that way. He was fired. But he said, I don't know, really about this case, but I think maybe, and it was like, well, would you give him immunity, you've talked about giving police immunity, and he sort of waffled on that question. But he didn't see that he had done his homework on questions that would be pretty obvious for a candidate to come into an NABJ, a National Association of Black Journalists, to have to be able to answer.

Haniyeh, who openly celebrated Hamas massacre of hundreds of Israeli civilians on October 7th, has been on Israel's kill list for months.

And so, you know, where -- where we stand at the moment, Iran has many ways it can hit back.

Evidence families of those who were killed on 9/11 have been asking to be unsealed for years now. CNN is still waiting for that evidence to hit the public docket.We will be sure to show it to you when it does. Remember, the 9/11 commission established by Congress said in 2004 that they found, quote, no evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded, unquote, al-Qaeda. Now since that report 20 years ago, a slow drip from court cases and major pieces of information redacted by U.S. government officials have come out. One trove of evidence came last month. This shows Omar al-Bayoumi, whom the FBI confirmed was at the time a Saudi intelligence asset who supported two lead hijackers from 9/11 filming this chilling video that we're showing you right now. This appears to be him casing the U.S. Capitol as the attacks were being planned in 1999. Here's one part of that newly released, more than hour long video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE (though translator): We greet you, the esteemed brothers, and we welcome you from Washington. Washington, the American capital city. This is the Congress. Here is where the decisions are made and the procedures are taken. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Brett, you were in court today more than 200 exhibits were unsealed. What is your main takeaway?BRETT EAGLESON, PRESIDENT, 9/11 JUSTICE: The main takeaway is, wow. Shocking. This is the first time that the 9/11 families have seen, presented in a full story all the evidence that our legal team, former FBI agents, former national security officials, have amassed over the past 23 years about the Saudi Arabian government's involvement in 9/11. Now, it's interesting you note that you mentioned the 9/11 commission report on your lead in. And all I heard today from the Kingdom lawyers were commission report, commission report, commission report. Their story hasn't changed. They're still relying on the '04 commission report. Everything that we've talked about today is post commission report. The video which you just presented to your audience was not even seen by the 9/11 commission. So as far as we're concerned, the 9/11 commission report is null and void. We need to rewrite the history of 9/11 and today's case were hundreds of family members, for the first time ever was a monumental development because were able to finally see and understand what our lawyers have known for 23 years.",

And it was -- it -- it -- it -- there other parts of it that were shown. There were parts where Bayoumi was shown with the hijackers hosting them at his house. That was never known before. There were parts of it where there were other Saudi government officials, brand -- brand new to anyone that in Bayoumi's apartment there were senior Saudi government officials with him, higher ranking than Bayoumi himself, hosting the hijackers, slicing meat for the hijackers, passing food around.They were addressing each other in very dear -- very respectable ways, meaning that they were using a form of Islam that shows a very high level of respect for these individuals. So today we learned a lot. I'm still digesting it. And it's -- it's just, there's -- there's more coming, too.
