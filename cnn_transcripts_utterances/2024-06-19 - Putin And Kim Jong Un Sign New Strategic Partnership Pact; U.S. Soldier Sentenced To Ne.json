The Russian president just wrapped up a rare visit to Pyongyang, his first trip there in more than two decades. He was met with a lavish ceremony that included a military parade and a ride in an open limo, while thousands of North Koreans lined the streets waving flags and chanting, welcome Putin.By the end of the visit, the Russian president and his counterpart had signed a strategic partnership agreement pledging to help each other if their countries are attacked. Putin says the pact with North Korea will take relations between the two countries to a quote, new level. CNN Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Matthew Chance is following the story live in Moscow. And Matthew, we haven't exactly seen the language in the text in a way that's clear. Some of it seems ambiguous.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, we will have to wait to see what the text says, get a translation of it, really have a look at it. But it looks like this strategic partnership treaty, which was the centerpiece of this very dramatic yet colorful trip by President Putin to Pyongyang, which was highly choreographed. It looks like it could be really significant and it could mark a really new and potentially dangerous phase of cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang, between Russia and North Korea.It's obviously going to have a security dimension. We don't know what that's going to involve, but in the past, U.S. officials have accused Russia of taking millions of rounds, artillery rounds mainly, from North Korean factories and using them on the front lines in Ukraine to help them sustain that very heavy bombardment that's been underway now for some time on the part of the Russian artillery. It's unclear and it's of concern what North Korea will get in return for continued cooperation in that regard. It needs help on its ballistic missile program, its nuclear program as well. Both those programs have been a thorn in the side of the United States and its allies, particularly in the region, could destabilize the Korean peninsula. The other big thing, though, is what Vladimir Putin point out - pointed out, which is that this new treaty, it basically is a mutual assistance treaty. So much like NATO's Article 5, if one country is attacked, the other one must go and help. Now, we don't know whether that means attacks on Russia of the kind we've been seeing in Western Russia by Ukrainian forces with drone attacks, et cetera, whether that would be a motive to invoke that clause in the treaty and whether North Korea could somehow become more embroiled than it already is in Russia's war. It's what it calls its special military operation in Ukraine, Boris.",

CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, so that's going to be really interesting, Brianna, because that's right, about 11,000 containers worth of munitions have allegedly reached Ukraine from North Korea. So what else could there be? There could be personnel, in the extreme case. You could actually have North Korean troops potentially help the Russians either in a backfill capacity where they support them from the back and not on the front lines. But the other part of it could be that they would provide logistical support, that they could provide perhaps equipment from their train service. Those are the kinds of things that they might do if Russian planes break, for example, even though the North Koreans have very limited aircraft, perhaps they would use one or two North Korean aircraft. All of those things are possible. We don't know, of course, the text of this, but that's the kind of thing that you would expect them to do. But the other thing that they, I think, will do is provide labor support for the Russian labor force. There's a civilian labor shortage in Russia. And now that Russia is on a war footing, on a war economy footing, there will be North Korean workers, even more of them, working in Russian armaments factories and in other areas of the Russian economy that directly support the war effort.",

So the Russians supplied the Koreans, the Soviets at that time supplied the North Koreans with a lot of manpower. They used fighter pilots, Russian fighter pilots, to actually fly North Korean jets during the Korean War. So there would be the possibility of it happening in reverse where the North Koreans come in and do something like that if there was - were to be a shortage of Russian pilots.I don't think that will happen, but that's an extreme scenario that's possible. The other thing, of course, if something were to happen on the Korean Peninsula, then you could see the Russians aiding in that way once again.

And even before the fall of the Berlin Wall, you had relationships that the U.S. had with the Soviet Union and they made some sense. They resulted in the reduction of arms, you know, all the START talks, for example, the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks were extremely important in doing that. Of course, they didn't eliminate nuclear weapons, obviously, but the proliferation regime, which has had its problems, is now, I would say, completely dead at this point.",

And I think it's important here to contrast pictures and numbers.By pictures, we have president - former President Trump appearing in a black church without black people, giving the appearance that black people are, in fact, political props in a photo op. Contrast that with President Biden speaking at Morehouse College, the alma mater of Martin Luther King and Julian Bond. Contrast the numbers, that is to say, Trump moving his support among - in the black community in states like Pennsylvania and Michigan up from the single digits to, yes, the double digits, but low double digits. The point being here is these polls at this point show some volatility, but do not constitute a testament to the popularity, if you will, of former President Trump among African-Americans.",

So on this day, Juneteenth, where we're celebrating the liberation, the emancipation of four million African-Americans following slavery, what we have found in our research is that, in a sense, America does a form of reparations every day for people who have been harmed, either physically harmed, harmed in terms of economic distress, harmed in terms of the health care system, the banking system, and that these reparations, or what we call repertory compensations, in the main are for nonracial harms and benefit white citizens.Our research shows that the government actually has the expertise, the experience, and the resources to address, long unaddressed, racial harms in this country. What Chicago is endeavoring to do, what states are endeavoring to do, is important, but it's far more important that the federal government assume the responsibility of repairing America's unresponded to, unheeded, unaddressed racial harms and that we can do. We can celebrate the holiday, but also make amends for the past as we embrace the future.",

Just outside of Chicago, Evanston, Illinois is getting sued for offering cash reparations to black residents. How do you anticipate these efforts might survive legal challenges, and what would the implications be nationwide? So here's - let us consider this. This country has always possessed the capacity under the Constitution to address wrongs and attempt to make them right.So, for example, when Japanese Americans were incarcerated after World War II or during World War II, this country provided reparations, modest reparations, for the deprivation of their liberty. So, in other words, it is not illegal, it is not unconstitutional to make a wrong right by remedying the wrong. Lawyers do this every day to the courts. The country can do this. For example, we've done this in terms of African-Americans. Actually, it's not African-Americans. We've done it in terms of vets who serve their country. We provided the GI Bill. When pensions in this country are threatened, this country will insure the pensions and save the pension funds. The point being here, there is nothing illegal, nothing unconstitutional about responding to an unconstitutional wrong, a racial wrong and attempting to make it right. Civil rights lawyers do this every day and this country can do it. And let us note this, Boris, I think this is really important, reparations are actually supported by a majority of young people and an increasing number of Americans. And our research shows that we can respond to reparations because we have the resources. We can respond because the government is actually skilled, if you will, and experienced in terms of addressing harms and we can make this holiday, more than just this holiday in which we celebrate with barbecue and with food and with festivities, the holiday in which we recognize and heal and respond to America's racial harms.",
