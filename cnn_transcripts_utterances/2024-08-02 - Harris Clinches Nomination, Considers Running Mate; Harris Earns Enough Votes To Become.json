Plus, he's accurately predicted the winner of nine of the last 10 presidential elections, so what does Allan Lichtman think is going to happen come November? Is he picking Harris or leaning towards Trump? I'll ask him live. And leading this hour, Vice President Kamala Harris on the clock just has a few days to pick her running mate if she's going to meet her self-imposed deadline of next Tuesday. And today, CNN is learning Harris will meet with top VP contenders over the weekend, with multiple sources saying that while all six of these men are in the running, Governors Shapiro and Walz, along with Senator Mark Kelly, are among the top contenders for the job.

I'll give you that for free advice, OK, JD Vance, from one Ohioan to another.Look, I think I have, as a strict political tactician, elections are about votes in this country of the Electoral College, you need 270 to win. Josh Shapiro represents a state that is extremely important to win. And his favorability ratings are very high in that state. And so, it makes sense for Josh Shapiro to be on the very short list. There may be drawbacks for all of them but I have always said when you people have said most of time, to your point earlier, Kristen, is that vice presidents don't matter. I actually think they do in this moment, because even though it's not to elderly people at the top of the ticket, that conversation was introduced earlier about Kamala Harris even being Joe Biden's vice president, which is why I think people are paying more attention to the vice president. And then you have a JD Vance, who people are saying like is the next generation of Trump's MAGA Republican Party. So I think this does matter. I think it helps build a broader coalition who she picks. And I've always said put points on the board. And I think Pennsylvania, you need to put points on the board. Arizona is another state.

She is that he's serious crossroads right. At the end of the day, the Democratic Party has its own serious crossroads. You know, is there really a Palestinian faction of the party that's growing, it's expanding, that's going to be hurting the party go forward, and how do they respond to sort of a Jewish vice president. That's her first difficult decision. And if she doubles downs on the left, that almost disqualifies her for being a mainstream candidate, because she needs something to numb the view that she's a San Francisco liberal. And so, Shapiro is probably the best one that that does it but it also creates conflict within her governing base. I mean, you got the progressives, the lefties, who are just completely opposed to everything he stands for, and they're fighting against him right now.

And trust the American people to look at what we what we're putting forward. Let's not forget on the other side, they've got some courage on their side as well but it's more reckless courage. They're putting somebody up with a bunch of felony convictions, and somebody's been in public office for 18 months. So there are some courage on their side that's looks a little bit reckless. To put two very successful political leaders, who have won election after election and who have served honorably and well on a ticket should be what Americans do.
