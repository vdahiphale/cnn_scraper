We look back at Christiane's conversation with the Oscar winningfilmmaker, Barry Jenkins, as he brought Baldwin's \"If Beal Street Could Talk\" to the big screen. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, this week, U.S. presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have been digging into the economics, talking about inflation and issues like price gouging. But so far in their campaigns, one big topic has gone almost unmentioned, climate. And while the candidates are quiet, the Earth, well, it's screaming. Temperature records are being shattered. Wildfires are spreading and new studies are revealing a terrifying reality. One European report finding that heat turbocharged by carbon pollution killed up to 50,000 people on the continent last year alone. Two years ago today, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, the largest ever investment in renewables and clean energy jobs. But challenges continue, many arguing that it's not going far enough, and some political entities like the pro Trump Project 2025 trying to wipe away clean energy initiatives altogether. Gina McCarthy served as EPA administrator and then as inaugural White House National climate adviser, where she helped craft the Inflation Reduction Act, and she joins the show from Boston. Gina, it is good to see you again. What a wild few weeks it has been. A new candidate at the top of the Democratic ticket. And I'm curious, just at the top of this conversation, if you're surprised that of all of the topics that have been discussed thus far, I know that it's early days for her campaign, but the campaigns themselves are winding down, the election just a few months away, that we haven't heard specifically from Kamala Harris on the issue of climate.",

It -- I mean, they've displayed it by their work so far in government, and I'm excited about it. And frankly, this two-year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act is the biggest birthday present that I could ever get.

It really has a shocking number of ridiculous -- if you care about America and our country, ridiculous proposals that would eliminate not just whole agencies, but frankly, totally undermine our democracy.

But President Trump, you know, to say that the good news is that homes will be destroyed along our oceanfront properties is just -- you know, I have to say it, it's not just strange, it is weird. I think weird is the word I would use for both of those folks in the conversation that they had. You know, we have to get smart in this country. We have to recognize that the Inflation Reduction Act actually resulted in $493 billion in investments in just its two-year history, and this is a 10-year horizon. Why is that happening? Because businesses want to invest. They want to make money. This gives them an opportunity to make money in a way that's going to benefit all of us. Lots of new jobs, lower family costs. We are talking about the opportunity of our lifetime. We have to get away from two people that are disconnected in many ways with reality and talk about real human beings. 3.4 million homes have invested in energy using the rebates, the new clean energy using the rebates and efficiency programs that we have available to them. Look, the United States deserves better than to listen to those two. We have to listen with our heart and listen with our head and talk to real life human beings and what they need. The Inflation Reduction Act has created 330,000 jobs. We need. It has provided families cheaper energy costs. They need that. Let's keep focused on reality here and let's keep pushing because we're going to have eight years of the Inflation Reduction Act and I am hugely excited about the technologies and opportunities that we're going to see during that period and grab for ourselves and, frankly, for the entire world.

And you spoke to the U.S. ambassador to Panama about this, other State Department officials. And what you note is so important because you say that people migrate for overlapping reasons. It's usually not a binary option for so many of these people. And in terms of hearing from both candidates at the introduction of this piece, it really stood out to me that many of these migrants are well aware of the legal system here, in terms of what they're doing. And I'll quote from your piece. Many of the migrants I met in the Darien Gap knew which types of cases prevail in American immigration courts and which do not. They were prepared to emphasize whichever aspect of their story would be most likely to get their children to safety. I found that fascinating, Caitlin.",

You know, one of the things that I focused on in my work, and that was a priority for me in the Darien Gap, was to look at thetools that the U.S. government has relied on again and again to respond to global migration. It grows each year. Right now, you have one in 69 people on the planet who are currently migrating from their homes. Over 170 million people total. And you know, I've spent years looking at how we've responded to that, largely through deterrent policies. So, policies put into place at the southern U.S. border, as well as by pressuring other nations, especially in Latin America, to crack down on their own immigration systems and basically try to stop people either before they leave home or en route to the United States. Another of these tools is -- has been to distinguish between who qualifies under the law as a legitimate refugee or asylum seeker versus an economic migrant. But I felt it was important to convey in this piece that, you know, again, years of experience has shown me that people have many reasons for which they're migrating and they know the American immigration system. You know, our Congress has been stuck on this issue for years with no movement since the '90s. And in that time, the international smuggling networks that move people across the globe are sort of running circles around our enforcement apparatus. They know what the rules are. And you know, these are people who are very, very desperate. Carrying their children through, you know, unimaginably harrowing scenes, which I'm sure we'll get into. And so, you know, any rational or logical person knowing the laws is going to respond in interviews in a way that they know is going to be more likely to get their children and themselves to safety.",

A father traveling with the mother of his children, his partner, and his partner's cousin, there are four children with them in total, and they've had to make those decisions in real-time. Children hungry, tired, they're having to lose some of their belongings as they're going. The internal tension between this group as they're going on these sleepless, grueling days. But what really stood out to me is that you told us a bit more detail about who they were. He trained -- he went to college, studied to be an engineer. His partner, a nurse.

They're almost a classic case in the Darien Gap. I mentioned there's an incredible amount of diversity, people from all over the world and all different backgrounds. But there are a lot of people like this family, you know, Burk Han (ph) and Orly Marr (ph), the two parents were from middle-class homes. Burk Han's mother was a lawyer, Orly Marr's (ph) mother was a doctor. He had been studying to become an engineer, as you mentioned, she a nurse. And so, they had this whole life set out in front of them. They were in college when the Venezuelan economy began to spiral, and that was around 2014. Obviously, it hasn't recovered since. Things have only become more dangerous, more unstable, and certainly, economically untenable. And so, they sort of watched this middle-class future that they were planning for vanish before their eyes. And another thing that makes their case a common one in the Darien Gap is that they tried to resettle elsewhere before moving toward the United States. You know, they were very clear with us. Their goal is to get back to Venezuela. They're not chasing an American dream, and they'd prefer to be at home. But because Venezuela was so impossible for them as a family, they moved first to Peru. You know, they were working odd jobs, they were sleeping in a studio apartment on a mattress that they dragged in from the street and they weren't able to feed their kids. And so, they were given an opportunity when a family member's boyfriend who lived in Texas offered to lend them some money to get to the United States and they really felt like that was throwing a Hail Mary pass to try to save their lives and their children's futures not something that they wanted to be doing, but they felt they had no other choice.",

You know, everything in life depends on proteins, all your muscles in your body, everything, all the functions of your body are governed by -- supported by proteins. And what a protein does depends on its 3D shape, how it folds up in the body. And the conjecture was, could you predict the 3D shape of a protein based just on its two-dimensional -- sort of one-dimensional genetic sequence, right? So, just a string of numbers. Sometimes it's called the amino acid sequence. And can you predict the 3D structure of the protein just from its amino acid sequence? And if you could do that would be really important for understanding biology and the processes in the body, but also, designing things like drugs and cures for diseases and understanding when something goes wrong and how to design a drug to bind to a certain part of the protein. So, it's a really foundational, fundamental problem in biology. And we managed to pretty much sort of crack that problem with AlphaFold.",

We'veput out -- I mean, we were just discussing AlphaFold earlier. That is open source, you know, over 2 million biologists and scientists around the world make use of it today. And, you know, pretty much every country in the world to do their important research work. We've -- we published, you know, thousands of papers now on all the underlying technologies and architectures required for building modern A.I. systems, including most famously the transformers papers, that is the architecture that underlies pretty much all the modern language models and foundational models. So, we very much believe in that's the fastest way to make scientific progress is to share information. That's always been the case. That's why science works. Now, in this particular case with AGI systems, I think we need to think about as they get more powerful. So, not today's models. I think that's fine. But, you know, as we get closer to artificial general intelligence, you know, what about the issues around bad actors, whether that's individuals or up to nation states, using these things, repurposing these same models, their dual purpose, they can be used for good, obviously, that's why I've worked on A.I. my whole career is, you know, to help cure diseases and maybe help with things like climate change and so on and advanced science and medicine. But they can also be used for harm if incorrectly used by bad actors. So, that's the question, I think, the -- that we're going to have to sort of resolve as a community and a research community is, how do we enable all the amazing good use cases of A.I. and share information amongst well- meaning actors, you know, researchers and so on to advance the field and come up with amazing new applications that are benefiting humanity? But at the same time, restrict access to would be bad actors to do harmful things with those same systems by repurposing them in a different way. And I think that's the conundrum that there's -- we're going to have to sort of solve somehow with this debate about open systems versus closed systems. And I don't think there's a clear answer yet or consensus about how to do that as this, as these systems improve. But of course, you know, I congratulate Mark Zuckerberg and Meta on, you know, their great new model. And I think this is a useful to stimulate the debate on this topic.",

And I think back in those times in the earlyparts of DeepMind, early 2010s, it was very important to have inspiration from both from machine learning and mathematics, as well as neuroscience and inspiration for the human brain as to how intelligence might work. So, it's not that you want to slavishly copy how the brain works, because as you pointed out, the brain -- our brains are carbon based and our computers are silicon based. So, there's no reason why the mechanics should work in the same way. And in fact, they work quite differently. But a lot of the algorithmic principles and the systems and the architectures and the principles behind intelligence are in common, including, you know, in the first -- the early days of neural networks, you know, the things that underpins all modern A.I. were originally inspired by neuroscience and synapses in the brain. And so, the implementation details are different, but the algorithmic ideas were extremely valuable in terms of kickstarting what we see is the modern A.I. revolution today including this idea of learning systems, reinforcement learning and systems that learn for themselves, very much like biological systems and our own brains do. And then ultimately, you know, maybe when we build AGI, we'll be able to use that to back -- to analyze our own minds so that we can understand the neuroscience better and finally understand, you know, the workings of our own brain.

And as we commemorate Baldwin's 100th birthday this month, we revisit Christian's conversation with Jenkins speaking about what drew him to the story and why more diversity is needed in the entertainment industry. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARRY JENKINS, DIRECTOR, \"IF BEALE STREET COULD TALK\":  Yes, for me, you know, I've always been a really big fan and admirer of James Baldwin's work. And Mr. Baldwin had quite a few voices he wrote in, but two of those voices in particular that always stood out to me was the one voice that was obsessed with romance, romanticism, interpersonal relationships. And the other voice that was just as obsessed and passionate about pointing out systemic injustice.

So, I believe that's about 30 episodes of television directed by women. When typically, women are 10 percent, I want to say, of television directors.

And I think they bring part of themselves to these roles.
