He may get another victory with this trial of Igor Danchenko. We'll see what the jury decides, although it's been kind of a rookie go for the prosecution. But I will say that Durham has used this trial as a vehicle to air the dirty laundry of the FBI. He's been able to put on a show about some of the serious mistakes, sloppiness, errors that FBI agents made in their investigation of Donald Trump and the Trump campaign.Things like using the Steele dossier to get a surveillance warrant of Carter Page, an American citizen and former Trump campaign adviser. They kept putting that Steele dossier material in their affidavits to get that warrant even as they were trying to corroborate it, coming up empty, falling flat, they kept putting it in there. That's a huge problem. Durham has put that on trial. But that's not really the defendant in this case. So he's used this trial to put on a show.

He is a very responsive senator.

This is a great pollster. But the next poll will be the one to watch where things will tighten up. The Republican Party of Iowa issued a statement today that said specifically Chuck Grassley represents what the people of Iowa want and Franken does not. He is a rubber stamp for Biden's policies and what he has done with the economy, what he's done at the border, what he's done with agriculture and energy independence, that is not what the people of Iowa want and Franken represents that.
