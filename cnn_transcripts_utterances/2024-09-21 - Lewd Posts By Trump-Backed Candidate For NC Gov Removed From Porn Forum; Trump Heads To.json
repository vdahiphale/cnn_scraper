I'm Fredricka Whitfield.And we begin with new details into CNN's exclusive investigation about disturbing online posts made years ago by the Republican nominee for Governor of North Carolina, Mark Robinson. New questions today about how former President Trump may deal with the brewing scandal in the crucial swing state as well, where he will be taking the stage in just a matter of hours. CNN has now learned that the lewd, racist, and anti-Semitic post first uncovered by CNN's KFile investigative team have been removed from the porn forum called Nude Africa. It's unclear whether the comments were removed by Robinson or the site's administrators. Neither the Robinson campaign nor Nude Africa responded to inquiries from CNN. Robinson, who is currently North Carolina's lieutenant governor, denies making the comments despite CNN's KFile discovering that the user profile contained his full name, plus an email address he used on numerous websites for decades. The question today, of course, will Robinson join the former president at a rally in that state? CNN's Steve Contorno is in Wilmington, North Carolina, which is where the rally for Trump will be taking place moments from now. So, Steve, what do we know?",

However, we are told that he was not invited to today's event. We do have our eyes peeled to see if he makes an appearance anyway uninvited.I will tell you, just walking around, Wilmington, North Carolina today, the KFile reporting is certainly the talk of North Carolina right now. Though Trump himself has not directly addressed what came from his protege here. His campaign, however, telling CNN in a statement that Trump's campaign is focused on winning the White House. North Carolina is a vital part of that plan, and we will not take our eye off the ball. Now, part of the challenge for Trump in North Carolina will be reversing recent trends of women voters supporting the Democratic nominee. Instead, Trump got to work on that early last night with a post on Truth Social where he said that women were poor, less healthy, less safe, more depressed, and less optimistic than they were four years ago. He also said that, quote, \"You will no longer be thinking about abortion because it is now where it has always had to be with the states.\" This, of course, comes as Vice President Harris has made abortion a central part of her campaign. And it's no wonder that he is talking about this coming into North Carolina. Harris is doing much better than Donald Trump among female voters. If you look at this recent Quinnipiac poll, she has 60 percent of support from women voters to Trump's 37 percent. That outpaces Biden's support among women, according to exit polls that came out of the state four years ago. So clearly, that is going to be a focus for Donald Trump going forward in the Tar Heel State, Fred.",

This would be their second meeting on a public debate stage in the first final weeks of the campaign. Trump has suggested last week that he might be open to participating in a third presidential debate following his September 10th face off with Harris on ABC in Philadelphia. And his first debate, his election cycle was, of course, with President Joe Biden right here on CNN in June. And I'm quoting now, the former president, maybe if I got in the right mood, he says, he told reporters during a stop in California after previously posting on Truth Social and saying this quote, \"There will be no third debate.\" So which is it going to be? The CNN debate would mirror the June debate between President Biden and former President Trump with a similar format in which Trump and Harris would field moderator's questions for 90 minutes without a live studio audience and would take place at the Network Studios in Atlanta. CNN's Steve Contorno is in Wilmington, North Carolina, where Trump is about to take the stage.

And Trump himself has waffled on whether he wants more than one debate against Harris.He had previously suggested that he would do debates on Fox News. Ones focused -- ones that were hosted by NBC. But after that first debate, when Harris came out of -- with her strong performance and immediately challenged the former president to another debate, he came out and said, look, the only people who want to debate again are the people who lose first debates, and so I don't think that I should go out and do another one. He has since said otherwise. He has at times said, \"You know, I did great with the debates and I think they've answered everything, but maybe if I got in the right mood, I don't know. Right now, I'm leading.\" So suggesting there that maybe he could do another debate if he was, quote, \"in the right mood.\" He also has said -- without any sort of qualifications, there will be no third debate. It's too late. Anyway, the voting's already begun and the voting has begun in certain states. We have seen early voting begin in Virginia and several of these other swing states in North Carolina where their ballots are starting to go out. So, clearly, Donald Trump's posture on this has been clear, or he's tried to clarify where his posture is, but we'll have to wait and see if this -- now he was -- we have more polling, and there's been more time has passed, if he has changed his calculus, and ultimately decides that he wants to go head-to-head with Harris once more.",

And that's one of the things that's complicating this investigation and has paralyzed a community that's now left to grapple with the shooting. These two men were prominent in the community. They were known to each other. And they were certainly known to the law enforcement community. And that's going to be part of the investigation. So while the motive remains unclear, we are trying to learn more about how these men were known to each other and exactly what they may have been arguing about. But just to give you a sense of just how small this community is and the fact that everybody kind of knows each other. The Letcher County Commonwealth attorney has already said that he is going to recuse himself from the case, saying that he has family ties to the judge and therefore cannot possibly be a part of the investigation or the legal proceedings that are going to come after this.",

And the sheriff has been arrested. So the -- the Kentucky Administrative Office of the Courts, which administered the state's courts, said Thursday that a retired judge -- judge will temporarily preside over this court once they can open it back up. And then the Governor will have to likely select the next judge. But there's going to have to be a nomination in order to make that happen. So it's going to be a bit of a process. And it's not clear just yet who is going to replace the sheriff. That is going to be part of what we'll be following in the next following days. Another important detail, Fred, is that this case has now been moved outside of that community. Stines has been transferred about 100 miles away from the location, and that is where he is going to be arraigned next week. That will be his first court appearance, which, of course, can't happen in the place where this crime allegedly took place. Fred?",
