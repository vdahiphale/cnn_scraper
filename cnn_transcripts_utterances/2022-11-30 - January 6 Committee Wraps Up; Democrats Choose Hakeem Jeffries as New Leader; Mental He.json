      "sentences": "Well, good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Coates, and this is CNN TONIGHT.Look, you've got chapters closing, you've got chapters opening and some still being written in the very many investigations of the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol and what happened, of course, in the days leading up to it, and frankly, since that day as well. Now, the clock is ticking, as you know for the January 6th committee. They're checking their final interviews, and of more than a thousand actually took place today, the final of more than a thousand, and meeting on Friday, now we're learning to discuss the possibility of making criminal referrals. That, of course, in the wake of the conspiracy convictions of two Oath Keepers and with the special counsel's investigation ramping up. The question is, what's all this going to reveal? And does it still matter to the electorate. Plus, a new leader in the House as Democrats pick Hakeem Jeffries to succeed Nancy Pelosi, the first black lawmaker to lead a party in Congress as a new generation is now changing the face of our politics. And with team USA and the World Cup spotlight after their thrilling victory over Iran, this is also a very big moment, and frankly, a long overdue payday for the women's team. I'll talk to one of the women's World Cup champions and frankly, a personal hero of mine, coming up. We've got a lot to talk about tonight here with me, CNN anchor and correspondent Audie Cornish, national security attorney Bradley Moss and Mike Shields, former RNC chief of staff. I'm glad to have you all here. We'll -- we'll get to the World Cup without you here in the moment, maybe in the break. But let's talk about a different matchup that's happening on Capitol Hill. And really, we are expecting with the new Congress, which is about 34 days away from being, you know, sworn in, there are already promises of new investigations. I'm wondering from your perspective and thinking about these moments, what do you think the impact of the culmination of all that we've seen with January 6 and the Oath Keepers trial is going to have on the GOP led House coming up. It'll be green, it'll be - good-nighted already the committee's not going to continue. But Mike, what, what's your take on how this might move forward and maybe a different way?",

Personally, I believe Republicans like to see anyone who attacked a cop put in jail and getting in front of grand juries, getting indictments, that's the legal process. What politicians should be doing is, what's the root cause of political violence? Analyzing that in a bipartisan way. That's what should have been going on. That's not what's.

You know, one of the things that speaker-elect McCarthy advocated for was, let's expand this. Let's let the justice system handle prosecuting people. Let's us take a look at political violence, things like what happened to Paul Pelosi, things that happened to Steve Scalise where he was shot.

The reason the January 6th committee focused the way it did was because it was an attack on Congress. It was an attack on the electoral certification process. It was looking into potential legislative fixes to prevent what we learned.People like John Eastman, and the former President Trump were trying to do to prevent the certification of electoral count, you know. And you mentioned something and I want to just, you know, make sure this is clear. When speak -- sorry, possibly Speaker McCarthy coming up was trying to put people like Jim Jordan on the committee. The reason it was unprecedented in terms of rejecting them was because they were material fact witnesses. They ultimately got subpoenaed themselves and of course, you know, decline to comply, which was their choice to make, but that's why those particular individuals would not be normally sitting on that committee.

And finally, as a female songwriter, it's just so lovely to hear people speak about her with such reverence because that is a group of songwriters, right? Everyone is fantastic there, but she really has earned her place and I think that part of her legacy of just writing so powerfully, so simply, and with such grace, that's what's going to stand the test of time.",
