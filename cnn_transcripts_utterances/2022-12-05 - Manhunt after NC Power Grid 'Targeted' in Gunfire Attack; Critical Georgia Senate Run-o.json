And what we've seen since the killing of Mahsa Amini has been the extraordinary courage of Iranian young people, especially women, who have been leading these protests, standing up for the right to be able to say what they want to say, wear what they want to wear.

That was the person that we heard on Thursday, with no suggestion, by the way, Don, about which way that's going to go. Relaxing or a tightening. But it was his remarks on Saturday in response to a reporter who asked whether the Morality Police that enforces it was going to be disbanded that really led to that speculation that that might be the case, or part of that review. What he said exactly, more particularly, was that it was not something for the judiciary, but that it was disbanded from the place, it had been launched. Now that would be the interior ministry, who for now has not got back to CNN and either confirmed or denied that that's the case.

All those images, Don, of women taking them off, burning them, cutting their hair, that's become the symbol of what it's about. But I think it's important to note, as well, that even if that were to happen -- and for now, we just don't know -- it's unlikely that would calm things down. If anything, what we've seen over the course of the now near-nearly three months of protests is these demands morph and become about much more than the rights of women. It's become a series of protests about poverty, about corruption, about the brutality of the prison and judiciary system and, in fact, about the iron fist with which the regime has ruled Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution, Don.",
