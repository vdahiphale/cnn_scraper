One was serious, shutting down a major highway here in the Twin Cities for at least two hours. Last checked that highway had not reopened. And the National Weather Service is predicting that travel will likely be impossible tonight and tomorrow as conditions are expected to worsen. We're talking about snow falling and those wind gusts. In some parts of the State, Victor and Brianna, up to 45 miles per hour. That's all happening at the same time. So that's why you're seeing the blizzard warning because it will reduce visibility. Behind me, I'm starting to notice what I like to call a fresh blanket of snow earlier when we arrived at this location. People were moving in and out somewhat easily, but now you can see the snow is beginning to stick but the plows are here and they're working. There's more than 800 across the state of Minnesota, snowplows that is. Victor? Bianna?",

This could end up being one of the top five snowiest, storms on record for Minneapolis, so that's going to be an area to watch.But barely anywhere on the country does not have a warning. We have watches and warning stretching coast-to-coast, winter storm warnings, ice warnings, high wind warnings, we could see winds gusting 60 miles to 80 miles per hour, especially across the southwest and especially in those higher elevation. So we are going to have huge impacts from the storm especially areas shaded in red and then purple across the Sierra so you can bet a lot of those passes will be closed for periods of time. Around Minneapolis we could see some major headaches with hazardous travel, blinding conditions due to that blizzard warning once that starts to set up. So we are going to have very heavy snow throughout the rest of the afternoon evening before this starts to wrap up tomorrow. So here's the radar and you can see the snow starting to move back in to Minneapolis after a brief break. This pink and purple, that's the ice, so that's an area we really need to watch as well, because we are going to see some huge headaches from that. Also a tornado watch in effect for portions of Missouri and Illinois. So we have to watch out for the tornado potential as well. So as this moves on, guys, it should be improving by the time we get to say this time tomorrow. But this evening and tonight is definitely going to be dangerous across these areas.",

So what we are learning is that U.S. officials do believe that Russia attempted to carry out this intercontinental ballistic missile test on Saturday, about two days before President Biden, of course, entered Kyiv on that secret trip and that they believe that that test did ultimately fail.And the reason they believe that is because of course, President Putin did give his State of the Nation Address to the Russian people on Tuesday and he made no mention of this test. Now, the last time that Russia carried out a test like this just about a year ago, about April of 2022, a few months after Russia invaded Ukraine. Putin boasted of this and he did discuss the successful test of the missile at that time. Of course, it was a missile that President Putin said would make anyone who wanted to threaten Russia think twice about doing so. Well now, not so boastful, the U.S. saying that is a major clue that President Putin did not actually mention this test. But we should note that he did or the Russian government did reach out to the United States beforehand to notify them that this test was going to take place in order to de-conflict. And this is interesting, because it suggests that the U.S. and Russian governments were communicating through multiple different channels. Last week, of course, we learned from the National Security Adviser that the U.S. government also notified the Russians that President Biden was going to be in Kyiv beforehand. So clearly, these channels for de-confliction purposes are still open despite, of course, the deteriorating relationship, of course, between the U.S. and Russia right now, guys.",

So we have this failed ICBM test prior to the President's visit to Kyiv, then we have President Putin yesterday announcing that he was going to suspend Russia's participation in the New START treaty.

I mean, this is something that happens regularly that you might have Hungary or one of the countries disagree, so it doesn't mean that these won't go through. Sometimes it takes multiple rounds for them to approve new sanctions. So it's not about them taking sanctions away, but I think a hiccup in applied new sanctions.China knows, however, that it's going to be a lot more difficult for the U.S. and the European Union and the world to apply sanctions against them, because their economy is actually really, really important to us. And so - and it will be much, much harder and they know that. And they're also building their economy and the resilience of their economy, isolating certain companies, et cetera, to avoid the implications of sanctions. So they're hardening their economy to protect themselves, should it come to an invasion of Taiwan and the implications of the U.S. and others putting sanctions on them. So I do think that they are thinking about that, but they also see themselves as a very different test case than Russia.",

That's number one.Number two is I think the Chinese are a bit - a little bit unsettled, if we can use that word at the speed and the depth of which Western sanctions took hold once their full scale invasion happened. And just quickly as - when it comes to the EU, their unity on Ukraine is very impressive. They're - what they're saying is very impressive. But I don't know how strong that will last as we go further into the invasion. For example, during the COVID pandemic, the EU couldn't even agree on trade and travel restrictions, things like that.

And for sure, they don't want to see U.S. boots on the ground.So - and as far as the rumbling going on in the Republican Party, where they do have a fairly slim majority, is I think this is more small group of people, but they could tilt things in a way that isn't favorable to Ukraine. Just quickly, having said all of that, I have to say I was absolutely touched yesterday, last night, when ordinary Ohioans came up to me and said, what more can we do for Ukraine? How can we help?

We're right 50 yards from sort of market street, the main street through town. You can see those of those buoys, those like sponges or filters, they sit on top of the water, they had them all the way up to the stream, this is a stream that is contaminated and then that picks up any sort of contaminants that may be flowing down. They have replaced these things a dozen, maybe two dozen times since we've been here early this morning. That water that you're looking at that's being forced into the stream, it's being brought out of the stream and then forced back in to put those chemicals through these very big devices here. All those bags on that side, you can see, those are all old filters that they've already pulled out. It's - it is slow going and dirty work here. But now the federal government through the EPA says that they are going to force Norfolk Southern to not only clean up the mess, but pay for it and also even take part in any sort of public meetings as well because they had canceled on one earlier in all of this and that has caused great concern for residents here. It's that sense of the derailment, which was bad enough, and then this controlled burn that sent this toxic plume up which really raised a lot of doubts and concern across a very wide area into Pennsylvania which is right next door as well. And then the realization that there were other chemicals on board that nobody knew about until after that controlled burn. It makes it very difficult for people to believe anything that they hear from Norfolk Southern or from the EPA. So that EPA now coming in here in a very big way trying to take charge of the situation and hold Norfolk Southern's feet to the fire and make sure that they clean up the entire mess.

And with so much pressure to cut spending in the upcoming months as part of this debt ceiling negotiation, one of the big questions is whether or not Kevin McCarthy, who does support funding Ukraine, whether or not he's going to be willing to cross some of those hardliners. There are enough votes in the House between Republicans and Democrats to continue giving money to Ukraine. But the question is what will Kevin McCarthy be willing to put on the floor. And this is really a dramatic split screen with Mitch McConnell over in the U.S. Senate who has made this really a personal mission of sorts to - in - continue to talk to his conference about why this money is so important. He went on Fox News last week and talked about the fact that, yes, there is some public polling that is showing support for Ukraine aid is starting to slip, but he said he thinks that's really unfortunate.
