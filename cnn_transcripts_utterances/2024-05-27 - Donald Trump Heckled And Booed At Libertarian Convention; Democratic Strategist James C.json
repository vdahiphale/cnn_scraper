What he is worried about, I agree, is RFK Jr., who now is relegated to being a spoiler. The reason is he's only on in eight states. He needed the libertarian nomination to be -- to get the access to 46, 47 states. They won't even be on 50 states this year, which means he won't be able to get 270 electoral votes and be a legitimate candidate for president.He will be relegated to spoiler status given his failure. I think he got 19 votes at this thing.

Imagine paying that while also trying to pay back your student loans. I think a lot of young people are realizing that they're going to have to start families later on in life. So there's a huge disconnect I believe, Rahel, with a lot of younger people entering into the workforce, millennials like myself, to the message coming from the Biden reelect campaign. And for voters of color, generally speaking, specifically men, I think a lot of them realize that despite the fact that the economy has improved somewhat, we still see that the wages have only increased 25 percent while inflation is around 31 percent, 32 percent. So there is still a divide there. I think a lot of men feel that they have not heard the proper messaging from some of their concerns coming from Democrats as a lot of the messages appear to be targeted more towards women. And so there are some things that I think the president needs to focus on. Now, I would agree with Joe. We're months away from November. There's still an opportunity for President Biden to change things and I do suspect that many of those voters will come around, but I think both candidates, the president and Donald Trump, have to make appeals to these very, very key constituencies, which I think ultimately will make a difference this November.",

You couple that with the concerns about the shortage of manpower for Ukrainians right now that are finally, finally getting that military aid and weaponry that they've been waiting for for so long. How dangerous is the situation in the Kharkiv area right now? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, good morning, Bianna and Rahel. First of all, it's extremely dangerous. They're in an inflection point right now. It's, in my accounting, it's phase 7 of this campaign. Russia continues to strike civilian targets. This is not something that's changed over the last two plus years. They -- the Russian government, under the direction of Mr. Putin, has conducted their way of war, which they've done in Syria, in Chechnya, and in so many other places, where it's striking civilians in an attempt to make them come under the thumb of Russia. That's why Mr. Zelenskyy has added another objective strategically to this war of seeing Mr. Putin before the Hague, which I think is appropriate. But what you're talking about now from the Ukrainian side is, is they've passed the bill to mobilize more soldiers, up to 500,000, according to that bill. And also, as they're waiting for the supply chains to come back into effect that have been disrupted due to seven months of political wrangling, they're at a very difficult time as they try and spread their front line to protect against all Russian attacks, both through the air and on the ground.",
