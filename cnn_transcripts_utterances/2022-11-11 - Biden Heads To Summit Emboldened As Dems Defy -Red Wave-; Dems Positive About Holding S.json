We do expect them to come anytime at this point and we'll see if it makes it possible to call one of these crucial races. It has been almost 72 hours since the first polls close.Control of Congress, President Biden's agenda, still unknown. In the House, Democrats and Republicans are still in a tight race, right, 218 is what you need to control to have control of the House. Democrats are down right now, not out, can't say that, but we have 25 seats left to project. One race that is incredibly close, that Democrats are hoping to snatch from Republicans is the third congressional district in Colorado. Will you say, what is that one? Well, I will tell you, Lauren, Boebert, you know that named, the incumbent, she is ahead right now by 1,122 votes. It is a narrow lead over the Democratic challenger, Adam Frisch. So, you know, what we're going to see where this one goes, 99 percent of the vote in, but when your vote margin is that slim, this is still too close to call. Boebert, of course, with a history of false and dangerous claims about America's election like this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. LAUREN BOEOERT (R-CO): Millions of ballots were mailed out illegally right in front of all of our faces. That right there is what rigged this election. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

A lot of questions because of the fact that we do expect if the Republicans do take the House that it would be a narrow majority, meaning that Kevin McCarthy, if he wants to become speaker in January can only afford to lose probably a handful of votes in order to get ascend to the speakership. But there are a number of conservative members of that hardline House Freedom Caucus who are threatening to vote against him unless he agrees to certain concessions, including giving them more power over the speakership, something that McCarthy has resisted. And McCarthy has been behind closed doors. He had meetings, including with the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus today, Scott Perry, who came out and did not commit to supporting McCarthy, saying that there are negotiations ongoing.And then on the Democratic side, Erin, it is still uncertain whether Nancy Pelosi will try to continue in the majority or minority as a top Democrat in her caucus. There is a waiting game going on, a shadow campaign of sorts going on behind the scenes about potentially replacing her but she's returning from Egypt for an official conference she was at, and then next week, they returned to session.

More drama among Republicans than Democrats, drama everywhere but more among Republicans, because this is not the map they expected out of this midterm election. So how could the Democrats get there? Well, let's take a look at that. Let's take a look at that.It is mathematically possible. It is also, you know, again, the Republicans have a clear path. But if you look at the seats right here, they have 199 right now that we've projected. There are two races that we now describe as likely, right? These are likely Democrats that are leading in these races, we're just not ready to call them yet, right? So if they win those two races, that gets you to 201, right? That's 201. So then we move on from those races here. So what do you do next? What do you look at the map next? You look at some more -- a couple other uncalled races. These are 11 here, right? There are 11 where Democrats are ahead. In some of the ones in California, it's Democrat running against Democrat because of the jungle primary. So these are 11 races that you could say, OK, it's a reasonable possibility, even more, in some cases, for Democrats to win. So let's erase that, 201 plus 11 get you to 212, right, 212. That means 218 is within sight at that point. So then what comes next? This is where it gets a little bit more difficult, but two races with rank choice voting, the Democrats are ahead in both Alaska and in Maine. Right now, rank choice voting, if they don't get above 50 percent it takes a couple of weeks. They look at the ballots of the candidates who get dropped out at the bottom, top to stay, and it's who's your second choice, who's your third choice? So we have -- the expectation is that Jared Golden, the newly elected Alaska Democratic congressman run again. So where's that get you, Erin? That gets you to 214? Wow, right, 214.

The weight behind that message most certainly has.

That has not happened. And that changes the dynamics dramatically, primarily because of this, when the President took office, when he started meeting with foreign leaders, the message that he repeatedly heard was, sure you might think America is back now but for how long? Now, the President has evidence in his view and the view of White House advisors, that what he's put into place, the commitments he's made in both on the domestic and international front aren't just his theory of the case anymore, it's actually happening in practice. And I'll tell you this, when you talk to White House officials who are keeping a very, very close eye on both the Senate races and the House races at the moment, they feel even better than they did two or three days ago. Obviously they don't know how everything's going to land. But the reality remains this, as the President moves into these high stakes meetings, takes center stage on the international stage, what he has preached to some degree over the course of the last two years, he now believes is coming to fruition. And that perhaps more than anything else as he moves into these high stakes sit downs, these high stakes moments, and at a time internationally where there's just a lot of fragility and instability that the U.S. is better positioned and the President, in his view, is better positioned to make the argument he's been trying to make for the better part of the last two years than he has been at any point before now. That certainly wasn't expected going into this trip. It certainly the reality as the President gets set to land here in Cambodia, and then off to Bali for the G20 and that critical sit down with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Erin.",

The Vice President played a key role actually keeping that issue at the forefront.

She was one of the ten House Republicans who voted to impeach then-President Trump. The Democrat here, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, is leading Joe Kent, who primaried Herrera Beutler and won.Let's just be very clear here that the change here is that the lead has narrowed. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez's lead over Joe Kent has narrowed by about 764 votes on this latest count. So, as you can see, she is still 5,117 votes ahead but that lead has narrowed by 764 with this latest key race alert. And I want to draw your attention to the bottom of your screen. You see 84 percent of the estimated vote is in. So, this is obviously mathematically, statistically too close to call. The latest numbers that came in did favor Joe Kent by a net 764 votes. It is an important race as Democrats and Republicans are in this tight race to 218, which is the magic number needed for full control of the House. And in just moments from now, we are expected to hear from top officials in Arizona's two largest counties, Maricopa and Pima, on the outstanding vote counts there. We anticipate that really any moment. Of course, that's Phoenix and Tucson. If the Republican nominee wins a Senate in Arizona as well as either Nevada or Georgia, election deniers will have given the party control of the Senate. That's a big if. It's not how the numbers look right now, but it is still possible. I'm joined now by our Political Director David Chalian. So, David, how did election denier candidates for the Senate fare?",

There's like gradations of election denialism, not all election deniers equal some of these folks they voted back in January of 2021 to challenge the certification of the vote. That sometimes gets called an election denier. Some are just outright, like Ron Johnson or others, that have been much more vocal. So, we should be clear about that.But when you look at the board, you can see all those that are in the winner column there, and that includes newcomers, like J.D. Vance from Ohio or Eric Schmitt from Missouri. You noted, Erin, the critical three in the middle there, these three races that are still outstanding, one we know going to a December 6th runoff in Georgia. But the Arizona and Nevada races do feature, again, gradations of election denialism. We saw that tape, that documentary that Blake Masters was in a conversation with Donald Trump, where he said don't go soft on election denialism because you'll lose the race. And he said, don't worry, sir, I'm not going to go soft, after his debate. So, we see that middle column there that is critical. And then you see some folks who lost. As we know, sort of the MAGA wing of the party did not have the best night and some high-profile losses there, like Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania or Don Bolduc in New Hampshire. You remember, he was a total election denier and then flip flopped on it as soon as he became the nominee, but to no great success, obviously. Also in secretary of state races, Erin, and these are people running who in many of these states would, if they were to win, be the top elections official in their state, and you see the sort of scorecard there. You have four winners so far, two, these two races we're watching closely, Mark Finchem, Jim Marchant, in Arizona and Nevada respectively, they're both behind their Democratic opponents right now. So, that also speaks to if they end up losing those races, and this was a central theme in their races, maybe democracy was also one of those issues that the Democrats were closing on that didn't necessarily materialize in polls but may have had an impact here.
