I'm Jake Tapper. And we're live in Delco, also known as Delaware County, one of the collar counties of Philadelphia. If you've heard the phrase before, it's because these counties played a crucial role in so many elections, and they will play a critically important role again this year.We're just 13 days away from Election Day, and while the vice president is heading here for tonight's debate -- I mean, for tonight's event, Donald Trump is on the campaign trail in Georgia, another critical battleground. Trump's team is also fighting to deflect from and discredit a report in the Atlantic and another one in \"The New York Times\" that says, while President Trump told his staff, quote, \"I need the kind of generals that Hitler had,\" people who were totally loyal to him, that follow orders, that coming from Trump's longest serving Chief of Staff, John Kelly, the retired Marine General, who has also told the \"Times\" that Trump would rule like a dictator if re-elected, and that he meets the definition of a fascist and that he does not understand America or the Constitution. The Trump campaign has called Kelly's accusations, quote, \"debunked stories\" and said that General Kelly suffers from Trump derangement syndrome, and Vice President Harris reacted earlier today to these stories.

So I expect her, she intends to, I'm told, talk about the generals comment here tonight as part of her disqualification message.But mobilization is also part of her effort. She still needs to get people to vote who are ambivalent, are exhausted, are sort of tired of all of this.

Friends, Harris is coming here to Delaware County, Pennsylvania, one of the collar counties outside Philly.Harris is here for tonight CNN town hall, where she has a chance to sway persuadable undecided voters. Meanwhile, Trump, who declined to be part of CNN's town hall, although you can always change your mind, Mr. Trump, waters warm, anyway, he's holding a rally tonight in Georgia. Let's bring in my panel of political experts to discuss. Kate, Bob Woodward reveals in his new book \"War\" about donors last summer, 2023, concerned about Biden's mental fitness after interacting with him at a fundraiser in June, 2023. Woodward writes, quote, \"guests describe their interactions with Biden as painful. \"He never completed a sentence\" said Bill Reichblum,\" co-founder and president of Liberties Journal Foundation, who attended with his wife and father-in-law, a former U.S. ambassador to Romania.\" Quote, \"He would start to talk about something, jump somewhere else. He told the same story three times in exactly the same way and it meandered so much. It was striking.\" I do think that one of the reasons why this election is so close is because people don't know much about Kamala Harris, and that decision dates back to the decision to for Biden to stay in the race until he wasn't. KATE BEDINGFIELD. FORMER BIDEN WHITE HOUSE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR: Well, I think part of the reason this election is closed is because there is across the world, an anti-incumbent sentiment that Kamala Harris is having to navigate and message against. I think, given that she has been in the race for 100 days, she's done a tremendous amount to move up both her own favorability. She's moved it, I think, 15 points in the 100 days that she's been in the race, almost 100 days. And she's made progress on the question of, who do you trust more on the economy. So, you know, I think she has done a lot in the amount of time that she has had to move the race in her direction. You know, and on this question of Biden. I mean, look, I left the White House in March of 2023, my experience with Joe Biden was that he was competent. He was capable. He was effective. And I think as voters are looking today at who to vote for, you've got Donald Trump out saying, you know, he wishes he had generals like Hitler, and you have Kamala Harris talking about what she wants to do to make sure that women still have reproductive freedom in this country and improve the economy for the middle class, and that's the choice that people are going to have.",

The President had to drop out of the race for a reason, and I think this does lend to some credibility issues for the vice president, particularly with some of those moderate leaning Republicans. It's one thing to expect those individuals who lean to the right to vote for someone like Joe Biden. Joe Biden, I would even argue, as a conservative, was typically a traditional centrist leaning Democrat. I could see how some Republicans could justify that vote.You look at someone like a Kamala Harris, and I would argue Republicans have done a pretty effective job of painting the vice president as an Uber progressive individual who's all of a sudden, as of late, attempting to change some of her previous ideological dispositions as it pertains to policy, because she's running for the top of the ticket. I think tonight's going to be fundamental for her. But as I'm looking at it, there's still some cracks within the Democratic base for Vice President Harris, particularly among communities of color. She is still around nine to 10 points behind where she needs to be traditionally speaking. We saw President Obama, former President Obama, speak about this a week or two ago. So it's good that she's here, but she really should be talking to black voters where they are, because that's the base. You've got to turn out your base at this stage of the game.

We need actions now.If they don't see strong action, they still see that the U.S. government want to negotiate with them, want to get back to nuclear deal. So then, there is no reason for them to target more Iranians, more U.S. citizens, more U.S. officials. Because the Islamic Republic only understand one language, their language is hostage taking, killing, assassination. So, now I'm waiting for the future president of United State of America to see how they're going to deal with the negotiators of terror.",

It's a Joe DiMaggio jersey that was a personal gift to Giuliani from Joe DiMaggio. Secondly, he also says there's something that he's giving to Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss that was a gift from the first soldiers who entered Afghanistan following September 11th. He doesn't specify that what that is. And then in addition to that, we know he's been ordered to turn over a 1980 Mercedes-Benz once owned by Lauren Bacall. Giuliani says now that is the only vehicle in his possession that he will be giving to these two women that they can sell. His statement also says that he is being unfairly punished by partisan political activists. What he hasn't done however though, Jake, is done anything in court to try and thwart or over turn this order. It is on the books.
