(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Ten days of demonstrations and the latest march through Paris begins to feel almost routine. Within a few hours this, though, was the scene. KILEY (on camera):  Concern over the rising level of violence has led the unions to ask for a dialogue with the government.

And clearly, they're hell-bent on trying to make sure that they don't gain the upper hand in what is beginning to turn into, albeit relatively small- scale, but pitch battles here on the streets of Paris. KILEY (voice-over):  Interior Ministry numbers put today's demonstration in Paris at 93,000. That's a 27,000 drop on the union- organized protests last Thursday. And across France, the numbers demonstrating were also down from a peak of about 1.28 million to only 740,000 today. [05:35:10] Opponents of the plan to raise the pensionable age in France from 62 to 64 must not pin their hopes on forcing a U-turn on the French government through street protests. But after two months of frequent strikes the austerity of protests in terms of lost earnings is beginning to bite. Garbage collection will return for the first time in weeks, to Paris, on Wednesday -- a sign perhaps that the fire is slowly going out on the opposition to pension reforms but not opposition to President Emmanuel Macron himself.
