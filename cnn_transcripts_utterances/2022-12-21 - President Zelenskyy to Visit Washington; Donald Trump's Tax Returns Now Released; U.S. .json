I'm Kristie Lu Stout.And just ahead, after years shrouded in secrecy, Donald Trump's tax documents set to be released just days from now. What the public may finally learn about the former U.S. president's personal finances ahead. Volodymyr Zelenskyy heads to Washington, the Ukrainian president preparing for a day of high stakes meetings on his first foreign trip since Russia's invasion began. And 70 million people are under winter alerts in the United States as a phenomenon known as a bomb cyclone develops. In the coming hour Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be in Washington for his first trip outside Ukraine since the war began 10 months ago. Now the White House says President Joe Biden invited Mr. Zelenskyy to underscore the United States enduring commitment to Ukraine. The two leaders are set to meet at the White House. The visit will coincide with an announcement by Mr. Biden of another aid package for Ukraine totaling almost $ billion, which will include the highly advanced Patriot missile defense systems. In a tweet, Mr. Zelenskyy confirmed he is headed to the U.S. to, quote, \"strengthen resilience and defense capabilities. He will also address a joint meeting of Congress. The U.S. House speaker says it will be in honor to have him on Capitol Hill.

One is symbolic to send a message, particularly to Russia that the western alliance, particularly the U.S. are still behind Ukraine and still willing to provide support.And of course, the second part of the mission is substantial. President Zelenskyy wants more aid, more weapons, and is set to get that. President Biden, according to the sources to CNN is set to provide a package of assistance worth almost $2 billion including the much sought-after Patriot missiles that Ukraine has spent months asking for, as for what's on the agenda. He is set to meet with President Biden at the White House, hold bilateral meetings with other lawmakers and then address a joint session of Congress. Now, President Zelenskyy, clearly this is a major risk leaving the country's security concerns were very high on the agenda. He didn't actually confirm that he was doing this until he said he was on his way in a tweet just about two hours ago. But he did drop a hint in a visit to the frontline city of Bakhmut on Tuesday where he was presented with a flag by Ukrainian soldiers to deliver to the U.S. Congress. Have a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator):  It is a complicated situation. The enemy increases the number of its troops.

Taking the individual weapons, the Patriot missiles would be crucial in Ukraine's efforts to thwart Russia's air assault that continues to bombard energy and civilian infrastructure in the country. [03And Ukraine's air defense systems have been fairly effective in stopping a large majority of the missiles and drone attacks that have been coming in. But the Patriot missiles are longer range, higher altitude and would provide another layer on top of that. Another type of weapon that the US is said to be thinking of providing are precision bomb kits, a way to sort of convert what are called dumb bombs to sort of regular bombs into guided ones. And that would help attack Russian positions, which we course also know, we know are entrenched in both the southern and the eastern front lines.",

Went through a court fight that Donald Trump took all the way to the Supreme Court to try to shield those tax returns from becoming public. He lost that fight.Ultimately, those returns turned over to Democrats just a matter of weeks ago. But in a party line vote, the House Democrats in their final days in power, the ways and means Committee voted to release those tax returns from six years, six recent years, as well as not just his individual returns, but his business returns as well. That vote 24 to 16 along party lines to release both a report from the committee investigating this, as well as all of those returns. Now at first on the report, there were two that were released late on Tuesday night. One of which is a committee's investigation that found that the mandatory presidential audit system, that the IRS employees for all sitting president, they say that it was dormant during the Trump years. They say that is an essential program because they need to ensure that a president is not compromised in any way in signing legislation into law. But they said it was not essentially in use until April of 2019. That is when Richard Neal, the Chairman of The Ways and Means Committee, a Democrat, started to inquire about Donald Trump's tax returns. They say at that point, that's when the IRS audit program kicked into gear, and they said it never was completed over the six years of returns that they ultimately obtained. Now, there was a separate report by the Joint Committee on Taxation analyzing those returns, it raises some question about some of the deductions that Donald Trump took suggested that perhaps more investigation might be warranted. It did not make a judgment one way or the other, but it got into the numbers of his deductions, his losses, and the income that he reported. But we expect a lot more, including all details of those tax returns in the days ahead. Right now, the committee is trying to redact some of the sensitive security information, some of the confidential information like social security numbers and the like. Once that is done, they will be released this and it will come out before Democrats are no longer in power in the House. January 3rd is when Republicans take over. Republicans attacking Democrats for misusing their power in releasing Donald Trump's returns. Donald Trump's spokesperson also attacking committee Democrats. But nevertheless, they are moving forward, and also moving forward on legislation to mandate, mandate how presidents are audited under the -- by the IRS.

What was his income? What were his deductions? Did he take more deductions than he was entitled to? Did he understate his income? And these kinds of questions about whether his deductions were properly documented. Did he follow the law? With Donald Trump it always comes down to that question, our principle that no one is above the law. In this case it's tax law. And I will be looking to see whether the law was broken here.

      "sentences": "Look, Kristie, this is a huge blow to women and girls hoping to return to university, but also, of course, a huge blow in general to the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan.As you laid out there, we've already seen the Taliban rolling back the rights of women and girls, freedoms that have been so hardly fought for over the last two decades. They were banned from returning to school in March just as those schools were due to reopen after months of closure. We've seen tougher restrictions in universities as well over the last few months. Segregated classrooms, different entrances, entrances for women and boys as well, of course in universities. So there have been those restrictions in place. It may not have come as a total surprise that the Taliban would then take this step to further roll back the rights of women and girls in education. But of course, a huge shock nonetheless for those hoping to be at university. This comes just months of course, after thousands of women and girls took their entrance exams, hoping to go to university, of course. So, this is a real moment of distress for women and girls at Afghanistan. Human Rights Watch has described this as a shameful decision, and it has drawn widespread condemnation from the international community.",

And western countries have said they won't give aid until the Taliban gives more equal rights.So, does the Taliban not want aid or international recognition?",

At every turn, we've seen the Taliban rolling back on fundamental human rights, not only of women and girls, but of the Afghan population in general. There's tougher restrictions. Then we heard yesterday from a U.N. spokesperson describing at this latest move as yet another broken promise from the Taliban. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEPHANE DUJARRIC, U.N. SPOKESPERSON:  It's clearly another broken promise from the Taliban. We have seen since their takeover, and also, in the past months just a lessening of the space for women, not only in education, but access to public areas. Their non-participation in the public debate. It's difficult to imagine how a country can develop, can deal with all of its the challenges that it has without the active participation of women and the education of women. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Of course, we've seen that condemnation from the international community, from the United Nations.We heard yesterday from the United States condemning this decision. The State Department's spokesperson, Ned Price saying in a statement, the Taliban's recent decision will further alienate the Taliban from the international community and deny them the legitimacy they desire.

Now that ban it came on the same day the Taliban released two Americans who had been detained in Afghanistan since August. One of them is a filmmaker. Ivor Shearer who was arrested along with his producer while filming in Kabul. It's still not clear what led to their release, but the U.S. State Department welcomed the move. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NED PRICE, SPOKESMAN, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT:  We are in a position to welcome the release of two Americans, two U.S. nationals from detention in Afghanistan. We are providing these two U.S. nationals with all appropriate assistance. They will soon be reunited with their loved ones. And we are absolutely gratified, to see that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And after spending more than three hours to do just a sheer 25 kilometers from the international airport, the team decided to jump on helicopters and instead did a flyover over these ocean of people that gathered in around the Buenos Aires obelisk to celebrate the victory in the Qatar 2022 World Cup. Now as on late on Tuesday the party here in Bueno Aires is still going. And it's perhaps a sign of how much this victory is felt in a nation that really breeds through football, but is also finding some elation, some relief, and some pride at a deep troubled economy is in dire strait. But for the past three days, this country really put on a party like no other before. For CNN, this is Stefano Pozzebon, Buenos Aires.",
