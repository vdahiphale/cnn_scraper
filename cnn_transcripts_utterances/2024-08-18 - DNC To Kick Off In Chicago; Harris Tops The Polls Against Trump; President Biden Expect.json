We're less than 24 hours away from the opening of the 2024 Democratic National Convention. Vice President Kamala Harris's ascension to the top of the ticket making this a dramatically different event from what we were expecting just a month ago.So let's take a look at this week's schedule. Opening night will feature the man many thought would be accepting this nomination, President Joe Biden. Former President Barack Obama headlining Tuesday night. On Wednesday, Governor Tim Walz delivering his vice presidential acceptance speech. And it's all building up to Thursday night when Vice President Kamala Harris will accept the Democratic nomination for president. A party that was struggling to gain any momentum will be going into this convention week with the wind at their backs. We have new polling from \"Washington Post,\" ABC News and Ipsos out this morning. It shows Harris up four points in a head to head matchup with Donald Trump. That is outside the margin of error. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is joining us now. Jeff, there's a lot to dig through in this new polling that we're getting and it really underscores how dramatically different this landscape is.",

      "sentences": "I mean, Jessica, we cannot overstate how different this race is. It was one month ago today that the Republican convention was ending in Milwaukee. Think of everything that's changed in one month. But that is all going to be underscored here on the convention floor. When you talk to Democrats, they are united. They're excited. But they also know that this is still a tough race.Let's look at those polls again. So interesting that \"Washington Post\" poll, it is showing Vice President Harris 49 to 45 percent for the former president. And when you add in RFK Jr., it tightens somewhat. But the reason this is happening, if you look inside these polls, there's no doubt the vice president is consolidating her base. Younger voters, voters of color, and female voters are rallying behind her. If you look at our CNN poll of polls, which is an average of all the polls, that is showing, again, within the margin of error, the vice president there at 50 percent, Donald Trump at 48 percent. But it shows that Democrats are back in the game. But again, a very close race. However, look at these battleground polls. This is certainly more instructive than the national polls. The \"New York Times,\" the Siena College polls shows that the vice president now has a lead in three of the four of these. Georgia the only exception here. This is coming on the heels of last week's polls in the blue wall states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania. So taken together, this is something Democrats have not really enjoyed this moment yet in this race. they are at a narrow advantage, but it's an advantage nonetheless and momentum is on her side. So perhaps the biggest question, the biggest thing coming out of these four or five days from now, does she keep that momentum? And conventions are scripted affairs. So there's every reason to think that she will, as she is sort of filling the blanks here with a roster of people raising her up. Former presidents, the current president, et cetera.",

You know, the campaign team is largely intact. I mean, the same people who were running different departments on the campaign are still running those departments. Jen O'Malley Dillon, the chair of our campaign, is still the chair. Julie Rodriguez is still the campaign manager.So a lot of the infrastructure is still very much the same. And the message is, you know, obviously Vice President Harris has her own message that she's delivering. But in terms of what we stand for, the values of being the Democratic Party, the values of, you know, fighting for working class people, you know, fighting for the middle class, you know, looking forward, not backward, those values are still very much intact and very thematic of our campaign. And what you will see this week here in Chicago is, you know, President Biden really passing the torch to the next generation, to borrow a very commonly used phrase. And Vice President Harris will talk about her vision. She'll lay out her plan. And you'll see a number of validators talking about her, you know, people who worked with her when she was attorney general, people who worked with her in the Senate, people who had worked with her at different parts of her career, really going on stage and validating her. And, you know, to the point that you and Jeff just talked about, really kind of reintroducing her and what she stands for to the American people.",

That could be an opportunity for you all to really impress upon people her message and have her introduce herself.It's also an opportunity for the Trump campaign to continue to define her. How do you blunt them from doing that and make sure it's your message that gets to those 36 percent?",

We will be telling the story of her, what she stands for, what her vision is for the American people. Stephanie Cutter, who is brilliant, who ran the 2020 convention and the inauguration for President Biden, is leading the charge here, really making sure that we're telling that story.So we have a really smart team in place that is using messaging and incorporating that in a way that I think the American people who are tuning in hopefully every night will come out of this understanding what her vision is, what her priorities are as the nominee. But look, I mean, you know, sure, the Trump campaign can try to define her all they want. They've been throwing, you know, kind of some of these garbage attacks at her that are not sticking. We also just announced the $360 million, think about that, Jess, $360 million ad blitz on digital and broadcast media, really making sure that we are ensuring that the American people understand her and what her vision is, fighting for middle class families, lowering costs for Americans, while also drawing that contrast with Project 2025, which Trump has, no matter what he tries to do, his fingerprints are all over that agenda. It would be incredibly divisive if it becomes, you know, part of the American, you know, system if he becomes president, if it's enacted. So we're going to make sure that over the next few weeks, when early voting starts in Pennsylvania, which is in mid-September, that every single American understands what's at stake here in this election and every single American understands that Vice President Harris is in this race to fight for them and to protect their values.",

That was something a major part of her platform that she really talked about in her economic speech. And a lot of those policies are the same as President Biden's. But I think over the next few weeks, you will see her continue to show that she does share a lot of his values, but she has her own plan to going forward. But I think she's got it. She's excited about all the work that they did together. They've been true partners. And I think you will see President Biden tomorrow night really talk about that strong partnership, that strong bond that they have had ever since he chose her to be his running mate in 2020, and that she's been a consistent part of all the success of this administration has had.",

On inflation, 61 percent of Americans trust Trump over Biden, I assume Harris. And on the economy, 56 percent. Those aren't close numbers. Those are the three most important things of voters. I told the former president he needs to keep talking about those things. He's to continue to drive those messages home. You're going to see events these coming weeks that are going to focus on jobs, the border, crime, small events. And this is going to be a close race. Nobody expect it to be a blowout. It is not going to be a blowout. It's going to be 50,000 votes there, 25,000 votes here. Erie County, Pennsylvania, right. Luzerne and Lackawanna Counties, Northampton County, Bucks County, how those counties go.",

It said, \"After listening to the mediators about the recent round of talks in Doha, it became clear to us once again that Netanyahu continues to place obstacles to reaching an agreement, sets new conditions and demands in order to thwart the efforts of the mediators and prolong the war.\" There are a lot of issues brewing here, Jessica, including who will control the border between Gaza and Egypt. Also, proposals from the Israeli side to have some sort of security corridor in the central part of Gaza that Hamas says will effectively split Gaza in half. Blinken will go from here to Cairo later this week to continue to meet with negotiators. But the real concern here, Jessica, is that that optimism we're hearing from the U.S. and Israeli sides is not shared by the Hamas side. And when you start to get to the stage of these negotiations where folks are assigning blame, the negotiators are starting to point fingers about who might be responsible if these talks fall apart, that's a worrisome stage, Jessica. That said, hope is not gone, but it's a change in rhetoric and it's certainly a change in perception from the Hamas side of these talks.",
