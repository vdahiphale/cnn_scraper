This is special coverage of the extraordinary and still confusing events we have been reporting on for the past 24 hours out of Russia and of what will be a critical day ahead for Vladimir Putin.What we witnessed over the last 24 hours appears to have been the most serious threat to Putin's hold on power in decades. At this hour we know a lot, but it's important to point out there is a lot that is not known. For instance, what will be the fate of the man in the back seat of this SUV, Yevgeny Prigozhin, cheered by some as he appeared to be leaving Rostov-on-Don, the southern Russian town his mercenary force had just occupied. This video taken just hours after he called off his mercenaries from their push toward Moscow and agreed to a deal brokered by Russia's ally, Belarus. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGHOZIN, HEAD OF WAGNER PRIVATE MILITARY COMPANY (through translator): Therefore, realizing all the responsibility for the fact that Russian blood will be shed from one of the sides, we turn our columns around and leave in the opposite direction to the field camps, according to the plan.

Joining me this evening, CNN International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson, Former CNN Moscow Bureau Chief Jill Dougherty, and CNN Senior International Correspondent Ivan Watson. So, Nic, I want to start with you. Earlier today, Vladimir Putin was referring to Prigozhin as a treasonous person who would be held accountable.

Incredibly bravely and made that, you know, sort of heroic video saying I'm here, my people are here. For him to now be in a position to say, Vladimir Putin fled Moscow, and again we don't know if that's the case, it just -- the irony is somewhat -- I mean, it's extraordinary.What does this mean for the war in Ukraine, though? I mean, the Wagner forces have, as we said before, were, you know, really on the front lines. I mean, the battle of Bakhmut, they often led the way, they took heavy, heavy casualties.

Until, all of a sudden, we saw them packing up their gear and essentially invading Russia and launching a mercenary mutiny, that's something I never thought we'd be reporting on.

However, he was pretty important for Vladimir Putin as well.If you look at the beginnings, it really was pretty small at the start. He was in jail in the 1980s, in the Soviet Union, and started selling hot dogs in the 1990s in St. Petersburg. Now, it was there that he founded a catering company and became known as Putin's chef. And from there, things really went up for Yevgeny Prigozhin. He started a media company which then turned into a media and propaganda empire, which, of course, the U.S. says meddled heavily in the 2016 presidential election. Yevgeny Prigozhin actually indicted for that in the United States. But then there was the Wagner private military company. And I saw them and action, really at the beginning, when they were starting to go to places like Syria. And on the ground in Syria, their forces back then were pretty much doing base protection for the Russian military that was on the ground in Syria. But from there, things really did evolve. They started getting involved in the oil business in Syria, then, of course, also things like gold and diamonds in African countries and started training the forces of African countries as well. But it really wasn't until the war in Ukraine that Wagner turned into pretty much a full-on army with really heavy weapons. If you look at the battle in Bakhmut, for instance, some of the firepower that was unleashed there by the artillery, by the tanks that Wagner now had in its possession, that certainly seemed to be a very professional army. And it was now that Yevgeny Prigozhin seemed to be at the height of his power, but it appears as though he's gone one step too far, Anderson.",

Why do you -- why did Vladimir Putin allow this guy all these months to spout off, attack his generals and the execution of the war? Was it because the -- his troops were so important to the war effort or did Vladimir Putin like that he was going after his generals and having some chaos around him?

And he was -- he really didn't want anyone to challenge him for power and -- but he -- but has never thought that Yevgeny Prigozhin could be the person to be really dangerous. So, Putin loves rat races. He loves giving the same orders to different people and watching them run. So, he thought that Prigozhin might be dangerous for Minister of Defense Shoigu and might be his rival, but he never expected that his puppet, as he considered Prigozhin, can stop being a puppet. You know, that's some kind of Pinocchio moment when Pinocchio thought that he was not a puppet but a real boy, that's what happened to Prigozhin last year when he unexpectedly realized that he's becoming very popular and he loved that moment. COOPER: Yes. I mean, you could tell in the videos that he was constantly making -- you know, dressed up like a Wagner fighter. He's not -- he has no military experience. He's not an actual fighter, but he was certainly -- you know, somebody dressed him like one and he talked very tough in all these videos. Why do you -- what happens to him now?

April fool. And Prigozhin, excuse me, the head of the Wagner Group has agreed to go to Belarus as an exile. Well, this is, you know, a very strange turn of events to me and it makes me wonder what Putin did to leverage him to cause him to suddenly change and agree to such an arrangement. And Belarus, by the way, is no safe haven for Prigozhin because the -- you know, Russia -- I mean, Belarus is essentially an extension of Russia. So --",

A part from their global involvement in places like Syria and Africa, they're all over the place. And so, what happens to them? That's a good question.

If there are other -- any indications whatsoever of another coup attempt, if this was a coup attempt, where another group or another party would try to take advantage of Putin's vulnerability. I mean, he clearly just diminished or humiliated, embarrassed both the domestically and globally. So, are others making a move against him or is he going to -- is he able to solidify his control over the national security apparatus?The other thing, of course, in a situation like this is the Intelligence Community is going to be very sensitive to watching the nuclear arsenal and its state of readiness and any changes there too, either strategic or tactical.

Because in the span of less than 24 hours you had something come of nothing, it appeared, and then, all of a sudden, you have a major city in the south taken over and a march towards Moscow and then it's over.But my understanding, from their perspective, is that this was a real challenge to Russian military leadership by Prigozhin, this was not playacting, this was not something for show. And in fact, that it's the western intelligence point of view that Prigozhin have been preparing for this for some time in a number of ways, massing weapons and ammunition, reaching out to contacts in regular army units in Russia to see if he could, in effect, bring them on to his side. But also, and this is something we had seen in public in recent weeks, Prigozhin making greater and greater and greater critical comments against the Russian military leadership but also targeting Putin himself. So, this was planned, it was prepared, Prigozhin made quite an effort in terms of taking off Rostov-on-Don in the south and then sending his troops north. And that this agreement that came to be, perhaps, equally surprising to some degree, was an effort just to stop this before this got worse. But this was a very real -- for the time that it lasted, Anderson, a very real, at least the intention to be a very real challenge to Putin's leadership.",
