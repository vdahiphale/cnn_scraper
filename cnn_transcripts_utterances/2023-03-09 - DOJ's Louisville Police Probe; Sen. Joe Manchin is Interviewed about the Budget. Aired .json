We just played for you what Breonna Taylor's mom said, but there were and are so many people in Louisville who were dismissed. One woman told DOJ in this investigation that she had told the police over and over again about this detective who was extorting sex from her daughter and they didn't believe her. And it turns out he was. And it turns out five years later, after potentially other victims, that this was actually addressed.Can -- will people be believed now?",

This was after -- I wrote in the book - in my book, after all these incidents, it's -- the ideology with which we currently deploy police in major cities is tantamount to exercising a melanoma with a blowtorch. In neighborhoods where racial bias shapes police response, black people are still being admonished to go slow as they push for change. But how much more slowly could we have gone? When you think about that, you were saying, this is a 36 -- there are36 ways that they're saying that there should be improvements in the department. Are you going to act quickly? Are you taking your time? When are you going to implement these, Chief? INTERIM CHIEF JACKIE GWINN-VILLAROEL, LOUISVILLE METRO POLICE: We're already acting. And we're already in the process of reform. Many of the recommendations within the report is highlighting some of the things that we already have pushed forward with having our accountability improvement bureau stood up, which encompasses our wellness. We want our officers to be whole (ph). We want them to be mentally, financially, and spiritually well. And so we're underway with that. We want to make sure that we are hearing the community and by providing them an outlet for them to be able to come and speak with us directly. We're doing just that. So, in the report, and you also see that the report did state that we are already making those improvements. And so, yes, we're not waiting, we're not stopping, we're moving aggressively ahead because, let me say this, whether the DOJ was here or not, we should be a premier department. We should be a department that the citizens of Louisville can be proud of. And, guess what, for us, internally, to be proud of our ourselves. So, no, we're not waiting, we're moving forward.",

I'm quoting the White House there.This has no chance of actually getting passed, no traction it's going to gain in Congress, but it is a statement of priorities as Capitol Hill is gearing up for a pending showdown over the debt ceiling. So, to talk with us about that showdown is Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who serves on the Appropriations, Armed Services and Energy and Natural Resources Committees.

Kaitlan, what we have to understand, first of all, in the last 10years, since 2013, we've added about $17 trillion to $18 trillion of new debt. Some of that was attributable to Covid. But shouldn't we be looking at how we accumulate so much debt so quickly? And both sides are to blame. So, if Democrats want to blame Republicans, Republicans want to blame Democrats, this is an American problem we have to fix. And the blame game is not going to fix it. I can't tell you if $3 trillion's enough, if it's anywhere close to what we - where we need to be. But I can tell you, we've accumulated over $17 triller to $18 trillion, from $13 trillion to $31.5 trillion as we speak. That breaks down to $94,000 per person in America. For every person in America, children, everybody, that's $94,000. The interest this year, Kaitlan, is $600 billion. If we do nothing, which I'm happy to see that the president's changing the trajectory, but if we do nothing, that's $130 trillion by 2015. $130 trillion of debt. $5 trillion a year will be spent towards interest. That is non-attainable whatsoever. We would not be a superpower of the world. We've got to start getting our financial house in order, period. And it's going to be tough.",

How much new debt did we accumulate during Covid because of all the subsidies? And is it possible to start going back and just getting back to normal before you start cutting the bejesus and scaring people to death. That's what gets people all upset.But for Democrats to say, oh, no, we're not going -- just vote for it clean, well, that's not going to happen. That's not recommend. We should be talking about during a debt crisis and a debt ceiling, how do we fix it? And we fix it by basically being more disciplined. And we're not there. They're not even getting a budget. The president's budget is about a month late. He's putting a budget out, but it's about a month late. The House and Senate is supposed to have a budget before us on April the 1st and have reconciliation by April the 15th. And then by September the 30th, we're supposed to have a complete budget done. If we do that, that saves billions of dollars. If we just do our jobs. So, there's so many things that we can do and be disciplined and do our jobs the same as all Americans have to do.",

But we're going to look at everything that we possibly can. How come we've increased $3.5 trillion of spending in 2013? How did it get to $6.2 trillion? How did that happen, OK? We know about -- discount the Covid, but how did that happen? And how come we have so much in what we call nondiscretionary funding? That means we can't even talk about it, Kaitlan. That means it's put over there. You're just going to have to continue to fund that. How did it grow so quickly? How do we have so many things that are so necessary that weren't before? Those types of things. And we should have that conversation.

So, I've been very clear about that.As far as the gentleman for the IRS, most qualified. He'll do a good job. That was a message I'm sending because the president and his administration is not adhering to the piece of legislation called the Inflation Reduction Act. They have touted that as strictly an environmental bill. And I can assure you, we put that together and negotiated after we put it together. No one even knew that my -- me and my staff were working on it, Kaitlan. It was for energy security. My goodness, when you saw Putin do what he did with energy, and you know what's happening to our friends in the EU and Europe and all over, and then basically not being able to produce the energy we have under our feet in our great country, and we're asking other countries, such as Iran and Venezuela, the greatest terrorist supporter in the world, Iran, you want them to have more money to create more havoc to humankind? I'm just - I was appalled. And I said, we've got to do things more and be more secured in our state, and our country, so that we can help our allies if they start looking elsewhere for energy. Everything they're rolling out is relaxing, and I just said, you're trying to basically reconfigure a piece of legislation that we passed, that we passed in the Congress, to something that you want and wasn't in that legislation.
