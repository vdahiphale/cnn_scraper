And the weather is only making things worse.In Sicily this week temperatures reached 47 degrees Celsius or 178 degrees Fahrenheit, creating a prime environment for wildfires. More than 40 of them broke out in the southern Italian island on Monday night including one at a landfill that produced poisonous fumes. More than 1500 people have evacuated. But that brings danger of its own. Harrowing journey on a road flanked by flames. And an airport on Sicily was forced to close earlier Tuesday after wildfires came dangerously close to the tarmac. It's now operating with major delays. Greece's prime minister says firefighters are working 24 hours a day to contain the blaze on the island of Rhodes, Corfu and Evia. He says the dire situation will likely get worse thanks to rising temperatures, strong winds and drought conditions. Two Greek Air Force officers died when their plane crashed while conducting a firefighting operation earlier. Let's get started now with Elinda Labropoulou joining us live from Athens. This is said to be another hot day there in Greece. Temperatures approaching somewhere close to 48 degrees in parts. So how is this all playing into what is already a weeks-long emergency?",

It is also the island where two officers died trying to put out the flames in the fire in an aircraft that crashed yesterday, causing the defense minister to call three days of mourning. People in Greece are following the fires very closely. At the moment, we understand that the biggest problems remain in roads. It's a very touristy island where thousands of people were at the time the fires began just over a week ago over 20,000 people have been evacuated. Some have gone to other islands. Some are being repatriated back home. The many fronts burning on the island of Corfu as well. The Greek prime minister has said that the country is at war with the fires and has said that it's going to be a very difficult summer ahead. Meanwhile, we expect these difficult conditions to continue throughout the day. Strong winds in the area. And of course, you know, the question for everyone, John, here is what happens after these blazes are out.

Experts say multiple reefs around the Florida Keys are completely bleached and could be dead within a week.

And that's because, you know, we have to try to at least, you know, run the country by virtue of laws and then higher principles. But of course it gets murky because even our basic laws which are a bit of the quasi-constitution we have are not well- defined. In fact they're not defined at all.They can pass by a regular parliamentary plurality. They can be overturned by a regular parliamentary plurality unless they are specifically entrenched and even in that case they require 61 members of the Knesset to be overturned. So they're very weak. Can the court rule on them? Yes, the courts has asserted its authority to rule on Israeli legislation, and basic laws count. However, the legitimacy that the court might have or not have for doing so is very tenuous. The court has heard cases with relation to basic laws in the past, specifically challenges to the 2018 Nation State Law which was very controversial because many people felt that that is a law that entrenches inequality in Israel and privileges for Jews. The court, you know, rejected the petitions in that case but the right-wing which supported the Nation State Law was furious, and said that the court should never have had the authority even to hear a case about a basic law. So I can only imagine that the court is well aware, that should it actually strike down an amendment to the basic law of the judiciary, the one that was passed two days ago which severely limits the court's power to review executive decisions.

It fell apart ideologically even though they had a few core things unifying members.There's no guarantee that elections even if the current coalition would not win that the opposition could form a government. If they could, yes, they can absolutely overturn this law. They had vowed to do so. But I think we have to take into account that under the banner of this law the government can make a whole series of changes that are not so easy to reverse. And that's why many people feel there is irreversible damage. I'm not even talking about the social crisis, and in fact, you know, senior military officials are already saying the damage to the army because of the movements of refusal will take years to undo. Economists talk about years' worth of economic damage that will have to undo. But even at the political level, specifically the fact that the Supreme Court cannot review government executive actions is likely to influence government appointments. The government can make a whole series of appointments now, of political cronies in all levels of government including professional levels that, you know, should be independent professionals appointed to those positions. That can significantly change the nature of civil service in Israel, politicized civil service in various levels of the government. And that would take ages to undo even as if the law is quickly overturned.

They believe Russia has depleted its stockpile of more than 400 drones Iran provided for its war in Ukraine, and say when the new factory is completed likely early next year, new drones could have a significant impact on the battlefield. Iran for its part flatly denies providing drones to Russia during the war.Ukraine says its military advancing towards the Russian held city of Bakhmut, the scene of some of the war's most intense fighting, certainly the longest battle we've seen. Both Russian and Ukrainian sources report heavy fighting in villages on the outskirts of Bakhmut. Ukraine's deputy defense minister claims Russian losses have outnumbered those of Ukraine by a ratio of eight or nine to one. Ukrainian military has been trying to encircle the city, but acknowledges the situation is more difficult north of Bakhmut. Meantime, they have made further gains on the southern battlefront near the cities Berdiansk and Melitopol. The U.S. secretary of state insists negotiations to free two Americans detained in Russia will not be impacted by revelations that previously freed American Trevor Reed was fighting against Russian forces in Ukraine.
