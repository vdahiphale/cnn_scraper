And we do begin this hour in Gaza where at least five aid workers. have been killed in an Israeli military strike. World Central Kitchen says those killed Monday were members of its team and in a statement made clear humanitarian aid workers and civilians should never be a target. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said an Australian aid worker was among those killed.

The New York Times cites four unnamed Israeli officials who acknowledge that Israel carried out the attack. CNN cannot independently verify that reporting. Iran says at least seven people were killed in the strike. They include two senior commanders of the Islamic Republican Guard, Revolutionary Guard, pardon me.

As we continue to try and parse exactly what's happened here in the fallout. Now, you believe these targeted assassinations are in fact a significant escalation in the Middle East conflict.What I want to ask you, though, is what kind of fallout do you think we can expect? TRITA PARSI, AUTHOR, \"LOSING AN ENEMY\": One of the most immediate fallouts may be that this uneasy ceasefire that has existed now for six weeks between the United States and militias in Iraq and Syria, prior to that, were targeting U.S. troops on a daily basis and, as you remember, killed three us troops in a base in Jordan and Syria. That has been as a result of pressure by the United States on these militias, but also by Iran. And now the Iranians have sent a message to the U.S. through the Swiss it appears that the Iranians are holding the U.S. responsible for what Israel has done just as much as Israel holds, or the U.S. holds Iran responsible for what Iraqi militias do. And the message appears to have been, or may have been that this truce is now over and we may see an increase, a resumption of attacks by Iraqi militias and Syrian militias against us troops. And that would mean that the Israeli attack on Iran actually has put a target on the backs of American troops in the Middle East.",

Trump and his sons, Don Jr. and Eric, were fined for fraudulently inflating the value of his assets to obtain better loan rates.The bond was originally $464 million, but a court lowered it last month. Posting bond means that New York's attorney general cannot try and seize true Trump properties to cover the judgment, at least not until the state appeals court hears the case in September. The judge in Donald Trump's hush money trial has expanded the gag order against the former president. It will now prevent Trump from discussing the judge's family and the Manhattan district attorney's family. Over the weekend, Trump attacked the judge's daughter in social media posts. Judge Juan Merchan says Trump's rhetoric is a direct attack on the rule of law and it could make those involved in the case a free for their safety and the safety of their loved ones.

And what that means to me and I've been exposed to this as an accident investigator and we're trained to not do this.But what confirmation bias does is it says that if you're looking for something, if you intend that you're going to find something, guess what, you will find it. If you wanted to look at Airbus, you wanted to avoid Airbus or look at just the things that happened in Airbus, you would see those things too. If you wanted to look at a sausage factory and say, this isn't the right way to build a sausage, you don't want to know about a lot of the stuff that happens. What you need to remember is that there is triple redundancy built into every airplane, no matter what you see is happening. I mean, even when you look at the wheel that fell off the airplane, that looks like some tragic thing that has never happened before. And that's just simply not true. The reason that its designed that particular airplane with six tires on it is because its designed to land with two. So I know it sounds funny to say, but if that tire comes off, it's still built to be safe. No one died from that incident. No one died from the door plug that fell out. People are not dying from Boeing airplanes. We need to get a perspective and understand that things do happen. We're human beings and things will continue to happen whether it's Boeing, whether it's Airbus or the new Chinese airplanes, you're going to still see things happen because we are human beings. And I think you could go down the rabbit hole here and start looking for things that really aren't there.",

The film took eight months to release in Japan amid controversy over an unofficial marketing campaign that critics said trivialized the 1945 nuclear attacks. But the criticism hasn't deterred viewers entirely. During opening weekend in Japan, the movie grossed $2.5 million U.S. Abroad, the highly-lauded film won seven Oscars this year, including the coveted Best Picture and Best Actor Awards. Christopher Nolan, who also took home Best Director, will receive a knighthood in Britain for his services to film. But despite the film's global accolades, Japanese viewers tread lightly, wary of how the West remembers and depicts history from 78 years ago, a past far from forgotten in Japan.
