      "sentences": "Good morning. You're alive in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We do have breaking news at this hour. At any moment, the Supreme Court is expected to release opinions that could have a profound impact on American lives and American democracy. We're standing by for what could be one of the most consequential rulings in U.S. history, a decision Justice Gorsuch calls a, quote, rule for the ages, the question, whether a former president enjoys immunity from prosecution and is, in effect, above the law. That ruling could drop in just minutes. We're also awaiting a number of other major decisions from the justices, among them, a case challenging the prosecution of January 6th defendants. That opinion could throw out some of the criminal charges against Donald Trump. Plus, just days ahead of the two-year anniversary of the decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, another crucial case for women's reproductive rights. It could determine whether pregnant women experiencing a medical emergency have the right to an abortion. And we're standing by for an opinion that could give domestic abusers the right to own a firearm. Here with me now is Yale Law and Political Science Professor Akhil Reed Amar. He's also the author of The Words That Made Us, America's Constitutional Conversation. And, Akhil, we have been waiting for some time for this immunity decision to come down. And I do want to play what the conservative justices on the court have said about the law applying to people from the president on down during their confirmation hearings and here they are in their own words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  No man is above the law. CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS, U.S. SUPREME COURT:  I believe that no one is above the law under our under our system, and that includes the president. The president is fully bound by the law, the Constitution and statutes.",

George Washington never said that, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson. They did say, some of them, that while they're in office, they shouldn't be lightly messed with because they have to do the people's business. But that argument that they did put forth was always, and when we're out of office, we're going to be accountable just like everyone else. That's actually what the founders said. If it was anything other than that, the Constitution should have said so clearly, the founders should have said so clearly, because that's as they say in law, a big elephant, and elephants don't hide in mouse holes.So, if there was some general immunity for ex-presidents or ex- officers, we should have expected to see that in the text of the Constitution or the conversation. This is an originalist argument. When the Constitution ratified, we don't see that at all. So, I'm with those folks who say they're just like everyone else when they're out of office.",

Usually the Supreme Court gets out of dodge, gets out of town, end of June, beginning of July, definitely before July 4th. They came back into special session, back then in order to hear that the Trump -- the Nixon tapes case, excuse me, and that was the only case that they had. So, of course, they're going to be able to do that more quickly. We still have close to I think now, as of this nanosecond, 21 cases yet to be decided, and that's including, you know, I'm not counting the one that just came down three minutes ago.",

He argued a case, the Supreme Court, the most important case -- the only case he ever argued before John Marshall, his chief justice, Claude Hilton. And I'm just looking at the opinion right now.

Now, they also asked Roberts in this letter to outline the standards for recusal decisions and whether those have been met given the fact that there are two cases before the Supreme Court that involved former President Donald Trump, and there are some apparent conflicts of interests involving Alito and Thomas. So, they asked those questions. They want all of this outlined by the chief justice and back to their hands by July 5th. That's the deadline they have given him. Of course, Democrats, Jim, on Capitol Hill have been slowly growing the pressure amid all this growing ethics scandal. So, this is just one more example of them increasing the pressure, keeping up on the Supreme Court, of course, at a moment where all eyes are on the Supreme Court this morning. Jim?",

We have new details this morning on how the men and their teams of advisers are prepping for the rematch. A new poll by Fox shows Biden leading Trump by two percentage points among registered voters. That lead is within the margin of error, but it does show Biden making a three-point gain since May.

Well, Jim, unlike President Biden, Donald Trump is not spending the next week bunkering down and studying. In fact, he's got a fundraiser tonight in Ohio. He's holding a rally on Saturday in Pennsylvania, returning to the Philadelphia area once again. And he's also not doing mock debate sessions. That's something that the president is doing, as Arlette just said, something he actually did in the past, in previous cycles, with Donald Trump with Rudy Giuliani with Chris Christie.Instead, he's been holding sort of informal policy sessions, including with some of his potential running mates. He's met with J.D. Vance, with Senator Rubio, where they've talked policy and those in those interactions. He's also been huddling with some of his top advisers, his campaign managers, individuals like Kellyanne Conway and Stephen Miller has been prepping him on immigration, also talking to Richard Grenell, so sort of laying out some of the key of the policy areas where they feel like this debate is going to center on, immigration, the border, crime and inflation, and certainly abortion. But they've also been preparing him to face attacks from Joe Biden over these criminal convictions and as well as what he did and didn't do on January 6th. So, they are anticipating that those issues are going to come up and they're trying to figure out how they are going to respond to that. It's also been interesting to watch the former president in recent days, because for so long, they have been making this case that Joe Biden will be too feeble and having him on stage next to Trump will be a great visual comparison. Well, actually, recently, they've been sort of resetting the expectations and making the case that they think that Joe Biden is going to come out strong. They've been feeding into this conspiracy that has absolutely zero evidence that President Biden will show up with some sort of performance enhancers. But for their audience and their supporters who have heard nothing but about how Joe Biden is not up to the task, it's been interesting to watch this sort of leveling of expectations heading into next Thursday's debate.",
