It's wonderful to have you with us.

In an interview with FOX over the weekend, Trump claimed he's just fine with going to jail.

      "sentences": "Yes so. Severe storms and our ongoing wildfire threat across San Juaquin County. This is the Corral Fire, and you can see the charred landscape across this particular area.And you know what? This is a byproduct of a very wet spring and winter. So above-average precipitation. Now we're heading into the dryer months. The taps have been turned off, and that vegetation that grew so abundantly has now started to dry out. And that's a recipe for fire. And the Corral Fire, the good news here is that the containment has certainly gone up from yesterday. But it's all part of the bigger problem here, because the temperatures are really starting to skyrocket. We have excessive heat warnings and watches. Vegas, the mercury in the thermometer, by later this week could reach 120 degrees. So several U.S. cities, particularly across the state of California, could reach record high temperatures. You could see triple-digit heat from Phoenix to Vegas, Palm Springs, all the way to El Paso. And of course, riding that heat bubble is our severe weather threat today from Chicago all the way to Dallas, once again -- Kasie.",
