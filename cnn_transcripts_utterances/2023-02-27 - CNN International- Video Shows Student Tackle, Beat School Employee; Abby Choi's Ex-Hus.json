      "sentences": "And this incident really just highlights a growing problem for educators. And that is the rise of threats and violence directed their way, oftentimes by students inside of school grounds. We have a study by the American Psychological Association conducted during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. It surveyed over 15,000 educators, and it found that one-third of teachers reported being victimized. So, these are verbal threats of violence from students.And it turns out support staff, things like school resource officers, aides, like you've seen in this instance and bus drivers, they're most likely to report physical aggression with, in that case, 99 percent of aggressors actually being students. The survey also found that up to 34 percent of educators reported interest in either quitting or transferring schools because of the school climate or school safety issues. Now in this case, this teen was arrested. He faces a serious felony. Aggravated battery with bodily harm. He has since been turned over to the department of juvenile justice.

      "sentences": "That's right, because it's so shocking and gruesome because Abby Choi was not just murdered but dismembered. On Sunday, investigators found a skull, some ribs and hair believed to be her remains in large stainless steel soup pot. That is after they found some other body parts on Friday in a rental unit in a northern Hong Kong suburb, where they also found a meat slicer, electric saw and some clothing.And as of now, some parts of her body including the torso remain missing. That's why the police at one point deployed more than 100 personnel including divers in search of her remains. Now as you mentioned, what we do know is the ex-husband Alex Kwong and three of his family members have now been charged. But despite all the horrific details, one thing we have not found out is why. The motive, despite some speculation in local media, the authorities have not confirmed anything. Obviously, a lot of intense interest in Abby Choi who was a model with quite a bit of international exposure often seen photographed at fashion shows and with luxury brands from London to Paris to Shanghai. And also, was an influencer with more than 100,000 followers on Instagram. But all of that, of course, came to a screeching halt last Wednesday when she was reported missing in a city of more than 7 million residents. But for the most part considered to be very safe for people of all ages including young women. So you know, one thing that came out all this is this tragedy that she left behind two children she had with the ex-husband who is now, of course, awaiting trial for her very gruesome murder -- Max.",

They say the president's administration has put free and fair elections at risk. He says they are simply trying to discredit his government. Organizers estimated half a million people demonstrated in Mexico City but the local government put the number at 90,000. Some results are trickling in as votes are still being counted from Saturday's election in Nigeria. But anger is growing after officials didn't arrive at some polling stations. That mean some would be voters who waited for hours, may have lost their chance to pick the country's next president. Some voters went to a polling station to protest even as others were able to vote on Sunday, the day after the election. For more on this we're going to go Stephanie Busari. She's in Lagos for us. We're not going to get the full result, I understand it, for some time.",

But those agreements were undermined on Sunday by another deadly flare-up on the West Bank. It started when two Israeli settlers were fatally shot whilst driving and what officials say was a terrorist attack.Later, a Palestinian man was killed on what Palestinian officials called revenge attacks by Israeli settlers. The Israeli military now plans to send battalions to the West Bank to improve security. CNN's Hadas Gold joins us from Jerusalem. It's an impossible situation, isn't it, when they're trying to solve things on one level and then things keep flaring up and making those situations even harder?",

      "sentences": "Well, it goes to show you, Max, just the level of crisis that this region is in. Because scenes like what we saw yesterday are really unprecedented in a region that's already been beset by so much violence and death. It started as you noted, those two brothers, actually 19 and 21 years old were driving in their car along a busy thoroughfare that's used by both Palestinians and Israelis.And while they were sitting in traffic, Israeli officials say an attacker came up to them and shot them at point blank range before managing to get away. Then later in the day there was that summit in Aqaba with the Israelis, the Palestinian Authority, Americans, Egyptians, Jordanians, all aimed at trying to calm the situation on the ground, especially ahead of the overlapping holidays, Ramadan and Passover, which in the past, have seen tensions flare up even more, especially here in Jerusalem. And the communique coming out of that summit was seen positive. You know, the two sides, Israelis and Palestinians, agreeing to sit together in a joint security committee to try and reestablish security cooperation. Israelis talking about freezing discussions on settlements for a few months. Palestinians saying, they wouldn't go after the Israelis in the U.N. and the commitment to meet again in March before Ramadan in Egypt. But then, Max, as night fell, we got these scenes of essentially parts of the West Bank burning, Israeli settlers going on what's been called a rampage, burning homes, burning cars. We're getting lots of reports of casualties including one Palestinian man killed in what Palestinian officials are calling a revenge attack. They are saying that he was shot and killed by Israeli settlers. And I mean, I can't tell you the last time there were scenes like this, where you just had, you know, groups of Israeli settlers going through Palestinian towns burning homes. We've had stories of Palestinian families having to be evacuated actually by Israeli soldiers. Now, we are getting some reports of some settlers being arrested but there is a lot of worry about what will come next. Now what's interesting is when you look at the internal politics of this, after that summit took place, we seemed to get some commentary from Israeli officials seeming to almost dismiss the summit. The Minister of National Security Itamar Ben-Gvir saying what happens in Jordan will stay in Jordan. Bezalel Smotrich, another right-wing settler leader administering this government claiming there will not be any sort of settlement freezes. So it's not exactly clear what the Israelis necessarily agree to versus what the commentary we're hearing from Israeli government officials. But meanwhile, the Israeli military saying that they're sending extra battalions into the West Bank, to not only try to catch the attacker who shot and killed those two brothers but also to try to calm the situation and keep security for those Palestinians and Israelis -- Max.",
