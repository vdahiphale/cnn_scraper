The families of those killed on 9/11 are coming together to honor their loved ones and the nation is joining them remembering the sacrifices of that day. Let's not waste a moment here. Let's go live to CNN's Kate Bolduan. She is at the site of the World Trade Center Memorial. Kate, we are just seconds away from a moment of silence. What can you tell us?",

I would say, coming into this morning it was a thought in my mind, Jim, probably yours as well, is knowing if they came across each other, what that was going to look like in a place that politics should be nowhere near in a place that this is about the families and remembering today and seeing them take a moment to shake those shake hands.

      "sentences": "This morning, the campaigns are offering their takes on last night's debate. Vice President Kamala Harris calling the showdown a great day while also saying she's still the underdog in the race. Last night, she immediately called for a second round.The debate with Trump, for his part, the former president says he doesn't know if he wants to face Harris again. He's now arguing without evidence that the debate was rigged. Let's discuss with former senior adviser for President Biden's 2020 campaign, Alencia Johnson, and former deputy communications director for Trump's 2016 campaign, Bryan Lanza. So, Bryan, how did Trump do last night, in your view? BRYAN LANZA, FORMER DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN:  Well, first of all, thank you for having me, Jim. Listen, I think the debate achieved a couple of things for President Trump. I think if you look at the polling data, the country is moving in the direction of believing that Kamala Harris was an extreme liberal. I think the debate last night did nothing to move course from that. She's clearly moving in the direction of people believing she's an extreme liberal from San Francisco that's dangerous for America. So, I think from that standpoint, he did really, really well. He established that. I think from the standpoint of, you know, not insulting, I think everybody was anticipating, you know, he was going to be baited into insulting. We're sort of moving with the line of baited was and they said he's going to call her nasty things, that didn't happen as well. I think, you know, the debate was sort of short on policy. I would have liked to have more of Donald Trump executing the case or prosecuting the case against Kamala Harris being this co-pilot in this horrible economy, but we didn't get to that. And that's coming up short, but we'll continue to do that. But I think overall, if you're sort of looking at it from the Trump campaign, you know, you had the trend line showing that Kamala Harris was leaning in the extreme liberal direction. I think this debate pushed her over, specifically with her and this bizarre sort of San Francisco liberal position, where she wants to sex changes for illegal immigrants. That's not where the country is. Pennsylvania is not there, Michigan is not there, neither is Wisconsin. So, she helped paint herself as an extreme liberal even further.",

I mean, that was a priority of her when she was the District Attorney of San Francisco. She sent letters to the jails saying this needed to be done. And when she became attorney general of San California, where my home state, this became a signature issue of hers that she wanted to bring, you know, the transgender operations into our prisons and they need to be taxpayer funded.

What's going to matter is these two wars that are starting abroad. You know, Alencia talks about world leaders sort of holding Kamala Harris with respect. Well, let me tell you something. Benjamin Netanyahu doesn't hold him with respect, and so does President Zelenskyy.
