More than 100 million people are under heat advisories right now. We're watching all of this.Also happening now, the preps and the posturing. They're underway right now. A huge, huge debate coming up next week. Also tonight, we're watching very significant legal developments unfolding right now. The judge in the Trump classified documents case just wrapped up a hearing on whether a special counsel Jack Smith was legally appointed after pushing Trump's lawyer to defend an argument she called ominous. Plus, the United States Supreme Court upholds a federal gun law aimed at protecting victims of domestic violence. We're breaking all this down. It's a significant new ruling and how it tested the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the Situation Room. We begin with the pregame warm up before the high stakes presidential debate here on CNN just six days from now. President Joe Biden is getting deeply personal in rehearsal mode behind closed doors, while former President Donald Trump is publicly trying to raise expectations for his opponent. Our correspondents are here with more on both candidates and their strategies that are unfolding. First let's go to CNN's Kayla Tausche, she's covering the Biden camp pain for us. So how is Biden campaigning, right, preparing for his debate?",

Now, they're workshopping policy items, zingers, punches, counter punches, trying to refine exactly what his argument will be all with the goal of trying to highlight some of the wildest Trumpisms of recent years that they believe in the Biden campaigns theory of the case that voters have just been disengaged for.Now, they also believe that having the mics muted, is a productive way for President Biden to be able to make that case without being interrupted as he was in the first debate of the 2020 cycle. Now, there is expected to be a Trump standard when they evolve into the formal mock debate portion of the prep, which is going to be in a couple of days. And sources tell me that that's expected to be Bob Bauer, the personal attorney to the president, who also served in that role in 2020. And he has a book out where he describes some of that 2020 prep. And here's how he described the character study of sorts earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So we know over the past several months, Donald Trump as well as all of his senior advisors, have really been trying to paint Biden as this old and feeble man, someone who cannot stand up for the 90 minutes that is allotted in this debate, that he has trouble with his mental and physical activity. Now, they're trying to raise the bar.[17:05:03] They recognize that maybe that's setting the expectations too low for Joe Biden. Take a listen to what Trump said on the \"All-In\" podcast yesterday.

And really, I think for my conversations with Trump's campaign behind the scenes, they are trying to figure out OK, we recognize that Joe Biden is going into this intense prep, what can we do to sharpen our own rhetoric, our own messaging. Now we know that Donald Trump has met with a series of vice presidential contenders, senators, policy experts, people from his previous administration like Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Miller, Rick Grenell, to sharpen some of those attack lines. I'm also told that he's been really working to rein in some of his aggression and kind of what Kayla talked about with him talking over Joe Biden repeatedly in that 2020 debate, they don't want him to do this time.

But there is no doubt that this narrative of trying to paint Joe Biden as this feeble old man wandering in fields and all the like, would lower expectations that all Joe Biden would need to be able to do sort of complete a sentence and it's deemed a victory for him. And I think the Trump team and the former president himself are keenly aware of that after his more energetic State of the Union speech, and they're trying to avoid falling into that trap this time.",

So I think, removing that factor is important for viewers at home to just get a very clear one to one interaction with both of these candidates. And these candidates have to remember, they are speaking to viewers at home, not the room, but at home. And specifically in a state like Georgia, they are speaking to swing state voters.They both have their fans, their supporters who aren't going anywhere. What they need to do is grow their base. They need independents, undeclared, moderates, all in these swing states.

The question is what is he going to do with that because Biden has been on the air for months pressing that fundraising advantage with advertising dollars. And as Meghan was saying, the needle hasn't really moved here.This has been a stable race. I think watching how Joe -- Donald Trump now spends this money that he has, both of these candidates will be well funded in the fall, how Trump now spends this money now that he has raised it. And what he puts on the air since he has not been largely on the air nearly at all at the same levels of Biden will be a key thing to watch. And the other thing to remember here is what fueled all of that fundraising was his felony conviction.

So, I think if Judge Cannon rules against Jack Smith, he'll appeal and he will probably be able to get her reversed in that scenario.Now, if this somehow comes to pass, that it's upheld, the Jack Smith was improperly appointed, then I think the indictment gets dismissed because the argument that Donald Trump is making here is that Jack Smith has been given essentially the same powers as a U.S. attorney to indict and try federal cases. But U.S. attorneys have to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, neither of which applies to Jack Smith. That said, what prior courts have said is the power that Jack Smith is given is legally given to him through the attorney general. There's a lot of discretion there.

They're asking to change his release conditions. So, something even more than has happened in other cases. But that's the centerpiece of what the arguments will be on Monday afternoon.There's other arguments going to be -- that going to be happening on Tuesday where Trump's team continues to try and convince Cannon to dismiss this case. They haven't been successful with that yet. They're going to keep trying. But a theme of all of these today and then again next week is we're going to keep hearing Trump's team, Wolf, try to get more hearings. Can they convince Cannon to allow them to call witnesses like people from the Justice Department and perhaps gin up some sort of sideshow that may be very similar to what happened in the Georgia case where Fani Willis was put under oath and had to testify.

So, I would say, you know, in the normal case, you don't see this a lot at all, but we've seen them a lot with Donald Trump. A lot of it depends on what he says, what he continues to do as to whether there will be one here or not.You know, in Manhattan, we have Alvin Bragg coming out and saying these threats continue. You need to continue the gag order in place even when the (inaudible) is over. But this trial is a little bit different. Donald Trump doesn't dislike the judge here. He likes the judge.

And he put this in the opinion.He said, our tradition of firearm regulation allows the government to disarm individuals who present a credible threat to the physical safety of others. And that's exactly what this federal law did. But Wolf, I'll note, this decision doesn't exactly close the door on all future gun challenges. In fact, there are many gun challenges out there, including one that asks whether it's unconstitutional to forbid drug users from owning or possessing a gun. That's a case the Supreme Court could take up, it could directly factor into Hunter Biden's conviction. But of course, this isn't the last word from the Supreme Court. We're still expecting several more opinions obviously, in the next week. There are about 12 opinions remaining some, very key ones, including the big one concerning Donald Trump, whether former presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution. Then there's also the question of whether hundreds of January 6th rioters were properly charged under an obstruction law. There's the case out of Idaho, whether a near total abortion ban in Idaho is really preempted by federal law. And then there's the question of the power of federal agencies, this could really rock the way that federal agencies run if the Supreme Court finds a certain way. And then there's also questions about the rights of social media platforms to restrict content on their sites. So the Supreme Court has a lot of big cases still left to decide.

HANCOCKS (voice-over): Footage and satellite imagery of the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt shows the passenger terminal has been heavily burned and damaged. The Israeli military took control of the crossing early last month. Since then it has been closed to aid coming in and critical patients going out. The U.S. says it has started bringing humanitarian aid in through its floating pier again, although it has not yet been distributed. The pier was dismantled for the second time last week due to high seas and bad weather. The U.N. has given Israel security steps that must be met before it can resume distribution of the aid from the pier. Humanitarian groups point to increased lawlessness and desperation in Gaza making some distribution simply too dangerous. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
