In a way you could say like the calls coming from inside the building. I mean what are their concerns?",

      "sentences": "It absolutely is. The concerns range from things that are already happening. Things like AI being used to impersonate people in ways that could be misleading or potentially interfere with elections. You have nonconsensual deepfake pornography that's being created with AI, AI chatbots creating false information. And then you have these more speculative risks that people are nonetheless very concerned about inside of this industry. Things like artificial general intelligence that could one day become as smart as, if not smarter, than humans.And in particular, OpenAI has faced criticism for prioritizing speed and growth over safety concerns. Those are the concerns that led in part to the ouster of CEO Sam Altman last fall before he was quickly reinstated. But they've also been sort of bubbling up again in recent weeks with the departure of some high-level safety executives from OpenAI. So, it will be interesting to see whether this company agrees to some of the concerns and some of the demands in this letter.",

      "sentences": "The employees are essentially saying here that the major AI companies can't be trusted to voluntarily share information about risks. And they're saying that in the absence of regulation, because there still are very few guidelines for AI companies at this point, employees need to know that they can speak freely about the safety risks without fearing retaliation. So, they've asked the companies to make a series of commitments,things like agreeing not to enforce non-disparagement agreements. And I think - I want to read you just one portion of this letter that I think really gets at the heart of the concerns here that the employees say \"ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks were concerned about are not yet regulated.\" And I should say that OpenAI has, in some ways, sort of agreed that this safety debate is important. A spokesperson for the company told us yesterday, \"we are proud of our track record providing the most capable and safest AI systems and believe in our scientific approach to addressing risk. We agree that rigorous debate is crucial given the significance of this technology and we'll continue to engage with governments, civil society, and other communities around the world.\" But the bottom line here is, there's still no regulation for this technology. And employees need to be able to tell, not only the companies, but regulators and the public when there are risks and safety concerns.",

But by itself, it is not going to strengthen Biden.And what you have is a situation in which a majority of voters clearly disapprove of Biden's performance. A majority of voters are unfavorable to Trump. The voters who I think are the most likely to be moved away from Trump because of this verdict are also deeply negative about Biden's performance, question, whether he's too old for the job or upset about inflation. So, they are both operating against a very strong headwind that makes it, I think, very hard to move the race in any direction.",

I mean, you know, we - first of all, we've - I think we saw in 2022 a very clear phenomenon where voters, Biden and Democrats, our winning more support than is typical. Far more support than is typical among voters who disapprove of his performance, especially those who somewhat disapprove.And that is the answer to people who asked whether anything hurts Trump. The fact that Biden - that millions of people in polls are saying - and not only in polls, in practice in '22, that they will vote for Democrats anyway, even though they believe Biden is not doing a good job or they are unhappy about the economy. That is the measure of discontent with Trump. But what I really discovered to an extent that I had not understood previously, I think in this poll, is that the reverse is also true. There are a fair - you know, we think of Trump's vote as entirely this unconditional, walkover glass support for him. There are, in fact, a lot of ambivalent voters supporting Trump as well. There are people who are - who have an unfavorable view of Trump and are voting for him in part because they are so negative about Biden.

If this doesn't go well, I think you're going to see a lot of anxiety, you know, in Democratic circles because no matter how many doubts the Biden campaign can inflame about Trump, and they can - I mean there is a lot of resistance to Trump. As long as his own approval rating, the president's own approval rating, is down around 40 percent, he will be in a vulnerable position.
