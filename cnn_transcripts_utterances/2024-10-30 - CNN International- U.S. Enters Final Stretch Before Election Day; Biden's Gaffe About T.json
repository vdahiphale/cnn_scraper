This is \"CNN Newsroom.\" Just ahead, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump try to drive their messages home with less than a week to go before Election Day. Walking it back, the White House trying to clean up comments from President Biden about Donald Trump's supporters. And the U.S. is calling an Israeli strike that killed nearly 100 people in Gaza, horrifying. At the site where Donald Trump told the crowd to fight like hell on January 6th, right before the insurrection, Kamala Harris on Tuesday urged her supporters to look to the future. The Harris campaign says 75,000 people attended her speech Tuesday night on The Ellipse in Washington, which was billed as her closing argument. She told the crowd, Trump is unstable and obsessed with revenge. But she said it doesn't have to be this way and pledged to find common ground to bring more unity to America. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  America, for too long, we have been consumed with too much division, chaos and mutual distrust.

And she argued that she would spend her time in the White House not chasing vengeances and grievances, but by trying to bring down the cost of groceries, making housing more affordable, widening access to healthcare. I think in isolation, it was an effective argument if you consider who she was trying to talk to, that was wavering Republicans who don't like Trump, but are still on the fence about jumping to a Democrat, perhaps moderate voters who haven't decided yet whether they're going to vote and looked at what happened at the weekend and Trump's rage and anger, and think we can't go through all of that again.But in some ways, Harris, I think would've been a more -- perhaps is not the best messenger for that. she talked about herself being the herald of a new generation of leadership. The problem is for American- Americans, they see her as an incumbent. She's the vice president of an unpopular Democratic Administration. The White House over her shoulder was a reminder of that. And I'm not sure that for many Americans outside the East Coast and across the great heartland of the United States, that this speech was quite effective as perhaps the Harris campaign would've hoped.",

This is one example of that. It's a bill that prevents countries from opening consulates in Jerusalem. They want countries to open embassies in Jerusalem, to reiterate this idea and to underline the idea that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Many countries, of course have embassies in Tel Aviv and only consulates in Jerusalem. But it's part of a whole spate of legislation as well.I mean, a couple of days ago, UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine refugees was banned in a bill, went through the Knesset. There have been other examples as well of legislation being discussed, which would lead to the deportation, for example, of families of known terrorists inside Israel. They would be deported to Gaza or to elsewhere for a particular length of time. And so, look, in this new Knesset political season, the Israeli authorities, the Israeli government, which is a very hard-line, right-wing coalition, supported by very hard-line coalition partners is doing what it can to push through some very tough legislation politically while it can, while it has the majority in this country, Amara.",

Thank you very much.U.S. and South Korean security officials will meet at the Pentagon today to discuss North Korea's deployment of troops to Russia and Ukraine. Now, according to Western intelligence sources, a small number of North Korean soldiers are now deployed inside Ukraine, and that number is expected to rise. The U.S. estimates roughly 10,000 troops sent by Pyongyang are training in Eastern Russia and could soon be sent to combat zones inside Ukraine. CNN's U.S. National Security Correspondent, Natasha Bertrand joining us now from the Pentagon. Natasha, this meeting of U.S. and South Korean security officials, what are they discussing? What might come from that? NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Amara, the South Koreans have been raising the alarm about this deployment of North Korean troops to Russia for quite some time now. And it took the U.S. a little bit of time to catch up with the exact number that the South Koreans were saying were actually deployed to Russia for participation in the war in Ukraine alongside Russian forces. The U.S. was not confirming for several weeks that these North Koreans were there and that frustrated the South Koreans. And so what you're seeing today and through this week is the South Koreans coming to the Pentagon, coming to Washington, to try to convey the urgency of the situation to the Americans, to brief them on the intelligence that they have collected about what kind of North Korean forces are being deployed, which we are told they are actually special operations troops that are being deployed to Russia and to Ukraine. And also, how many -- the South Koreans still say that there are much more troops in Russia right now than the U.S. has estimated. South Korea puts it at around 13,000 North Koreans that are currently in Russia, whereas the U.S. and the U.K. put that number a little lower at around 10,000. And so, this is really an all hands on deck moment for the South Koreans who were actually also just at NATO headquarters in Brussels, briefing them on the same thing because the South Koreans say that this is an urgent threat, not only to their own national security, but for the security of the entire international community. Here's what the South Korean president has said about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOON SUK YEOL, SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  This illegal military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a significant security threat to the international community and could pose a serious risk to our national security.
