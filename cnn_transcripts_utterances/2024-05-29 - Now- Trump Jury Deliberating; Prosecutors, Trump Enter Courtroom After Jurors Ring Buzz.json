And typically when that buzzer sounds, it means that the jury has a question. But at this point, it's unclear exactly what is going on. Most of the reporters have filed back into the courtroom. But our colleagues say they're still waiting for the parties, for the prosecutors, the defense attorneys, the defendant and the judge.Now, as we reported, the defendant, he has to remain inside the courthouse during these deliberations. So he is close by and we'll be watching and waiting to see what exactly the jury has to say. This would be pretty quick to come back with a verdict. But at this point, it is unclear why that buzzer sounded. It has been widely expected, though, that this jury would likely have some questions about this case. Not only do they have this historic deliberation that they have undertaken, they also don't have access to all the evidence that they've heard over the past several weeks. They have a laptop with some of the evidence. But, for example, they don't have access to transcripts from a testimony by key witnesses like Stormy Daniels or Hope Hicks or Michael Cohen. So it's widely expected that after they were in there for a couple hours, got a sense of where all the jurors were at in terms of this case, that they would likely have questions either about the evidence or about the law. But at this point, again, our colleagues are inside. They said they've heard the buzzer. It's not clear if this is a question, but that is what they expect. This is likely a question from the jury, but they're still waiting for everyone to come back in the courthouse. Now, if this is a question, the way this would work is the question would be read. And then, of course, both sides suddenly enter into this game of trying to figure out what exactly it means. They try to read the tea leaves. You see this in almost every trial. But, of course, here, this historic trial, the first criminal prosecution of a former president of the United States. And this jury has been deliberating for a little over three and a half hours.

Let's start at the beginning and kind of work our way chronologically through the events of the case and see what questions we have to see whether it meets these parts of the evidentiary issues that we need to decide.

They set up this meeting and they asked David Pecker how he could help their campaign, which obviously we saw the ways they did so, not in - just with Karen McDougal, but also with Ted Cruz and Ben Carson and Marco Rubio and planting these negative, false, vicious stories about Trump's challengers.",

And again, the reason that the documents that were allegedly falsified have been charged as felony is because they argue that all of this was done to help Trump win in 2016. And David Pecker's testimony sets that up. So the fact that they're asking about this, it is significant. It's a core part of the case. And it really, in many ways, makes sense. Of course, they're going to want to hear this again. This is one of the first witnesses that they heard from. They don't have a transcript. And it's not surprising at all that they're going to want to refresh their recollection and just refresh themselves on exactly what it is that he testified to.",

One of the things I remember being so notable about David Pecker's testimony was about the election and was about Trump's feelings towards the election. He testified in those early days that when he had been helping Donald Trump with these stories in the National Enquirer, placing them or warning people near him about them, that it used to be about not wanting to upset Ivanka or Melania or upset his family, but at some point it turned to being about the election and his campaign. That was his early on testimony.So that itself kind of shows you the evolution of David Pecker's relationship. And I will note, you know, as you said, there is no ill will between the two of them. In fact, Pecker seemed to be kind of smiling at the defense table at times, kind of waving at one of the lawyers at one of the points, looking as though he was engaging with them. And Donald Trump himself had positive things to say about David Pecker to the point where it actually got brought up in a gag order hearing later because he talked about the witness, but ...

They go, let's start with witness one. What did he say? What did witness two say? Here the note asks for testimony from the very first witness, David Pecker, and the very last witness, Michael Cohen. So it's quite clear to me they're not proceeding witness by witness. What it seems they're doing is proceeding chronologically along the timeline of the story, which, because, again, the August 2015 meeting is chapter one. It's where this whole plot gets hatched according to the DA. So, again, with all the caveats attached, if I'm the prosecutor, I like that. I want them to look at this case chronologically. The way the DA laid out his closing yesterday was I'm going to tell you a story. It begins in August 2015. So it seems like they're following that sort of linear timeline, which is a natural way that people consume stories. So I think it's safe to glean that from this note.",
