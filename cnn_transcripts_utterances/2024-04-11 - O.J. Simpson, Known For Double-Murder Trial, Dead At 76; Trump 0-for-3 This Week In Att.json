Then, as the thing began to play out, you heard he was a suspect. And then by Friday of that week, they were asking for his arrest and he was fleeing, and he had been termed a fugitive from justice at that point. So at that point, you begin to think there's good reason to believe that he was somehow involved.Now, let me say this just as background, O.J. Simpson wasn't just a famous football player. In all of my dealings with him, he was an extremely nice and likable guy, the kind of guy who would remember the name of the intern who brought you coffee when you got to the set on a Sunday morning to cover football, which we did together for four or five years on NBC. I had dinner with him many times. He came to charity events at my request. We played golf. He was a hale fellow, well met. That, contradictory as it may seem, doesn't point toward his innocence when all of the factors and all of the evidence are taken into account. As you've laid out in the last hour, very capably, there was an intersection here of all kinds of dynamics. The history of racial injustice involving African-Americans in this country, the specific issue of the past behavior of the LAPD and the feelings that African-American citizens might have about that. All those things can be true, and they were true, and to some extent, remain true and O.J. Simpson can still be guilty. You know, the DNA evidence which Barry Scheck and the Innocence Project have used to free hundreds of wrongly accused Americans, most of them African Americans, to exonerate them, which is noble work. The truth is that DNA evidence pointed toward O.J. Simpson's guilt, not innocence. But all the overlapping factors and the excellent work done by his dream team of attorneys was able to obscure that essential fact. Were all the social issues that helped to exonerate O.J. true? Yes. But is the evidence in the case itself something that exonerates him? No.",

No last minute adjournment requests, no emergencies, no appeals, no motions for reconsideration. Maybe they've seen the writing on the wall that this thing is going on Monday. Now, the only things they can theoretically do is, first of all, try to ask New York's highest court, the court of appeals, to take a look at some of these appeals which were already rejected, and maybe in the farthest off scenario, to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to get involved.

If you lose, you're just back to where you were before, nothing lost. But I don't take that view. I take the real life view, having been in courtrooms, that when you're a lawyer and you go in front of a judge, your credibility is precious.And if you are bringing motions that you've already lost on that have next to no basis, next to no merit, you will lose your credibility. And believe me, that will come back to haunt you. There will be times throughout this trial when you're going to need the judge to trust you.

You can look at this as an eight year old paperwork offense on a case that the famously aggressive feds across the street turned down, where we're looking at either a misdemeanor or a low felony where the star witness is a convicted perjurer. Or you can look at this as an attempt to interfere with the 2016 election, to hide information from the American voters. And I think the facts here are largely not going to be in dispute, how are the payments made, who did what, who had -- what conversations with who? I think the central struggle that we're about to see between the lawyers is convincing the juror of which categorization is more accurate and more fair.And I think they're going to be aiming for the jurors brains, of course.

They're defendants or convicted criminals, convicted of crimes carried out during the January 6th attack, often violent crimes, often violent crimes committed against law enforcement.Today's convicted rioter, David Joseph Gietzen of North Carolina. Gietzen, was convicted last summer of several charges, including assaulting police officers. The FBI says that's him decked out in that green jacket, white helmet, goggles, knee pads. According to court documents, Gietzen was at the Capitol's West Plaza area. They say images show him in a number of physical confrontations with police. He grabbed the shield of a Capitol police officer, pushed others. In another clip, Gietzen appears to grab the throat or mask of a police officer. At some point, the cameras lose Gietzen. He reappears with a long pole. Prosecutors say Gietzen used that pole to jab at police, striking one police officer in the shoulder between his protective gear. Gietzen was number 217 on the FBI's initial wanted list in the days after the January 6th riot. He was arrested in May 2022, more than a year after the Capitol riot, he went to trial last August. A jury found him guilty of five felony charges, including two counts of assaulting officers. He's scheduled to be sentenced later this month. Once again, one of Donald Trump's January 6th hostages, they're not hostages. They're criminals and criminal defendants. That brings us to our Politics Lead and more fallout from Republicans fear of Donald Trump and what Trump might do in a second term. My next guest normally lets his photographs speak for himself. He was appointed President Gerald R. Ford's chief White House photographer and has photographed every U.S. president from Lyndon Johnson to Joe Biden. This week, he put down his camera and wrote a scathing letter residing from the board of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation after the group denied Liz Cheney its top yearly award. Over, he says, fears that Donald Trump would retaliate against the organization if Donald Trump is reelected. In the letter, he writes, quote, the historical irony was completely lost on you. Gerald Ford became president in part because Richard Nixon had ordered the development of an enemies list and demanded his underlings use the IRS against those listed. That's exactly what the executive committee fears will happen if there's a second coming of Donald Trump, unquote. The author of the resignation letter, Pulitzer Prize winning political photographer David Hume Kennerly, is here. The Pulitzer Prize you won for your amazing photography during the Vietnam War though I believe. You closed your letter, David, by writing this about the Ford Presidential Foundation, quote, it's now a place whose leadership is cowed by a demagogue creating and promulgating the greatest crisis our country has faced since the civil war, unquote.
