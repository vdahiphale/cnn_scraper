We'll bring you the latest from his crucial testimony which could deliver a final blow to the GOP fizzling impeachment investigation.Plus, Republicans are rushing to publicly say they support IVF. So why are they planning to block a Senate bill today that would protect the procedure so many need to start a family to the campaign ads. And it's a must win state for November, but Michigan's primaries exposing warning signs for both Joe Biden and Donald Trump. This hour I'll talk to a top Biden campaign official about their plans to address the president's problems in this pivotal swing state. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start today on Capitol Hill where this moment Hunter Biden is behind closed doors testifying in front of the House oversight and judiciary committees. The president son says his deposition today should put an end to the GOP impeachment inquiry. In his opening statement, he had this message to Republicans. He said quote, for more than a year, your committees have hunted me in your partisan political pursuit of my dad. You have trafficked in innuendo, distortion and sensationalism, all while ignoring the clear and convincing evidence staring you in the face. CNN's Melanie Zanona is live on Capitol Hill. Melanie, how's it going behind closed doors?",

He is sitting there, answering questions as he is in the hot seat. But Democrats emerge from the room moments ago on a break.And they said that Republicans are clearly on a baseless fishing expedition. They've not uncovered any evidence of high crimes or misdemeanors. And they said this is all a waste of time, especially with a looming government funding deadline on Friday. Just take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): What we saw, I think was a rather embarrassing spectacle where the Republicans continued to belabor completely trivial points. They seem to be obsessively focused on speaker phones and use of speakerphone. I did not know that that was the devil's technology, but apparently it is. That first hour of this much anticipated testimony was the nail in the coffin to what is a complete bogus and sham impeachment inquiry. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They did ultimately agree on some terms that include agreeing to release the transcript within potentially the next 24 hours, so that -- so as not to have any selective weeks. And they also are not videotaping this as they have with other witnesses.And Republicans really want to grill Hunter Biden about his overseas business deals, his role on a Ukrainian energy company, and whether his father -- other personally benefited financially from those overseas deals. But in his opening statement, Dana, as you're read, he made crystal clear that his father has not profited off of his son's foreign business deals. And he really is just the latest in a parade of witnesses who have testified to just ask. In fact, an FBI agent was recently charged by the FBI for lying about a foreign bribery allegation. So, this is really a make-or-break moment for Republicans potentially could go late into the night here though, Dana.",

They said that they were going to show evidence that Joe Biden directly benefited from his son's business activities in, you know, other countries. And they have not been able to do that. None of the witnesses have been able to substantiate that. And so that's part of the problem is that, you know, now you have the one last part of this, which was this guy that was making this very big claim of bribes -- $10 million in bribes, and now he's been charged by the FBI, and he's going to go to trial in April.",

And all of this time and effort spent by these Republicans on what looks like, A, the wildest of goose chases.LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Republicans getting out in front of their skis might be the understatement of the year. This is something that once they gained the majority, they said that they were going to impeach Joe Biden and any way that they were able to do it and they had been trying to get there. Now remember, they took a vote to proceed with this impeachment inquiry, which was also controversial within the House Republicans are some more centrist Republicans who didn't think it took a lot of persuading to get them here.

And it's hard to imagine, unfortunately, that the tone and tenor is going to change much, even though the facts aren't on their side. And this is something, you know, Hunter Biden gave this opening statement that we read part of behind closed doors today. But he actually in a rare interview with Axios on Monday said the following, which really struck us. He said, I've always been in awe of people who have stayed clean and sober through tragedies and obstacles, few people ever face. I have something much bigger than even myself at stake. We are in the middle of a fight for the future of democracy. This is kind of more of the human element of what we're talking about here. It's very personal. He is very open about the fact that he is an addict. He was very much off the wagon when a lot of this happened. And part of what he is trying to do. He's saying here is stay clean.

Donald Trump has asked a New York appeals court to delay the requirement that he quickly cough up $454 million in his civil fraud case. It's the latest step the former president has taken to avoid paying that massive penalty.CNNs Kara Scannell joins me now. Kara, what's Trump's goal and asking for this delay? Does he think that it's possible he can get away with not paying it, and is it? KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Dana, he's trying to buy time here because the clock is ticking on when he has to put up money or, you know, either cash or in the form of a bond in order to prevent the New York Attorney General's office been trying to move forward to enforce the judgment. And one way they could do that is to try to see some of the properties that he could stop that if he posts the bond right now. But he's asking the judges for more time to come up with the money. And that's really what this -- what is that issue here. The New York Attorney General's office is opposing it. They just filed a letter in this case. I'm asking appeals court to deny it, but there was likely to be some briefing on this matter over the next couple of weeks. You know, this is all happening though, is Trump is facing more than half a billion dollars that he has to put up between the New York Attorney General's case and the defamation case involving E. Jean Carroll. In that case, a jury awarded Carroll, $83.3 million. Trump's clock is ticking on that. He asked the judge overseeing that case on Friday to delay enforcement of that bond as well. So, he's having to come up with a lot of money. Now he's asking different courts to give him more time to do so we'll wait to see what these judges say. Dana?",

Once said, the anger will not be resolved with meetings, it will take bold action. They're really calling on President Biden to do something bold to keep distancing himself from Prime Minister Netanyahu, which he's done.I mean, if you track the timeline of President Biden's own response to this since October 7, he's already heard this message. This did not come as a surprise then. The number didn't. 101,000 people -- I talked to one Michigan Democrat who supports Joe Biden yesterday, and he said anything over 50,000 that could be an issue. It was twice that 100,000. But in addition to that, this could be a floor another warning sign I heard from a Michigan Democrat who again wants President Biden to be reelected. So, it took an act to go out and vote uncommitted. What about the people who didn't vote? Young people in Ann Arbor, in Lansing across the state. The apathy and they're just a disinterest in this campaign that is -- in the words of this Democrat, a much more worrisome sign. So, look, the warning signs are there.
