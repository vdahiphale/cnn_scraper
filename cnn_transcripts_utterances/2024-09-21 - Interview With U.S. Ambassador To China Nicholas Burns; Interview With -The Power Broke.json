I'm Christiane Amanpour in London.On this day in 1949, Chinese communist leaders proclaimed the People's Republic of China. 75 years ago, it was one of the world's poorest countries. Today, it's the world's second largest economy, second only to its great competitor, the United States of America which it also rivals militarily. China now challenges America's role as the world's only superpower. It is also, of course, the battle of ideas, democracy versus authoritarianism of the Chinese leader Xi Jing Ping. While America's strength lies with global alliances, China has a lock on the continent of Africa, while also courting pariahs like North Korea, Russia, Iran. Tensions over Taiwan and trade keep ratcheting upwards. And yet the issue of China has had little play in the election campaigns of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. Nicholas Burns knows a thing or two about tricky diplomacy, with a lengthy career as an American diplomat serving six presidents, nine secretaries of state. He was U.S. ambassador to NATO on 9/11. And now he's ambassador to Beijing, a role that he's compared to being envoy to Moscow at the height of the Cold War. He joined me from Washington. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

We think that China should commit itself to a peaceful resolution of that dispute. And frankly -- and thankfully, we're not alone in this. You've seen a very assertive position of the government of Japan, the government of the Philippines, the government of the Republic of China -- of Korea -- excuse me, and also the European leadership and members of the European parliaments and national parliaments traveling to this part of the world to make that point. China asserts the right to use force. We don't think that's just and we don't think that's smart. And so, what we're trying to do is two things: convince China to resolve the cross-strait differences peacefully, and that's been the American position, Christiane, going back to Richard Nixon's trip here in 1972. And obviously, provide for a stronger deterrent in Taiwan. That's our legal obligation under the Taiwan Relations Act. And we're doing both things at once.

I think they know that there's -- there is a bipartisan consensus. There is large-scale Democrat and Republican agreement on the need for us to have a very tough-minded, competitive policy with China, but also, on the engagement side, to make sure that we're talking to the Chinese about climate change. John Podesta was just over in Beijing with me two weeks ago, our climate negotiator. We're trying to work on the fentanyl crisis here in the United States and getting some help from the Chinese government in doing that. We obviously want to work on global health issues together. So, this is a relationship that's incredibly complicated. On the one hand, we have high competition between the two governments. On the other hand, we're the two largest economies in the world. We have to work together on issues like climate. And I think that's part and parcel of what we're doing with. We -- the Chinese are intensely interested in what happens in America on November 5th.

So why so much attention and celebration for the book now? Well, it's just turned 50, it sells tons every year, and it's a pop culture phenomenon -- podcasts, viral TikTok videos. The book examines power, its use and abuse, race and inequality, Shakespearian hubris -- it is all there. And the author Robert Caro, has won a Pulitzer Prize for it, that was in 1975.

But the data only tells part of the story. We meet Blanca Flores and Victor Bolanos. They fled El Salvador in 2003, leaving their three college-age sons behind. From all the people you worked with. Planning to eventually bring them to Colorado. At least that was the plan. They were able to get their kids through schooling and everything through their work in the U.S. But after 15 years, the couple lost their asylum claim and was forced to accept a so-called voluntary departure back to El Salvador. It's a lot of work.",

He's consolidated power, tightened his grip of control and essentially eliminated any political opposition. And yet Blanca sees Bukele more like a concerned father. Two years ago, the Bukele administration introduced financial incentives for citizens looking to return to El Salvador.

She knew the horror and terror of war in a way that these guys that she was working with didn't. They were too young to remember or they'd been born after the war.
