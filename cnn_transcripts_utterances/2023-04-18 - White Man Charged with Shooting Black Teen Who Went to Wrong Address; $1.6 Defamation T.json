That's when Ralph Yarl made a mistake. He thought he was picking up his younger brothers on 115th Terrace. That's one block away. Instead he rang that doorbell in 115th Street. That mistake nearly costing him his life. The mayor of Kansas City on our air earlier talking about the amount of time that it took to bring these charges forward. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR QUINTON LUCAS (D-KANSAS CITY, MO):  I think we do need to look at the fact, though, not just this case, but many others, where we have these incidents involved with black teens in too many situations. It seems like we need a public groundswell to get full attention. I will admit, and I'll look to my own office and our own review, I didn't know about the details of this case until several days later. That is problematic.

Fox News has denied wrongdoing. There's a long road to getting here. Joining me now is CNN Anchor and former Federal Prosecutor Laura Coates. So, as we're waiting to hear more, jury selection wrapping up, opening statements to be to becoming, there's been some interesting moves in terms of legal strategy as we're heading into trial. First, in terms of Dominion, I wanted to get your take, this number of $1.6 billion that they're asking in damages, they've now made a shift now arguing that this all has to do with damage to the company's reputation, whereas before, it was kind of divided into damages, reputational damage and also a loss in contracts. What do you make of this kind of last-minute shift in terms of that strategy?",

Plus, you know, the Supreme Court has said that 11Okay. So, what could the Supreme Court do here? They have a few options. First of all, they could extend that pause on any changes or any additional restrictions to the abortion pill. They could extend that as the appeals process moves forward. Because, remember, the challenges to the underlying case are moving forward in the Fifth Circuit, the Fifth Circuit already set arguments for May 17th, or the Supreme Court could decide not to act at all. And then what would happen then? Well, all of the restrictions that the Fifth Circuit have said that they would put in place, those would go into effect. That would include women past seven weeks of pregnancy would not be able to take the pill. Currently, they can take it up to ten weeks. And they also wouldn't be able to get the pill via mail or via telehealth. They'd have to do everything in person. Now, the FDA has already talked about the fact that these are huge burdens that would be put on the FDA if these changes did go into effect. And also, you know, Senator Dick Durbin was on the floor of the Senate yesterday talking about the chaos that this has really resulted in for women and doctors, just a lot of confusion. So, it looks like the Supreme Court will be getting those briefs from the anti-abortion doctors by noon today, and then the clock is ticking to 11:59 P.M. tomorrow night when it's before then the Supreme Court is expected to rule.
