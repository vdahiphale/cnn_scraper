Plus, a suspect in the Lockerbie bombing now in custody almost 34 years after the attack that killed 270 people. And a Russian spy being held right now in Germany, could he be the key to getting imprisoned American Paul Whelan back home?Hello, and welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Kristin Fisher. This morning, snow walloping the U.S. from coast-to-coast as a powerful Winter storm moves across the country. More than 15 million Americans in 14 states under some sort of Winter weather alert right now. The storm has shattered major highways in parts of the west, even bringing avalanche warnings. Snow has blanketed mountain areas of drought-patched, California with thick snow. This is Soda Springs which saw 60 inches in just 48 hours. Britley Ritz is in the CNN Weather Center. Wow, how much more can we expect as this storm makes its way eastward?",

And it's just going to be a continuing thing over the next 24 hours for the Sierras, and then it pushes into the Rockies. And well, you know what? We've already started picking up snow in the Rockies. It travels all the way up into the northern plains.So 60 inches in Soda Springs, forecast snowfall totals expected for the central Rockies in marble and uptick forecast total, this is over the next three days by the way, just over a foot, nearly 13 inches. Many of us, you heard Kristin say 15-plus million are under some sort of Winter weather alert. We now have Winter storm warnings going into the northern plains where we once had Winter storm watches. Blizzard warnings extended now into parts of Colorado where we have 35-plus-mile per hour winds for over three-hour period of time, knocking down visibility to a quarter of a mile or less. And I told you there's still snow falling through parts of the Sierra mountain range, and that pushes on to parts of the four corners into the central Rockies as of this morning. And we'll continue over the next 24 hours. This area of low pressure eventually takes it track farther east, and on the back end of that low, now we're dealing with a threat for ice across the northern plains and upper Midwest. Now, Kristin, a quarter of an inch of ice to a half an inch of ice doesn't seem like much, but it's enough to cause widespread power outages and then wind up with tree limbs down and treacherous travel conditions.",

So let's get more on this and just who this spy is from CNN's Fred Pleitgen live in Berlin. So, Fred, who exactly are we talking about here? And how would this even work? I mean, we're essentially talking about a three-country prisoner swap.   FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENTwould be talking about that, and that's certainly something that makes it very complicated. The person that we're talking about is called Vadim Krasikov, he's known as the \"tear garden killer\" here in Germany. And he murdered someone execution style right here in central Berlin in 2019. The person that was murdered was actually a Georgian who fought against the Russians in the Chechnya war. So certainly someone that the Russians wanted out of the way. There was a big trial here in Germany, and the court then found out and ruled that this murder was actually orchestrated by Russian Intelligence Services. The Germans obviously were very angry about this, they've expelled two Russian diplomats, and since then, Vadim Krasikov has been serving a life sentence here in this country. Now, we've known since about August that the Russians wanted Krasikov back, and they were sort of coming to the U.S. and demanding Krasikov's release if Paul Whelan and Brittney Griner were to be released. That all that was being debated. We also know that the U.S. actually did make an inquiry to the German government about all this, it was a low-level inquiry, it was never discussed at the top levels here of German politics, and certainly, it was never viewed as a serious offer. So far, what we've been hearing from the Germans over, I'd say the past half year or so is that they say that Krasikov is a non-starter for him to be released from German prison because he is such a high-profile prisoner and certainly someone who obviously the Germans wants to remain in custody. So it would definitely be very difficult to make something like that happen. Nevertheless, of course, we do know Germany and the U.S., big allies, so unclear how that is going to go in the future, definitely so far though, the Germans are saying is a non-starter for them.",

Now, this latest meeting between this senior U.S. delegation and their counterparts in China is to set the stage for an upcoming visit by the U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken due to visit China in early 2023.

According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quote, \"the two sides agreed that the meeting was candid and constructive and agreed to stay in communication\", unquote.
