This is from a twister that moved through Dawson Springs, Kentucky, late last night.And why this is so concerning is because this area was ravaged by an EF-4 tornado back in December of 2021. So to have another twister which is clearly very dangerous on the ground within this area is -- is concerning. And there's been reports of tree damage, lots of power outages. You can see people just trying to clean up the initial mess that was left in the wake of these storms that moved through. Now that same storm system advances to the East Coast: Atlanta, all the way to New York and our nation's capital, that I-95 corridor. Hundreds, thousands of people, if not millions of people, under the threat. And we have a severe weather threat for the day tomorrow, too. So just recycling this severe weather threat over the next few days. Here's a look at the power outages. We have the greatest number of customers out across Kentucky. And you saw the storms and the tornado that move through there yesterday. There it is. The line of storms now approaching portions of central Alabama into Northern Georgia. We have tornado watches and severe thunderstorm watches, including the greater Birmingham area. Wouldn't be surprised if Atlanta is included within some sort of watch within the next coming minutes. A few severe thunderstorm warnings as we speak, but the storm system really has our greatest risk of tornadoes across the mid-Atlantic. And that includes our nation's capital. I mean, Jessica, we have had over 1,000 reports of severe weather since Friday as the system finally exits off the East Coast. And then we recycle that severe weather threat into Texas for the day tomorrow. So can't stop, won't stop. It is so busy.",

It's one of his shortest campaign speeches to date.It is highly unusual for a presumptive Republican nominee to attend the Libertarian convention. And it highlights the Trump campaign's growing concern over third-party candidates. Joining us now, Republican strategist Rina Shah; Lance Trover, former spokesperson for Doug Burgum's 2024 presidential campaign; and former special assistant to President Biden, Meghan Hays. Good morning, everybody. Here we all are on a nice Memorial Day. Lance, let's just start first with you. Rina and I were talking last hour about seeing the former president at that Libertarian convention. Why do you think he was there? And what does it say to you that he was there? LANCE TROVER, FORMER SPOKESMAN, DOUG BURGUM'S 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: I think this is part of a broader strategy they have going in reaching out to non-traditional Republican groups. And I would say to Democrats and anybody who questions that, underestimate Donald Trump at your own peril when it comes to reaching out to these groups. We've seen that he is polling really well with Latinos, African Americans across the country. And despite the raucous atmosphere, I would say that, you know, he made some pretty big commitments to this group of people out there today. This commutation of Ross Ulbricht, which is a big deal to them. That's going to filter down through the atmosphere. It is a little unconventional, but again, I've not seen a Republican candidate like Donald Trump in many years doing this kind of outreach to non-traditional Republican groups.",

It was, to me, the type of thing that was more revealing of who RFK Jr. actually is.And he is somebody that took a real issue, again, with those COVID-era policies. And it was probably the most salient point he's made in a while on the campaign trail. Because that is something that a lot of people have -- tend to forget overall, is the poor handling of the Trump administration, how they handled that pandemic. I always say Trump lied; people died. And we -- if we forget that, then we forget the greatest mistake he's made in his presidency and why he doesn't deserve to re-enter the White House. His administration knew of so many things coming down the pike. Yet, they failed to act. And then they wanted to take advantage of, basically, the environment and say, We did Operation Warp Speed. Hey, that was the bare minimum. So again, I think, if we focus on COVID, people realize that Trump did things that don't jive with Libertarians. And I think that will also trickle down and make its way to Libertarians. But the question remains: where do they go? I think a lot of Libertarians stay home. And look, it's not unusual for them to interface with conservatives. I've attended places like Freedom Fest for summers many years, where I've seen conservatives and Libertarians co-exist well. But this, again, was a poor move on Trump's part. I think trying to court their vote, it fell flat.",

I disagree a little bit with you guys on why he was there. I think he doesn't have money, and he can't afford to do these big rallies. He is showing up where cameras are.

You know, young families like mine with really tiny children, we have a lot of big, unexpected costs coming down the pike, always. But it feels magnified when you don't hear a candidate that wants your vote says, I'll make your life better. But how exactly? What -- what are you going to do with wars? What are you going to do on the economy? What are you going to do to strengthen the American family? We don't hear the Republican Party put out really clear issues anymore, like those pet issues I heard Doug Burgum talk about. He really piqued my interest when he was on the debate stage, because when candidates talk in specifics, people listen. And Trump doesn't do it, ever. He's always speaking in platitudes. And I think that's my great frustration, is that what are you fighting for? You're out here just fighting, and you're angry, but you're not fighting for my family when you don't talk about my needs. And that is going to be the challenge in the debates. When Biden says to him, I did this, that or the other, whether its junk fees or what have you, at least he's got some concrete things.
