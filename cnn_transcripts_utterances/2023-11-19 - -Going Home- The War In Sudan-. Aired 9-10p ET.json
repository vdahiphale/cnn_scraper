      "sentences": "Welcome to THE WHOLE STORY. I'm Anderson Cooper.While war has raged in Ukraine for more than a year and conflict has once again broken out in the Middle East, there is another often overlooked battle happening right now in Sudan. In April, a paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, began fighting the Sudanese army for control of the country. Now, so far, thousands of people have been killed, and more than 5 million have been displaced, according to the U.N. That means, on average, roughly, 30,000 people are fleeing their homes every day. Among those lucky enough to make it out have been the family of CNN's chief international investigative correspondent Nima Elbagir. She's not been back to her home country in more than a year after RSF-linked authorities issued a sealed indictment against her because of her reporting on them. So what is motivating the RSF? And how are they able to sustain such a large and drawn-out conflict? Very few Western news organizations have been allowed into Sudan since the war began, but Nima and her team made it back inside. And over the next hour, she takes us on a deeply personal journey, as she sees for herself what this power struggle has done to her country. Some of what you're about to see in this hour may be disturbing.",

You just really get hit by the desolation, the devastation. But this war, this pain, it's personal. I've been covering Sudan for over 20 years, first as a young reporter at the very start of my career, then as an experienced journalist, witnessing a popular revolution overthrow the country's longstanding dictator, seeing people I love taste democracy only to watch as military leaders wrenched back control and mourning their loss alongside them. Now, some of those very same military leaders are fighting each other for the ultimate prize -- to rule Sudan alone, unchallenged. Sudan is where I was born, but it's also where my family were forced to leave only a few weeks ago. Most are trying to flee, but we need to get in. We need to see for ourselves what's been happening. You can't just fly to the capital anymore. We need to be creative. The fighting is focused on two areas, the capital Khartoum, and the west of the country in El Geneina, Darfur. The only way in for us is to travel to south Sudan, starting in the small village of Renk, which has been hosting refugees. From here, we need to cross the border and try to get to Khartoum, but again, nothing is straightforward. Much of the capital is occupied by the paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, better known as the RSF. They don't want me or any Western journalists to document their atrocities. So we'll have to take an 800-mile journey northeast to Port Sudan, where we've been promised a flight to the capital. But Khartoum tells us only part of the story, of the tragedy unfolding in Sudan. Troubling stories from El Geneina, in Sudan's western Darfur region are trickling out.

Desperate, tired, and hungry, many end up here, a holding camp run by aid agencies near Sudan's border with South Sudan. There are around 15,000 people in the camp on any given day, and no one here knows how long they'll have to stay. Aid agencies say they're trying to help, but there's not enough food, not enough clean water, and not enough medicine. What you see behind me here is one of only two meal distributions a day. This is the first time anybody in this camp has gotten to eat this morning, and it's already around 11:00. It's chaotic. It's painful to watch because the reality is that most of those people back there are not going to get to eat. They're going to cue with their empty bowls and plates, and they may not be able to take anything back to their families. Every single day, a child dies here in this camp.

He was later found executed and his body mutilated. The weeks that followed saw killing sprees by the RSF and their Arab allied militia that many believe amount to one of the worst massacres seen in this region's genocide scarred history. Survivor after survivor told CNN how the RSF spoke of wiping out the African descended Masalit, who, unlike Hemedti's tribe, claim no Arab heritage. It's this land in Darfur that the RSF are currently occupying, which the Masalit claim as their ancestral land, part of a fertile land mass that the commander of the RSF Hemedti has been strategically looking to secure for the last 20 years, changing the demographics from African to Arab. The purpose, creating through alliances and Arab fortress extending through the African Sahel Region for not only his tribe, but for all the nomadic Arab tribes, whose tribal land extends across borders. What does that future territory look like? Those who escaped into Chad tell us it requires the annihilation of the Masalit, with a domino effect for other African tribes native to this land, those young enough to survive enslaved. Mahadi (ph) who's only 16, gives us a glimpse into what's happening in West Darfur. He was kidnapped by the RSF with his brother and forced to work at a farm. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (translated): We were 8 people. We were all tied up. They would come and say, I want the strong boys. Someone came over and started to feel my arms. I was tied up and blindfolded.",

But the Emiratis say that their operations are humanitarian in nature and that their field hospitals, seen here in this video, is helping the local population and refugees -- even though the vast majority of refugees are hundreds of miles away in the south, where we found no direct Emirati presence.The Emiratis are a key us ally and integral to the ongoing peace negotiations between the two warring parties in Sudan. If they're delivering supplies to the RSF, that role becomes disingenuous at best, duplicitous at worst. CNN has uncovered that in the last four months after the civil war began in Sudan, as many as 109 flights left two UAE airports and traveled to Chad to Amdjarass, a highly unusual route. You can see those flights in video and stills provided by whistleblowers. Eyewitnesses at Amdjarass told CNN that after the arrival of many of these flights, they saw vehicles loaded with weaponry crossing over to Al-Zurug in Sudan, where there is an RSF base. And it's not just the Emiratis using Chad. It's also Wagner expanding its network and reach. Prigozhin may be dead, but Wagner's supplies and the support to the RSF continues still. We uncovered evidence that Wagner trucks laden with arms from a Russian plane crossed through Chad en route to the same RSF military base in Al-Zurug, where you can clearly see here over 100 trucks newly arrived at the base. Both Russia and the Emirates have a history of supporting the RSF, more specifically, their commander Hemedti, through a series of financially beneficial arrangements, including the illegal sale of Sudan's gold for arms. If Hemedti does win the war, at the very least, both Russia and the Emirates would have strategic access to the Red Sea, access to Sudan's gold and mineral wealth, and increased political sway. But at what cost? We still don't know how many people have lost lives, how many have lost loved ones. And as the war rages on, it's impossible to count. We do know millions have been forced from their homes, not knowing if and when they will get to go home. They are paying the true cost for this fight for power and influence. I am among the lucky ones. We were able to evacuate my parents to Cairo, as well as my beloved uncle, who ran out of heart medicine. But so many others remain trapped in this geopolitical power game, playing out still six months on, while the world chooses to look the other way.",
