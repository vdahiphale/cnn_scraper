(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRYAN LANZA, SENIOR ADVISER, TRUMP 2024 CAMPAIGN: We're excited to have so many people, so many people excited to be part of this administration and unifying the country. So I think what you're going to see from this transition, you know, is going to be a unified front. And, you know, President Trump and Kamala Harris spoke a little bit earlier. It was a very gracious phone call that the vice president gave, and the president was very clear. She thought she ran a strong campaign, and she was very tenacious in the process. And, you know, she also mentioned she wanted to work with the president to unify the country. So I think from the transition, who wants to display a unified front, and also from the relationship that he has with Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, we're looking to have a unified relationship with the country in January. Let's be clear, Anderson, it's not a legal requirement for the campaign or the transition to sign anything with the government. We're working on cooperating in unison to make sure we cross the necessary thresholds so that our people can be briefed properly with national security background information and so that we can hit the ground running. But let's be clear, it is not a legal requirement to sign a memorandum of understanding with the government for this transition. What we expect to see for the first 100 days is people focused on affordability. The American people want to do something with respect to affordability. They've been wiped out. They've suffered tremendously through the policies of the previous administration. And we're going to focus on that. We're also going to focus on securing the border. That's very common sense to the common people. Once we understand how step one moves forward, we'll understand we'll move to the next layer. But let's be clear to the American people, we are going to deport illegal aliens who've broken our laws and who've been violent to our people. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The judge in that case has given himself until November 12th to decide if the Supreme Court's immunity ruling from this summer should mean that this entire conviction is tossed. If he decides that it should be tossed, obviously the sentencing wouldn't happen. But Trump's lawyers, again, they want to get that sentencing canceled. There's also good news for Trump's legal team on the federal front. The two federal cases their client is facing, we have learned that Jack Smith, the special counsel who brought both of those cases, is talking to leaders at the Justice Department, including the attorney general, about how to wind down those cases. They're looking at internal Justice Department guidance about how sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted or indicted, trying to figure out how does that apply to a president-elect. It is expected these conversations will go on for several days, but at this point it does not appear that the president would need to fire Jack Smith or have his Justice Department fire Jack Smith. These cases will likely be resolved before he returns to the White House. Paula Reid, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The markets boosted mainly by the fact that the election was decided relatively quickly as investors, of course, were hoping for some certainty -- clarity there.The Dow, the S&amp;P 500, and the Nasdaq all reaching new highs. The Dow, for its part, surged more than 1,500 points, more than 3.5 percent. The S&amp;P up by 2.5 percent. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq closed in trading nearly 3 percent higher. That record day on Wall Street comes despite warnings from a number of economists that many of Donald Trump's policies could increase inflation and America's budget deficit. So how could the economy change? What might it look like once Trump is, in fact, back in the White House? Well, let's think about what the things are that he has promised to do. The president-elect has said he will impose a tariff on all goods coming into the U.S., as well as steeper tariffs on imports specifically from China and Mexico. Economists say measures like that, though, would likely raise prices for the average American as they are passed on. Here's CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Imagine everything you buy that comes from outside the U.S., like wine, cheese, and laptops, get more expensive. Well, that's what economists say would happen under former President Trump's tariff proposal. A tariff is basically a tax on products, and Trump wants to put them on everything that comes into the U.S. That's $3 trillion worth of goods a year. In order to cover the higher tariffs, companies will have to raise prices, and that cost ultimately gets passed down to you, the consumer.So here's his plan. A 60 percent tariff on Chinese imports, and up to 20 percent on imports from other countries. Trump says it will protect working class jobs and punish countries making goods with cheap labor in unsafe conditions. The self- proclaimed tariff man is hoping the tariffs will incentivize Americans to buy more made-in-America products, and the tariffs could, in theory, raise trillions of dollars to help fund tax cuts. But economists at Goldman Sachs warn the tariffs could backfire, instead raising prices on American families, killing jobs, and setting off another trade war. Countries could then retaliate, putting their own tariffs on U.S. goods that they buy. The cost to the average American family, by one estimate, more than $2,600 per year. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

HILL: So in terms of passing that down to the consumer, we know that for the majority of voters, the economy was one of their top issues. That was consistent of what we heard over a span of months. The data may be pretty positive right now in the country, but we know that people don't feel it. Donald Trump has also said he will lower prices.

So at the end of the day, he's not getting there quick enough for people to really feel the difference to be able to do that. And if you're doing tax cuts on top of that, there's going to be a deficit issue, which he has to have a balance. So this is his plan and policy is something that could build on the economy, but it really needs to have a really strong balance.",

And I think also that needs to be also paid the inflation aspect to it, too. And when you put these tariffs on other countries, say 20 percent in other places, other banks are now looking at the Fed going, well, what are you doing? Are we going to increase our you know, I expect the next this month we'll see a twenty five basis points from other banks and the Bank of England.But in the next couple of months, they're going to see if the if the Fed doesn't do more decreases, we can see the dollar becoming more expensive for others to use.",

I believe that there's going to be a decrease behind it. And I think we saw the Bank of England actually was signaling that, too. But let me be really clear. No president should be affecting the Fed. The Fed has taken this long to get to this point to where I think that they're going to be decreasing this time next year. So I'm hoping that the numbers and the data continue to do what it's had. It's been a long road to get here for the economy to have interest rates to start to decrease. That's what the economy needs.
