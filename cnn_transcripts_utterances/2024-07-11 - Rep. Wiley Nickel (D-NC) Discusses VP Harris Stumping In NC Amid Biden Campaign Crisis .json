REP. WILEY NICKEL (D-NC): Jessica, Joe Biden's our Democratic nominee. we're going to do everything we can to make sure we beat Donald Trump. We've got a really important race for governor as well with Josh Stein taking on MAGA extremist Republican Mark Robinson. A lot on the line in this election. And my focus is just making the case for why Joe Biden should deserve a second term. And talking about the good things he's done, especially as we contrast that with Donald Trump, who wants to ban abortion with no exceptions, give massive tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy. That's not going to help the folks that I represent.",

We've got to do everything we can to push that message out.This is going to be about turnout. This is going to be a close election. And Joe Biden has just one hurdle he has to overcome. He has to make sure folks understand he's up to the job. We're going to get to see him in action day in and day out. He's got a big press conference coming up today. We will get to see him in action, up-close. I encouraged that the Biden campaign to get him out there as much as we can. Because once he clears that bar, it's a very low bar, we're going to be talking again about Donald Trump and why -- especially on days like today here in Washington, where we've got the NATO 75th anniversary summit. Democracy is literally on the ballot. If we can't -- if Donald Trump gets back to the Oval Office, he will hand Eastern Europe over to his friend and pal, Vladimir Putin. Those are big stakes in this election. So I hope our focus can be more on really what's at stake. And Joe Biden's the one that needs to put this issue to bed.",

And we have very diverse opinions as House Democrats. But we are united in beating Donald Trump. And we're just trying to figure out, especially at the top of our leadership, what's the best way to do that? And right now, we've got Joe Biden is our nominee. The focus really should be on talking about the good things that the administration has done. And frankly, I want to hear the White House come out and talk about what they want to accomplish over the next four years. I think that's what the American people really need to hear, not -- not the constant D.C. chatter, but what we're going to do to help improve people's lives.

Including 140 people who worked in his administration, who helped write or contributed to Project 2025, the signature work, this 900- page manifesto with their ideas for a second term.

His former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, is closely involved with one of the groups that has been advising this project. Is So Stephen Miller, another longtime adviser to Trump. He's involved with a group that has been advising Project 2025 as well. Many of the people who were behind the immigration policies that he pushed early in his term, they helped write this thing as well. We took this information to the Trump campaign and they said, look, yes, these people did work for Donald Trump, but they don't speak for him now. They may never work for him again. If you want to know what Donald Trump believes, they said, you should look at his Web site. He has this entire agenda put up there. He supports the Republican Party platform, but he is not involved with Project 2025. But I want to point you to a clip from earlier this year. This is in February, where Donald will Trump spoke at an event, as well as the Heritage Foundation president, which is the group behind Project 2025. And he had some interesting words to say about Kevin Roberts, the president of Heritage Foundation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But on a policy level, the researchers in this study really focused on things that communities can do. They focused in on smoking, for example. One of the most effective ways of reducing smoking rates is to make it more expensive through excise taxes. And they've pointed out that a pack of cigarettes in Missouri is about half as expensive as a pack of cigarettes in New York State. And if you look at the rates of lung cancer in those states, they are dramatically different. So there really can be societal things that can be done on top of reminding ourselves, protect ourselves in the sun, maintain a healthy weight.
