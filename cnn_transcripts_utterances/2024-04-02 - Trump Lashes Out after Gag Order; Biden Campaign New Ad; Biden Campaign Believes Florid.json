He just spoke out for the first time about the new, expanded gag order that he is now under, posting on social media and railing against the judge in the hush money trial he's about to face, but also notably not targeting the judge's daughter this time. That's notable because Donald Trump has targeted the judge's daughter recently, targeting her by name in several comments, even posting photos about her. The new gag order that came down late last night now bans the former president from talking about the family members of prosecutors and court staff. The judge saying that Donald Trump's words and rhetoric pose a \"very real threat.\" His post this morning does not cross that line. He'll face another test of this newfound restraint later today as he heads back on the campaign trail,CNN's Alayna Treene is on the trail in Michigan for us this morning. Alayna, what are you hearing about this? How is Donald Trump and the team around Donald Trump going to handle or face this new, expanded gag order?",

I took Hope Hicks deposition because the same, as the judge put it, alleged interference with an election gives rise to impeachable offenses as well.And I think that the prosecution, Alvin Bragg, has a powerful case here. If they're calling Hope Hicks, they're calling these other witnesses, it's because they've meticulously put together a case that they're going to present to the jury of how Donald Trump allegedly, let's remember, he's innocent until proven guilty, but he allegedly kept vital information from voters in the 2016 election. That's a case of voter deception and alleged election interference. It's kind of a gateway drug to him doing the same thing allegedly in 2020. That's why we're going to hear from Hope Hicks and the others. They have critical information in the determination of DA Alvin Bragg.",

In recent days alone we saw him attack judges and prosecutors in his Easter message. He put up a heinous image, Sara, of the current president of the United States, bound and gagged in the back of a pickup truck. An obvious gesture to the kidnapping of the current president. We've never seen anyone behave like this who's a former president, who's a criminal defendant, and that must go into the calculus as well. Thank goodness the judge put in this gag order.",

And they believe the big reason why is the issue of reproductive rights. The Florida state supreme courts moved forward with allowing a constitutional amendment relating to abortion to appear on Florida ballots in November. Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said that that would be a mobilizing and galvanizing force for voters heading into the election.The Biden campaign has long argued that reproductive rights across the country can really help push voters to the polls, especially women, moderate, and independent voters. That is something that the Biden campaign is also leaning into today in a new television ad they're releasing across battleground states and the state of Florida. This new ad features President Biden speaking direct-to-camera about needing to protect a woman's right to choose and trying to portray former President Donald Trump as a direct threat to reproductive rights. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But the Biden campaign is also running up against the reality of the political electorate in the state of Florida. We have seen in the past two campaigns former President Donald Trump really improve his standing among voters there. He beat Hillary Clinton by about 112,000 votes and more than double that margin when he competed against Biden in the state back in 2020.But one area that the Biden campaign is also saying they believe works in their favor is in the attempts to court those former Nikki Haley supporters. There were about 155,000 people who voted for Haley in the Republican primary in Florida, and the Biden campaign has been making direct overtures to her supporters, rolling out a new digital ad over the weekend and I'm told even reaching out to the people who funded her campaign, those high-dollar donors as well. So, these are all elements that the Biden campaign believes could work in their favor with reproductive rights.

And one of the major reasons it didn't happen was because reproductive rights were on the ballot. The Supreme Court had just overturned Roe v. Wade. And this is an interesting point, John, the issue of repro rights is very rarely adequately and accurately measured in polls. It's an underlying issue. A lot of people kind of put it aside. They said women were going to get over it. The Supreme Court overturned it in the summer. They were going to get over it by the midterm elections in 2022.Well, no, guess what, we're not over it and we're not going to be over it until the government stays out of a decision that should be in our hands with our families with our doctors and with our faith. And until Republicans understand that, and stop talking about any kind of ban, this is going to be an electoral kryptonite for them and it's going to be something that's going to give huge openings for Democrats. We saw it in Ohio. We saw it in Kansas. We flipped a central Florida seat that had been Republican. We flipped a Jacksonville mayoral seat that had been Republican in Florida as well.

And make no mistake, one of the biggest contributor to RFK Jr.'s super PAC is one of the biggest contributors to Donald Trump's super PAC. So, let's make sure that everybody understands that a vote for RFK Jr.is a vote for Donald Trump. And what he represents is conspiracy theories. And the fact that he said that he believes Joe Biden is a bigger threat to democracy than Donald Trump says at all. That's beyond the pale. Joe Biden was not the candidate who inspired an insurrection and pushed his supporters to go and attack the Capitol, where many people died, including law enforcement officers. He is not someone who still denies the election of 2020. He is not someone who said that he wants to be a dictator on day one.
