They both got out of the car and then, kind of off in the corner, it says that the suspect appears to move toward Bob Lee quite quickly. And then, he ends up getting in his car and driving away quickly, the suspect, while Bob Lee daggers off.So definitely, we're getting much clearer picture of what happened and it appears that the district attorney is arguing that there was an interpersonal dispute between Bob Lee and the suspect, Momeni.",

If that's 730 (ph) Max, stays -- sticks in your head for some reason that's because you may recall the plane was grounded globally after fatal crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia in 2018 and 2019.Now, Boeing says this new issue does not impact safety.

But this new issue is different. Boeing is really coming clean here about a defect and the manufacturing of the jet itself. The issue Boeing says is with a fitting in the rear part of the fuselage of some Maxes that are manufactured by a third party, and Boeing has not said exactly how many Maxes are defective, even though there are about a thousand flying worldwide, more than 300 in the U.S.In a statement, Boeing says, \"This is not an immediate safety of flight issue, and the in-service fleet can continue operating safely.\" The FAA, which ultimately came down hard on Boeing after the investigations into those crashes in 2018 and 2019 says, It has validated what Boeing says is true and is monitoring next steps. The contractor responsible for building these parts is a company called Spirit AeroSystems, and it just said, It is working on an inspection and repair for affected airplanes. But for now, the bottom line here is that this is not impacting travelers, only really airlines waiting for their new airplanes to be delivered and they would like a fix (ph). United Airlines has about a hundred more Maxes on order. It says no impact to travelers just yet. Erica, Bianna.",

And the situation now in the evening is one where there is still a lot of display of anger, but the crowds have dispersed a little bit.It's a bit of a cat and mouse game between the cops and the protesters who are still out here. You can see right here the police in full force. We have some of the police fans there behind us. We did see the police charge a couple of protesters. So, it has been, you know, some of a difficult night here in Paris so far, and in general we do have to say there are a lot of people here in France who are very angry at the fact that the retirement age is going to be lifted, but they're also angry at the way that Emmanuel Macron has pushed all of this through. They feel that he sort of bypassed large parts of the legislative process. And one of the things that we've sort of taken note of as we've been reporting on this on the ground is that there are also a lot of young people who are joining those protests, and a lot of those young people are telling us that they want to continue to fight this bill. With the kind of protests that we've been seeing here over the past couple of months, and especially over the past couple of days. Of course, several hundred thousand people went on the street yesterday, throughout France. There were a lot of people at protest in France today again as well. And even here all through the night, you can still hear the sirens as the police are out in full force and people are coming up and challenging those police officers because they are so angry. With what they feel is just the way that Emmanuel Macron, they believe has essentially done damage to democracy here in this country, guys.",

But perhaps it will complicate efforts to pardon him or give him a new trial. Among the posts that he wrote on June 1st, 2020 on Facebook, he wrote, It is official. I am a racist because I do not agree with people acting like animals at the zoo.That same day he also wrote, now it is my turn to get banned from Facebook by comparing the Black Lives Matter movement to a zoo full of monkeys that are freaking out, flinging their s-h-i-t. At a different time, he said, too bad we can't get paid for hunting Muslims in Europe and on and on. And I have not, we have not heard yet from Governor Abbott, who one has to believe was not aware of these text messages, which were not introduced in trial before Abbott said that he would seek a pardon for Mr. Perry. But it certainly is a shocking development and obviously will have a political impact. And let's be honest here, this case had become a cause celeb among conservatives.

I mean, this is the very short order from Justice Samuel Alito here, and what he's saying is he's granting what the Justice Department wanted. The Justice Department asked for a number of things, one of them being a short administrative stay.So, all of these changes to the abortion pill would not go into effect overnight tonight. So the Supreme Court is saying, yes, we will give you that brief pause, and that pause will last until just before midnight Wednesday. And Justice Alito is also asking the parties to file additional briefs if necessary. So, what this does is this doesn't settle any questions. This doesn't settle the underlying merits of this case. This basically just puts on pause what might have gone into effect overnight tonight. So, really this whole thing is going to play out again in just a few days when we're once again in that waiting mode to see what the Supreme Court again decides to do. Because this is an administrative stay, a very short stay. While the Supreme Court gets more briefing from the parties and further decides how to act here, but the takeaway from all of this is that Mifepristone is still available in the same form it was just a week ago before that Texas judge made all those changes to it. It is status quo for how it's been for the past several years. Women can get this pill, they can get it up to 10 weeks of pregnancy. They can also get it via telehealth medicine and via mail. That will be the case until at least late Wednesday night when the Supreme Court will again weigh in on this. So essentially, guys, the Supreme Court just really kicking the can down the road on this decision saying, we'll revisit this next week. But for now, things are status quo. There's been a lot of back and forth, a lot of confusion. The Justice Department pointed to all of this confusion and they're filing to the Supreme Court this morning. But it does sort of just keep things on hold while this continues to get sorted out, guys.",

And because of the access that it's had, but also because of the fact that this ruling just a week ago by this judge in Texas, it called into question the FDA's approval process. This drug was approved in the year 2000, and there has been a fair amount of data since then in terms of feedback about the impact on women and how safe it is. So, this is also a major focus because it's going to involve potentially the FDA approval process.",

So, what's going to happen here, as Jessica said, we have breathing room for five days.By Tuesday noon, the original challengers, the anti-abortion physicians and medical groups and anyone supporting them needs to get their filings into the Supreme Court by noon on Tuesday. Right now, we already have heard from the Department of Justice and the drug manufacturer Danco. Plus, also today, more than 20 states who wanted a pause in this litigation had already filed at the Supreme Court too. So I imagine we'll get a Russia filings by Tuesday. And this temporary pause is just until Wednesday. So that gives, you know, the justices a chance to actually read up on this to consider what their next step will be. This is a set of justices that just 10 months ago had overturned constitutional abortion rights nationwide and sent it back to the States. But as you said, Erica, this is a whole different kind of battle over the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to review and approve drugs in this case, obviously. The first pill of a two drug abortion medication protocol. And what's at issue right now is the access, not just the, not the core approval of that drug. That looks like, you know, at least the lower court said that that was done properly and the challengers couldn't go after that at this point. But what's at issue is more the availability.",
