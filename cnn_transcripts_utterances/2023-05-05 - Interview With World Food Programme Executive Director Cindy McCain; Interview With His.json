One month into her new job, I asked the World Food Programme's new executive director, Cindy McCain, how she's helping the unprecedent number of people facing starvation. Also, ahead, a coronation fit for a king, but is the monarchy still a fit for modern-day Britain. Historian and author, Simon Schama, and with the American perspective, \"The New York Times'\" Mark Landler, are here to discuss. Plus, Michel Martin talks to Oklahoma Republican Toni Hasenbeck back about her proposed law to protect women who kill their abusers. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane in London. In Sudan, still no lasting cease-fire as the warring parties refused to put down their arms. And the United Nations' chief now warns that it could all explode into an all-out war that would affect the region for years to come. After nearly four weeks, the violence is having a devastating effect on the country, with hundreds killed and thousands fleeing their homes in search of safety. Those left behind or forced into refugee camps are in dire need of shelter, medicine, clean water and of course, food. The U.N. World Food Programme is urgently working to get the Sudanese people fed, but it is dangerous work. Three staff members were killed in the fighting, forcing a temporary suspension of operations. At the helm of the WFP during this tense time is Cindy McCain, the former ambassador and widow of Senator John McCain. She's just one month on the job and the challenges go way beyond Sudan. The number of peaceful facing acute food insecurity worldwide has more than doubled to 345 million since 2019 due to the COVID pandemic, the Ukraine war, regional conflict and, of course, climate change. And Cindy McCain is joining me now from Nairobi, Kenya, where the U.N. secretary general is sharing emergency meetings. Welcome to our program.",

But -- so, I want people to know, WFP never left. And this is what we do. This is how we do it.

There will be street parties up and down the U.K. and thousands will come here to Buckingham Palace to witness the famous balcony moment, to see for the first time the newly crowned king and queen. FOSTER (voiceover):  Many more will line the streets for the coronation procession, just as they did for Queen Elizabeth seven decades ago.

So, there was a sense actually in the coronation, even though people -- first of all, the youth of the queen meant looking forward, you know, maybe tricky in this particular iteration of it, but I think that means something else. But there was also the sense of actually the nation had survived, the community of memory and democracy had survived the worst that fascism and Nazism could throw at it. So, even though you won't find many people talking about the war, the implication was that we are still part of a recognizable million extended family that have gotten through this ordeal.

You can take the oppositive view, which I think is strong, not just in Britain but in other monarchies, Japan's empire, Netherlands, Scandinavian countries and so on. But even in -- or especially in our digital age people are crying out for space to relate to each other which is not political, which is not partisan, where they can kind of enjoy a memory and history.

He spent all of his adult life, virtually, prophesying trouble with the environment that turns out one to be one of our existential crises.

It's my understanding that she was dragged tothe basement, handcuffed and physically assaulted. And that she was able to get her abuser's firearm away from him and killed him. But even though she was handcuffed at the time, she was still given a life sentence for this, which she continues to serve. I understand that there's another case, there was a woman who was pregnant, who was stabbed in her pregnant stomach by a man who had abused her previously. She did everything she'd been advised to do. She moved away. She changed her phone number. She made sure she blocked him on social media. But at some point, he tracked her down. He assaulted her while pregnant. She was able to get the knife away from him and defend herself, and she also was given a life sentence. Again, I'm just wondering why it is that -- is the way that stand-your- ground is interpreted in Oklahoma is only interpreted when the individual is a stranger?
