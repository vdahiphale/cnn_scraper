Dozens of police officers, rescue teams and firefighters are combing a steep valley on the Canary Islands west coast with dogs, drones and a helicopter. Tense moments on Sunday during protests outside a synagogue in a predominantly Jewish Los Angeles neighborhood. Social media videos showed police pushing pro-Palestinian protest demonstrators. Police said they responded to two protests in the neighborhood but there were no reports of injuries. Video also showed counter-protesters with Israeli flags confronting the pro-Palestinian demonstrators. The two sides shouted at and sometimes scuffled with each other. Videos from the scene showed multiple altercations. Protesters also blocked traffic. One person holding a so-called spiked flag was issued a citation and then released. A new building will be constructed at a Pittsburgh synagogue where there was a mass shooting in 2018. The groundbreaking ceremony took place on Sunday for the building of the Tree of Life synagogue, which will include a memorial and a museum to combat anti-Semitism. Eleven worshippers were killed and six others wounded in the hate crime. Second gentleman, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, spoke at the ceremony. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DOUG EMHOFF, HUSBAND OF U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Let me be very clear. When Jews are targeted because of their beliefs or identity, or when Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred, that is anti- Semitism plain and simple. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's not just because of flagging Arab American support. Some experts worry that the support of Jewish voters may be diminishing as well, as CNN's Edward-Isaac Dovere has the details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR PRODUCER: The ongoing turmoil set off by the October 7th attack by Hamas and Israel's bloody war launched in response is becoming yet another weight on President Joe Biden's re- election, with warning signs flashing over Jewish voter support for the president. For all the attention over how the Israel-Hamas war has endangered Biden's standing with Arab-Americans and progressives who have taken up the cause of Palestinians in key states, Jewish Americans who make up enough of the population to be determinative in tight battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin, and Arizona have been scrambled too. That's all the feelings brought up by the conflict, but also the pain over the surge in anti-Semitic incidents and rhetoric, particularly on the left in recent months. Josh Shapiro, the governor of key battleground state Pennsylvania, and an observant Jew himself told me, from Pharaoh to Hitler to Kim Jong- un, at what point in our history when a dictator has been leading a nation has a minority group done well. Donald Trump will eviscerate the rights of minority groups, including American Jews. Doug Emhoff, who's Vice President Kamala Harris' husband, and also Jewish, has been taking a lead on this too, calling Donald Trump a known anti-Semite. Now, Biden and Donald Trump have very different records on Israel and condemning anti-Semitism, with Biden spending a lot of time on both over his years in politics. But Republicans are looking to play into the anxieties, with operatives telling me they plan to campaign on the idea that Biden's presidency has led to Jews in America being less safe and more Israelis being killed.

      "sentences": "Right, and we keep hearing that term. I think it came from the Saudi government statement, but we hear it from other officials, unregistered or unofficial pilgrims.Look, all of this is coming after for days we saw families of those missing on the ground in Saudi Arabia desperately looking for those loved ones, desperately looking for their elderly parents, posting on social media, calling local hospitals, trying to get answers, and now we have this figure officially from the Saudi authorities. 1,300 people who have died during the Hajj pilgrimage. Fears that that number could go up, and now governments are looking at why. How did this happen? What does it mean to be unofficial or unregistered in the pilgrimage? Many of these people really are at the mercy of these tour groups. You have to remember how important the Hajj is. This is an absolute pillar of Islam. People save up their whole lives for it. They apply year and year after year to try to get that OK, that permission, that green light to go to the Hajj, and then you have these tour operators who oftentimes are calling these families up and saying, look, I'll sort it out for you, I'll find you a way. So it's not always clear whether families are aware if they have the correct permissions, if they have the correct paperwork, until they get there. They're in these scorching temperatures. They have to get to a site, one of the key sites, Mount Arafat, is where a lot of the deaths happen, is on the route to that, and they find they have no bus, that they have no accommodation, they have no proper way to care for themselves. We know Egypt is already taking steps. The Egyptian government says it has banned 16 tour groups for their part in these illegal pilgrimages. We know Jordan is taking steps to crack down as well. Tunisia has fired one of their ministers for not cracking down. But the question is, for all of these pilgrims, and for the families who are still looking for loved ones, because it is this week that the homecomings are going to happen. You have to remember, this is going to reverberate throughout the Muslim world when people don't return home. Those governments are going to have to answer questions. The question is going to be, why did it take 1,300 people dying of the heat, many of them, in order for this to take place, in order for these actions to be taken? So a lot of consideration here about the logistics, and you have to remember going forward, these temperatures could potentially only rise with the climate crisis. Governments are going to be looked at, these tour groups are going to be looked at. People are going to ask, how can I safely get my family member, get my relative, to carry out this pilgrimage to Mecca in the future?",

CNN's Rafael Romo reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Some 300 families have left their home on the island of Gardi Sugdub in Panama, in hopes of a better future. For some, that does not seem to be the case. The Panamanian government relocated these families to the new community of Nuevo Carti on the mainland, due to the rising sea levels affecting the island. CNN went to the island and spoke with locals there, and on the mainland, not all locals seem happy with this solution to climate change. Resident Brenes Garcia goes back to his home on the island every day. BRENES GARCIA, GARDI SUGDUB RESIDENT (through translator): This morning at 6 a.m. I crossed here. Here and there, I have quite a few things here. I would have to take everything with me. ROMO (voice-over): Garcia owns a shop in Gardi Sugdub, and he tells CNN there's not enough space in the new community for his business. It would not be profitable for him to stay in Nuevo Carti. Community officials say some 32 families stayed on the island, there were no more houses left, and others decided to stay on their own. Residents of the Panamanian island tell CNN living on the mainland would affect their livelihood and lifestyle. HERMINIO REYES, GARDI SUGDUB RESIDENT (through translator): I'm losing fishing time because I'm not looking at the sea every day, and that's in my nature. I want to ensure that every day my family is eating fish, and also yuccas, everything that is natural. ROMO (voice-over): The community secretary, Augusto Walter, said that before the move, the island of Gardi Sugdub had around 1,300 inhabitants. And in some homes, up to four generations would live under the same roof. But conditions in the new community of Nuevo Carti do not seem to be better. Walter says that electricity and water go out sometimes for days at a time. The climate change effects will only get worse as sea levels rise. Residents of the island looked at other solutions to protect their homes. These fillings seen here on the island are built with wood and stones to prevent water from entering the houses when the tide rises. CLAUDIANO LOPEZ, GARDI SUGDUB RESIDENT (through translator): What they told me at first was that they didn't think it was climate change, they didn't believe it. But now they're tired of drying everything, removing stones, and when the sea rises, it takes things away. AGUSTO WALTER, COMMUNITY SECRETARY (through translator): I know that in 10 or 30 years this will be noticeable, but not now. Now people think that it is not a big deal, that it's not going to happen. But yes, the sea level is going up. ROMO (voice-over): Rafael Romo, CNN Atlanta. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
