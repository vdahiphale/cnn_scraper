He was very charismatic. He was somebody who -- I mean, I've attended some of his speeches, and he certainly had a charm that really came across.So, he had broad appeal, but he had many critics as well. But certainly, in the last few years, what we've seen is, he has gradually faded from public life, as you mentioned, back in April, he was hospitalized. He was diagnosed as suffering from leukemia. So, it wasn't a complete surprise that perhaps, today was the day he would pass. But it certainly was, as you said, a larger-than-life figure who many Italians looked up to and found to be quite inspiring. He was somebody who also had his troubles with the law. Back in 2013, he was convicted of tax evasion. He never actually served any time in jail because of his advanced age. But as I said, he was somebody who appealed to many Italians because he was somebody who played the system to a certain extent. And he often times expressed the frustrations of many Italians with high taxes and an unwieldy bureaucracy, both of which, however, he at the end of his days was not able to overcome. Max, Bianca.",

For instance, the Italian economy for the 20 years from the first time he became prime minister, never actually grew.The Italian economy has largely been stagnant since the early 1990s. So, he certainly threw an element -- he was almost a Trump-like figure without some of the more rougher sides of Trump. But he was somebody who rode a populist wave and remains to this day very popular. But in terms of actually changing how Italy functions, that's a very hard thing for even a larger-life figure -- larger-than-life figure of Berlusconi to do.",

The governor and the city were not giving answers during a press conference Sunday evening, but I will tell you what we do know about how all this went down. Basically just before 6:30 Sunday morning, there was a tanker truck that was sitting underneath i-95. That tanker truck then caught fire, and that fire is what ultimately led to the collapse of the northbound lanes on i-95. And the governor told us on Sunday that the southbound lanes also are not safe at this moment. Now, currently, the truck is still trapped underneath that wreckage. We've been hearing all throughout the day, jack-hammering and heavy machinery working through the day to sift through that rubble. And while there have been no reported injuries, the governor said they are still working to see if anyone was actually alive in that truck when this collapse happened. Now, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said that there are 500 tons of concrete mess now sitting on the ground, that's what officials have to sift through -- sift through. Take a listen to what Governor Shapiro said when he laid eyes on this incident first. GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA):  Remarkable devastation. And I found myself, you know, thanking the Lord that no motorists who were on 95 -- on i- 95 were injured or died. It's just a remarkably devastating sight. One that our first responders, law enforcement and others contained very quickly. [05:20:00] They got people out of harm's way.
