I need not say that the despicable conduct that was engaged as to him. So, what that led to was this investigation into the patterns and practices.But when you look at the investigation and the pattern of practices, that's significant because it shows a federal government had a role, took it seriously, did thousands of investigations, looked into the issue of body cams, et cetera, did interviews and looked at documents. The Trump administration had gotten away from that, so that's significant. But now that you have this decree, which is an agreement with the federal government to try to make things better, the issue is it's going to take time. Yes, there will be specific recommendations. They will be overseen, those recommendations, the issue will be is to try to get to the community their trust back, with respect to that being lost because of the police aggression and the police misconduct. There will be a number of reforms that have to be implemented, but it will take time and we'll see whether it goes far enough.

That's what at stake here.But before I get to that, I want to just illustrate exactly what happened today. As you said, 63 federal charges were found guilty of all of them, including the 22 capital offenses that we've been talking about so much in this particular case. The primary capital offense, the obstruction of religious beliefs, resulting in death, basically the accusation that he killed these 11 Jewish worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue back in October of 2018 while they were practicing their Jewish faith. The other Capitol crime there, the use and discharge of a firearm to commit murder during and in relation to a crime of violence and possession of a firearm. Now, Alex, we had our producer who was inside the actual courtroom when these guilty verdicts were being read aloud. She said that it was so silent, you could hear a pin drop. As for Bowers himself, he was a motionless during the process. And then by the time we got past those initial capital punishment verdicts and towards the latter charges that were red, that's when she could hear some sniffling in that courtroom, some emotion there. It's been a harrowing few weeks of trial and testimony, and for some perspective, these people who are family members of the victims, these people who had been survivors of the shooting, they waited four and a half years for this day in court. We actually heard from some members of the Jewish community a little while ago.

They don't just care about liberal policy priorities. If they wanted this caucus to actually be taken seriously, they would have made it bipartisan, like almost every other caucus in the House is. The Congressional Dads Caucus has also taken issue with the Parents Bill of Rights, a Republican education bill that requires public school to share the material with parents. The Dads Caucus argues this takes away from the real problems that families face.
