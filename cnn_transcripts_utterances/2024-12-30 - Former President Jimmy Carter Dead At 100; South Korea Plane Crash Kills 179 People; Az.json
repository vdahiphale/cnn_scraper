Plans are coming together this hour to honor the life of Jimmy Carter, the humble peanut farmer from Plains, Georgia, turned 39th president of the United States, who died yesterday at the age of 100. A man who redefined what life after the White House could look like. The southern statesman only served one term as president, but leaves behind a legacy of humanitarianism and fighting, of course, for human rights. After leaving Washington, Carter and his wife was 77 years. Rosalynn founded the Carter center, a nonprofit working to promote peace as well as freedom right around the world. Rosalynn Carter passed away a little more than one year ago at the age of 96. President Joe Biden remembered Jimmy Carter as a man of great character, as well as courage, and is honoring his lifelong friend by proclaiming January the 9th as a national day of mourning. President-elect Donald Trump honoring him by in part by saying: While I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically, I also realized that he truly loved and respected our country and all it stands for. He worked hard to make America a better place, and for that, I give him my highest respect. Well, CNN's Rafael Romo joins us now from the Carter center in Atlanta. Rafael, good to see you. Just give us a sense about the funeral plans. What more are you learning this hour?",

How are you?We have learned that in addition to lying in state at the U.S. Capitol, there will be public observances, both in Washington, here in Atlanta, President Joe Biden will deliver the eulogy at a service at Washington's National Cathedral. And this is because Carter, when he was alive, that was his request. And also, we have learned that there will be a private burial for family and close friend of the former president -- of the late president, I should say, and his beloved Plains, Georgia, his native town. And, Isa, in addition to all that, we have seen a tremendous amount of love being poured out here where we are at the Carter Center, with many people coming down here to bring flowers to light candles. There was a person who brought a jar of peanuts. They put the jar of peanuts right behind me because they wanted to honor the memory of the man who rose from being a peanut farmer to becoming the 39th president of the United States. And, Isa, much has been said about the perception that his president -- Jimmy Carter's presidency did not reach its full potential. But many people here in Georgia say that you have to look at the entire life and legacy of the man and remember the important causes he fought for, including promoting democracy, fighting disease, seeking international peace. I had an opportunity earlier to speak with the former health advisor here at the Carter Center, and this is what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. FRANK RICHARDS, SENIOR ADVISER FOR HEALTH (RET.), CARTER CENTER: President Carter and Mrs. Carter were very, very passionate about human rights, human dignity, freedom and democracy and the alleviation of suffering, and especially that health care is a human right, and they're concerned with diseases that have especially afflicted people who were destitute and poverty.

      "sentences": "Well, how he will be remembered is a question that has been asked ever since he left the White House. And in the years since 1981, that question has been answered differently. The answer has evolved, I think by this point, people are seeing him as a man who was deeply committed to public service, whether it was in the United States or globally.People saw that once he once his career ended, his political career ended in such a disappointing way to both him and Rosalynn Carter and many of their supporters. Rather than giving up rather than stewing in bitterness, he chose to take his youthful energies. At the age of 56, and those of his -- of his wife, and turn them towards doing unilateral good. He didn't have to worry about congress. He didn't have to worry about elections in the United States. He was able to focus on things that he thought -- puzzles he thought he could solve. He was, after all, not only a peanut farmer, but also an engineer by training. And so he will be remembered not just in the United States. I mean, I think that is the biggest testament to Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter. They have shaped lives not simply in their own country, but in many countries in the Global South and elsewhere. And so that's how he'll be remembered. He won't just be remembered in the United States. And that's a great legacy. I think, for him.",

And by achieving, by brokering a peace agreement between Israel and Egypt, he showed the possibilities of peace, by combining a willingness and a willingness to strengthen American defenses, while at the same time avoiding at all costs a new hot wars. He tried to show that you could achieve, um, this is a term Ronald Reagan would use, but Jimmy Carter was actually the first person to shape this kind of approach to foreign relations, peace through strength, because Jimmy Carter laid the groundwork for the defense rearmament of the Reagan years.So Carter himself, while American president, tried to find a way to achieve American goals peacefully, he didn't seek unilateral disarmament. He didn't want to give up on Americas role in leading the push against Soviet tyranny in the Cold War. But he wanted to do it differently. He sensed the American people were tired of war. He was the first post-Vietnam Democratic president. He knew that Americans were tired of political scandal. He promised an ethical administration and actually changed the rules, tightened them for ethical behavior in the White House. So I think Jimmy Carter will be remembered for trying to set a higher standard for Americans, trying to -- to prove that we were a better country than we had been.

And the people in Plains, Georgia, specifically adored him, adored his wife, adored his whole family because he had been here for 100 years. I know he -- he was governor of Georgia for four years. He was the president of the United States for four years. He served some time in the Navy, but 87 years of his life, he literally lived in Plains, Georgia. And that says a lot.

So he was always from my childhood, the president that I kind of looked at as a -- as a model and as -- as an example of what a president is. So when I got the chance to move to Atlanta to cover him, it was a thrill because, you know, as the reporters, as you know, we meet a lot of famous people. We meet a lot of interesting people. And meeting the president and I think I could consider him a friend after all these years of covering him was a -- was a blessing.

So you think about that and you put that in context as to what that situation was that he was born into, but he was born also into a community where his parents surrounded him with black people. Rachel Clark was a black woman who actually worked on his fathers farm. And when his mother and father would go on vacation, they would -- he would -- Jimmy would -- Jim, President Carter would stay at Mrs. Clark's house.So Mrs. Clark, basically, he writes about this, I'm not saying anything that's a secret, basically raised him. So he was raised by Mrs. Clark. She was -- grew up with Mrs. Clark's children, as well as the Black people around who lived near his farm. So most of his friends were Black. So when you think about being born and raised in a segregated society but immersed amongst Black people, that changes your thinking because that -- it doesn't change your thinking, but it shapes your thinking. So as he becomes a politician, as he becomes a businessman, he understands the importance of race. He understands the importance of diversity. And as a Christian, I think he understands the importance of human nature and decency. So I think that he didn't see race the way a lot of people see it. Obviously, he doesn't see race the way politicians see it now and the way most people see it now. He sees people as people and human beings and children of God, and that's who he was. So that's what he was raised as. And one of his last civic duties that he said publicly was that he wanted to live long enough to vote for Kamala Harris to be the first Black woman, first woman, and the first Black woman to be president of the United States. He lived to vote for. And she didn't win, of course, but he did at least meet -- meet that goal.",

One of his signature White House legacies was the Torrijos-Carter treaties that returned the Panama Canal to Panama in 1999. He also calmed Mideast tensions, brought together Israeli and Arab leaders at Camp David, opening the door to the Israeli-Egypt Camp David accords. He normalized relations with China, weakened U.S. ties to Taiwan in a vain hope Beijing would weaken ties with Moscow. But after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in December 1979, the last year of his presidency, he toughened his Soviet stance, backed the Afghan mujahedeen in a war against the Red Army. The same year, 1979, Islamic Revolution in neighboring Iran dealt Carter a double domestic blow, spiked oil prices, and led to a humiliating failed raid, Operation Eagle Claw, in April 1980, to rescue Americans captured by the theocratic revolutionaries in Tehran.",

Were joined now by Robert Strong, a senior fellow at the University of Virginia's Miller Center. He's also the author of \"Working in the World: Jimmy Carter and the Making of American Foreign Policy'. Great to have you on the show, Robert. Let me pick up really with that report from Nic Robertson, really highlighting there how he was above everything else, a peacemaker. He said, in fact, in an address to Congress, this is in 1979 that when it comes to relations with potential adversaries, he said the following: It is a myth that we must choose between confrontation and capitulation. Together, we build a foundation for a stable world of both diversity and peace. And of course, the example that comes to mind for so many of us is those accords at Camp David between Israel and Egypt. Talk to us about that conviction and what brought about Israel and Egypt together, because that deal last is endured until today. ROBERT STRONG, SENIOR FELLOW, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA'S MILLER CENTER: Well, I think you're right that Carter was a sincere and serious peacemaker. That's a hard job to have. In the case of the Middle East, he came into office in 1977, hoping that there would be a large scale conference and all of the issues between Israel and the Palestinians, but that didn't occur. When it couldn't take place, he was advised by experts on the Middle East not to have direct negotiations with Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin because they hadn't reached an agreement between themselves. Carter invited them to Camp David for a three-day period. It ended up being nearly two weeks, and by his own forceful personality, was able to bring them together for a partial settlement a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. One of the real milestones in the long ongoing negotiations in that part of the world. It was criticized at the time for not dealing with all of the remaining issues involving the East Bank, Gaza and other issues between Israel and its neighbors. But it has stood the test of time, and it took the largest and most powerful enemy of Israel out of the coalition that had fought multiple wars in the region. The Camp David accords was a significant accomplishment, and both (AUDIO GAP) and Begin agree they wouldn't have occurred but for Carter's. It -- Carter's insistence that they stay in Camp David until they reached an agreement.",

And the liberals concerned about spreading democracy and human rights in other parts of the world.Americans support the proposition of human rights. Unfortunately, when you get to individual cases, it was often much more complex and much more controversial. Carter, to his credit, sometimes compromised but never wavered from the core principles. He talked about human rights in almost every meeting he had with another head of state. He made it a major theme of his presidency and a major commitment in his post-presidential work.",
