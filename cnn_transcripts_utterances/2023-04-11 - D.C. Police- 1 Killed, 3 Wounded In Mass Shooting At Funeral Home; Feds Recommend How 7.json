But there's just not enough to go around. And the law of the river was written in the twenties after one of the wettest years ever. So they've been over allocated water for a century now. And it's time for people to come together and figure out an equitable way forward. When you've got cities and ranchers and tribes and ski resorts and golf courses all competing over every drop, you can see how it gets very complicated.

But normally, when China is going to use this military force against Taiwan, Taiwan needs to be prepared. If China sees that Taiwan is prepared, Taiwan has adequate defense capabilities, and ensure that Chinese leaders will think twice before they decide to use force against Taiwan.

These negotiations have been going on for a few weeks now. But what this strike authorization vote does is really set the scene for a potential strike if the two sides can't come to an agreement by May 1st. And here's what's on the table. The Writers' Guild of America is calling for increased compensation. They are asking for residuals from feature films and also from streaming platforms. They want to end the abuse of smaller writers' rooms, and they want to increase contributions to pension and health funds. And this is really affecting writers from the lowest rung to the most famous writers we know from hit TV shows. Listen to a writer from the show \"Yellowjackets\" on Hulu.
