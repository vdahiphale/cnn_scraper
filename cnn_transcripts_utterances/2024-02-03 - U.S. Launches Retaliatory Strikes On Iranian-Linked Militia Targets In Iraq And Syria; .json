The strikes are in retaliation for the deaths of three American soldiers killed in a drone attack in Jordan nearly a week ago.Now, President Biden says a launch of airstrikes carried out in Syria and Iraq are only the beginning of the operations. This is video from what appears to be one of those strikes in Iraq earlier this morning. The mayor of the town says the strikes had houses used for weapons storage. Officials condemned the strikes as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. We have team coverage this morning CNN's Nic Robertson and Kevin Liptak are standing by.

      "sentences": "Amara, the U.S. military striking a variety of different targets associated with these Iranian-backed militia groups, including rockets, missiles and other munitions stores, striking command and control hubs as well as logistics facilities.But what's significant here, Amara, is that the these airstrikes targeted, not only these Iranian-backed militia groups believed to have been responsible for the deadly attack on an outpost in Jordan last week that killed three American servicemembers, but also targeting the -- targeting facilities used by Iranian officials themselves embedded with these groups. Now, this is an escalation from previous retaliatory strikes in response to what has been now more than 160 attacks on American servicemembers across Iraq and Syria by these Iran-backed groups. The United States, of course, we heard from a senior military official last night saying that these targets were chosen quote with the idea that there would be likely casualties among not just these militia groups, but also amongst the Iranian personnel who used them. Now, this is of course intended to send a very clear message to Iran, about the funding support training and other support that it provides to these militia groups who are carrying out these attacks knock it off. But the United States is, of course, stopping short of striking Iran directly, as some Republican lawmakers had urged the Biden administration to do something officials believe would escalate the situation rather than have the deterrent effect that they are looking for. Remember, important to understand here that all of these different Iran-backed militia groups, they receive funding, they receive training, they receive other support, including arms from Iran, and they receive a certain amount of coordination. But Iran does not necessarily order any one specific attack and it doesn't have perfect command and control over all of these groups, something that has made the response to these attacks, very complex for the Biden administration. So the big question going forward. Now, Amara, I think, is not only do these strikes have the impact that the Biden administration is looking for in stopping these attacks. But also, how does Iran respond to the likely -- the targeting and potential killing of its own of its own officers even not on Iranian soil? Do they view that as a potential red line that they may feel domestic pressure to respond to? Or does it have the deterrent effect that the U.S. is looking for?",

But let all those who might seek to do us harm know this. If you harm an American, we will respond.Now, what the next phase of this response looks like, isn't exactly clear. And American officials were understandably reticent about describing what we might see next happen in the region. Certainly, they will want to do that assessment on the ground to see how successful these strikes yesterday were before determining a next base. There are a number of other factors that I think will go into that. And it was interesting, listening to officials yesterday describing how much the weather impacted the timing of these strikes, because there had been this several day gap between when President Biden told us that he had made a decision on how to respond. And when we saw this response actually taking place, and what official says said was that they were looking for clear skies, you know, that essentially made it easier to determine the targets on the ground, and to ensure that there were no unintended casualties. At the end of the day, President Biden is trying to strike a balance here and to thread a needle. He is looking to deter these groups to degrade their capabilities. But he's also seeking to prevent a wider war from escalating in the region. You saw this very forceful response yesterday, and certainly, White House officials are hopeful that this could really make a dent in some of the capabilities of these groups on the ground. But the President did stop short of striking inside Iran. That is something that many Republicans were urging him to do. That option at the end of the day was never a likely one from the get go. Certainly President Biden watching very carefully a region very much on edge and hoping not to cause this conflict to escalate any further guys.",

And we did that. But we use the weapons system that wouldn't be capable of doing that. So it was a message to the Iranians that we were ready to go in if we needed to, but we decided we didn't need to.

Now we are in a situation where the U.S. has said, you know, we've asked and asked and asked you to control these paramilitary forces that are partly under Iraqi government control, but largely funded by Iran and backed by Iran.

CNN's Nick Valencia has more.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Fulton County D.A. Fani Willis responding for the first time to an explosive court filing last month, accusing her of an improper romantic relationship with her top deputy, Nathan Wade. Writing in her response, \"while the allegations raised in the various motions are salacious and garnered the media attention, they were designed to obtain, none provide this court with any basis upon which to order the relief they seek.\" And for the first time, both she and Wade acknowledging that they developed a personal relationship in addition to our professional association and friendship. But they said that happened after Willis appointed Wade in 2021 to investigate efforts by Donald Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. And Willis strongly pushed back against defense attorneys who she says are wildly speculating that she somehow benefitted financially from the arrangement. Willis also addressing allegations that Wade paid for them to take lavish vacations together with money he earned on the case. Writing, \"financial responsibility for personal travel taken is divided roughly, evenly between the two, with neither being primarily responsible for expenses of the other, and all of the expenses paid for with individual personal funds. A hearing on the alleged conflict of interest and the effort to disqualify Willis is scheduled for February 15th, where Willis, Wade and some of their colleagues could be forced to testify. But Willis argues in her response that such a hearing is unnecessary, and she continues to defend Wade's appointment as her top deputy, like she did the last time she spoke publicly in church in January.",
