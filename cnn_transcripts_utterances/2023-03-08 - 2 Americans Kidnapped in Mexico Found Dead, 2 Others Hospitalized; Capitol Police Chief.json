I can't handle much more of this.

This is street to street combat, particularly brutal for these last few days as Russian forces try to continue their push towards the center of town.Now, you have to bear in mind, of course on the Ukrainian side this is something we've heard from so many soldiers and commanders fighting in Bakhmut even though.

Of course, they have had another galvanizing moment, yesterday when this extraordinarily chilling video was released, showing soldiers, a Ukrainian soldier who went missing from around Bakhmut in early February, being brutally executed. His last words as he smoked a cigarette being for being shot by Russian forces -- glory to Ukraine. He has become really overnight a sort of iconic image to Ukrainians and if ever they did doubt why they were fighting, or sometimes wonder about the amount of losses, somehow the Russians seem to keep reminding them of why they are there -- Christine.",
