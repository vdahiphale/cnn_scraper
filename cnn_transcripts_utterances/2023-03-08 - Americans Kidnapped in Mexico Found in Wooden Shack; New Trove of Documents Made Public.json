Whether you're talking about your job or you're talking about all these ways the higher interest rates are going to affect you. And I want to just look at the mortgage market, for example. Thirty- year fixed-rate mortgages are indirectly tied to these Federal Reserve rate hikes. And you've already seen mortgage rates rising here. You're paying about $700 more a month in interest on a typical mortgage today -- a new mortgage today than you would have if you'd got that mortgage last year. On credit card interest rates, those are record highs here. Nineteen percent for a typical credit card interest rate. This bears repeating, you guys. If you are putting money on a card and not paying it off, you will spend a long time and a lot of money to get out from underneath that debt. So that's a really important part here, too. And now in savings rates, you're seeing a little bit money. Eventually, you might get a little bit more by having your money in a certificate of deposit or in a savings account. That has lagged, I'm going to say, sadly. But eventually, saving money because of these higher rates could be a little more advantageous. It's just not happening.

And that could throw the economy into a recession. It's a very, very dangerous and delicate balance that the Federal Reserve is trying to do. And I think what we heard from the Fed chief yesterday is that this economy has been stronger than they thought. It really has been.
