Pro-democracy American lawmakers are all too aware of the danger Putin poses on the battlefield and also in cyberspace. The State Department is warning Russia will conduct \"information operations\" around western elections this year. It comes as the era of A.I. is upon us, misinformation and deep fakes, the twisting of truth, everyone's struggling to distinguish what is actually real, truth or lies. Mustafa Suleyman is an artificial intelligence pioneer. As co-founder of the A.I. lab, DeepMind, which Google bought for hundreds of millions of dollars back in 2014. He was also in the room when President Biden announced new A.I safeguards last year. Suleyman says it is an incredible time to be alive during this transition to A.I, and that the world still doesn't quite grasp how big a deal it really is. He joined me here in the studio to discuss all the ups and downs, which he's written about in his book, \"The Coming Wave.\" Mustafa Suleyman, welcome to the program. 2023, let's say, has been the year of A.I. Everybody was focused on it. And by and large, it was the catastrophizing of A.I. People are worried about the elections, first and foremost. People are worried about knowing what truth is. What should we know right now after this year? MUSTAFA SULEYMAN, CO-FOUNDER, INFLECTION AI:  Look, I think naturally whenever we encounter a new technology, we initially feel anxious and we're sort of afraid like, what are the benefits? How is this going to affect society? What does it mean for jobs and privacy and trust? And they're all good questions to ask, but I think in the panic and the hype, perhaps, we're sort of losing sight of the very practical, real challenges we have in just getting this to work, getting it to be useful, getting it widely available, making it cheap so that anybody can play with it and experiment. And they're the things that I tend to focus on. My new companies called Inflection AI. We've been going for a couple of years now. We create a chat bot called Pi, which stands for Personal Intelligence, P-I. And it's incredibly warm and kind and supportive. It has very high emotional intelligence, and it's a great conversational partner.",

If you really focus on creating an A.I. that is smooth, conversational, fluent, very even-handed, and balanced, it turns out it's possible to do it. And our A.I. Pi is really, really good. I mean, people should check it out. It's very, very kind and balanced and friendly. And I think that that demonstrates that we can actually control these A.I. systems. That we aren't at the mercy of them. This is not some technology that is taking place beyond us or outside of us. This isn't, you know, an emergent effect of life. This is a tool.

And the good news is that we actually have many, many choke points around which we can focus these kinds of policies. All of the big tech companies provide access to these services, right? And I think it should be an obligation on them, I think -- which I think they should embrace proactively before regulation requires it, to prevent chat bots and other kinds of A.I.s from imitating a politician or even promoting or advocating for a certain political party or an idea.

And, you know, we as a company have been very, very forward in trying to educate regulators, collaborate with them, and so on. The downside is that's going to take some time. So, in practice, I think it is a sensible thing for Google and Facebook, TikTok, and the big tech companies to just declare that they're going to do everything in their power, they're going to do every best effort they can imagine to try to prevent this kind of imitation on the platform. They've done it before. We've seen it before. After you know, there was real-time streaming of mass shootings, for example, in the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand, for example. You know, the platforms got very good at detecting when that was about to happen. And within seconds, can now shut it off and prevent it. So, this is the same story.",

Technology has changed so much in the past year, when you think about the advent of generative A.I., and adding, she's really excited about what the changes will mean.

In the medium-term, over the next decade, it's going to be labor augmenting. It will make people smarter, more productive, more efficient with their time, more accurate with their engagements in working in an everyday office or organization. But in the very long-term, that same A.I. is going to learn to do those tasks more effectively than a regular human. And that on its face should drive an enormous amount of value. That is good for everybody. We are going to see the most productive decade in the history of our species. We're able to do much, much more with less. The question is, how does that value get redistributed? And that's the age-old challenge. If we leave that just to the market, to its own devices over the next two or three or four decades, then we will see what we've seen in the last five decades, which is the returns to capital compound far more quickly than labor's wages can grow. In fact, we've actually seen a stagnation of wages over the last four decades, and we've seen massive growth and concentration in capital, and this is a tool that shifts value from labor to capital, because an A.I. is essentially a capital form of labor.

The Russians have lost about two-thirds of their pre-war tank inventory. They have suffered more than 300,000 casualties. So, this is directly decreasing the threat to our NATO allies and to the United States. And it's also upholding the principles of liberalism, democracy, and the rule of law that we have stood for since World War II. It would set a horrible precedent for the world if Russia were to get away with its unprovoked aggression, that would be a green light for China to attack Taiwan, for North Korea to attack South Korea. We don't want to live in that kind of world. The Ukrainians are fighting for our values with a small amount of aid. We are helping them to keep their nation intact. And even though their counteroffensive failed, Russia has also failed in its attempt to destroy Ukraine. 80 percent of Ukrainian territory remains in Ukrainian hands.

And I don't mind linking the two if it's possible to get agreement on a border deal. But remember, Walter, there has not been a comprehensive immigration bill passed through Congress since Ronald Reagan's presidency in the 1980s. And now, we're seeing why it's so hard to do that because even though Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have made a lot of progress on a compromised bill, Trump is saying that it needs to fail, because essentially, Trump cares more about holding onto the border as an election issue than he cares about actually controlling the issue. And so, the odds are that the House Republican caucus will tank the immigration compromise in the Senate. The question then becomes, what happens to aid to Ukraine? And also, by the way, aid to Israel and Taiwan, is that going to get a separate up or down vote or not? And it's imperative that Congress delink these two issues so that even if there is gridlock and immigration, Ukraine can't wait for us to settle our differences. They need aid right now.

But clearly, we need to also send a strong message to Iran that they can't attack us forces or their proxies can attack U.S. forces with impunity. And so, I'm sure that President Biden and his military and foreign policy advisers are looking at target sets that they can after to send that message to Iran without getting into an escalatory spiral that would produce a massive war that nobody wants.",

And yet, we're doing that when we're pushing against Russia, pushing against China, and now pushing against Iran. And they're all becoming closer to each other. Do you think we're making a major strategic error in foreign policy? And if so, should we be opening up to China or Iran, and try to not have our adversaries all grouped against us?",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, I would not actually say that all of our adversaries are grouped against us. There are some overlapping interests between Iran,China, and Russia, but they're not close allies. And in fact, I think the Biden administration has done a pretty good job over the last year of improving relations with China. And as you can see, China is not providing weapons to Russia in Ukraine. I think that's hugely important. And China seems to have adopted a somewhat more conciliatory approach to the U.S. and the West, and I think that's a positive thing. So, I think we should certainly try to ratchet down tensions where we can. It's hard. You know, there's no way to ratchet down tensions with Russia as long as they continue to invade an innocent country next door. It's very hard to ratchet down tensions with Iran as long as their proxies are attacking U.S. forces. Certainly, we should try to avoid getting embroiled in multiple conflicts. But remember, I mean, this is kind of the historic foreign policy of the United States, going back to 1945, is to try to preserve the peace in the key centers of global power, in Europe and East Asia and the Middle East. And so, I think we still have a vital role and indispensable role, as Madeline Albright said, in trying to uphold global order, and that's not always easy and sometimes dangerous. But I think the far greater danger would be to abandon our internationalist role and retreat into the kind of pre-Pearl Harbor isolationism that Donald Trump seems to advocate.",
