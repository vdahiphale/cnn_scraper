      "sentences": "Well, Boris, we understand that currently Reed is in Germany receiving medical treatment. We don't know exactly when or how he was injured. But we do know that he was transported to a local hospital in Kyiv before then being evacuated to an NGO to Germany. Now we don't know the same of this nongovernmental organization, and we don't know what Reed's condition is at this moment, whether his injuries are very serious or not.But we do know that this was not an operation, of course, carried out by the U.S. military, even though Trevor Reed is a former U.S. Marine. In fact, the U.S. is taking great pains to emphasize the fact that Reed was over in Ukraine on a personal endeavor. This is not any kind of U.S.-sponsored or government-sponsored operation. He was there as a private citizen. And the State Department reiterated today that U.S. citizens should not be going to Ukraine at all, let alone to participate in the fighting. Now Reed was released in a prisoner swap with a convicted Russian smuggler back in April 2022, after serving nearly three years in a Russian prison. And he has been mostly in the United States since that time. He was just on our air actually, as recently as May. And he's been tweeting, of course, in the last several weeks, most recently at the end of June. So it is not known when exactly he went to Ukraine. But look, the administration is obviously concerned about this. A U.S. official to tell us there are of course, ongoing considerations with regard to other hostages that are currently in Russian custody. And that it may not be the best look for Trevor Reed to have been fighting in Ukraine. So they are of course, concerned about how this could affect ongoing negotiations between the U.S. and Russia when it comes to other prisoners. The U.S. official emphasized to us though that, quote, this was something an individual did of their own volition and should be treated entirely separately from the negotiation for the release of Evan Gershkovich and Paul Whelan. Who are two American citizens currently being held by the Russians. So we're still waiting for an update, Boris, on Trevor Reed's condition. But we are told that currently he is in Germany receiving medical care -- Boris.",

Even though we said prosecutors in this case to ask for probation. So what we're seeing from Congressman Jason Smith -- he's the chair of the Ways and Means Committee -- is essentially an urging, a push to the judge to say, please take note of these political interference claims that we have heard from IRS whistleblowers.Here's what Smith said in his letter to the judge. He said: The committee member has been made aware that the defendant appears to have benefited from political interference which calls into question the propriety of the investigation of the U.S. Attorney's office. They go on to say: In interest of full transparency and fairness for all citizens, it's critical for the court to have this relevant information when evaluating the plea agreement. That would be a pretty extraordinary move to see the judge come out and this reject miss plea deal. But I think this is an effort by Republicans to sort of get their side of the story, the whistleblower side of the story, into the mix. Even though we've have seen David Weis, the U.S. attorney in this case, wrote a number of letters to The Hill, debunking a variety of the claims the IRS whistleblowers have made. Even saying he's willing to come up and testify in the next couple of months because he wants to set the record straight on a couple of these issues.

We know that it's time that we even have a seat at the table, that our family has a seat at the table.

It looks like it's just routine city maintenance, right? They're installing a camera up there because there is going to be 24-hour police presence at this home for some time. They do not want this home disturbed at all.And the district attorney, as he was talking about what was collected, he used words like just an immense amount of items were collected. And then he said that they have to be catalogued and then they have to be analyzed. And they're going into the hands of the task force. But beyond that the forensic experts really have to get involved to test this evidence. He said they're looking for trace evidence. They're looking for DNA. They're looking for hairs out of that home. And that they collected everything. It was very cluttered home, they said. Because there was so much that they had to look at. Now as far as the backyard, he said there was sonar and they did that work. But they didn't find anything. But he did say that there needs to be an analysis of trace evidence from that search. So -- and then they kept asking about the vault -- reporters kept asking. You know, what did you find in the vault? Well for the first time it was confirmed 279 firearms were found. But that is not necessarily the cause of death. It's homicidal violence and these were remains that were found. But he said there were other things in the vault that were collected in the basement. But he wouldn't say what. Now I asked the question about Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who is the fourth victim of the Gilgo four. He has not been charged with her murder.
