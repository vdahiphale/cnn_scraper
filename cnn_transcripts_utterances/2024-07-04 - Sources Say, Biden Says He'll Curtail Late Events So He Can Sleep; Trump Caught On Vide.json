ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: That's exactly right, Pamela. They want all of the chaos surrounding Joe Biden after the fallout from his poor debate, poor performance last week, as well as the questions over whether he should ultimately step aside to be the story right now. And so you're exactly right, Donald Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet this week, and that is intentional. His team has told us that they want him to lay low. He's been at his club in New Jersey at Bedminster all week. However, we did actually hear him on a new video that was first leaked to the Daily Beast and then Donald Trump himself actually posted it to his own Truth Social page, where he was sharply criticizing both President Biden as well as Vice President Kamala Harris.

He knows when a lane has closed. I'm not saying it has, but he is at the moment of recognizing, and we've heard little bits of that over the last couple of days, as he said to an ally that the next few days are crucial, that tomorrow's interview is essential. The public events he does are essential. But if they don't turn the tide, then these pressures are going to remain.

We've got a long way. We're all part of that long chain of patriots that stretches back to our nation's founding, that's given life to the very idea of America.On this day, I think it's important we remember, America is unique in -- all every president says this about their country, but we're unique in the world for a lot of reasons. But the one main reason is we're the only nation on Earth founded on an idea, not ethnicity, not geography, not anything else, on an idea, the idea is contained in that we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men and women are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights. We mean it. We've never fully lived up to it but we've never, ever, ever walked away from it, and it's because of you. As your commander-in-chief, along with the vice president and the secretary of defense, I want to thank you for your service and your sacrifice. Let me close with this. Last month, Jill and I traveled to Normandy, France, to commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day. We met with American veterans, some of them about 12 or 14, over 102 years old, veterans who toured the battlegrounds, went to the cemeteries, and looked at what has happened. [18:20:08] There should be no question, no question about it, all those who served as members of the military were heroes, genuine heroes, heroes for freedom, democracy and America. Look now, decades later, we have to look at ourselves and ask the question, will we stand for freedom again? Will we stand for democracy? Will we stand together as Americans? I believe we will, and we can. And, by the way, you know, I was in that World War I cemetery in France, and the one that my -- one of our colleagues, a former president didn't want to go and be up there. I probably shouldn't even say it. Anyway, we got to just remember who the hell we are. We're the United States of America. And there's nothing, nothing beyond, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, there's nothing beyond our capacity, nothing, when we do it together, not a single thing. We're the only nation in the history of the world that has gone through every crisis and come out stronger than we went into the crisis, every single time. And, by the way, I've been all over the world with you. I've been in and out of battles. Anyway, you're incredible. Understand, you are the finest fighting force in the history of the world. That's not hyperbole. In the history of the world, there's never been another military as powerful, as decent, and as giving as our military. I'm so damn proud to be your commander-in-chief.

Let's see, after he said -- it says after Governor Josh Green of Hawaii, a physician, asked Mr. Biden a question about the status of his health, Mr. Biden replied that his health was fine. It's just my brain. He added, according to three people familiar with what took place, a remark that some in the room took as a joke, but at least one governor did not, and was puzzled by. Jen O'Malley Dillon, Mr. Biden's campaign chair, who attended the meeting, said in a statement that he had said, all kidding aside, a recollection confirmed by another person briefed on the meeting. So, she also said he was clearly making a joke.How did you take it? What was the vibe in the room when he said, it's just my brain? Just help give us some color of what was going on.

You know, the difference is Joe Biden makes a self-deprecating joke because he's comfortable about that, as opposed to what we would hear from the former president, who would probably be saying things like Trump's brain is great, Trump can pass any test, Trump's brain passed the MRI scan in the third person.I mean, Biden was just kidding with us. And, frankly, and this is -- I'm saying this as a physician, it is a significant ability to cognitively still be able to make a self-deprecating joke. So, if anything, people do need to lighten up. Now, I know that the whole country is panicked, especially Democrats. At the end of the day, if President Biden decides not to run, it'll be his choice and Jill's choice. But, you know, for me, I got to witness the president very up close because we had this disaster on Maui 331 days ago. And he was right there by our side. He walked Front Street. He greeted 300 Hawaii residents, hugged every one of them. You know, the entire country, including the Republican governors, called me to offer support. And there was one individual in America who went off and that was Donald Trump. And he sent some kind of hateful message to me in the state, as we were recovering from a fire that took 102 loved ones. So, you've got President Biden who came and embraced us, and within six hours helped us heal with a major disaster declaration. And then you've got the one individual amongst the whole planet who attacked us. And so, look, my heart is with Joe and if he tells us he's not up to running, then it's his choice. But we have a very clear choice in America, which is a really good hearted human being with a great vice president, or we've got someone who is somewhat awful, frankly. And so I hope that people look beyond the surface, because Joe's going to slip up periodically in the next couple weeks or months, but the actual humans underneath the surface are very different. And I would ask Republicans and independents and Democrats to look beneath the surface, because that's what's necessary to guide this country on every decision.",
