So that's a really good way of doing that.And here's what they found in this huge study. They found that folks who were on the low side of hydration who weren't giving enough, they were had a 21 percent increased risk of premature death, and an up to 64 percent increased risk of heart failure, diabetes, dementia, increased risk of all sorts of other things as well.
