And we begin this hour with this breaking news. Donald Trump just announced that he is now not going to testify at his New York civil trial tomorrow. Just moments ago on a long rambling Truth Social sentiment, Trump said, quote, \"I have already testified to everything and have nothing more to say other than that this is a complete and total election interference, Biden campaign witch hunt, that will do nothing but keep businesses out of New York. I will not be testifying on Monday.\" That from the former president. So for days, though, Trump had vowed that he would be retaking the witness stand tomorrow in the high- stakes trial that threatens his real estate business. New York Attorney General Letitia James is suing Trump for $250 million and seeking to bar him from doing business in the state. CNN's Zachary Cohen joining us now.

He goes on to continue to attack the prosecutors and the judge in this case, calling it election interference, witch hunt, some familiar terms, and familiar attacks that we've seen from Trump, not only in this case but in others.But I want to play some sound from Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, from just the other day when she said that lawyers had advised Trump not to take the stand again, but that he was adamant about doing so anyway.

So sort of making the rounds of Washington to try and make the case that continued American investment in Ukraine is necessary, and certainly his challenge will be to try and convince some skeptical Republicans that this additional $60 billion that President Biden has requested can make a difference on the battlefield, when so far in this counteroffensive, Ukraine has not necessarily been able to change the battle lines significantly. But certainly, these talks have not really yielded progress so far.

That sounds like a lot, and it is, but it's actually lower than the average that we have seen since that pause broke down some nine days ago.There was a strike on a house today that killed some 45 civilians, that's according to the WAFA Palestinian news agency. So when Israel says that they are striking terror targets, you know, locals in Gaza say that so many of those targets, those buildings being struck, actually are civilian buildings, whether they're schools or mosques or homes. There were also dozens of people killed, according to local reports, as the Israeli forces have been pushing south towards the city of Khan Younis. That's where the IDF has been trying to encircle the city. They say they have broken through defensive lines in and around the city. And that is where they believe that several top Hamas officials are and may be underground. The Israelis have also told residents and civilians of Khan Younis to flee even farther south. Many of them had come from the north and went to Khan Younis. There was an urgent appeal that was issued on Saturday for specific areas of Khan Younis and then the people there to leave to go towards the southwest, toward the coast where Israel says that they will be more safe and where there are established shelters. We asked the IDF what those shelters are. It's still not clear, but you have hundreds of thousands of people who are now fleeing to the southernmost tip of Gaza, around the city of Rafah, and the shelters that there are simply bursting at the seams and overflowing. A lot of people sleeping outside. It's an extraordinarily dire situation -- Fred.",

And we've seen Donald Trump use this strategy before. He's trying to move the attention off of him and reshape the narrative to make it seem like his opponents are the ones who are actually doing this. Of course, there is no evidence that the White House has any involvement in the indictments that Donald Trump is facing.But, look, you know, in my conversations with Republicans and those close to the former president, they do admit that there is a concern that his amped up rhetoric on this and continuing to talk about being a threat to democracy could actually hurt him. And especially if he were to win the nomination and go on to compete in the general election. How this would play with independent voters and voters in the general is something that they don't know. And so there is a concern around this. But there's a couple other things that I think are worth pointing out. One is that I think we need to be very clear about what Donald Trump has been doing and saying himself. He's publicly said both on the trail as well as in interviews that he would use the Justice Department if re-elected to go after his political enemies and that he wants to move the DOJ underneath presidential control, and effectively give the executive branch a lot more power. But another thing that's also very interesting is what this is doing for Democrats. By Donald Trump continuing to talk about this, he's effectively giving Democrats and President Joe Biden an opening to attack him on this because one of the big things that they have been trying to do is not only try to paint the general election as a rematch between Trump and Biden, but they also want to make it a choice between authoritarianism and democracy. And so when Donald Trump continues to talk about this and say again that he would be a dictator on day one, that's just giving Democrats more of an opening to continue with that narrative.",

The petition says, quoting now, we, the undersigned faculty urge you in the strongest possible terms to defend the independence of the university, and to resist political pressures that are at odds with Harvard's commitment to academic freedom, including calls for the removal of president Claudine Gay, end quote.A source tells CNN a scheduled meeting of Harvard's governing board is happening on campus today, adding, it's not an emergency meeting. Gay has since apologized for how she answered questions about whether calling for the genocide of Jews would violate Harvard's rules. And today, Elon Musk, a loud in notorious conspiracy theorists back on to X. Alex Jones, now owes a billion dollars to victims of the Sandy Hook shooting for spreading the lie that the mass murder of first graders was a hoax, well, today, Musk posted an informal poll on Jones's return, saying the people have spoken, and so it shall be.

Musk explain his position at the time by citing the death of his own first born child, saying of Jones that Musk had no mercy for anyone who would use the deaths of the deaths of children for again, politics, or fame.Jones, of course, was removed from Twitter in 2018, for violating its policy against abusive behavior. But Musk appears to have been swayed by a right leaning pressure campaign in recent days that was advocating for Jones's return. Musk posted that poll yesterday. And about 70 percent of the 2 million respondents voted in favor of bringing Jones back. And I will say, Fredricka, that Musk didn't just bring back Alex Jones, he actually elevated his profile today, by engaging in a livestream interview with him on the platform. And, this really seems to be in line with Musk's increasing promotion of fringe and extreme views on the platform, Fredricka.",

Musk, in recent weeks, has promoted an antisemitic conspiracy theory, which he later apologized for. But he's also promoted the dangerous pizzagate conspiracy theory, which emerged it ahead of the 2016 presidential election.And so, it's hard to see how bring back Alex Jones is going to help, advertisers want to return to this platform, which is really crucial, because advertising is X's core revenue base.
