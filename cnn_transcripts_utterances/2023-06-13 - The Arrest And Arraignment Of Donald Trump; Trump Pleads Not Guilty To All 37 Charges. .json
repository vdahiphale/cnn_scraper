I mean, he also was just really sitting at the counsel table and he's quite much shorter than Trump himself, as well as his own attorney, Stanley Woodward, who was the person that was there representing Walt Nauta in the court. But a lot of the proceedings, that was not as much of a moment in court. And it took up far less of the time than the discussions around Donald Trump and particularly his bond.So they didn't even read through the charges themselves. That's something that doesn't happen when you have a long indictment like this. They didn't walk through page by page and the judge said it would take us a while if we did. So, Nauta had to sit and wait for several minutes, more than half an hour, for the proceedings to progress through the focus of being on Donald Trump. His attorney was clearly aware that there were going to be things applying to him as they're discussing these release conditions, who Trump could talk to. And the judge did acknowledge that Walt Nauta works for Donald Trump. He works for him every day. And so having a situation where the two of them can only be -- cannot discuss anything at all and could only communicate through their attorneys would be quite difficult.",

I mean, it is more than a dozen of those people plus court marshals from the U.S. Marshal Service, courtroom security officers, courtroom deputies.

And they're unlikely to be successful, but they maybe successful in at least delaying this. I think the goal is to delay this case, at least beyond the election. Obviously, special counsel Jack Smith has said he wants a speedy trial, and he believes this will last about three weeks, so about a month approximately. But it's unclear how they would get that done before the election, before they would run into sort of the time where you're not supposed to really do anything that could potentially interfere with the election.Once again I think we're going to be raising some unprecedented constitutional questions there, but they're going to try to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. As I said, they're likely going to want to litigate every question about privilege before Judge Cannon and even if they're not successful, even if they're not going to win on the merits, they're just going to throw everything to try to delay this as long as they can. That's always the strategy with Trump as you know, but I think the goal right now for him is to try to get back in the White House so he could either try to have this case dismissed, right, try to have his attorney general fire the special counsel and then dismiss this or potentially pardon himself. Once again, those would be completely unprecedented issues. That would likely go before the Supreme Court. But as per usual, Trump right now, the number one strategy is to delay and the other thing is to keep Walt Nauta as close as humanly possible.",

And, Dana Bash, one of the things that we want to keep in mind, as we watch this motorcade leave the courtroom, is that in all likelihood, this is just the second of four indictments we will see Donald Trump facing. The next two we expect will be for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. One specific prosecution in Georgia, that we expect.

Again, to talk about the former president's demeanor, to have the reality, clearly set in, like it did in New York. But there's no question that this feels different, it has to feel different to him.

To a point that Abby has made a couple times -- if you want to see whether Donald Trump brought this on himself, it is demonstrably provable from this indictment because all the documents that Donald Trump turned back over to the archives, even after months of negotiation, none of them are the basis for the criminal charges he faces. These are all based on documents that Trump continue to withhold for months and months, and were only recovered through the subpoena and through a search warrant. So, those are the first 31 charges, each of which, on its own, is very serious.We know from the indictment, they relate to our nuclear programs, our military vulnerabilities, our allies, our retaliatory abilities. Now, the other six charges in this case, and Nauta in this case, which is one extra, seventh charge on Nauta because he lied to the FBI. Those all go to obstruction. And the crux of that is that Donald Trump lied to DOJ. He lied to the FBI, he lied to the grand jury through his lawyers, by misleading his lawyers, by hiding boxes of documents from his lawyers, caused his lawyers to lie to those entities, which, this -- the obstruction charges should not be a footnote here because these go to the heart of our criminal justice process. These go to the integrity of what we do. When you try to mess with the rules of the game, that's very serious as well.

This is not an \"oops, I possessed it\" or \"I possessed it and didn't realize that I had them\". You know, everybody else who have them, turned them over right away as soon as they realize it. What Donald Trump did here was not only did he have them, not only did he intentionally keep them, have them, he recklessly stored them, and these are documents that have to do with defense and weapons capabilities of the United States and foreign countries, the nuclear programs, the United States vulnerabilities. You know, just putting people at risk all over the world. That those documents were just stored in a way that were just moved from place to place, everybody had access to them. And even more significantly than that, there are a couple of paragraphs in the indictment where he talked -- they talked about in two separate instances in Bedminster -- in his club at Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is actually waving the documents around, bragging about them, and in one of them showed a map to someone in his political action committee, a map related to military operations and bragging about how he still is possessing these documents. And so, he has them, he knows how serious they are. He's reckless with them. And he's showing them to people, and then when the justice department asks for them back, he moves them so that they can't be found. He asks his lawyers to -- to get rid of them, pluck them out and so they don't get found. I mean, this is a man who is trying to get away with -- get away with committing a very, very serious crime.",

I want this stain on my reputation removed. So, we will wait and see what Donald Trump does. I think he'll try and postpone it to after the 2024 election.
