On Friday, a law enforcement official said police found the backpack they think the gunman wore during the shooting. It's now at a forensic lab where it's being analyzed for more evidence. Investigators are also telling \"The New York Times\" the gunman may have used a so-called veterinary gun to kill Thompson. The weapon is used to put down animals and it creates less noise than many other firearms. As CNN's Omar Jimenez reports, police believe the suspect is no longer in New York. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
