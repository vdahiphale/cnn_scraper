But again, they're going in. I think there are various options to move the civilians around whether it's back up North further to the southeast.I'm surprised there's been no international pressure by the way on Egypt to open up the border area and create a safe zone a sanctuary for the Gazans while they wait out the Israeli offensive. But look clearly this is going to happen. I suspect as Ramadan ends in a couple weeks. It will further divide Washington and Tel Aviv and there's going to be a really, really tough time for us Israeli relations coming up. And it's going to impact domestic politics as well, both here in the United States and in Israel also. Keep in mind that the Israeli population poll by poll shows they want two thinks. One is the return of the hostages immediately. And secondly, they never want October 7th to happen again, and they believe defeating Hamas is critical to doing that.",

That interpreter is accused of stealing millions of dollars andplacing bets with a former bookie under federal investigation. The bookie has also claimed -- and this is key -- that Ohtani was not involved or aware of the betting. CNN's Nick Watt is at Dodger Stadium for us. So, Nick, when do we expect to hear from Ohtani?",

      "sentences": "Well, you know, Boris, first of all, let's just get a little bit of context here. This guy Ohtani is a unicorn in this game. He just came to the Dodgers on a 10 year, $700 million deal. He's 29. He's already being spoken about as one of the all time greats of the game. And in an MLB survey of current players, two thirds of them said that he's the best player right now.So that's the context. He is going to speak 2:45 local 5:45 Eastern. We've been told it's just going to be a statement. No questions. Let's see what happens. The only inkling we've got was from Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, who said, quote, I'm happy he's going to speak and that he'll address what he knows and his thoughts. And another quote from Roberts. I think it'll give us a bit more clarity. Clarity is needed here because right now there's a lot of confusion. This story started last Tuesday when Ippei Mizuhara, the interpreter, told ESPN that Shohei Ohtani had paid off his -- Mizuhara's gambling debt and that Ohtani definitely had never gambled at all. A little while later, Ohtani's camp then, quote, disavowed all of that and said that Ohtani had in fact been the victim of, quote, a massive theft. And they were handing the case over to authorities. Now, Major League Baseball say that since the allegations, they are, quote, gathering information about the allegations involving, they say, Shohei Ohtani and Ippei Mizuhara. The IRS Criminal Investigations Division, they confirmed to me that they are investigating the interpreter. No mention of Shohei Ohtani, the interpreter, and this one time bookie down in Orange County just south of here. Now, that bookie, Matthew Bowyer, had apparently been telling people that Shohei Ohtani was his client. Over the weekend, I spoke on Zoom with Bowyer's lawyer, Diane Bass, about that. Take a listen to what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And she also points out her client has not actually been charged with anything. She said that Mizuhara bet on soccer, a little bit of football, never baseball. And she said he was basically a very bad gambler. Hence, this huge debt that Ohtani allegedly paid off. Now, there's a game tonight against the Angels here at Dodger Stadium, opening day Thursday.

And once again, it might be up to them to decide whether they are going to save or sink the Republican speaker.Now, his fate may be tied on how he handles Ukraine aid because Democrats have said that they are not going to just save him for free and they want a clear commitment on Ukraine aid. He has said that he would address this issue after this two week recess, but he has not said exactly how he would plan to do that. One of the options he has is putting that massive Senate passed Ukraine aid package, which also has aid for Israel and Taiwan on the House floor. Now that would almost certainly trigger a revolt from the right flank and force Marjorie Taylor Greene to go through with the motion to vacate. But we are told that a massive amount of Democrats would likely save Johnson if that were the case. Another option that Johnson has is to put forward a more narrow proposal, a bipartisan proposal that's currently being worked on in the House that might not trigger the right wing revolts, but it could. And in that case, there are still some Democrats who still might want to step in and save Johnson. But all of it is a reminder of just how much his fate right now is tied to how he handles Ukraine. Just take a listen to what Chip Roy, a Republican congressman, told our colleague Jake Tapper yesterday when asked about the motion to vacate. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. CHIP ROY (R-TX): I oppose the use of the motion to vacate against Kevin McCarthy very openly and very loudly against my right flank colleagues and everybody across the entire body. I disagreed with it. It was a mistake. Kevin was actually honoring most of the agreement that we came up with. We were actually having bills that we had 72 hours to read. You know what? That got violated this last week. Mike was wrong. I can promise you if you put a Ukraine bill on the floor and you haven't secured the border, there's going to be a problem within the within the ranks and on Capitol Hill. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, this is an operation that is run by the Ministry of State Security. This is associated with the Civilian Intelligence Agency for the Chinese and pretty much runs the gamut, right. From defense organizations or defense companies in the United States, people from inside the government, the Justice Department, Commerce, Treasury, State Department people were targeted, senators, representatives, election campaign people. And in the U.K., they also announced that they had found that the same group, something that the West calls the APT 13, this is the outfit that they refer to, was also responsible for infiltrating the U.K. elections agency and their organization. There is no indication that they did anything to change voting results or anything. But obviously that raises the huge concerns, you know, certainly here or elsewhere, whenever you have election systems being breached, it's a perennial concern. The other thing that this group was also doing was to target organizations, anybody associated with dissidents, anything that is criticizing the Chinese government, for reference, for example, Tiananmen Square, anything like that, they were going after in Norway, for instance. So this was a full-on organization. Seven people have been indicted. It's not clear whether they'll ever see the inside of a U.S. courtroom, but it is something that the U.S. does to sort of what they call name and shame, so that they can tell the Chinese, look, we know what you've been doing, and we want you to stop it.",
