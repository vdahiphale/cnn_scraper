We'll have all the details on what we can expect in terms of the issues and how Donald Trump and Joe Biden have been preparing. Also the Supreme Court set to release opinions on a variety of cases. We're still waiting on a presidential immunity ruling and we may have had a sneak peek at one important ruling on abortion. It is 9 am in the U.S. Capitol. It's 5 pm here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson. You're watching \"Connect the World\" also happening this hour angry protesters on the streets of Nairobi, Kenya and the leader of an attempted coup in custody in Bolivia. Let's get you look at the stock markets which will open about 30 minutes from now and if the futures are any indication, it is a pretty weak mixed not if the opening on those markets so keep an eye on them back at those at half past this hour. Well, the stakes are high as U.S. President Joe Biden and Donald Trump take to the stage in the coming hours for CNN's Presidential Debate in Atlanta, Georgia. It is an historic event. The first time a sitting U.S. President and a former president face off in a debate. CNN's latest poll of polls shows no clear leader in the 2024 race, underscoring just how critical it'll be for both men to make their case for a second term in the White House as they debate on CNN's stage. Let's bring in our Jeff Zeleny joining us now from Atlanta. Good to have you. Let's set the stage for our viewers. Biden, as I understand it chose to be on the right podium after winning the coin toss that of course allows Donald Trump to have the final word in closing statements just explain the choreography Jeff, the rules and what viewers can expect later today? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well Becky, this is the biggest moment of the presidential campaign so far aside from the decision for both of these men to seek re-election which is history making in its own right. But perhaps the biggest change from debates gone by will be there is no live audience. There is no studio audience of supporters to applaud or listen, it is simply the candidates, no advisors, and it is the two moderators. That is going to be how the two candidates are seeing this tonight. There'll be in our studios here in Atlanta, as you said, and they've not been in the same room for four years since the debates in the fall of 2020. Of course, so much has changed since then. Back then it was all about the Coronavirus pandemic, and the Trump administration's record and their handling of it. This time, of course, it is President Biden's record that center stage on inflation on the economy on immigration on world affairs. So certainly a different moment in every respect another sort of stage detail the microphones will only be working when the candidate speaking has the floor. So there will be not as many opportunities for interruptions that we've seen in previous debates between these two men who have so much acrimony between them.",

And we are expecting this to be quite historic. Good to have you, Jeff always a pleasure thank you, sir. We are anticipating a big day at the U.S. Supreme Court with another set of key rulings due next hour and it is expected that the court will announce one of its biggest decisions of the term after it was accidentally revealed for a short time on the courts website. On Wednesday the case involves an Idaho law that denies emergency room abortions to women whose health is in danger. The document, first reported by Bloomberg News indicates that the court ruled 6-3 that the law cannot be enforced, while a legal challenge makes its way through lower courts. And one of the liberal Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote the decision is not a victory for pregnant patients in Idaho. It is a delay. Well, Corey Brettschneider is Professor of Political Science at Brown University joins me from New York at this point. What more does this leaked document? Tell us about this Idaho case? Everyone seems to agree that this is kicking the can down the road. And the Justice writing quote, Alito writing quote this, that question is as ripe for decision as it ever will be apparently, the court has simply lost the will to decide the easy but emotional and highly politicized question that the case presents that is regrettable, your thoughts?",

So now the question is by the Biden Administration, can we revive the right to an abortion and they've come up with frankly, legally a pretty brilliant argument. The idea is and it frames the issue as one of healthcare. We have a federal law in the United States that requires and guarantees access to health care, including life-saving health care, and to the extent that the state law limits abortion and denies that health care, the argument is, federal law is supreme and federal law trumps. As you said, the Supreme Court has not decided the issue. It looks like from this leaked document that leaves that they're sending it back for more legal proceedings by the lower courts.",

And conservatives saying what are you talking about? We already decided the Dobbs opinion, there's no federal right to an abortion. So it's just a matter to be left to the states. So when you have a conflict like that, and a highly contentious issue, and the court is not immune to the facts of the moment, which is that, we're in the midst of a presidential debate. They're trying I think, partly not to make this an issue and they are making a decision so it's sending it back to the lower courts for more review by some time.

But even if Pezeshkian wins, let's say with a 60 percent participation, 65 percent participation, it's not as easy for him to basically open the doors completely. He has to get approval for his cabinet and work with a very hardline parliament. There are many ways in which the system can block him.

Well, there will be some important differences tonight from previous debate CNN's Phil Mattingly and Victor Blackwell have the details for you. PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF U.S. DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: Welcome to the set of the CNN Presidential Debate. We want to give our viewers a sense of the rules of the debate so that when they watch it, they can understand how President Biden and President Trump will be engaging with each other. Just after 9 pm Eastern President Biden will enter from the right side of your screen, President Trump will enter from the left side of your screen. The podiums are eight feet apart directly across from them the moderators CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Now, a reminder, this is a television studio there's no audience. Candidates will have two minutes to answer questions and one minute for responses and rebuttals. At the moderators discretion there may be an additional minute for follow ups, clarifications or responses. So how does the candidate know how much time is left to speak? Attached to the cameras in the studio and in the candidate's field of view are the timing lights. When the lights show yellow, there are 15 seconds left in a candidate's answer or response. When the lights flash red, there are five seconds left. And when the display is solid red, the time is up. At that point the candidate's microphone will be turned off, and the other candidate will have their microphone turned on. My colleague Victor Blackwell has more on that.",

Now I want to give you a sense of what it will look like for viewers at home if a candidate whose microphone is off interrupts a candidate whose microphone is on. So I'm standing at one podium, and I'll ask Phil to come in and take the other podium. And so let's say I'm answering a question. My light is green and I'm speaking Phil's microphone is off and his green lights are not illuminated. He's going to interrupt me as I'm speaking and this is what it will sound like my volume remains constant while Phil's interruption can be difficult to understand.",

The stakes in this debate are absolutely massive. These are issues that are very important not just to Americans, but will reverberate around the world because a Donald Trump lead United States that would probably be more volatile and unpredictable than it was in his first term could have huge consequences for the U.S. posture in the world, the way it interacts with its allies, and even its enemies.

There could have been changes. We don't know. But it sounds like the court is afraid that there was a leak or anything like that, that it was inadvertently put out there. So what did they say? Well, this case was struck down if that decision is accurate, what we saw yesterday, and that's the final decision, because the court said it was improvidently granted for the Supreme Court to become involved at that time. So that means in Idaho relating to this specific law, emergency room care for conditions other than when a mother's life is at risk. So when her health is at risk is available to them. So emergency room doctors can provide that care. If this is the decision, it did not answer the bigger question about whether or not a federal law relating to emergency room care is going to apply across the country. So because the court was saying we really shouldn't have taken this up at this time. It's a good result for that Idaho case relating to emergency room care for the Biden Administration. But it does not answer the bigger question that needs clarification for doctors to act nationwide. So it's kind of a narrow decision.",
