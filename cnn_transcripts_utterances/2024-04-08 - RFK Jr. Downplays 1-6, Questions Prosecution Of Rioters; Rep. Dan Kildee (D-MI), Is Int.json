We are sort of learning more about what exactly Kennedy thinks about what happened that day.After his campaign sent out fundraising e-mails last week referencing January 6th activists, Kennedy was essentially forced to put out this statement on Friday clarifying his stance, quote, I have not examined the evidence in detail, but reasonable people, including Trump opponents, tell me there is little evidence of a true insurrection. They observed that the protesters carried no weapons had no plans or ability to seize the reins of government and that Trump himself had urged them to protest peacefully. Kennedy later retracted the claim that there were no weapons there that day. You can see here that is quite obviously not true. Kennedy also -- appoint a special counsel if elected president to investigate the prosecution of January 6th defendants writing that, quote, political objectives, and quote, may be at play. Former Capitol Police Sergeant Aquilino Gonell joins our panel now to talk more about this. Sir, thank you very much for being here. SGT. AQUILINO GONELL, FMR.

And they have gone through the court system and found guilty in by the judge and by their peers. And that's one of the reasons why I continue to go to court.

I mean the fact that it really does feel like this is how he actually feels. And, you know, he has done this in a couple of different places. He'll say one thing, when he's speaking to friendlier audiences or places where he's not being challenged, that seems to be his two views. He's done this on vaccines. And then when he is coming under more mainstream scrutiny, he tried to do this to me. He tried to say I never said that a vaccine was not safe and effective. Obviously, that wasn't true. It seems like the same thing is going on here. Why is it that Kennedy is where he actually is, it seems to be on January 6th, and then trying to clean it up. MATT GORMAN, FMR. SENIOR ADVISER TO TIM SCOTT'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: A couple of things, Kennedy is doing, as well as any third party candidate has since Ross Perot in '96. I think people don't talk about that enough. He's on the ballot in Arizona, which is I won't say a must win for Biden, but it's close. And so he has real electoral consequences here. And I think what we often talk about is the horseshoe theory of politics, where people on kind of the far left and the far right, often kind of meet and share a lot of similar views. You talk to a lot of folks in 2016, you'd ask them who their first choice was, either they say Bernie or Trump, and their second choice was the other one. So there's a lot more ideological similarity. And I think, whether it's the right and the left and some of these outer edges. But you're right, I remember that interview very well. And, you know, he does try to have it both ways. And yes, this seems to be one of those times.",

And it's not that surprising, I think, to hear him, you know, retconning the history of January 6th, seeking alternative explanations, believing that what we've been told, you know, in the media and what's actually factual, believing that there's something else going on and that we're being sort of lied to by the elites.

So this town has about 25,000 people. That's the population according to the mayor. But they're expecting the crowds to be 75,000 or 100,000. And so this town is preparing. But here's what makes it so special. I want you to look at this map from NASA, you can see that there's an X on the map. One of these paths of totality that's from an annular eclipse that happened in October. The other path of totality is for today's eclipse. And you see that there's an X. Well guess where Kerrville is, right in the center of that X. That's why people think that there is just something special about this location, and that there's going to be special energy. I'm kind of getting goosebumps right now. One of the businesses in town that's buzzing with people is a business called Zen and Alchemy, and we have video of it. They have merchandise, earrings, they have glasses. But one of the things that people go there to see is if they can get healing, or pre-eclipse alignment of the body and mind. So we asked him about to worry about the weather because everyone's worried. Are we going to be able to see the eclipse even though X marks the spot and this is supposed to be amazing? Will we see it or not? The good news is this is what we heard at Zen and Alchemy. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
