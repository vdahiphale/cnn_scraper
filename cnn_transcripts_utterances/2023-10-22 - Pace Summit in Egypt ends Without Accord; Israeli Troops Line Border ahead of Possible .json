Israeli military says its bombardment of Hamas targets will become even more relentless going forward ahead of an incursion.Authorities in Gaza say more than 4300 Palestinians have been killed in the past two weeks after the Hamas terror attack in Israel, which killed more than 1400 people with around 200 others missing or captured. Hundreds of armored vehicles along with thousands of Israeli troops are now poised to strike at Hamas at a moment's notice. On Saturday, the IDF Chief of Staff again repeated what they've heard all week that we will enter Gaza. An IDF Spokesperson told CNN it's not a question of if, at this point, only when. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF SPOKESPERSON: The timeline, you know that changes according to many variables on the ground in the air and across the sea. The important thing is that the IDF will conduct significant military operations in order to defeat Hamas in order to bring our hostages home. And in order to fundamentally change the security situation that we have in Southern Israel and frankly, all of Israel. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And also because it also, it's been dropping flyers on one southern neighborhood of the Gaza Strip telling residents that if they don't evacuate that they might be considered a partner to the terrorist organization, a reference to Hamas. We've seen this buildup of troops more than 350,000 reservists called up there are hundreds of tanks there. And now you've got the Chief of the General Staff telling troops there in no uncertain terms that they will be going into the Gaza Strip. So it really is just a question of timing. But that timing does now seem to be very, very close by. But of course, we've been discussing this all week as well, for the past two weeks that a ground invasion is not going to be simple, not just because of the risk to Israeli troops both to their lives and for the possibility of them being taken hostage. But also because of course the risks for very large numbers of civilian casualties. And of course, the labyrinth complex of tunnels that Hamas maintains underground and tower blocks there. It's a very risky operation. But it's one that Israel feels that it has to do in order to achieve its objectives of destroying Hamas militarily. And also trying to get its hostages back there are at least 200 people being held by a Hamas more than a missing as well by Hamas and other militant groups. And Israel wants to get them back as well so very complex operation and one that now seems not just inevitable, but imminent as well, Lynda.",

Generally, many of them seem to be dug by hand, relatively small, and then they're reinforced with concrete so they can't easily be collapsed.How big is this network? Well, think about this, Gaza itself is only about 25 by 6 miles. And yet the indication from some experts is there may be more than 300 miles of tunnels underneath that. The depth unknown maybe it is a few meters, maybe it's a whole lot more and many of them appear fairly cramped. Possible uses well hiding command centers, weapons caches, rocketry, and yes, maybe even hostages, secret movement of key Hamas figures. So they might be in this part of the area and go to this part of the area and be undetected because they can't be spied by satellites or people who are trying to look with drones or anything else. And they would represent a safe place in this small area relatively safe, and that a lot of conventional weapons would not easily penetrate this. But in fact, you might have to bring in bigger sort of bunker buster bombs, if somebody really wanted to be able to go through the reinforcement and all of that Earth to get underneath but that's why this is the focus not only for Hamas, but for the Israelis too.",

So that families have food on the table, it basically has been propping up the Gaza economy on a monthly basis. And so that, you know, has been OK with Israel, United States, the Palestinian Authority and the PLO and Egypt and Jordan and everybody else. But I think at this point, any additional aid to Hamas takes on a very different tinge. And they give them a lot of support. Beyond that, they as I say they have almost all the political leadership of Hamas living there as close and trusted friends. That's a problem now. Good.

And when terrorist groups or insurgent groups do that, they're trying to provoke any emotional overreaction by the targeted power by the stronger dominant power.And to get them to inflict on themselves damage and a blow that the insurgent group would not be capable of doing. Think of 9/11 how it provoked the United States into irrationally attacking Iraq, a country that had nothing to do with 9/11. But it was a blow against American prestige interests, sense everything. That continues to reverberate to this day, we did much more damage to ourselves that will -- that could have by stupidly invading Iraq. So I think Hamas is trying to get Israel to make that mistake, come in on the ground and engage in the kind of close quarters, house does combat that really favors guerrillas and militia groups, not regular armies. And ideally, they would like Israeli troops to stay and say, well, we're not we have to run this place. And Hamas is destroyed and everything. And they can then the remnants of Hamas can create an insurgency that at first is very small, maybe, but over time, gained steam, and momentum. And then they can start picking off Israeli soldiers, and capturing them and whatnot. All of this is a bid to gain control of the Palestinian national movement, and once and for all, get fatter into the margins, and to ultimately take over the PLO, with all of their missions all over the world and their U.N. presence, their U.N. observer state. So I think this is the plan. So far, I think it's been working brilliantly for Hamas. I'm sad to say, Israel goes in on the ground.

There are groups that, you know, have turned this into a business and northwest Africa, groups I'll tie it in the Islamic Maghreb, or in the Southern Philippines, the Abu Sayyaf Group or in South America FARC. They've turned this into a business over the years. Hamas is different. They are in some ways, the nationalistic group looking for the independence of Palestine, but they're also an Islamist group as well. So they are not rational actors, although they have some proficiency and experience in dealing with hostage matters. And they also know that their anchor point is you know if they took one Israeli soldier in 2006. Five years later, they had, you know, were able to get over 1000 Palestinian prisoners released. So that's what they're thinking. So now they have 210 hostages, and they are using this to their benefit, it's going to be very calculated, very deliberate on their part. So negotiating with them, through the Qatari is the real legitimate partner with an established track record with the United States. And the international community is the best approach right now.

If you're working on this particular negotiation to get them out, what would be the best way isn't negotiating with Hamas or is it a military rescue, because we know that Israel is ready to launch a ground incursion?O'LEARY: So unfortunately, it's both. So as soon as you know, this event happened, the hostage enterprise from Israel, which includes their special operations forces, who are extremely capable, their negotiators, their intelligence capabilities, started working on this problem, because there were Americans taken because there were other dual nationals taken. All of those capabilities also came from those countries. So the United States immediately deployed a team over there to work with Israel. Just a year ago, we did an exercise symposium with the Israelis discussing how we respond jointly to a complex hostage matter. And more recently, we've been working with the international community for what we've called a multilateral fused response. So if there was a complex hostage matter where there were Americans taken alongside British citizens alongside Qatari citizens, that we would fuse our response, synchronized our efforts in gathering intelligence in our negotiations, and our strategic narrative to the global community, and work on joint tactical resolution. But it's also synchronizing our efforts with the negotiations and I'll give you a one vignette. TWA 847 was a very famous and complex hostage incident in 1985, and it has hostages from a variety of countries. The Greek government negotiated directly with the Palestinian group that took the hostages, and they were able to secure the release of their citizens. The incident protracted for nearly three weeks and resulted in the death of a U.S. Navy Diver who was beaten and then shot and dumped on our tarmac and Beirut International Airport. So it is important when you have a complex matter like this to work together. And that's what we've been working on collectively for the last year.",
