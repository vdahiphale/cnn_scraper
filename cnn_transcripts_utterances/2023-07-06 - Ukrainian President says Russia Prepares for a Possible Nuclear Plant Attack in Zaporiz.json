Rescue teams are working right now to free people who are trapped in the rubble. At least seven have been rescued so far.Meanwhile Russian-backed officials in occupied Donetsk say Ukrainian attacks are causing chaos there. A missile strike in the Makiivka district apparently causing this huge fire at an oil depot. Ukraine says fighting is very, very hot around Donetsk and Luhansk. They're reporting dozens of combat engagements in the region. And Ukrainian fighters say they feel, quote, \"positive and optimistic about their progress around Bakhmut.\" They claim to have recaptured a number of territories and say they're causing huge losses to Russian forces. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia is preparing to launch a possible attack on the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant. He's accusing Russian forces of placing, quote \"objects resembling explosives on roofs around the facility.\" Ukrainian officials say they have procedures in place if anything happens, but the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency is urging caution, saying there are no visible indications of mines or explosives at the facility. Zelenskyy tells CNN's Erin Burnett why he's so certain in spite of the IAEA. Here it is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We heard from President Zelenskyy warning that Ukrainian intelligence suggests that explosive-like devices have been detected, identified on the Zaporizhzhya nuclear plant.President Zelenskyy in June in fact did say that the Ukrainian Armed Forces and military does believe that Russia is planning some sort of terrorist-like activity around the plant, potentially turning the plant itself into a weapon. So this is certainly a huge concern not only for Ukraine but for the international community overall with potential for a nuclear accident. These are allegations that the Kremlin has of course denied and has continued that denial of any sort of attack around the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, and we have heard from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, at this stage they say that they haven't detected any sort of explosives around the plant. However, they are asking for further access to the plant, namely to the plant's roof where this is where the Ukrainian intelligence suggests those explosives may be placed. So this is a significant concern but we've also heard from some analysts who have pointed to the fact that there is little military advantage to targeting the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant for the Russian armed forces and also the fact that this could actually have a greater impact on Russian-held territory in the east. But of course those warnings from the Ukrainian intelligence are stark and this is a huge concern for the international community.",

Beijing is not buying this whatsoever. Just this week, China retaliated by announcing that it would restrict the export of certain minerals critical for the production of semiconductor chips, solar cells and other tech products. On Monday, Janet Yellen met with the Chinese ambassador in Washington where they laid out the issues of concern. And the very next day, we heard from a spokesperson from the Chinese Foreign Ministry saying, quote, let me read it to you. \"We always believe that China-U.S. economic and trade cooperation is mutually beneficial in nature and hope that the U.S. can create a favorable environment for the sound development of China-U.S. economic and trade ties and win-win cooperation with concrete actions.\" At the end of the day, Kim, these are two economies deeply entwined. $700 billion, roughly in trade between China and the U.S. each year.

That includes DNA testing, fingerprint analysis, secret service officials I'm told are also going through visitor logs as well as security camera footage.This all started on Sunday evening when a white powdery substance was found inside a small dime-sized bag in one of the cubbies. These cubbies are used for visitors who come into the West Wing. That's where they drop their cell phones off. It's also used by White House officials before they go into a skiff to view classified information. They also would drop their cell phones in these types of cubbies. Now, the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, for her part, certainly left the impression that it could be a visitor who was going on a West Wing tour who left this bag of cocaine there. She talked about the fact that this is a highly-traveled area, that this is where visitors are brought in when they go on these West Wing tours. But when I asked her whether or not she could rule out that it was a White House official, she could not do that, saying she wouldn't speculate on who was doing this. She did express confidence in the Secret Service's investigation, but nonetheless, that federal law enforcement official telling me that they just don't know if they'll actually be able to identify who brought this baggie in. That's in part because of the number of people who would go through this West Wing entrance, and also because of how small that bag -- that was where the cocaine was, making it that much more difficult to identify fingerprints or potential DNA there, but this investigation is certainly ongoing at this hour.

Also the doctors who saved lives of these guys. And I congratulated the doctors with the Ukrainian Navy Day. And all of these doctors are from Sevastopol. And when the occupation of Crimea and Sevastopol happened, they escaped to the Ukrainian-controlled territories. They're all here. I also visited the Ukrainian Navy Institute, which used to be based in Crimea. So everyone shares the same feeling of definite victory, definite return to Crimea. I will tell you not as a president, but as a citizen. I used to adore Crimea even before I had become a president of Ukraine. Every year we visited Crimea with my family. We cannot imagine Ukraine without Crimea. And while Crimea is under the Russian occupation, it means only one thing. War is not over yet. BURNETT: To be clear, in victory, in peace, is there any scenario where Crimea is not part of Ukraine? ZELENSKYY (through translator): It will not be victory then, because this is what we're saying right in the beginning. Even before the full-scale invasion, we understood that it's purely a matter of time when the contact line in Donbas and Crimea would turn into a war. It could be anything. It could have been our de-occupation steps, or it could have been a full-scale invasion by the Russian Federation, which has happened. They have been planning to annihilate us completely straight from the start. It's a fact. Thank God that now, apart from ourselves, the majority of the world believes it too.

Is there anything that would change that speed dramatically? Is this something when you say F-16s are necessary or ATCMS are necessary, would that make a difference to those infantry walking through fields? ZELENSKYY (through translator): Today, we have got a different war. Not only people die. First and foremost, we need material to save human lives, and this material gives results. When we talk about ATACMS, they are very important because we can hit some long-distance targets without losing our people. The fact that Russia has advantage on the ground and has more long- range weaponry is one of the things, but ATACMS are very important. Will this accelerate our moving forward? Yes, 100 percent. Because in some directions, it will give us opportunities to start the counteroffensive. In some directions, we cannot even think of starting it as we don't have the relevant weapons and throwing our people to be killed by Russian long-range weapons would be simply inhumane. So we're not going to do it, and ATACMS is definitely our priority. We also have shortages in artillery. We cannot hit all the targets because of the absence of the quantity in our own artillery. We gather some units in the priority directions, but we cannot divide it between many. We lack quantity. This is a fact. As the F-16, I emphasized on it many times. It's not even about the Ukrainian advantage in the sky over the Russians. This is only about being equal. F-16s help not only those on the battlefield to move forward. It's simply very difficult without a cover from the air. We've got losses of lives and slowing down. However, let's look at F- 16s as a very important humanitarian mission. We've talked about it many times, the Grain Initiative. Erin, we are today in Odessa. The Grain Corridor, extremely important for the whole world, is happening just here. It's important for Africa, Asia, for the countries of Europe, et cetera. Today, if the Russians beginning to block this corridor, we don't have anything to answer this.

He will make everything in order to break and nullify the Wagnerites' fame and everything they were doing. He will be distancing himself from all that and will be communicating extensively in order to unify the society. His society is un-unified. Pay attention to this interesting example. After all these events, where did Putin go? I can tell you, he rarely comes out to the street. We see him in his offices, et cetera, but we never see him out and about. Where did he go? He leaves his bunker only when it's extremely needed. He went to the town of Durban, in the Dagestan Republic, if I'm not mistaken. The stats show that Putin's popularity is the lowest in Dagestan. A lot of locals died, whom he sent to the ward to die. And Prigozhin is very popular there. So he's behaving like a political animal. He goes to Dagestan.

Sometimes we see it quite clearly when he's talking about some towns or villages that they are under the Russian flag. But in reality, all of them are under the Ukrainian control.

So if somebody equals that, passes that, this is their thing, their moment. And I know nowadays it's especially media driven as well, also the player-driven. I was driven as well by trying to break records to equal records.But I think as you sit back, you have a totally different perspective, as you don't eat it anymore you start relaxing just very proud of your achievement so I hope he does it to be honest because I think anything more he does adds to tennis history goes above and beyond just talking tennis he goes into global sports like when he went to 23 now in Paris this is incredible stuff great news and it's good for the game so I think he's the heavy favorite and I wouldn't be surprised if he if he wins Wimbledon again.
