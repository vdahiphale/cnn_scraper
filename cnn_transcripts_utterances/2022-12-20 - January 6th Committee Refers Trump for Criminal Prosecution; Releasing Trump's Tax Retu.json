The big question now of course is, what does the Justice Department do with this evidence, as well as the evidence it's collected itself. For the first time in American history, Congress has recommended criminal charges against a former president. The committee accused Trump of four federal crimes, including inciting an insurrection. Those criminal referrals do not force the Justice Department to do anything, but with DOJ investigations already underway, and Trump already a 2024 presidential candidate, the rule of law, American democracy, lots of things facing key tests just ahead.",

As you know, Richard Neal, the chairman of this committee, has had access to the former president's tax information now for a couple of weeks. But new information that I got last night is that members have also begun to get access to this information ahead of today's meeting.What we expect to happen is that they will get together at 3:00 p.m. today. They will open the meeting then they will quickly vote to go into what is known as an executive session or a closed-door meeting. That means we won't be able to see what transpires within that meeting. They'll have a discussion then about what to do with the information that they have received about Trump's taxes. That is going to be a decision up to the committee. We do not know what they plan to decide and whether or not they will release any of this information. But it is going to be significant. They will come out of that meeting and then they will have the formal vote where we will be able to see how members vote and whether or not they want to move forward with releasing some of this information. It's going to be highly, highly anticipated, in part because Republicans are arguing that this is unprecedented, that this is something that they think is being weaponized by the Ways and Means Committee, but the chairman has been steadfast all along saying he wanted this tax information because he wants to understand how this presidential audit program has been working over at IRS. That's a program that requires when a new president and vice president come into office that their taxes are automatically audited.

Gentlemen, always good to see you.

For one thing, we're going to get more details tomorrow. We're going to starting seeing those transcripts. They left some sort of conspicuous gaps in the executive summary yesterday that maybe they will fill in tomorrow. Also I think it's a fair bet that DOJ has some information that the committee does not have. It does both ways. The committee clearly has information DOJ does not have and vice versa. But on the other hand, we also have to keep in mind, this has been a one-sided affair. Yes, it's a bipartisan committee, but there's been no cross-examination. There's not even been any real examination of the underlying transcripts. So, count on the fact that in the coming days Donald Trump and his team will scrutinize all of those transcripts, all that evidence, and look for any inconsistencies or any evidence that may be favorable to Donald Trump as well.",

The report established multiple instances in which someone close to Trump, and we saw in Paula's report there Hope Hicks, told him that the voter fraud theories were false, right, or, you know, witnessing instances like that. Does that help establish intent here because that's a part of the issue, right, from a legal standpoint is you have to have intent to defraud. HONIGhit on the key issue that I promise you prosecutors are struggling with right now. There is plenty of evidence that all manner of credible people, from Donald Trump's own advisers, to Bill Barr, to all manner of advisers and people who Donald Trump himself chose told him, you've lost, it's over. There also is, of course, evidence that some of Donald Trump's more sort of ardent loyalists told him, well, hold on, there's fraud, and we're talking about Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell and others like that. Now, we can roll our eyes at that and say, who believes Rudy Giuliani? Who believes Sidney Powell? And I think there's some justification for that. But what Donald Trump's lawyers will argue is he gets to decide who he believes. If he trusts Rudy and Sidney Powell and doesn't trust other people, then that's up to him. So, this is going to be a difficult issue, Jim, and I think it's at the heart of what prosecutors are trying to drill in on.",

In the Civil War generation, putting the laws forward to try to stop future insurrection from occurring, embedded in 14th Amendment Section 3.

But that's the problem of this.And we do need - you know, I think what was so - more compelling about the testimony we heard is that it's coming from Republicans. It's coming from within the Trump White House. And that should, you know, blow apart this sort of process argument, hand-wringing, that this was somehow a partisan committee. If it had -- it could have been more bipartisan. It should have been more bipartisan. And I think that does reflect where we are as a country, that we can't unite even after January 6th.

He fears the dangers of child trafficking, cartels and more. Ciudad Juarez, once known as the murder capital of the world, still dangerous.
