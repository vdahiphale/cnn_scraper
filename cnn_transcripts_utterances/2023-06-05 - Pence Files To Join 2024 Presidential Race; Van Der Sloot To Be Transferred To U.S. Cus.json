He is now officially a candidate for president for 2024. With us now, CNN Political Director David Chalian.David, Mike Pence, he is in. This is in advance of the public announcement on Wednesday.

Trump, has lawyers at the Department of Justice right now arguing basically not to charge Donald Trump in connection with the classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago.So, Mike Pence enters the race at the very moment that Trump's lawyers are arguing not to be charged with some kind of criminal violation. Also, Chris Christie enters this week. Just explain how this all fits together.",

      "sentences": "Yes. It's like you're watching two different versions of the 2024 Republican nomination race. One version is Donald Trump's version, which is inextricably linked to all the ongoing investigations. And you know, we've heard so much public bluster and denial from Trump's legal team.That's probably a different posture than they have behind closed doors as they are meeting with Justice Department lawyers to try and figure out where the Justice Department may be going and to perhaps persuade an argument here to decline to charge the former president, which of course, would be the first time we would ever see a president being charged with federal crimes here, John. So, Donald Trump is on a different course here. Now, we are seeing a crowded growing Republican field. You know, Chris Christie is set to get in. In addition to Mike Pence this week, a lesser-known North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum set to get in. So, the competition for folks not named Trump in the field is getting far more intense and growing here. And I would just note, the Pence candidacy in and of itself is going to be so interesting to watch because for four years, as you remember, John, he was a loyal lieutenant to Donald Trump. I mean, in full defense of everything that went on through the Trump administration, those four years. It was on the sixth of January, and thereafter where their relationship fell apart completely because Pence did not go along with the scheme that Donald Trump and his allies were trying to put forth and delay, deny the certification of a rightful election. Pence said that was simply a bridge too far. Now, he's got to navigate an electorate that has a chunk still very much in admiration of Donald Trump, and somehow thread the needle of, I did -- I was part of the Trump-Pence administration, but I've completely broken from him. So, where does he go to find voters that will fit in that mold?",

He's been fundraising off of this back and forth. It gets him on a very popular daytime show, not necessarily the traditional place where Republican presidential candidates are making appearances, and gets him in front of a different kind of an audience that benefits him. And I'm sure he'll take this clip that you just played and others from his appearance and continue to raise some small-dollar donors off of it. And so, that will benefit his effort too.

So, when Elon Musk bought the company last year, did Twitter you know file paperwork to the U.S. government telling the FTC hey, we -- you know, have undergone this massive change. That's not clear whether or not that's happened too. And all of these questions, Sara, are really all about how Twitter you know has got much of its staff.
