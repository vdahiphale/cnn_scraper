And this comes as the former president is doubling down on an angry Christmas message to his opponents, wishing they would \"rot in hell.\" Also tonight, new images from inside Iraq where US airstrikes targeted Iran-backed militants in retaliation for a drone attack on American forces. Iraq is calling the strikes hostile acts and warning they could further ratchet up tensions in the Middle East. And Kanye West is belatedly apologizing to the Jewish community for a series of anti-Semitic outbursts. We're getting reaction to the rapper's Instagram posts written in Hebrew.Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today, I'm Pamela Brown, and you're in the Situation Room. And we begin this hour with the next shoes that are about to drop in Donald Trump's unprecedented legal battles with just days to go before the New Year and just weeks to go before the first 2024 presidential contest. Let's go right to CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider. Jessica, walk us through what's next for Trump and his lawyers",

      "sentences": "Well, Pamela, Donald Trump's legal team is likely spending these last days of 2023 prepping for the immunity case that they'll argue before the federal appeals court here in DC on January 9. So they've submitted their brief to the court, that was over the weekend, and they're once again arguing that Donald Trump cannot be prosecuted by special counsel Jack Smith for anything related to January 6, because they say Trump was acting in his official capacity as president when he worked to overturn the 2020 election results.They're also arguing that because Trump was acquitted by the Senate in his impeachment trial, he also can't be criminally charged. So we'll actually see response from the special counsel by the end of this week. And then arguments before the appeals court, they're scheduled that second week of January, January 9th. And you know, Trump already had somewhat of a victory just before Christmas on Friday, when the US Supreme Court refused to hear his case before the appeals court heard it. The special counsel had hoped to speed up the timeline of this immunity appeal since, of course, everything is on pause while that immunity issue is decided. But time and delay will in fact be on Trump's side, at least for the next several weeks, making it very unlikely that his trial will actually start March 4th. But, of course, he will still have that slew of other legal issues heading into 2024. We've got the civil lawsuit brought against him by E. Jean Carroll for defamation. That trial set to start January 16th. Unless his legal team can figure out a way to delay, which we know they're working on. Then there's the hush money case involving Stormy Daniels. That's the case brought by the Manhattan DA. That is also still slated to go to trial in March but the DA, Alvin Bragg, has said multiple times that that date could be pushed back. And, of course, all of this happening as the campaign calendar is jam- packed. Trump focused on his 2024 campaign, while his legal team, Pamela, is focused on this litany of legal issues cascading into 2024.",

But I can tell you this, having two major trials this year, when you get in a courtroom, Pam, when you present the evidence to a jury, whether you're a defense attorney or the prosecutor, that takes on a life of its own, and that jury, 12 people, is going to be focused like a laser beam on the evidence against Donald Trump.And from what I've read, and what I know, the evidence in Jack Smith's case is extremely powerful. And the document case in Fort Pierce, Florida, that's even more powerful. The other two cases, the Stormy Daniels case, I had a witness in that investigation, Enrico (ph), that's sort of the side issue.

And they had returned to duty in a matter of days, according to the Pentagon. But this attack that was carried out by Kataib, Kataib Hezbollah, just yesterday, it resulted in one servicemember being critically wounded. So the US clearly felt a need to respond very forcefully. Now, Central Command said in the statement that they do believe that several of the militants were killed in the attack, and they believe at this time that no civilians were injured as part of it. But, look, the Iraqi Government is not happy about this. They released a statement earlier today calling it a violation of their sovereignty. We should note it's the second time in just over a month that the US has launched the strikes in Iraq raising questions, of course. But whether the Iraqi Government is doing enough to protect US and coalition servicemembers that are there in the country to fight ISIS, clearly the Pentagon feeling that it needed to take matters into its own hands in this case, Pam.",

And they're doing it basically in response to the US efforts to supply Israel with weapons in the Hamas -- anti-Hamas efforts that they're undertaking Israelis are undertaking in Gaza.

So you'll look at some of the shipping fees for mail and returns that retailers have added J.Crew $7.50, Macy's 9.99, and then Amazon, interestingly, Amazon, they've trained us to return for free, but now they've added a $1 fee for customers who are bringing in items to the UPS store when there's a closer Whole Foods store nearby.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Pam, returns are very expensive for retailers, particularly the mail in returns, they have to pay for the shipping fees, then they have to restock the items. And so that's all going to impact their bottom lines. And we've seen return rates spike over the past few years, especially as more customers order online, you know, you think about something looks good online, then you get it in person. It's not the right size or the right color. So 2019, about 8 percent of all return -- of all merchandise was returned. That's jump to 16.5 percent last year. So retailers they're saying we've had enough and they're cracking down.",

So retailers are now tightening their return windows, trying to another move to crack down a little bit. You can bring in a lot of returns now box free, label free. That's kind of a nice convenience. And then some stores like Staples. They're offering you to bring in their -- your Amazon returns and you can shop in stores with for a discount. That's a way to draw customers into stores. And I think this trend is most interesting. They're just telling you to keep your return. They don't want it anymore.",
