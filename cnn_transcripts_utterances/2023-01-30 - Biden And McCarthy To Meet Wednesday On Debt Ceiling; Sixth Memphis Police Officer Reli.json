The Republicans have made clear they want cuts to raise -- spending cuts to raise the debt ceiling.MJ Lee is at the White House for us. She's joining us now. For the Biden teams part, MJ, they have made clear that they're not going to negotiate over this, so what are you hearing there today?",

And we know that he faces a tremendous amount of pressure from the hardliners in his own caucus to extract deep spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. He gave a little preview of how he is viewing this Wednesday's meeting over the weekend. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA): We're going to meet this Wednesday. I know the president said he didn't want to have any discussions but I think it's very important that our whole government is designed to find a compromise. I want to find a reasonable and responsible way that we can lift the debt ceiling with take control of this runaway spending. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We, of course, also know that time is of the essence. The Treasury Department has said the government essentially has until early June until their so-called extraordinary measures can prevent the government from defaulting.

He said that he -- as he has before that he took credit for the fact that he won governor in 2018, saying it was his endorsement that put DeSantis over the edge. But he also pushed back, lashing out at DeSantis and his COVID protocols that he had in place. Something that Republicans have praised. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I know that might sound counterintuitive since so much of his Republican Conference is -- you know, they're -- they have their feet down and they're saying we're not going to budge.They're really entrenched. But when it comes to this particular issue of the debt ceiling, they also realize -- at least enough of them realize that is not an option. This needs to be dealt with in some way, shape, or form, or the economy will be in very, very big trouble. So, the fact that they're going to have this meeting is important and is a big deal. I think we have to be careful to listen for the terminology here. They are going to sit down and talk. How much the president is going to actually negotiate meaning compromise on what the Republicans want, which is spending cuts in addition to the debt ceiling increase? That remains to be seen.",

And the fact that Governor Sununu talked about Ron DeSantis, the governor from Florida, no question at this point in time being able to win his state, the first in the primary state, is really -- first in the nation primary state rather, is really critical because remember, back in 2016 when there was a big, big field, it was Donald Trump's decisive win in the New Hampshire primary that set him going forward, and he never really looked back.

Whether or not there was blood, many experts for the state all saying that they didn't see any blood on Alex Murdaugh. And, Kate, this is key because he has said -- he told investigators that night that he tried to check the pulse on his wife and son. He even tried to turn his son over. This was a gruesome bloody crime scene. So, it would make sense that he would have had blood on him. Again, the state investigators saying that he didn't. They are seemed to be setting up this scenario that perhaps he washed his clothes that night after allegedly killing his wife and son. But we know that they didn't fully search the house for three months until September of 2021. If they had gone into the house fully that night, perhaps they would have -- or even sooner perhaps they could have seen whether or not he had done that. But also, Kate, getting back to the night of the murder. So, Alex Murdaugh did speak with investigators at great length in their car. And he suggested that perhaps someone else was responsible for the murders of his wife and son. And this goes back to a boat crash that his son, Paul, was involved in back in 2019.
