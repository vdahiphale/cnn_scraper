      "sentences": "All right, right now the map tells the story. We are well into the morning here in New York, and there is much more red than blue. Much.Welcome to CNN's special live coverage, Election Night in America. I'm John Berman, and if you're just tuning in, Donald Trump appears poised to become the 47th president of the United States, taking a wrecking ball to the so-called blue wall states that the Harris team thought was his best path to the White House. A couple of caveats right off the top. There is still vote to count. CNN has not yet projected some of the critical battleground states and a couple others that will formally decide the presidency, but that does increasingly look like a formality. Donald Trump is just short of the 270 electoral votes he needs to win. You can see he's at 266 right now, but three big battlegrounds, North Carolina, Georgia, and Pennsylvania have all gone for Trump, and the remaining four battlegrounds, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, and Wisconsin, Trump leads in all of them. The vote left to count is quickly shrinking, and the takeaway seems to be that the electorate is mad as hell, and tonight they're sending a message that they will not take it anymore. The economy mattered most to voters. Everything else that mattered did not matter nearly as much. January 6th, immigration, abortion, the chaos of the final few weeks, the bizarre behavior, the offensive, often racist, sexist musings of Donald Trump seem not to have mattered at least not as much. Crucially, we are also seeing what could very well be a political realignment. According to the exit polls, the Democratic coalition of the working class, Black men, Latinos, white women, who all helped propel Joe Biden to the White House four years ago, they are now offering Donald Trump a ladder to power. Just a short time ago, Trump spoke to his supporters in Florida and made a nod to unifying the country. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We're going to help our country heal. We're going to help our country heal. We have a country that needs help, and it needs help very badly. We're going to fix our borders. We're going to fix everything about our country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "We'll start there. The two blue wall states that have not been called yet. Donald Trump's lead substantial in the state of Michigan, 231,000 votes with 86 percent reporting.I think you go into the state of Michigan, particularly after the last two cycles, and you know where the Democratic strongholds are. You know where Donald Trump needs to do well. Let's start with one of those Democratic strongholds. That's right here, Wayne County. This is actually where a ton of vote is still outstanding. We're going to have to wait and see how that all breaks down, but I can tell you right now, if it looks anything like the current margin, like the current separation between the vice president and Donald Trump, that explains a lot about what's happening here because this is the largest county in the state. 17.6 percent of the voting population lives in this state. That margin you're saying, 29 points. It's got to be, that's a great sign if you're the Harris campaign. It's not when you look at what Joe Biden's margin was. At five points, and these aren't just Democratic strongholds. These are critical vote drivers in these states. We see it in Milwaukee and Wisconsin. We see it in Philadelphia and Pennsylvania. You see it right here in Wayne. But the other issue, move up here to Oakland County. This is the suburbs. This is one of those areas that Democrats have moved heavily into, taking control of, and really started to turn out major vote over the course of the last couple of cycles. This county, back in 2020, Joe Biden won it by 14 points, a little more than 14 points. Kamala Harris, underperforming. So the theory of the case from the Harris campaign is you run up your margins in those critical urban areas that you always run up big margins in, and then you blow out your margins in the suburbs, the places like Oakland County. That's how you hold down Donald Trump's gains in his strongholds, those rural counties. Smaller, but they add up if you add two, three, four points to what he did in 2020. In the suburbs, in the urban areas, in the biggest counties, in the biggest vote drivers in the state of Michigan, that just simply has not happened yet. And if you want to know where Donald Trump has been overperforming in this state, these are the places, the counties where he's overperforming by 3 percent or more. This isn't overperforming by a vote. This is overperforming by a substantial margin, 3 percent or more. One of them, Wayne County.",

Right now, Kamala Harris is just underperforming.

And I think that is incredibly important.The 2020 election was absolutely a referendum on Donald Trump. Voters were very angry about the pandemic. They held him responsible for the pandemic, and they punished him for that. They voted for Joe Biden. The mistake here, though, is that the Democratic Party, rather than institutionalizing those coalitions that came out of the 2020 election, they assumed that those things were a referendum about the Democratic Party and about the strength of the Democratic Party. What we're seeing now is that the fractures, the tensions that have really been, I think, in front of all of us since at least 2016 with Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump, all of those things are coming to the fore. All of the things that Democrats thought that they could rely on, the cultural questions, the questions about Donald Trump's racism, his bigotry, his xenophobia, they found out that actually those things are not enough to bind those winning coalitions together. It is no longer enough in American politics to say, hey, that guy is a bad guy. There has to be more. And for this election in particular, it was about the economy.",

You know, we always talk about the economy. It seems like we have these discussions every election that you and I have worked where the day after we say, wow, the economy really was what kind of drove it through.You know, we're tripping ourselves over what we think is the hot button issue that the party is really trying to push, abortion, you know, in this case, immigration as well, although they were hot issues and really were driving issues.

One thing I would keep in mind with this is that so far, you know, at this point, a presidential candidate, one of the nominees, you normally have an official transition process underway. Donald Trump does have a transition team, but they have not gone through some of the more official channels for how that should operate, including working with the Biden administration on some of that process.All to say that is because Donald Trump is very superstitious. He did not want to have serious conversations before Election Day about who would fill top cabinet positions and key administrative roles. However, we are told, and this is also according to some reporting from my colleague and I, Kristen Holmes, you know, some people have been calling Donald Trump over the last few hours now and calling top aides to him, saying, you know, trying to feel out the sense of what possibilities there could be for them in a future administration, in this expected administration. And so we're already starting to see some of that take shape. It's very early on. And I will tell you, Donald Trump, as far as, you know, presidential candidates go, he is far behind that process than what we would see normally for a Republican nominee and someone who had just essentially won the election -- Kasie.",

There are Democratic voters that say it's terrible because we think Donald Trump has poisoned the climate and sowed all of these seeds that have made things terrible. But a majority of voters tonight seem to be saying we don't think that the party that's in charge now can fix these problems. We need to go back to Donald Trump. It's in some ways the buyer's remorse election. For a lot of voters after January 6, Donald Trump's job approval was in like the mid 30s. It was terrible. But if you ask voters now, did you approve or disapprove of Donald Trump's job? It goes up to almost 50 percent that say they approve. There is a sense of buyer's remorse.

He was how he reacted to COVID, how he had some issues with foreign leaders. And now, again, he embraced that outsider role. And I think he's that he's audibilized that angry voice in people's heads, whether it's inflation, whether it's immigration, whether it be whatever the issues. Now he's got to figure out a way to take that from audibilizing, being the mouthpiece of that anger, to figuring out how does he solve some of these real problems?

But I'm not -- I think what people were missing doesn't exist anymore.So I'll be curious to see how does Trump try to deliver on that promise. Our economy is not the same as it was pre-COVID. So how does he supposedly bring back all this good times? Look, I think it says, too, that again, we talked about this over the last couple of years. The administration has not done a good enough job communicating with people about what they've done. And I -- and the Trump campaign was able to once again, I think Jeff is exactly right, tap into frustration and anger as an outsider. Right. Without the sort of as an incumbent outsider in some ways.
