The shocking actions that led to two jurors suddenly dismissed in unusual occurrence. What this might mean for opening statements which the judge had thought could start as soon as Monday.Plus, name calling and fresh threats. House Speaker Johnson was physically cornered on the House floor, pinned against the wall by hard-right Republicans, demanding that he keep his hands off the rule that as of right now allows just one member of Congress to force a vote to remove him as Speaker. The House adjourned today before anybody could make a move. We'll tell you all about it. And arrests at Columbia University protests in New York City, just one day after that school's president testified before Congress about anti-Semitism on campus. We're going to go to Columbia, live. Welcome to THE LEAD. I'm Jake Tapper. And we start today in our law injustice lead with a dramatic day in the courtroom during the third day of Donald Trump's hush money cover up trial. Two jurors who had been seated were excused from the panel -- summarily dismissed. It's very unusual. One asked to be removed after some members of the news media, not CNN, reported so many details about her. She was afraid she was going to be outed. The other was kicked off after prosecutors say they found evidence of a prior arrest of someone by the same name. Unclear if it's the same person. That leaves five jurors on the panel. We started with seven. Right now, courts ongoing, lawyers from both sides are questioning more potential jurors. We're waiting to see if any new ones will be seated by the end of the court today. They need 12 jurors and six alternates' total. We're going to bring you that update as it happens. But back to those jurors who are no longer there. The first, a woman, juror number two, an oncology nurse. She said she could no longer be considered impartial, because she feared too much of her identity had been revealed. Some news media outlets not CNN, reported the hospital where she worked. After juror number two got several messages from friends and family asking if she was on the jury, based on those details reported in some media outlets. Well, she grew fearful. The second juror dismissed, a man who was juror number four. He runs an I.T. business for training and consultant. Now, prosecutors allege that they found evidence of a prior arrest of someone by the same name, though he was officially removed in private. So, it's unclear as of now if that was the exact reason he was dismissed. We're going to start a recording today was seen as Paula Reid, who has been tracking jury selection today. And Paula, we started the day with 96 prospective jurors, half was -- were dismissed. They said they could not be impartial. Where does jury selection stand as of now? PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Any minute, we could get the newest juror seated in this case. Now, this is the second group of 100 potential jurors that they've had to walk through. And we've seen some similarities between the first group and the second group, like you said, over half of them were dismissed because they said they could not be impartial. Nine others had to be dismissed for other various reasons, scheduling conflicts, other reasons they couldn't serve. And then, it was interesting to see world politics interfere here, because there was one potential juror who said he was born and raised in Italy. And he said that he associates Trump with former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who, of course, face charges for corruption, fraud, and sex crimes. And he said he just didn't think he could be fair or impartial. Also, certainly not someone that the defense team would want on there. So, as we speak right now, they are still working through the final stages of this group. Right now, they are asking the judge to dismiss some of these jurors for cause, and then both sides will have the chance to use those precious four strikes that each have left.",

And that's very intimidating and very frightening for many people. And frankly, Jake, this is going to keep coming up over the course of this trial, where even if the judge tries to restrict the amount of information that's been public about these people, there is still so much curiosity in the in the public right now, and among certain members of media, that I think more information is going to keep leaking out if he doesn't control it.",

Now they have all 12, both sides, used all of their preemptory strikes, these are strikes that they can use to have someone removed without giving a reason. Now, the only reason they could move remove someone was for cause but we have the full -- the full jury.

And then this morning, they came in and did lost two of them. So, it's an extraordinary case, things can certainly change. But right now, the judge has announced they have their jury and they're moving on to try to select those six alternates.

And they'll have that new group, again, Jake, it'll be approximately a hundred people. And if they have to move into that new group, they'll go through the same process that we've already seen, twice. Now you have a hundred people you ask anyone first and foremost if there's anyone who cannot serve and be impartial in this trial. And it's been interesting in the other two groups that we've seen so far, over half of the jurors are exactly half of the jurors in one group said they could not be impartial. And it's notable that the Trump defense team said that they really wanted to get that specific statistic, they didn't want everyone who is removed for cause to be lumped into one group, they wanted to know specifically, how many people said they couldn't even be impartial. Why is that important, Jake? Because that is an issue that the Trump team will inevitably bring up on appeal. They will say this is why we wanted to move the venue. Over half the people said they couldn't even be impartial. So, that's something we're watching very closely. There are other reasons that people can be struck for cause or be removed before they move on to the jury questionnaire, and then this process where they will have additional strikes to select these alternates.

That's the New Yorkers who will judge Trump.They are continuing to go through the jury now to select the alternates. It is important to note that this all happened very quickly in just the last half an hour. So, where we ticked through these, both sides used up all of their peremptory challenges, and we finished seating this jury. Now they're doing the alternates, they will each side will each have one peremptory challenge. And we still -- we have jurors that are still there in in the box. But they did ask and they did swear in another panel of 96. They will return tomorrow around 11:30 if they do not find the remaining jurors, the remaining five or so alternates, as we get toward the end of the court day to day. But we do now have a jury seated in this case, the judge saying we have our jury, let's do the alternate. So, this is now moving swiftly again.

She said she doesn't follow the news, but occasionally follows headlines and reads industry specific publications that the last year to be seated. We have some generic details about this individual as well. She is a physical therapist, she has a doctorate degree in physical therapy. She reads the New York Times USA Today and watches CNN. Again, these really interesting details about the people who will be deciding Trump's fate, I will expect that the Trump team will make an issue of the fact that they tried to have someone removed for saying that Trump is, \"not her cup of tea\", and that she will still be on the jury.

Let me go back to Paula Reid with some more information. Paula, what else? REID: So, a reoccurring issue here, which is the holiday of Passover and the fact that the Trump defense team asked if they could have off next Monday and Tuesday, the first two days of Passover. And if you read the transcript, Jake, when the defense attorneys made that request, it appeared that the judge several weeks ago said yes, that shouldn't be a problem. But when this trial began on Monday, he said no, in fact, on Monday and Tuesday, they will be in court until 2:00. So, right now, the defense attorneys are revisiting this issue, as it appears that this case could begin on Monday. Now, the defense attorneys are saying look, it's fine to break at lunch, but they're asking not to sit on Tuesday, because Tuesday is a holiday -- a holiday and the entire day is a holiday for one member on the defense team. The judge however, pushes back says, look, I appreciate that it's a holiday, but this is not a court holiday. So, it appears that the judge not moving on this request even though he had previously said that he would recognize any religious exemptions for jurors who wanted to observe religious holidays, it does not appear that that is being extended to the extent of the defense team has requested. Jake, I think this is an issue that they might bring up on appeal as they continue to pursue any issue, any objection, gather them all for a potential appeal if there is a conviction.",
