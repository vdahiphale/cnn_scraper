We will have more on this story in just a moment. Also ahead, a Japan Airlines jet burst into flames after colliding with an earthquake relief plane at Tokyo's Haneda Airport. And stabbed in plain sight. Shocking scenes in South Korea where the main opposition leader has survived an attack by a man with a knife. But first this evening, we are tracking for you developments in Lebanon where Hamas says one of its senior leaders has been killed in an explosion. The blast happened in the Lebanese capital of Beirut as Israel wages war against the Palestinian militants further south of course in Gaza. Hamas has been quick to say Israel killed deputy political and military leader Saleh al-Arouri. But we are still waiting to see if the Israelis come out and officially confirm or deny responsibility. People started gathering in front of the Beirut explosion site where at least three other people were reportedly killed. This is a developing story for you. Our Nada Bashir is in Beirut for us this hour with the very latest. So, Nada, what do we know at this stage happened here, and give us more context as to who is Saleh al-Arouri within the Hamas structure?",

      "sentences": "Well, Isa, there certainly is a developing situation, but this is also a significant escalation on what has been weeksof mounting tensions between Israel and Lebanon. Of course, the killing now according to Hamas of Saleh al-Arouri is a significant escalation. He is a top Hamas official, the deputy of Hamas' political bureau, but also considered one of the founding members of the al-Qassam Brigades; Hamas's military wing. We have seen that statement from Hamas now, accusing, as you mentioned, the Israeli military of carrying out what they've described as a strike on the suburbs of southern Beirut, killing Saleh al-Arouri. At this stage, no confirmation from the Israeli military. CNN has reached out to the IDF, but they have at this stage declined to comment. And it's unclear what caused this blast exactly, but of course, important to note that we have over the course of this war in Gaza heard from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to target all senior Hamas officials, not just in Gaza, not just in the occupied West Bank, but wherever they may be located. And there has been concern that, that could lead to this conflict spilling over more broadly into the region and elsewhere. We have just in the last two hours or so -- we also heard from Israel's  former ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, he took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to congratulate the Israeli military on killing, in his words, Saleh al- Arouri.",

And that has really raised alarm bells for the potential for an escalation more broadly between Lebanon and between Israel.

Well, want to stay in the regionbecause Israel is drawing down the number of soldiers on the ground in Gaza, in anticipation of prolonged fighting. Israeli defense forces say they now have control of Hamas, of the Hamas stronghold in Gaza city. They also claim to have discovered on the ground Hamas bunker which was used, quote, \"to manage the war in the Gaza Strip.\" Now, CNN has not been able to verify those claims. Meantime, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society -- several -- says several people were killed and others wounded after Israel bombed its headquarters in Khan Yunis. CNN reached out to the IDF for comment on that. Well, tensions, as you can see remain high along one of the most vital waterways after Iran announced it was sending a warship to the Red Sea, the ships mission is still not clear, and oil prices are becoming more volatile. That follows a decision by global shipping giant Maersk extending a pause on moving cargo through the Red Sea after recent attacks, if you remember, by Iranian-backed Houthi fighters. Let's put all of this, these transits into context. I want to welcome Colin Clarke; he's director of Policy and Research at the Soufan Group; an Intelligence and security consulting firm. Colin, great to have you back on the show. Let me start up with this -- start up first of all with this developing story that we're getting out of Beirut that a senior Hamas leader has been at explosion. How significant is this? How much of a blow is this to Hamas? COLIN CLARKE, DIRECTOR OF POLICY &amp; RESEARCH, SOUFAN GROUP: Well, first of all, thanks for having me. You're right. There's been a lot of developments even in the last 48 hours. I think the strike in Beirut is quite significant. One, it's symbolic. It shows Hamas that the Israelis will target Hamas leaders wherever they are, not just in Gaza, but across the region and indeed across the world. I think more importantly, this is a shot directly at Iran. Saleh al-Arouri was someone that was known to be close to the leadership in Tehran. And this is a clear message that the Israelis will not sit back and allow Hamas to continue planning for another strike. They are on high alert. They won't be caught off guard again.

He's a few months out from local elections in South Korea. And this is what politicians are doing at this point.

How significant in your view is this ruling from the supreme court, the high court? AVI MAYER, OUTGOING EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"JERUSALEM POST\": As you said, it is hard to believe that just a few months ago this was the issue that was tearing Israel apart. It feels so very distant, so very far away. It is significant in that this is a ruling that had been anticipated for quite some time. Many have quietly forgotten it was actually in the works because of the events of October 7th and the war that has ensued. It is significant because this was the first legislative piece of the government's judicial reform, which many had somewhat assumed was somewhat dead due to the events of recent months. And it does seem to have  blown a significant aspect of that to smithereens. We don't know whether it will be possible for the prime minister to restart it.

A federal judge in New York ordered the release of more than 150 names last month. It was the latest filing in the settled case by the Virginia Roberts Giuffre chief there, an American woman who accused Jeffrey Epstein and his former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell, of sex crimes. While the case was settled in 2017, there has been an ongoing effort to unseal the records. Epstein was indicted in 2019 on sex trafficking charges over accusations that he sexually abused underage girls. The multimillionaire died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial.

It is documents that they obtained throughout the course of the litigation. It could be deposition transcripts, it could be calendar entries, flight manifestos. All of this rich information that they had gotten. Giuffre, through her lawsuit, she has made big allegations against a number of prominent men, saying that she was forced to have sex with them, probably most famously accusing Prince Andrew of that. They reached a settlement in a lawsuit where he agreed to pay a substantial amount of money to a charity. We are expecting to see a lot of names in this. And it's not necessarily going to be that it is for a bad reason or one of the men that she has accused. There could be people that work for Epstein. People who were secretaries who might be cc'd on things. Also we are expecting there to be a number of other accusers. After Giuffre went public with her allegations, other accusers also came forward. A number of them have also had written references vaguely to them in some of her litigation. We do expect to see some other people that have come forward and their names will become public. The reason why the judge is doing this is because she said that so much information has already become public, either because accusers went public on their own or because the information came out during Maxwell's criminal trial. That was one of the reasons she was saying that it was OK now to release the information so they can get a fuller picture of Epstein's life.",

As far as the legal consequences, the federal prosecutors who brought that case against Epstein and Maxwell spent time interviewing dozens of accusers and women in connection with this, including Giuffre, asking them what they had in their allegations of being assaulted and anybody else that would've assisted in that. In the end they only brought an additional case to Ghislaine Maxwell, not any of the other alleged recruiters or other women who are part of this machinery or any of the men who may have had sexual relations with underage women and girls. Unless there is some bombshell allegation here, it seems like a lot of this material has already known by prosecutors. We might not see anything from a criminal standpoint. It is always possible that there could be additional civil litigation that stems from this. But again, we will have to wait and see exactly what is in this material.",
