But it's growing evidence, really, of, well, North Korea not being the most powerful ally Russia could find globally that this is increasingly an international conflict. And look, you know, Becky, just after the remarkable week we've had that began with the German Chancellor Olaf Scholz ringing Vladimir Putin, kind of trying to get peace talks started, doing it for his own domestic political reasons and I think infuriating some of his allies, we've now got to a point where the United States has let Ukraine fire U.S. missiles into Russia. It's hard to overstate how significant a step that is, one that Biden said he wouldn't take for months because of how escalatory it would be. And then Moscow, while many sort of, well, debated as to whether this would be another red line that Russia let fly past it, well, instead they seem to have found a way of responding and a way which was, while having no nuclear element to it at all, was sort of ridden with a nuclear subtext, flying in the direction of Western Europe.

And it was under the Biden administration and international pressure that Israel put these detention orders, administrative detention, on some settlers because of complaints and criticism coming from the Biden administration. Look, since October 7th last year, settlers have killed 12 Palestinians in the West Bank, in the occupied West Bank. I've been to two of those funerals and there's no amount of anger in the Palestinian communities because they feel that the settlers, whether it's the murders or the intimidation, you know, turning up when farmers are getting the olive harvest, torching their cars and villages, all of those things, are really happening with impunity, even a nod and a wink from the government is the perception of Palestinian villagers.

Interesting times, Nick. Thank you. President-elect Donald Trump suffers his first failed cabinet pick but moves quickly to replace embattled attorney general choice Matt Gaetz after he withdrew on Thursday. He chose -- he being Donald Trump chose former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi. And that's the state's first woman A.G. to head up the U.S. Justice Department. Bondi, well known to Trump and his team, she helped defend Trump during his first impeachment trial when he was president. Sources say her path to confirmation certainly appears far less controversial. CNN's Alayna Treene has been covering all of this. Donald Trump, as I understand it, Alayna, put her name forward within a matter of hours. We know that she is a Trump supporter and loyalist, and we know that she has been involved in his defense during the impeachment process. What else do we know about her and her background as it were, given that this is a huge job heading up the Department of Justice?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And there's a lot of people, we've even heard this from members on the hill now that believe that she'sfar more qualified for this role than perhaps Matt Gaetz was. So she was a prosecutor in Florida for 18 years. She also was the first female attorney general of Florida. She was in that role for eight years. A couple of things I want to highlight for when she was attorney general in Florida. She had really pushed back on expanding any sort of LGBTQ rights in the state including fighting to keep gay marriage banned in the state. She also really pushed or tried to overturn and push back on the Affordable Care Act in her state. She did gain some of a reputation, though, for her anti-sex trafficking push and efforts while as attorney general. So that's some of her background as attorney general. As you mentioned, though, she knows Donald Trump very well. They have a long history of knowing each other. He's always loved watching her on television, something that we know is kind of been a quality that he's liked in all of the major picks that he has made. Another thing on Bondi's background is she has also a big lobbying background. She once worked for Ballard Partners. It's actually a lobbying -- a Republican lobbying firm where also Susie Wiles, Donald Trump's new incoming chief of staff, had also worked as well as many others who are close to the former president helping out with this transition process. While she was there and doing other lobbying work, there's a couple companies I want to highlight that she had been involved with. That includes Uber, Amazon, General Motors and Qatar. So these could be some areas where perhaps Republicans and Democrats who are on the Senate Judiciary Committee and who would be tasked with confirming her may try to confront her on. Another area as well that she may be, you know, criticized for and we've seen her under scrutiny for this in the past is that she really kind of attached herself to the fight in the aftermath of the 2020 election. She started to repeat and spread some of the false claims of election fraud and also falsely claimed that Donald Trump had won that election. And so these are just some areas where she might have some trouble. But all in all, when I talk to Donald Trump's transition team, they do believe that she should have a much easier time going through the Senate than Matt Gaetz would have -- Becky.",

Now, this comes after the U.N. nuclear watchdog criticized Tehran for not cooperating with the agency. Well, Iran says it's only protecting its interests and developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. Injecting gas into centrifuges is part of the process to enrich uranium, which could ultimately be used to develop a nuclear weapon. Iran has repeatedly denied it has any ambitions of building a bomb. Mohammad Al Shabani is the editor of Amwaj Media, and he joins me now from London. At a time, which couldn't be more worrying in this region given the escalation between Israel and Iran of late, Israel squarely accusing Iran of trying to build a bomb, saying it's weeks away, gets support from the U.S. who've said they will never allow Iran to have a bomb. So what is going on here at present? Certainly Iran denies it is interested in making a nuclear bomb, but the head of the IAEA has warned that Iran has enough uranium to make several nuclear bombs if it chose to do so.

Iran has been enriching uranium for quite some time now. The stockpile has grown, but in a relatively stable manner. Just days before the resolution, the new Iranian president hosted the IAEA director general for the first time since taking office and during that meeting, one item that were discussed was the fact that Iran is open to putting a cap on its 60 percent enriched uranium and then we had this resolution which saying basically that that cap is not enough, that the E-3 and the U.S. want basically a comprehensive report by the IAEA by next spring and hinting more or less that unless that materializes by next October, Europe may trigger what's referred to as snapback.

Now, with reference to what Iran may be open to under the second Trump administration, you absolutely rightly point out that they've been putting out trial balloons. They're saying that they don't think the 2015 deal, which Trump pulled out of is, quote-unquote, \"no longer good enough for us.\" What does that mean? It means that they're open to a new deal, perhaps a better deal. And I think Trump coming into office, again, like you rightly point out, is going to face a very different region. The neighbors of Iran are not as antagonistic towards Tehran. On the other hand Israel is far more hawkish. Just weeks ago, it carried out airstrikes inside Iran. Netanyahu is claiming that one of those sites was a nuclear related site. And we're all now waiting for how Iran may or may not respond to that. So I think the bigger picture here is that all the major players in the region, including Iran and Europe, I think the rest of the world, are all angling to see what may come out of the next Trump administration.",

Those attacks took out half of the kingdom's oil production for months, and we saw the Trump administration do nothing. That was shocking to the Saudis. That meant that their view of U.S. commitments fundamentally shifted. And I think that played a very important role in triggering this rapprochement, which you mentioned previously, right. So I think if Saudi Arabia now is normalizing relations with Iran and whether or not, yes or no, whether that can be a prelude to normalization with Israel, I think all of this shows that their trust in the existing world order is being undermined. They're seeing shifting chips on the table so to speak.

While his anti-vaccine stances, his false claims and his conspiracy theories about issues like COVID are seen as problematic, his goal of cracking down on ultra-processed foods is one that most health officials and doctors are in agreement on. In fact, one group of researchers is conducting a landmark study looking at these types of foods. The first of its kind. And for more, I'm joined by CNN medical correspondent Meg Tirrell. It's good to have you. Tell us about this new -- it's a U.S. government funded study, as I understand it. What are they looking at and why?",

All to try to better understand how our health is affected by ultra-processed foods. I think your food is coming in. We saw the kind of food he got in. Eggs and spinach and yogurt. But we don't know. That could be processed. It could be unprocessed. That's part of the trial. (Voice-over): Ultra-processed foods contain additives and ingredients you wouldn't find in your own kitchen. They were shown in the previous NIH study to drive overeating and weight gain, according to researcher Dr. Kevin Hall. Are ultra-processed foods just junk foods?",

Most of those are considered ultra-processed because of some of the additives and preservatives that are in there, as well as how they're manufactured.

This is where they prepare all of the food. And they don't just prepare it, they weigh it before it goes up and when it comes back after the participant has eaten.

The trial is a month long and each week has a different diet, minimally processed or different kinds of ultra-processed.

They hope to get results by the end of next year. And as they say, they could give that over to the FDA, to regulators, to policymakers who could potentially consider what to do with this information. They can also provide that information to us as consumers so that we can be better armed as we're going to the grocery store and making decisions about what to buy for ourselves and our families. One finding from the previous trial that the NIH did is that it's much more expensive to eat a mostly minimally processed diet than an ultra-processed diet, not to mention how much longer it can take to prepare those kinds of meals. So if we can find a way to eat in a sort of healthier way, but still get some of this convenience and lower price, they are saying that is really the goal of this. And for that they need the information and the data -- Becky.",
