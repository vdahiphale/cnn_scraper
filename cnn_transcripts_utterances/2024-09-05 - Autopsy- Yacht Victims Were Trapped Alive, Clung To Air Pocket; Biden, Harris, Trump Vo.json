Both Harris and Trump actually agree with President Biden that they would block the $14 billion sale of U.S. Steel to the Japanese firm, Nippon Steel. U.S. Steel's chief is warning, though, that if the sale doesn't go through, it may have to close down mills, likely cutting thousands of union jobs and potentially moving its headquarters out of Pennsylvania, which if you've been paying attention, is a very important state in this election. Some employees of U.S. Steel rallied yesterday in Pittsburgh to support the takeover. But the United Steelworkers Union has firmly been against the deal. Let's discuss with David McCall. He's the president of the United Steelworkers Union. David, thank you so much for sharing part of your afternoon with us. I'm curious to get your response to this warning from the CEO that blocking the deal could mean lost union jobs. Do you agree?",

It's baseless and it's irresponsible. U.S. Steel is a profitable company. It does well here in the Amman Valley where he was targeting some of those threats. They've talked about it being a world-class facility and being able to deliver quality products to our customers. Now, all of a sudden, when he's about to lose a $70 million change- and-control bonus, he makes these kinds of threats. And like I say, they're irresponsible.

The real problem here is not only the national defense and critical supply chain issues that CISA has been investigating. It also violates our collective bargaining agreement in that the ultimate parent of this proposed transaction, Nippon, is not signing our collective bargaining agreement. So there's issues around the collective bargaining agreement, but there's also issues about national defense and critical supply chain issues.",

That story and more coming up on CNN NEWS CENTRAL. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:51:20] KEILAR: On this week's \"Homefront,\" a new problem for families in the military moving back to the U.S. from overseas posts. Amid all the confusion in that clutter of moving, some are facing a new hurdle, no way to bring home their family dog. The problem stems from new requirements from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They're designed to prevent any dogs that might carry rabies from entering the U.S. But it's led eight airlines to decide to stop flying dogs back into the states, either in the cabin or the cargo hold. Liz Hensel is the CEO of Leave No Paws Behind, USA. She is joining us from Tel Aviv, where her husband is serving with the U.S. Marines. Liz, this is heartbreaking. How many families have been affected by this?",

Well, we have a large population of troops all over Europe and Asia, and they think the last time to hit Bradley (ph), 300,000 troops overseas.And when the news first broke, it was so sudden. There was no guidance, that the quick reaction was to just shut down the services. And when the rule was published, I was actually in the middle of my family vacation in Germany. I just knew that we had to do something. We had to act fast. This is PCSD season, permanent (INAUDIBLE season, where families are constantly moving in and out of the country. So I immediately got on my laptop and my phone and I was emailing the CEO and the leadership of Lufthansa Airlines. This is an airline that I have personally used before. They are one of the most pet-friendly airlines. They made it so easy for military families to move to and from Germany to the United States. So thankfully, after about three days of back-and-forth of trying to cope with solution, trying to contact CDC leadership, explaining that this is not something that I can just be implemented almost overnight. We only had a few months warning to get things ready. Alot of families had no idea that this change was coming down. So with a lot of attention brought to this, the CDC did pull back a little bit. They're still a process that needs to happen. Lufthansa finally agreed to bring pets back in the cabinet and in the hold. But with starting caveats. They can only enter the country on certain locations, which you can find on their Web site. But it's still a huge win compared to what we had a few weeks ago, which was just a complete shutdown.",

OK, so what if the family is PCSD in North Carolina where we have traveled to, one of the biggest Marine Corps Bases on the east coast, along with Fort Bragg, one of the biggest Army bases on the east coast. And we have to figure out a route to bring that pet from New York City all the way to North Carolina versus just having a flight that can go directly there.",
