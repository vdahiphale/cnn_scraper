I'm Erin Burnett live at the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, joining Bianna today.Here, the fallout from the attempted armed insurrection in Russia is reverberating across the front lines and the entire region. The Kremlin right now says that Russian President Vladimir Putin is meeting with the heads of law enforcement agencies after that attempted insurrection threaten Putin's iron grip on power. And last hour, as Bianna mentioned, Putin's address the nation, calling rebellion lend by the Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, a mutiny led by traitors who betrayed their country. Putin also offering the Wagner fighters who did not participate a chance to join the former rescue military. But it's not suggested in that may have led to the insurrection in the first place, because earlier today Prigozhin claimed he wasn't even trying to overthrow Putin. He says he was demonstrating against the government's attempts to take over his military, and to force his fighters to sign contracts with the Russian ministry of defense. The Russian prime minister admitted today that Moscow faced a, quote, challenge to its internal stability. And Prigozhin and his fighters took over a southern Russian city on Saturday and threatened to march all the way to Moscow. All of this was unfolding in Russia as Ukrainian forces claim that they'd been beating back Russian forces and taking territory, making advances around the embattled city of Bakhmut in the east and other parts of the southeast. And I want to bring in CNN's international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson to begin our coverage today. Nic, let's start with what we just heard from Putin as Bianna said finally breaking his silence, but days have passed before he did so, brief remarks. The Kremlin spokesperson claims Putin's speech would, quote, determine the fate of Russia. Well, if that's the case, then would we take away from it?",

Putin surely hopes it would determine the fate of Russia because he's trying to say, you know, he is part of the savior, part of the saving Russia from the possible uprising, this armed uprising, dangerous uprising on the streets of Russia by these forces coming into the country.This is a narrative that the Kremlin wants. This is the narrative that they want to set. That everything is okay now. Everyone pulled together. We're going to hold these people to account. We're not going after the soldiers, these Wagner mercenaries, the ones that didn't do anything wrong. They can sign up and become a proper part of the military. And no surprise, Putin blaming the West and Ukraine for trying to foment and exploit the situation. This very typical of Putin, very typical of how the Kremlin defends itself at a moment of weakness. Fascinating here that he doubles down on Prigozhin, won't name him, which shows you how much Prigozhin is under Putin's skin. He doubles down calling him a traitor. Which begs the question, if you are still calling him a traitor, and only a few hours earlier he was able to call you, and your government out again, why did you let him go and escape on Saturday? Which seems to point that Putin's weakness, which points to my point, that they hope that this will help but some parts of it don't make it sound like as if it will -- Erin.",

We heard very little from the White House over the weekend other than the fact, to convey the fact they are actively monitoring the situation. And that was strategic because they did not want to land any appearance of Western interference. The president today himself emphasize that strategy saying that he wanted to give no excuse to Putin to be able to blame the West or NATO for what was happening inside of his country. And today, that silence, that caution continued as John Kirby, he declined to even define exactly what happened in Russia. Or to weigh in on Prigozhin's motives, what this means for the future of Russia. That's in part because the U.S. doesn't know exactly what will happen next as the president emphasized today.
