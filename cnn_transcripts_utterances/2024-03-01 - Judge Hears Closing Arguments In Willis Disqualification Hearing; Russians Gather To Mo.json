Also, drastic measures being taken, as President Biden says the U.S. military is now prepared to start dropping humanitarian aid, from the air into Gaza, to get food, water and medical supplies, to so many who are starving. Also, as lawmakers in Alabama, my home state, are rushing to protect IVF, couples in the middle of the process are still left shaken, fearing that their dreams of growing their families could be shattered. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Two more big steps, and Donald Trump's full-court press, to keep delaying his most serious trials, until after the election. For the Republican frontrunner, even no ruling really looks like a win, tonight. That fact was only amplified after the Supreme Court dropped anchor this week, on the federal case in D.C. That's the one about his efforts to try to overturn the election, in 2020. And then, in overlapping hearings today, judges heard arguments, in two of Trump's most dangerous cases, both personally, but also politically. Both judges went home without a ruling. The former President sat in court, near his home, in Florida, as Judge Aileen Cannon said that the government's proposed July schedule, for the classified documents trial was quote, \"Unrealistic.\" At the exact same time as that was going on, in Florida, 500 miles north, in the Georgia election conspiracy case, District Attorney, Fani Willis, grabbed a front-row seat, for apparently the final day of attacks, allegations and accusations.

It's one or the other. There's no gray area here, about whether she has some sort of untenable financial interest. But the problem is the evidence was such a mess, it was so confusing and unclear and so muddled. And now, the judge is going to have to sort of wade through this.

And so, again, it is a high bar. The Supreme Court in Georgia is very clear, in that matter, and that the appearance of impropriety is insufficient. So, I think what you saw, from the D.A. today is her being in court, and really demonstrating to all involved, the citizens that elected her, her team, the defense, that she maintains that this is her case, she's still involved, very heavily involved, in this case, and she's going to see it through.

But in a case, where there have been charges? The allegations are out there. These remarkable inflammatory serious allegations, they are already out there. And what the Justice Department is saying is, there's no -- there's no interference issue. What we're talking about in terms of having a trial, it's not election interference. It's providing election information. It is actually forcing the government to present the facts to a jury. It is having the jury decide this issue. If there's any interest, in terms of the election, the interest is, in fact having these trials, so that the voters have this information before they make the decision. COLLINS: Can I get your thoughts on one other moment, where it was from reporters, who were in the room, said that there was a moment where Jack Smith sat up straight, kind of raised his eyebrows, when the judge was asking a prosecutor, on his team, about when they plan to reveal their witness list, which the prosecutor said they're not prepared to do yet.

And what the government was saying is, at this moment, so early in the case, before there's been a trial, we're worried about harassment, that is, those names and information should be as close in time as possible to the trial, which is why it was sort of shifting. It's like, well, when do we get the witness list? It's like, well, let's deal with these preliminary issues. But let's pick a trial date first.
