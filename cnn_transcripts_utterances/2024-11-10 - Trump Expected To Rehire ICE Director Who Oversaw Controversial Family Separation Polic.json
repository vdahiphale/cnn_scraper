It's a tradition after elections, but it's one that did not happen in 2020, when Trump was falsely claiming that he had won the election and that Joe Biden had not. But tonight, we're learning new details about what this meeting is going to look like and what President Biden plans to say when he's behind closed doors with Donald Trump. And it's just the two of them in the Oval Office.The White House says that Biden is committed to the peaceful transfer of power, unlike Trump, and that the two men will go through top issues, both foreign and domestic, and exchange their views on that. I'm joined tonight by Anthony Scaramucci, who, of course, spent a few days as Trump's White House Communications Director and always has an interesting perspective. First, can I just get your thoughts on this meeting between Trump and Biden? Because my first thought was, I hope that there's a pool spray, which for those who are not, you know, versed in White House lingo, that means reporters get to come into the room with the cameras and the microphones to witness the meetings that are happening, at least the beginnings of them. I mean, what do you think it's going to be like when Donald Trump and Joe Biden are in the room together?",

He was very respectful and very charming to Barack Obama eight years ago.He was also respectful to Vice President Harris at the 9/11 memorial ceremony two months ago. So I don't see this going awry. I don't see these guys fighting with each other. They'll be cordial. But again, this is something that President Biden is affording Donald Trump, but not something that Donald Trump afforded President Biden. So there is some asymmetry there.",

I don't think they're going to set up the conflicts that they had set up in the first administration.

And so -- but, you know, listen, he's at his best when he's coordinated and he's doing the things that he likes to do. And I think Susie knows that.So his schedule is going to get set up in a way where he'll be making decisions. He likes to do certain things. He doesn't like to do other things. She'll -- she'll cut those out of his schedule and delegate it to other people. And so I think, you know, look, I'm hoping for the best possible outcome. But again, if they do 15% of what was promised on the campaign, it'll hurt the economy. It'll hurt the culture of America. I mean, I certainly don't want caravans of people deported and put in concentration camps, which more or less technically is what they would have to do. So -- so I certainly would speak out against that. But if the right wing is saying, well, he didn't really mean all that, that was just nasty rhetoric during the campaign. Let's give him a chance to govern and let's hope he does a good job for all the American people. And listen, he got a mandate, Kaitlan. You know, he got -- he won the popular vote. And frankly, I like that better. I think it's better for him and it's better for the country that we don't have him getting in there just on the Electoral College.

The American people ignored that. The majority of the American people have spoken.

They heard the warnings that people like myself and John Kelly or Mark Esper, you pick the 40 people said.And so I'm an American. I am hopeful. I'm an optimist. I want them to do well.

And Faiz Shakir, Bernie Sanders' Chief Political Adviser. It's great to have you both here, Chuck. Just listening to what Pelosi was saying, she was arguing that this election is not a rebuke of Democrats. She said that a large part of the reason working class voters went to Trump in this interview with Lulu Garcia-Navarro, she argued was because of culture wars.

The example I have is 35 years ago, I joined the party. I joined the party of the Democratic Party because I was scared that my factory job was going to be sent overseas. So I got involved to fight against NAFTA. I also wanted to what I would say, drain the swamp, get rich people out of involved of like who makes my decisions for me. And then I was tired of seeing my tax dollars spent on overseas wars. I'd like to see that money spent in my neighborhood, in my community. Who does that sound like? That sounds like Donald Trump today. That's why he won. We've let him co-opt our message of the reason I joined the Democratic Party as a 19-year-old factory worker. And it's no different today. The fastest growing group of middle-class workers in this country are Latinos. It's another reason why you see Latinos moving a little bit to the right.

Trump gained 13 points.And if you're looking at that from just four years ago, if you're a Democrat, how do you explain that shift to yourself?

He showed up where men were consuming, whether it was rodeos, basketball tournaments, going to work sites before they opened. This is what the Democratic Party has to return to is an honor of work.

Bringing Tom Homan back, what does that mean for what that's going to look like his second time in office? ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah, one of the early conversations that the president-elect had after announcing that he would run for re-election, that he would run this campaign, he had a conversation with Tom Homan. His former Acting Director of ICE, and discussed these plans for mass deportations. Just so your viewers are reminded, Tom Homan was also somebody that did sign on and endorse the zero-tolerance policy that did lead to the separation of families when the president-elect was last in the White House as well. [21:30:12] The president-elect thinks highly of Tom Homan. We know that he has an interest of bringing him back into this incoming administration. He is likely somebody that has -- he is somebody that has influence over these immigration policies that really will take it to the next level from even the previous anti-immigration agenda that we saw when the President-elect was last in the White House. We know that there are plans to redirect funds from the military, from the Pentagon, in order to create these mass detention camps. We know that he does have plans to also use the military at the border and also for these kind of sweeping deportations throughout the country. We know also that Stephen Miller, who was the architect of his last anti-immigration agenda, is obviously a pivotal decision-maker in the forthcoming agenda as well. And Kaitlan, I think something that's worth noting too, you know, when I was reporting on this the last time around, there was time and time again, there would be a proposal that would be considered, you know, one was actually Stephen Miller considered busing migrants from the border into democratic cities. You might -- that might sound like what Greg Abbott is doing. He thought about doing that in 2019. He thought about trying to use health authorities to shut down the border before Title 42. When Trump was last in office, and actually career officials, ICE officials, would stand in his way. Sometimes general counsels as well would bring up concerns around the legality of some of these policies. This time around, they're looking for conservative lawyers that will fall in line and implement this agenda.

And for more on this, I want to get to CNN's Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst, John Miller. Because John, you know, I've been thinking about this when we've been talking to sources in recent days. I mean, this idea of deporting, it depends on who you ask, what the number is going to look like. Sometimes he'll say hundreds of thousands. They've said up to 11 million. I mean, in actual practice, what would that look like? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, in actual practice, it's not realistic. I mean, the estimates, and these are the government estimates, as well as the estimates from the migrant advocacy groups, are that there are somewhere between 11 and 17 million people here who are here illegally or out of status. There aren't enough ICE agents and Homeland Security people in the country to start doing that kind of removal. And during the campaign, they talked about things like a million a year. But Holman's signature operation was always to scan for people who were here illegally or those who had been deported before and were back and were in the system, meaning they'd been arrested for a crime. And that was kind of the triage piece, which is focused on the courthouses and the jails or zeroing in on a location where you know that individual is. How that got complicated, though, was you might hit an apartment looking for a wanted individual and then find the person or not find the person you were looking for, but then check the immigration status of everybody else in that apartment and they would get caught in the same net.

I'm also looking at the Chinese Import-Export Bank and how they're utilizing these loans to help developing nations build and grow their own economies to essentially buy favor with China so that they're allies of China versus allies of the United States.

And I'm just hearing that President-elect Trump has offered New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik the job as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. We reported last week on Friday that she was in the running for this position and now she is expected to get this job. We'll see, of course, if she formally accepts the role.Seeing how quickly that's moving down at Mar-a-Lago will keep you abreast of other new developments on that front as well. And also I should note tonight as we look at Trump's return to office, it is very likely that he is going to be taking it with something that he has never won before, the popular vote. And if Republicans control the House, as it looks like they're going to do, we're still waiting to call a few races, Republicans won't control the entire U.S. government. But the question tonight is does Trump's win count as a landslide? His 312 electoral votes actually puts him in the lower half of presidential election winners. Barack Obama and Bill Clinton won more in both of their campaigns. And they're all blown away by Ronald Reagan, of course, winning 525 electoral college votes in 1984. I'm joined by the presidential historian and president and CEO of the LBJ Foundation, Mark Updegrove. And it's great to have you here. When you do look at Trump's win, how does it stack up against previous elections here in the U.S.?",

So it's impressive in that regard.You talked about Ronald Reagan's win in 1984, without question a huge landslide. Richard Nixon in 1972, another landslide. But I think particularly in this divided environment, to get the mandate that Trump got, to get 50-plus percent of the popular vote, to get that electoral vote tally, that's an impressive win. And I think the one thing you have to say about this in terms of its historical importance, Kaitlan, is this is without question the most impressive political comeback not only in this century, but in the history of the United States.",
