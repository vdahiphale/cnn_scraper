It is kind of you have to adapt or die in college football, and coaches are realizing that coaching at a high level. Look at Michael Penix Jr. He's a guy in Indiana that had four different season-ending injuries at Indiana. He goes to Washington, has an incredible start. He's a guy who has been playing so well on these big stages. You've seen his draft stock kind of slowly rise, which is really cool.So I think for the transfer portal, that's a great story with respect to that. So it's not going away. We might see some changes with the timeline with respect to when players can opt in. There's obviously the early signing period with recruiting that makes that time in December really chaotic. But it's a lot of changes and unknown, but the sport and storylines and the players that make it great are still going to be the same. So it's exciting and it's a little weird to kind of see this era ending, but it's going to be a lot of fun. I can't wait.",

So what you can hear there is a whole lot of silence, plus swirling winds whipping through after a gaping hole ripped open in the plane's cabin midflight just shortly after it had taken off from Portland, Oregon. The pilot was able to make an emergency landing after about 20 minutes. One person was taken to the hospital with a minor injury. CNN aviation correspondent Pete Muntean has more.",

This latest incident happened in an explosive moment, like the most violent convertible you've ever been in. In this case a passenger jet on row 26, where there could have been a door, this plane did not have it. It had what's called a door plug. More on that in a second. That happened with a bang. Seven minutes into the flight at 16,000 feet, what is technically called a rapid decompression where the high pressure breathable air inside the plane goes rushing out and the cold thin air outside comes rushing in.We heard from a passenger that a boy sitting nearby had his shirt pulled off. The oxygen masks dropped, and pilots very quickly had to deal with this issue. I want you to listen to the calm in the air traffic control audio. Step one, fly the airplane. Step two, run the checklist, descend back to 10,000 feet where the air is more breathable. And step three, communicate with air traffic control exactly what is going on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But I think Alex is right that if Nikki Haley is somehow able to leapfrog Ron DeSantis here, there's going to be a dropout watch for DeSantis. He's gone all in on Iowa, and if he's not able to finish a strong second place, something where he beats expectations, where Trump has had these huge historic margins in the polls where he's been leading by. If he's not able to close that gap, especially since Nikki Haley's super PAC that's been supporting her and her campaign together, when you look at what they've been spending, they've now surpassed in the last two or three weeks DeSantis and the two super PACs supporting him in who has been spending the most money.

But the fact is that Obama brought this up months ago and nothing has really changed. So there's also a little bit of a competition between these two. There always has been. It's very typical, the president-VP relationship. And that's why Biden always remembers back in 2015/2016, where all of Obama's allies and Obama himself really dissuaded him from running for president back then. So sometimes Barack Obama's advice to Joe Biden is sort of met with a bit of defensiveness, not just by President Biden, but the people around him who sometimes think that Obama has never completely appreciated President Biden's skills.Now, what the advice Obama is saying is that right now all the senior leadership that is driving the campaign, they are all in the White House, basically doing two different jobs, and that the people in leadership in Wilmington, Delaware, are not empowered to make any decisions. This has created a bottleneck and indecisiveness on the campaign that has really not ramped up and is very far behind where Barack Obama's campaign was 10 years ago. And that is sort of the concern, that Obama feels there is not enough of a sense of urgency with Joe Biden's reelection campaign so far.",

That number is going to exponentially explode over the next several months as we get closer to this general election campaign where President Biden does have the advantage of an incumbency to be able to try to win over these disparate factions within the Democratic Party that he's been lagging with, frankly, especially younger voters, non-white voters. People kind of forget that former President Obama was the first president since Eisenhower to win with 51 percent or more. This is twice. So to do that, you have to be a pretty good campaigner.President Biden back then, when he became vice president, was put on the ticket because Obama needed an inside game player. And nobody doubts how good a job Joe Biden has done over the years when it comes to negotiations on Capitol Hill. But when it comes to being a campaigner nationally, to be inspirational and win over broad disparate factions within the party, if it wasn't for President Trump and him running against Trump, it's not really clear that Biden would have been elected. And certainly, when he ran on his own the last couple of times that he did, he didn't have the same lightning in a bottle effect that someone like Obama did. So having someone like Obama around, who is young still, and who can get out on the campaign trail and energize really key groups is something that this White House is going to need. The campaign is going to use him and they're going to need to have him out across the country campaigning for Biden as one of the key surrogates.",

He wants that message to be pushed towards Iran and to Iran's proxies. And this is perhaps most tense along the northern border of Israel at the moment. Hezbollah today saying they fired 62 missiles at a monitoring station in the north of Israel, a military monitoring station in the north of Israel in retaliation for the killing of Saleh al-Arouri, the Hamas leader in Beirut earlier on in the week. The Israelis say that they counted about 40 missiles incoming. They returned fire at what they described as a terror cell behind that attack.The IDF watching right now to see if Hezbollah escalate beyond this. But at the moment, this attack doesn't seem as if it's going to trigger, go above a threshold, if you will, to escalate the situation. It has that potential, but it hasn't so far. And this, a big issue for Secretary Blinken, as I say, on all his stops. But when he gets here to Israel, the focus very much on that northern border, but on Gaza as well. He's going to want to hear details of how Israel plans to get from the military operations, scale down to a day-after scenario where they can be a new administration in Gaza. But a couple of the issues he's going to push the Israelis on is better and more humanitarian access, food, water, medical supplies, not only just getting additional trucks containing that aid into Gaza, but making sure it gets dispersed around Gaza to the population, particularly in the north. And, also, he's going to want to see the civilians in Gaza allowed to get back to their homes. He's also going to want to make sure that civilians, the safety of civilians is prioritized. The feeling in the United States at the moment is that Israel isn't going far enough to protect civilians. So these are going to be big issues. Also, he's going to want to push to get the release of the hostages who are still being held there. And, again, that northern border of Israel, he's going to want to see that that is not going to escalate at this time, Fred.",

I mean, you do not see major news organizations like \"The New York Times\" publishing lengthy -- this was a 5,000-word opinion piece questioning the sexuality of someone, nevertheless the sexuality of someone like Taylor Swift, a prominent, obviously cultural force. But that's what they did this week. They published the story in the opinion section questioning her sexuality, even though Taylor Swift in the past has come out and said that she is a straight ally of the LGBTQ community, that she is just trying to show support as they've come under attack in recent years.And so that's what's led to a lot of criticism of \"The New York Times,\" including from some of the singer's associates. I have learned they are not pleased, to say the least, with \"The New York Times.\" One of the associates telling me, quote, \"Because of her massive success, in this moment there is a Taylor Swift shaped hole in people's ethics. This article wouldn't have been allowed to be written about Shawn Mendes or any male artist whose sexuality has been questioned by fans. There seems to be no boundary some journalists won't cross when writing about Taylor, regardless of how invasive, untrue, and inappropriate it is, all under the protective veil of \"opinion piece.\" That's from one of the people close to the situation over in Taylor Swift's camp. Now, \"The New York Times\" is not commenting, they're not directly responding to some of this criticism. But they have pointed to what Anna Marks, the editor who wrote this piece, actually wrote in her piece preemptively addressing some of the criticism. Marks wrote, quote, \"I know that discussing the potential of a star's queerness before a formal declaration of identity feels to some too salacious and gossip-fueled to be worthy of discussion. I share many of those reservations,\" Marks wrote. \"But the stories that dominate our collective imagination, shape our culture, permits artists and their audiences to say and be, every time an artist signals queerness and that transmission falls on deaf ears, the signal dies.\" And it goes on to say \"Recognizing the possibility of queerness while being conscious of the difference between possibility and certainty keeps that signal alive.\" Now, obviously, associates close to Taylor Swift don't feel that's justification for publishing this lengthy piece, and now it appears there's some bad blood between them and the paper of record, Fred.",

Mickey Mouse, as seen in this 1928 Disney cartoon \"Steamboat Willie,\" is now open for public use for the first time. But there are a few caveats.Joining us right now, Jennifer Jenkins, she's the director at the Center for the Study of the Public Domain at Duke University. Jennifer, great to see you. So help us understand, what is this all about? What can and can't be done with this version of Mickey Mouse? JENNIFER JENKINS, CLINICAL PROFESSOR OF LAW: Thanks so much for having me and for your interest in this story. So what can you do? You can start your creative engines and you can use those early versions of not only Mickey, but also Minnie Mouse in your own creations. But you mentioned the word \"caveat,\" and as a lawyer, I'm here to give you some caveats. So the first caveat is that you can't use copyrightable features of later iterations of Mickey Mouse from films that are still under copyright. So it's not time to put \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" Mickey in your film. And the second caveat is that Disney still owns trademarks to the image of \"Steamboat Willie\" as it's being used as a logo. But the important thing is, even though copyrights automatically expire and trademarks don't, trademarks only prevent you from using that image of Mickey Mouse in a way that misleads consumers about where their products or services come from. So, so long as someone is seeing your new Mickey cartoon or you're new Mickey story does not think that it's produced or sponsored by Disney and knows that you're the one putting it out there, then there shouldn't be a trademark problem.",
