He's expected to honor the victims of the shooting during a rally. Running mate JD Vance and billionaire Elon Musk are also scheduled to be there. Meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris heads to North Carolina today to survey the impact of Hurricane Helene. She will also get a briefing on the recovery efforts. Harris held two events in the key state of Michigan on Friday, where she told working class voters that Donald Trump doesn't have their back. Here she is. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  As we stand here in a house of labor, we will not be fooled. We will not be gaslighted.

This is a hugely desperate situation for many civilians. As you noted, overnight, we have seen at least a dozen raid strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut.We have seen Israel's strikes on Lebanon actually spreading and hunting, rather, advancing across the country as you mentioned. Reports of an airstrike overnight in northern Lebanon near the city of Tripoli, targeting the senior Hamas official there, reportedly the head of Hamas' al Qassam Brigades, the military wing there. Again, no comment from the Israeli military on that just yet. Those reports coming from Hamas affiliated media. 3But we have seen these strikes advancing and deepening across the country. There certainly has not been any sort of de-escalation by the Israeli military in Lebanon. According to Hezbollah officials, we have seen yet further attempts to advance an incursion in southern Lebanon. Overnight, according to Hezbollah, that began at around 11:00 pm local time. And Israeli infantry pushed back. Again this coming from Hezbollah. Meanwhile, on the other side we've heard from the Israeli military reporting at least five projectiles being fired from Lebanon, targeting Israeli territory. According to the Israeli military, these projectiles were either shot down or fell in open areas. No casualties are said to have been reported. But again, the Israeli military is claiming that they are targeting Hezbollah militants, that they are targeting Hezbollah infrastructure across Lebanon. They say that they have killed at least 250 Hezbollah militants so far. But it is important to underscore that these areas that we are seeing being raided, being bombarded by the Israeli military, are by and large densely populated with civilians. This is a very small country. The areas in Beirut that we are seeing being targeted are densely populated, crammed, filled with residential apartment buildings. And what we've seen of course, as a result of this huge displacement crisis, Lebanese authorities saying around 1 million people in Lebanon are now internally displaced. We've seen this worrying surge in the number of Syrian refugees now, in fact, trying to flee Lebanon and return to Syria, despite the risks that they may face there. And of course, we have seen the key main route connecting Lebanon to Syria now also bombed by the Israeli military. So a hugely desperate situation for civilians there. And while we are hearing these evacuation warnings from the Israeli military for civilians, that they say are living or present near areas that they believe to be Hezbollah targets, by and large these warnings are not coming with enough time for civilians to get out, to get all their belongings. And, of course, to gather their children and evacuate. So it is a worrying situation and what we're hearing from monitoring groups is it's the level and intensity of bombardment that we're seeing is really unprecedented at this stage.",

But this will be really the largest scale conflict between the big, two big players, Israel and Iran. And the ramifications of that could be very enormous. It's been quite clear that the U.S. has really not been able to calibrate or manage or guide developments in the region. They have not been able to influence to any significant degree the decisions of the Netanyahu government. And maybe they have been able to deter Iran in a very limited way.

But I don't think the United States has any other option or any other setting at this point but to support Israel, even if they disagree on the targeting or on the action. If Israel does target whatever it wishes to target on Iran, Iran is going to retaliate. And then the U.S. will be in the position of, quote-unquote, \"defending\" Israel.

This is much bigger than influencing an election, even a U.S. election. They're quite aware that any administration in the U.S. will be supportive of Israel. As Biden said, the Biden administration has been very supportive of Israel. So I think, you know, their reaction to October 7, especially with a right-wing government in place, they went overboard in devastating the Gaza Strip and seeking to maybe reoccupy it. They turned to the northern front with Hezbollah with a great breakthrough in intelligence capacities. And really dealt almost a knockout blow to Hezbollah. And now they feel, without Hezbollah in its operational shape, Iran is very vulnerable and now is their chance to go after it. So I think they're making their calculations based on their own sort of perception of threat and opportunity. The fact -- I think it's not a secret that Benjamin Netanyahu favors Trump over Biden. I think that's obvious. But I don't think they're making these major decisions just in order to influence an election. But perhaps, yes, I do think they would prefer Trump over Vice President Harris.
