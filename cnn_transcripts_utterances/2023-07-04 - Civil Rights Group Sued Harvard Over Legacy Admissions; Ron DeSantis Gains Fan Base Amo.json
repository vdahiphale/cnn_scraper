      "sentences": "And it's all spelled out in the data they include in this complaint. They use admissions numbers. Let's look at some of that. And it becomes very clear the case they're making.They argue that for the class of 2026, for instance, some just under 2000 students were accepted out of an applicant pool of over 61,000. That's a pretty low admissions rate of 3.24 percent. But it's very different if you are some kind of legacy applicant. They looked historically from 2014 to 2019. They found that applicants related to a donor were seven times more likely to be admitted. So, their admissions rate was 42 percent during that period. And if someone was related to a parent or other relative have gone to Harvard, they were six times more likely to be accepted for an admissions rate of just over 33 percent. Those with no legacy were getting in at a rate of about 6 six percent. So, there's clearly a significant difference. And the timing here is important because now that the Supreme Court has said you can't use race, these groups are arguing that is even more imperative to eliminate any policies that disadvantage students of color. They're arguing that this one which largely benefits white students puts students of color at a disadvantage. And that's, of course, because a college admissions -- a spot in college is something that is a zero-sum game. If a legacy applicant gets it, it means that someone else who's trying to get on their own merit doesn't get it. Bottom line, they argue that if Harvard gets rid of these preferences, they're going to see acceptance rates go up for minorities and go down a bit for white students, Sara.",

But they're alleging that it violates the Civil Rights Act, which applies not just to public colleges, but to private colleges as well.So, they're saying, you know, listen -- and they're not by the way, suing Harvard directly, they're just filing a complaint with the Department of Education asking for an investigation, saying less in the Civil Rights Act requires you to treat these groups the same -- everyone the same. Protected groups like unprotected groups, and so on. And they're saying this is systemically racist because it elevates these profiles -- these applicants who are overwhelmingly white at the expense of applicants who are not. It's not merit-based, it is not inherently race-based or explicitly race face, but the impact is race-based. And so, that's what they alleging the complaint is. And what's very interesting, it's not so much that there's going to be money recovered or certain plaintiffs that are vindicated by this. But if the Department of Education investigation proceeds, there'll be a lot of universities who are really, really under the microscope about how they look at these admittance procedures and that could be embarrassing for them. So, I think what they're trying to prompt here is just more conversation. They're trying to prompt changes to these policies that are voluntary from Harvard and from all similarly situated schools that are so prestigious. And they admit so few people really when you look at the numbers.",
