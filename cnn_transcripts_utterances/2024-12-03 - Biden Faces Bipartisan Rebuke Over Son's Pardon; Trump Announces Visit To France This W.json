As Donald Trump prepares to return to the White House and Joe Biden prepares to exit, a stark contrast now playing out both domestically and around the world for Donald Trump, the once and future president is finding himself again at the center of world affairs with leaders like Canada's prime minister making the trek to Mar-a-Lago just this past weekend and now he's also getting invitations to go abroad. Trump will be in Paris this weekend for the reopening of the Notre-Dame Cathedral, at the invitation of French President Emmanuel Macron. All of this happening while Trump assembles a cabinet of loyalists preparing to carry out his agenda, backed by a party showing almost unanimous allegiance to their incoming leader. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK):  The American people gave President Trump a mandate. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  And what they've delivered with the mandate in this election is a demand that we shake up the status quo. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO):  This is the president's cabinet. He's got to choose people who he has confidence in. REP. TOM EMMER (R-MN):  Americans elected a Republican president, a Republican Senate and a Republican House with a mandate. SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL):  The Senate is going to give great deference to a president that just won a stunning what I think is an Electoral College landslide, when all is said and done and a mandate, and he's being -- being given a mandate to govern.

It is absolutely stunning. This is he described it as the soul of France. It's, you know, on many peoples bucket lists, it's a place of worship for many people around the world. And it burned down in 2019, or the roof fell through and they've completely refurbished it to the most extraordinary level, more than $700 million worth. And it's come out like new. So it looks like a completely new building. But actually what the historians love about it is that they've actually just restored it to what it would have looked like in the 12th century. So I think that, you know, this is a big moment for France. So they've invited heads of state, and they were expecting the U.S. ambassador to France to go along. And they've just heard that it's actually going to be President Trump. So it's all been ramped up a level. The background to this is that there's a growing fear in the European Union, of which France is a key member, that Trump is about to launch a trade war against the European Union which could be hugely, hugely destructive. So, knowing Macron, he's going to use this as an opportunity to absolutely throw everything at Donald Trump, give him you know, the red carpet treatment in front of all of these world leaders at an event the world will be tuning into and showing how much he can charm President Trump to try presumably to just reduce the impact of any sort of trade war that might be coming.",

You know, if you want to be our ally, you need to work with us. But Europe depends on Chinese imports. And if they don't bring them in, the prices are going to go up here combined with any tariffs that the U.S. is going to put on EU imports. So there's a massive fear that the literally that the European economy could collapse because of what Trump is about to bring in. And it will, you know if you want to make it symbolic, then you do target French wine, for example, in the same way that you might target scotch whiskey from Scotland. I will say that, Kasie, there's a very interesting there was a really interesting speech by the British prime minister yesterday where he actually spoke to this issue. He said, there's this idea that if Donald Trump does launch a trade war with the European Union, then Britain is going to have to choose whose side it takes. Is it going to go with America, or is it going to go with Europe? And it's not going to be able to survive without choosing one or the other. And the prime minister saying we can deepen relationships with both, but people actually think that that's not a realistic point of view. It's a big moment for the U.K. to decide whether to go with Donald Trump or with the E.U.",
