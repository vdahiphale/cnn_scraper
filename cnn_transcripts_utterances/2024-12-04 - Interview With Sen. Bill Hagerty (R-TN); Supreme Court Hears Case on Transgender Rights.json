Charles, investigators, you have heard what they're saying, that this was a targeted shooting.

Multiple people went by, that if he just wanted to do a random shooting, he certainly would have had the opportunity to do it.The victim was across the street at his hotel coming across to the Hilton for the conference. After he passed the gunman, the gunman opened fire. So this does sound like it was targeted, it was planned. The individual fled on foot, then got on an e-bike and left, went in the Central Park. So he had an escape route all planned out as well. So, this certainly doesn't sound like some random shooting that took place. The question is, why? Is this something that was a beef with that individual, or is it an issue with the insurance company, and he's taking it out on the CEO? We just don't know the answer to that. But the priority right now is going to be to locate this individual. And they do have some things to work with now that's going to help them perhaps narrow things down to identify the person who committed the crime. MATTINGLY:  Charles, during the news conference, law enforcement officials made very clear it was early on in an investigation. They were sparing no expense in terms of resources to try and find this individual. I was struck by two things. And Brianna and Shimon both mentioned it, one, the proficiency with weapons that they perceived by his ability to clear a jam. But also there were questions about the potential use of a silencer.

So it could very well be a silencer.The fact that he was able to clear a jam very quickly does show a level of proficiency with a firearm. But he also left behind some evidence. I mean, you have three shell casings and three live rounds. They will be testing that for fingerprints, for touch DNA.

There are a lot of Republicans who do have concerns about all the reports that they have, all of the misconduct allegations that have come out over the last several weeks. And there are more than three. Remember, he can only lose -- afford to lose these three Republican senators in the new Senate in order to get the job and be confirmed as the next secretary of defense. There are more than three Republicans who have concerns. Whether they actually vote no, that's another question, but they're at least more that have concerns. So he has some work to do. And as you can hear here this is all part of this new effort to try to go out publicly, contend that he -- these allegations are all false in his telling and tell senators that he can actually do the do the job. The question is, do the Republican senators agree with that? He just met moments ago with Senate -- the incoming Senate majority leader, John Thune, about all of this. And we expect a critical meeting this afternoon with him and Senator Joni Ernst. She is a member. She's a Republican who's served in combat, somebody who's actually a victim of sexual assault and someone who's pushed to change how sexual assault claims have -- dealt with throughout the Pentagon. And, of course, Hegseth has been accused of sexual assault, something that he has denied, but Ernst has been pointedly not taking a position about whether she would support Hegseth, but has said that she would have a thorough conversation with him and frank conversations with him when he meets later today. How does she deal with what Hegseth has been saying privately and publicly? Will she come on board? And will the other Republican skeptics as well, people who are uncertain if they will back him, like Senator Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, other Republicans, will they fall in line? And the ultimate question here too, Brianna, is whether or not Donald Trump continues to stand behind him. Hegseth has been telling reporters all day that Trump has his back, is still behind him, and he spoke to Donald Trump before coming to the Capitol. The question is, how long does Trump have his back? And will these misconduct allegations ultimately become too much of a distraction and force him to bow out? That is what a lot of people on both sides of the aisle are watching here as Hegseth is making the rounds and trying to make the appeal that he should get the job.",

And it's important because Neil Gorsuch was the author of the one decision that the justices have already issued on transgender rights. And in that case involving a statutory protection, not the Constitution as is issued -- at issue here, he wrote the opinion that said that, in the workplace, transgender people should be protected from discrimination because it is based on sex. But he said nothing to either side. And, obviously, it might not matter what he thinks because it looked like there was a sure majority to, as I say, vote for Tennessee. Some of the concerns that came from the liberals is just, what's going to happen to some people who were already getting this treatment in Tennessee and not be able to complete the treatment? And Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first African-American woman on the court, did raise the question of, what about for all kinds of discrimination, all kinds of violations of the Equal Protection Clause?

And President Trump again indicated his support. I have been behind Pete from the very beginning. He's actually been using my office as a base as he meets with other senators. And he's done a very good job. It's a process of advice and consent. He's stepping through this. And he's taking a tremendous amount of incoming pressure for very obvious reasons. He's here to change the Pentagon. He's here to put the Pentagon back on a mission of lethality, getting away from pronouns and social experiments, and fixing a broken procurement system.
