It has given off some, but we're holding steady, right around a hundred points, the gains are up the market. The market, the main market is the Dow, these are the events that you and I are talking about today: President Biden makes his case for re-election to the American people. It's the State of the Union. New plans to provide aid to Gaza and in fact, billionaires. Labor strikes, paralyzing rail and air travel throughout Germany. And the drugmaker, Eli Lilly, has a new unconventional ad campaign urging people motivated by vanity not to take their weight loss drugs. We are live in New York, joining you, on Thursday, March the 7t, I am Richard Quest and tonight, as I say, I mean business. A very good day to you. Six hours from now, President Biden will deliver his State of the Union. It will give him his biggest audience of the year and use the platform to tackle issues that are crucial to his re-election campaign. So we are expecting major announcements on the economy, border security, and indeed the war between Israel and Hamas, which has been such an issue for him as we saw in the primary season. Let's start with that conflict. It's told that President Biden is to announce plans for a port in Gaza that will be able to deliver humanitarian aid. Now look at the map, because the port will have a temporary pier. The aid will come from Cyprus and will be coordinated with Israel, UN, and other humanitarian organizations with senior officials saying initial shipments would be largely sea, cross the Med from Cyprus. The US has been increasing its humanitarian efforts. Last weekend, it began air dropping aid to Gaza. And you see where the aid was falling from, it was actually falling along the coastline where people were then rescuing the pallets from the sea. CNN's military analyst, Cedric Leighton is with me now. Sir, when we've spoken before, look, how does it work? I mean, I understand that the US has easily the capability to go and build portable piers, pontoons. This is meat and veg to a Navy the size of the US. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:   Yes, Richard is this is one of the greatest capabilities that the US Navy has, and in fact, their Seabees, which is the construction and engineering corps, they are well- versed in building these temporary port facilities. So they have the technical wherewithal, they have the equipment, they have the raw materials to build this pier and create this port basically out of nothing on the Gaza coast, and you correctly pointed out that the staging area for the goods that will be shipped to this port and then transported over land will be Cypress. In fact, Larnaca, Cypress, that's going to be one of the key things in this effort. So it's going to really help increase the volume of humanitarian goods that can flow into Gaza. And that will of course, the effort will be there to alleviate the suffering that that the local population has.",

Now, these same organizations that can't get through the Rafah or the Israeli port, they will be the same ones providing the materials that will be coming over on a boat except for the American stuff itself. Israel won't be able to surge that stuff coming in. I'm just wondering how much of all of this is a go around, a frustration, if you will, that basically says to Israel, you wouldn't do it.

It's one thing to do something like this atthe Rafah crossing, for example, in southern Gaza. It is quite another to do this in an area where there is no even land connection to Israeli territory. So it's going to be, I guess, somewhat analogous to, you know, boarding the Eurostar in London and going to Paris with the French Customs guys sitting there in London. But it is obviously a much more serious issue than just transporting people from one European capital to the other. So this is going to be a really big -- a big issue, I think, for the Israelis. We'll see how well they accept it, but it is definitely a US effort to circumvent all of the slow rolling that has been going on when it comes to delivering humanitarian aid for the Gaza population.",

They might be getting by, I can -- it is very much the case that income inequality has decreased in recent years, but people don't necessarily see those graphs, right, they don't see those charts. Instead, what they experience is their everyday life and they see, you know, they're struggling to make ends meet, they're struggling to have their household budget come together, they see the car repair bill that they can't pay, and they very much feel that health care bill that's impossible to pay.",

The scarce supply for those people who actually need them. Eli Lilly makes two drugs similar to Ozempic. Ahead of this weekend's Oscars ceremony, it put out this advert saying, if you're not obese, don't take our drugs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

New York Community Bancorp shares, now today, remember, yesterday they're around 40 percent then they recovered as the regional lender got an influx of investment. Now they're up 5 percent, still down in the toilet, but it was the billion-dollar lifeline that helped claw them back from yesterday's losses when the cash crunch sent shares into a nosedive, then result in trade, et cetera, et cetera. The bank is not out of the woods yet. It's installed new leadership, replacing its CEO, and adding four new board members. And one of the tasks is of course to get rid of these deposit shortfalls. They're down 7 percent over the past month. So if you look at how all this has factored into the market, and bearing in mind yesterday the chair of the Fed did not seem too concerned. I mean, he said there are vulnerabilities, but there was nothing systemic, there was nothing crucial, et cetera, that he was particularly worried about. Well, now you see sort of a slight change in that. You can see today's market much stronger, rallying ahead of tomorrow's jobs report. The S&amp;P and the Nasdaq hit fresh record highs on the back of the Jerome Powell testimony. And so to that story we're telling you about, the Eli Lilly telling celebrities not to use their drugs if not necessarily, Meg Tirrell is with me to talk about this. This idea, I mean, it's very, very unusual two basically say to a group of people don't take our drugs, you're depriving those people who really need them.",

And we don't know actually hear them actually say what the names of the drugs are. Lilly make Zepbound and Mounjaro. But we talked with Eli Lilly's CEO about how they're sort of capitalizing on this moment leading into the Oscars, knowing that there was that big joke from Jimmy Kimmel, the host last year, and perhaps a lot of talk about it this year.

And what's interesting is that markets have dialed back those expectations, right? March is off the table. May is unlikely. So not until June that investors are expecting a rate cut. And yet what's interesting is that the market is at all-time highs. I think that is a bit of a surprise and I think it's because of two reasons really. One, corporate profits are really, really high. And those recession fears that we heard so much about, they've really faded. And so we're in a situation where right now good news is good news.
