      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\". I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, Ukraine's President arrives in Canada, fresh off his bumpy talks with U.S. lawmakers, details in just a moment. Also had a new CNN poll shows the Joe Biden leads Donald Trump and a potential New Hampshire rematch but dissatisfaction with both remains high.CNN's Political Director joins us with a read on the new numbers and increased activity at nuclear test sites, in Russia, China, and the U.S., our exclusive report coming up. We begin in Crimea where Russian state media is accusing key of striking the headquarters of Russia's Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol. It says debris is scattered for hundreds of meters and ambulances are on the way so far. Ukraine hasn't commented. Crimea was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014. Bring you more on that as we get it in. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, is in Canada to rally support for his country's defense in its battle with Russia. He and his wife were welcomed to Ottawa by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Later today he'll adjust the Canadian Parliament. His visit comes on the heels of his trip to Washington D.C. Mr. Zelenskyy left the U.S. with a promise of more than $300 million in new aid for the war effort. U.S. President Joe Biden has proposed a much larger aid package but that's proving to be a hard sell to some Republican lawmakers. But in emotional remarks on Thursday, Mr. Zelenskyy made his case saying you give money we give lives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, we've been talking about attacks on Crimea, all of this week and last week, but this is potentially the most significant yet one Russian soldier killed.That's according to the Russian Defense Ministry, and also a huge amount of debris, hundreds of meters of debris around this area. And you can see from those videos, the level of smoke the damage as well. This is clearly quite a major attack on quite a crucial piece of infrastructure for Russia's war effort here. And let's not forget, just yesterday, we were talking about an attack on the Saki military airbase, there was 12 military aircraft being kept there. That was again targeted by Ukrainian attacks. Last week, we were talking about a ship repair facility, also in Sevastopol. All of this is key infrastructure Russia is using for its invasion of Ukraine. And it has been repeatedly targeted by Ukraine in the last couple of weeks, and clearly it is escalating further, the real question is, how did they manage to do this, these areas are heavily secured by Russia. So to be able to target successfully from these videos, you can see the headquarters for Russia's naval fleet must surely be quite alarming for the Russian side, Max.",

They also store ammunition. They train people on how to use drones. They also store all the ships that you're seeing this Black Sea naval fleet, all of this comes out of this area.And they've been using it to then link up with other areas where this invasion is ongoing. So it's pretty crucial for Russia's war effort. But it's also notable that this is impacting civilians. We're hearing just this morning from the Russian appointed Governor of Sevastopol. That they're telling people to stay inside residents to stay inside their building, seek shelter, don't go outside due to the debris. And not knowing if there was going to be a further attack. We're now hearing that the Russian governor is saying they're not likely to be a second missile attack. But that is the level of fear here clearly that there has been repeated attacks in this area that is affecting Russian civilians as well. So clearly, quite a big impact that Ukrainians are having and notable as we're talking about all this diplomacy in the states, Ukraine, insisting that they are going to make a breakthrough with this counter offensive Zelenskyy saying early this week that they are nearing the finish line. All of this is an indication that Ukraine is very seriously pushing for a breakthrough. These kinds of attacks on key pieces of Russian infrastructure really pointed up.",

It shows the Biden has a 12 point advantage over Donald Trump and a hypothetical rematch 52 to 40. That's a much wider margin than the national polls, which has shown the two in a neck and neck race.Let's go straight to CNN Political Director David Chalian with more on this.

      "sentences": "Yes, that is true. And you noted a swing state it seems to be a blue leaning swing state. Remember, a Hillary Clinton edged out Donald Trump here in 16. And Joe Biden pretty handily defeated Donald Trump three years ago here, but 52 percent to 40 percent, 8 percent unsure you mentioned independence, Max.Actually, Donald Trump is besting Joe Biden by six percentage points 45 to 39 percent, among independents so why is Biden leading? We'll take a look here he's got near universal support among his own Democrats. 94 percent supporting him in this matchup against Trump, whereas Donald Trump only has 79 percent support among his own. So even his advantage among independents can overwhelm what Democrats are doing for Joe Biden there. However, we should note both of these candidates, Max, are widely unpopular. We ask people would you feel negatively or positively if one won the presidency 56 percent says they'd feel negatively if Joe Biden won. Even worse, 62 percent said they feel negatively if Donald Trump won in New Hampshire, same when you look at their overall favorable and unfavorable ratings. They are underwater, Joe Biden 35 percent of New Hampshire voters have a favorable opinion, 53 percent unfavorable. That's a net negative of 18 points there. But Donald Trump favors worse, only 30 percent favorable, 62 percent unfavorable, 32 negative percentage difference there. And Joe Biden, as you noted, he performs better against Trump in New Hampshire than he does nationally. So too, does his overall job approval appear better in New Hampshire at 46 percent? Approve, then we see around 39 or 40 nationally.",

So if indeed, New Hampshire does not go first, or in fact, if it tries to go first, Joe Biden said he won't be on the ballot.But look, he's crushing his Democratic competition. 78 percent of Democrats in New Hampshire support him only 9 percent for Kennedy 6 percent for Williamson.
