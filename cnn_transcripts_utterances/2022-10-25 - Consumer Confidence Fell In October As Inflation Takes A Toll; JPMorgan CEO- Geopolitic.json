We view this decision by Adidas as a very positive outcome. Now, it might be a bit belated but it really illustrates two powerful things. First, anti-Semitism is utterly unacceptable and has consequences. That's what Adidas -- the action by Adidas today demonstrates. But, secondly, it also demonstrates, over the last several weeks, over the last two weeks, as you indicate, there's been an upswell, a surge of people, people using their voice, people joining ADL's campaign, Run Away From Hate. Dozens and dozens of celebrities raising their voice. You listed the numbers of companies that have taken their stand.
