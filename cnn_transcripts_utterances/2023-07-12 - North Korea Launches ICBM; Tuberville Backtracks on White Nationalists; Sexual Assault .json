It was during a special session called by Republican Governor Kim Reynolds to address the issue specifically. Demonstrators representing both sides of the abortion rights debate packed the statehouse. A reporter for \"The Des Moines Register\" caught a tense moment between two of the demonstrators you see that had to be broken up by a state trooper.Now, the bill excludes exceptions for miscarriages, when the life of the pregnant woman is threatened, and fetal abnormalities that would result in death. There are also exceptions for rape reported within 45 days, and incest reported within 140 days. Governor Reynolds says she intends to sign the bill Friday, at which point the ban would immediately go into effect. This would put Iowa with a growing list of states limiting or outright banning the procedure.",

We should also point out that this missile was launched at a very specific angle where it would have a very short flight. Again, only 74 minutes. However, this is a missile that has the potential of crossing the ocean, landing in other continents, and that is why there is so much attention to what happened over the last 12 hours here in the Pacific region at least.",

South Korea has made comments today saying that there will be consequences. As far as what happens next, that's still ambiguous. I can tell you, though, having spent time in the region, I wouldn't say that people are necessarily alarmed at this point, even though South Korea is saying there could be some consequences.

I think that one of the things that became clear to me was that while Republican leadership doesn't lean on members to change their stance, it was very clear that one after another Republican yesterday in the halls was making it clear that this was not a conversation they wanted to be having, this was not a conversation that they thought helped the Republican Party, and they wanted to quell it as quickly as possible.",

If there is a silent majority of whites in America who truly are threatened by the idea of race mixing or a non-white majority, that's what he seemed to be saying.
