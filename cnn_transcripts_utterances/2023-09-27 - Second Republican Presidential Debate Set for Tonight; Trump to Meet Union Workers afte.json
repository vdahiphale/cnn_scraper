It is 11 am here in Washington Wednesday, September 27th. Just hours until the second Republican debate and only 404 days until Election Day, this is today's \"State Of The Race\". Thank you so much for being here. As we discussed the seven top Republicans not named Trump will be in California tonight for the second presidential debate. Trump plans to skip tonight's event again. Of course, virtually every poll shows him with a commanding lead over his GOP rivals. Candidates who dared to cross the President at last month's debate were met with jeers and boos from a rowdy crowd in Wisconsin. It could be a different and more formal atmosphere tonight at the Reagan Library in California. But let's be real, this really looks like a race to be number two. And the challenge remains. Can any of these folks, any of these candidates have what it takes to be more than just a runner up? Let's dive into this all with today's panel Kristen Soltis Anderson is a CNN Political Commentator, Republican Strategist and Pollster and the Author of \"The selfie vote: Where Millennials are leading America and how Republicans can keep up\". We also have Paul Begala CNN Political Commentator, and Author, also a Counselor in the Clinton White House, and Margaret Talev, Senior Contributor at Axios, who serves as the Director at the Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship at Syracuse University. I am so honored to have all of you here today for our inaugural voyaged on \"State of the Race\" which our international viewers can find on CNN I but all of our viewers at home can also find on CNN Max. So our challenge is to help everybody understand what's going on today in this race. And Kristen, I want to start with you because this is your party. And what we are going to see tonight is all of them as we outlined jockeying basically right now to be the alternative to Donald Trump. What are you looking for through this debate, and I want to talk through each candidate individually, but let's keep it big picture for now?",

If there's not a clear winner, that's what we'll get. But we thought of the last debate, Nikki Haley wound up doing reasonably well. She only went up a couple of points in the polls. Let's be clear, she's not close to Donald Trump. But if she does a really good job in this next debate and consolidates the field around her. I still think she's a long shot let's be clear, but it would be the best news if you want to unseat Donald Trump for it to become crystal clear very quickly who that alternative is.",

There are donors in the Republican Party who are looking for a Trump alternative and trying to figure out whom to coalesce around. Should they coalesce around Ron DeSantis? Should they pick someone else? It seems like she's the other choice if it's not DeSantis. So that's a big opportunity for her that's really important. The other is that she does have a special role because she's a woman and because if you look at national polls, which have their limitations, they're not state by state polls. If you look at national polls, it's -- the early polling certainly suggests that she could give Joe Biden a run for his money in a head-to-head general election. She is not a supporter of abortion rights.

In a ruling, a New York state judge says Donald Trump and his adult sons are liable for fraud and that they bear responsibility for inflating the values of Trump's assets for years. As a result, the judge cancelled the Trump organization's business certificates that allow them to operate. And in theory, this could potentially end Trump's control over some of his key New York properties like Trump Tower. Donald Trump's attorney said that the family would appeal and call the ruling a miscarriage of justice. And again, we want to be clear here. This is a civil case. And it's unrelated to the four criminal cases that president has been indicted in, those involves accusations of election fraud and interference. My panel is back with me here. And we're also joined by Elliot Williams, thank you very much for as I was saying, we're going to need a lot of your expertise, I think over the course of the next year as we try to cover a four times indicted, likely Republican nominee. But this is a pretty peculiar situation, because this case, right, Letitia James, she basically went and said, is trying to prove that this fraud was created, it was, it is still set to go to trial. But this judge essentially looked at it and said, like, you don't need to prove anything to me. It's already obvious this fraud has been committed; I'm yanking his business certificates.

That's a big deal because Biden is enormously vulnerable to a left wing challenge.

And so for somebody like Nader to say, no, I'm not he doesn't love Biden, but he is his word, not mine. He says Trump in the Republicans are \"Fascists\". That's not my view.
