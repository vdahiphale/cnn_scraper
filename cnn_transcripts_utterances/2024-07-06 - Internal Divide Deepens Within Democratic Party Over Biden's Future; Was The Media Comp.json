That's 36 years hasn't happened this century. That's probably for a reason. No president with these economic numbers has ever lost reelection since we've been keeping economic numbers.The greatest weakness in any party is dissension for the nomination with an incumbent president. So, you get somebody like Pat Buchanan, who runs against George Bush in '92. What not -- he wasn't going to threaten him. But he cost him probably the election. What cost Jimmy Carter the election? Probably take Kennedy running. When you look at what Allan Lichtman, called the keys to the presidency, being challenged in the party is one of the key determinants if you can win or not. I don't think that what has happened in that debate, if President Biden stays in, I don't think it's what people are going to be talking about the last week. This is a long campaign. He has a very weak opponent with a lot to talk about. Now, look, I don't understand how that inner workings of the Democratic Party work. I mean, I know more about hip hop than I do about that. And I know more about eye hop and hip hop. But it seems to me that there is no reason based upon that not to continue to support what has been, I think fair to say the most successful first term president since World War II.",

      "sentences": "So first of all, let me begin by agreeing that Biden has had a fantastic presidency. His list of accomplishments is long. I've just come from England where it's clear there that the United States is leapt ahead almost all other developed countries in speed of growth since the Coronavirus pandemic. I admire his foreign policy. He's been an excellent leader of the free world and I use those terms and, you know, within full meaning. I mean, he's defended -- he's organized the Defense of Ukraine in a really spectacular manner. He has a great administration.However, an election is not about the past. It's about the future. It's about it's not a judgment on his first term. It's about what comes next. And in my Atlantic article I argued that a political party that was really cold blooded and that said what do we have to do to win. [09:10:10 Would look at -- would look at the math, look at the states and say there are three states that we need to win. We need Michigan, we need Wisconsin, and we need Pennsylvania. So let's look at the three governors of those states. Let's let them compete. And by the way, I agree with you that you could make not only could you make the Democratic National Convention really interesting and fun, you would also ruin the Republican National Convention because they'd have no opponent to attack. You could have the three of them run, you could, ha0ve Harris run as well. You could have a short competition. You could have, maybe President Obama and Hillary Clinton being the moderators. You could you could do town halls, you would have an exciting competition, you would have, you know, people arguing and then you would have a winner. And then it would be possible, after you have voted the convention for people to unite behind the winner. And remember that Democrats like competitions, remember they liked that Obama emerged from almost nowhere, that Clinton emerged from almost nowhere that they both emerged to become president through the primary process. That's how Joe Biden became president four years ago, because he won a primary. Democrats like primaries, they like seeing who wins them, and they like then uniting behind them. And I think that is, given the circumstances given that, as you said, the situation is not going to improve, and it could even get dramatically worse I think now is the moment to make that leap. SMERCONISH: Last night, the President was asked by George Stephanopoulos, what happens if a delegation come to you, a group of Democrats that you respect, and they say that they think it's time to go, Let's all watch the response.

Altman, who every presidential cycle, did a thorough scrub based on medical information and his medical background of what the physical condition of the two candidates were. And you know, he'd start working on this months before the election.And why no news organization took it upon itself to undertake an investigation, I don't care that neither candidate would cooperate, you don't let that stop you.
