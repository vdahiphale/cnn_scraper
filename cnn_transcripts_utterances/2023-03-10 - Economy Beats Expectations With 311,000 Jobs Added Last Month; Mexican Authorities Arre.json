Now I obtained a copy from a source who's familiar with this investigation. I'll read you part of it. It says thatNow, it's worth pointing out that the source that I spoke with said that U.S. and Mexican law enforcement they doubt the sincerity of this apology. Again, it appears to be sent in response to all of the attention that has come upon this group of course. We have U.S. officials who have been demanding that the U.S. government do more to help try to curb some of the violence at the U.S./Mexico border. So again, the sincerity of that letter is certainly questioned. But they mentioned as part of that letter that they handed over members of their group. There was a photo that surfaced online showing five men on the pavement, their shirts pulled over their heads. We could not confirm that that was an actual -- those were actually part of this incident. But the Mexican officials today announced that they have arrested five people. There was a mug shot that you just saw. Again, still unclear what their exact alleged role was here. But of course, the families of those who were kidnapped, particularly those who were killed in this attack are demanding justice. In fact, our colleague Carlos Suarez spoke to the mother of one of the surviving members. And she wants to see law enforcement go forcefully after this group.

U.S. authorities are going to conduct their own autopsies. I can tell you having worked these murder cases in the past overseas, that when the FBI is building a case for a possible prosecution they would like, you know, basically for simplicity and ease, to have an American doctor conduct an autopsy so they have their own results.
