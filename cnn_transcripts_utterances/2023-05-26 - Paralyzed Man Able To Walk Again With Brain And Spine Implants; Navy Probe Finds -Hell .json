He's the first. He's the test pilot, but I'm sure it's going to work in other patients. So it works because his brain is intact and the part of the spinal cord that is controlling the leg movement is also intact. So we can put electronics above the region of the brain that is controlling leg movement and the region of the spinal cord that is controlling movements and we could then link them.

And those screenings and those potentially accountability will be taken against 10 people but that's still under investigation. But look, Kyle Mullen died even after his symptoms were made aware to his classmates and to other people who were training with him. He was coughing up orangish, kind of reddish blood, essentially, and his symptoms were not even transmitted to the Navy medical center because the medical staff that were overseeing the course were just completely uninformed, according to this investigation. And while candidates going through Hell Week are normally given a form of penicillin at the beginning of the course to reduce the chance of bacterial pneumonia, which is it appears if what Kyle Mullen had -- he was not given that penicillin because apparently, there was a shortage of it before the course began. And so, just a lot of questions here about why there was this inadequate screening. Why this was inadequate -- you know, just basic medical care. And there will be some overhaul of the system. Candidates now are going to be required to undergo medical screening every 24 hours. They will have to recover in a center afterwards.

And in human service the entire system really is built on Medicaid services so there is no plan B.And in my job I support people who are in crisis who have intellectual and developmental disabilities. So this unknown piece, if it affects Medicaid -- if there are deep cuts -- if the faucet turns off our entire system just stops. And so small business owners like myself -- yes, we would absolutely lose our jobs because I'm a Medicaid provider so I bill Medicaid. Because the folks who need these services most can't afford them to private pay, so they require services. And so, yes, it impacts us as small businesses. It also impacts the folks that we support because they pay their room and board with Medicaid. And so it's going to not just disrupt their lives but it's catastrophic for them as well.",
