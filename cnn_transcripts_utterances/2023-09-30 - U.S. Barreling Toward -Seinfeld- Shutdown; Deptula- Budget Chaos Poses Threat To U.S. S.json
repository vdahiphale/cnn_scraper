In the mid-90s, it was about spending cuts in the Clinton years.In 2013, the issue was bipartisan disagreement over the Affordable Care Act on President Obama's watch. In 2018, the issue was President Trump's desire to build a wall on the Mexican border. But this time, Michael Strain, Director of Economic Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, has started to refer to the impasse as the Seinfeld shutdown. It dates back to George's pitch to TV executives. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We'll get to the impact that it all has on the military in just a moment. Also on today's program, police say an online influencer live-streamed the widespread looting in Philadelphia this week and encouraged the targeting of specific stores. I'll discuss the thorny issue of whether law enforcement should be allowed to monitor social media to thwart such crimes. Or does that violate privacy rights?As a matter of fact, it's the inspiration for today's poll question@smirkanish.com. Go there. Answer this. Is it appropriate for law enforcement to monitor social media to prevent and solve crimes? Also on today's program is the biggest peril of artificial intelligence the trend of AI girlfriends on America's young men. They're already in a crisis of loneliness. And now that they can just program a fake ideal companion, will they ever learn to find a real one? Plus, considering California Governor Gavin Newsom isn't a candidate for anything, he's having quite a moment in the spotlight. He was the Democratic spin doctor at the GOP debate this week. He announced he'll be taking on Ron DeSantis head-to-head in a debate of their own on Fox News. And now, after the death of Senator Diane Feinstein, he has the tricky position of naming her temporary successor when three of his state's representatives are already trying to win the seat in 2024. But first, the current congressional impasse doesn't just threaten people's paychecks and government function, but also America's military capability and national security. That's what my next guest, retired Air Force Lieutenant General David Deptula, warns in a recent piece in Forbes under the heading Congressional budget dysfunction poses a threat to U.S. security, in which he argues this. \"The failure of the 118th Congress to sufficiently fund the requirements of the U.S. Military may have a higher likelihood of undermining our security than China does.\" Lieutenant General David Deptula joins me now. He was the Air Force's first Deputy chief of Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. He's a fighter pilot with more than 3,000 flying hours. He was the principal attack planner for Operation Desert Storm's air campaign. Commander of no-fly operations over Iraq in the 90s and served on two congressional commissions focused on America's future defense strategy. These days, he's the dean of the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. General, welcome back. What worries you most? DAVID DEPTULA, U.S. Air Force (Ret.): Well, Michael, first I think it's important for Americans to understand that with a government shutdown or even with a continuing resolution, the military is going to lose critical new initiatives to deal with the array of threats that are facing America. And the reason is simple. A continuing resolution essentially freezes spending to last year's appropriations and it doesn't allow new military programs to go into effect. So you're not going to see any new tracking satellites in space to counter hostile hypersonic missile launches. There won't be any new agile combat employment equipment to counter the Chinese and the Pacific. There won't be any new drones to replace our aging and geriatric air force. There'll be a halt in production of the new ballistic missile submarine as well as other delayed purchases of important military equipment like the stealthy F-35. So gridlock and congressional budget in action come at a steep price, especially given the scale and scope of the current threat environment.",

And so these are the kinds of issues that, when they see this kind of dysfunction occurring in the United States, tends to signal an opportunity for them to engage in adventurism. And they're the kinds of things that we simply that's an immediate indicator, but the long-term ones are much more damaging if you will.

Really kind of depends on their specific status in how long, the lapse in appropriations. But the over 2 million military personnel on active duty, they're going to have to continue to report to duty, but they're not going to receive pay for the work performed after today until those appropriation bills or a continuing resolution is passed, just like you heard the President say.The other part of this is the civilian workforce in the Department of Defense. There are over 800,000 civilians who work there and over half of them will be furloughed while the other ones are legally exempt because they're not funded in annual appropriations. The other point to bring to your audience's attention is retirees will get continued to pay because their pay comes from a trust fund, not annual appropriation. But one other point I'd like to make for you too, and that is that under a shutdown, the government stops payments on invoices that have not yet been paid or incurred before the shutdown. So there are some small private businesses out there who simply don't have the financial reserves to pay their cost and the government's not paying them.",

She declined CNN's request for comment, but later told a local TV station that her lawyer had advised her not to do interviews.What happened in Philadelphia isn't a lone incident, not a one off. Cities across the country are working to combat organized retail crime and performance crime, where perpetrators often brag about their actions on social media. With more people posting crimes publicly, online or using social media as a criminal tool. Police departments are stressing the importance of ramping up surveillance so that they can monitor accounts for threats or criminal activity. But they're facing stiff opposition from civil liberty advocates who say that it's just another way for the government to infringe on your right to privacy. Take Boston as just one example. In 2016, the city wanted to spend $1.4 million to beef up its social media monitoring but kicked it down the road after backlash from the ACLU, who said that it would chill free speech and could target communities already subjected to extra scrutiny, including Muslims and people of color. New York has ramped up their monitoring, even signing a contract with a company that uses AI to monitor online behavior. And in 2021, a public records request by the Brennan center found the Los Angeles Police department authorizes its officers to engage in extensive surveillance of social media without internal monitoring of the nature or effectiveness of the searches. The LAPD responded by saying that it works to keep residents safe and is committed to protecting their privacy rights as we confront the challenge every day. With me now to discuss is Faiza Patel, the senior director of the Liberty and National Security program at the Brennan Center for justice. Thank you so much for being here. To me, it seems natural, intuitive, logical that law enforcement would be following the social media accounts of individuals they know, or suspect are involved in this kind of activity. And if they know we're headed to the Apple store on Walnut Street, police ought to be there to meet them. What am I getting wrong? FAIZA PATEL, SR. DIR. LIBERTY AND NAT'L. SECURITY PROGRAM, BRENAN CENTER FOR JUSTICE: You're not getting anything wrong. It's just that's not the only thing that police use social media for, and that's the problem. So if you think about investigating a crime, for example, right, you know, of some kind of criminal ring that is posting things on social media that might be relevant to your investigation, of course, the cops should be able to look at that. If you know that there is a protest or a demonstration organized somewhere and the cops want to know, well, how many people do we need to have out there? What is the potential that things might get out of hand? What is our resource allocation? Absolutely, you need to be able to look at social media to do that. Unfortunately, because the rules are so lax, police also use social media to monitor protest movements. You mentioned the Boston Police Department's attempt to buy a $1.4 million contract for social media monitoring. Why did it get derailed? In part because evidence came out that the BPD was actually monitoring Black Lives Matter hashtags, as well as what they called hashtag Muslim Lives Matter and other political, religious, and racial protest categories. The same thing is true with the LAPD. It's not that were worried that they're going to be using it to solve crimes. We were worried because we found evidence that they were using it to monitor protest activities. So not to be --",

Tell me if you think that this is fair for comparison. And it said that if Faiza Patel is driving down the street, law enforcement can follow you as you go about your business in public. But in order to place a GPS tracker on your car, there's going to have to be a showing and a warrant.So how does that compare to this? Because this individual, who's been charged in Philadelphia with 185,000 Instagram followers, is very publicly allegedly making the case. Here's where we should go. Here's what we want to hit next. And so in my analysis, that's the case of law enforcement following you down the street. They shouldn't need to do anything.

When we used to think about surveillance, we would think about wiretaps, right? I call you. And if the police want to listen in, they need to get a warrant.Now, what we're looking at more and more is public surveillance, right? Which is the ability of technology to track people generally without their knowing, through cell phone, GPS, those kinds of technologies. Social media falls in a slightly different place because in those instances, you're not actively trying to reveal your location to anybody. You're just walking down the street, right. Whereas social media, you're actually putting information out there. So I think it is reasonable to allow police access to social media, but at the same time, we need to make sure that we have protections in place so that access is not used to monitor protesters and people who are exercising in their rights.",

Professor Scott Galloway told me that failing young men he perceives to be an existential crisis for the country. Why? Well, Pew found that 63 percent of young men under 30 are single compared with only 34 percent of women the same age. One in five American men who are unmarried and not in a romantic relationship report not having any close friends. And according to Pew there's a decline in the number of single men actively seeking relationships or even casual dates currently around 50 percent. Joining me now is Liberty Vittert, professor of data science at Washington University in St. Louis and opinion contributor for \"The Hill.\" So not to be prurient at this time of day, but are all the needs of these young men able to be facilitated, taken care of by A.I. avatars? LIBERTY VITTERT, PROFESSOR OF DATA SCIENCE, WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS: Well, you have to think about this word A.I. It's not a virtual girlfriend. It's an A.I. girlfriend. So, it learns from you. It learns what you like and what don't like, what kind of pictures you like, what kind of pictures you don't like. And while not all needs are met, that is the next step, is actual physical girlfriends. A.I. ones, for that matter.
