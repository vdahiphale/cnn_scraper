      "sentences": "And good day to our viewers in the United States and all around the world. I'm Max Foster, in for Kasie Hunt today. It is Thursday, November 23rd. Happy Thanksgiving to those in the U.S.Now, it's 5:00 a.m. in Washington where the White House officials are hopeful that Hamas will begin releasing hostages on Friday now. Plans to release the first hostages today under the deal reached between Hamas and the Israeli government ran into a snag yesterday just hours ahead of a truce negotiated as part of the deal. Now Israel says that the first group of hostages, women and children, won't be released until Friday at the very earliest, the reasons for the delay unclear. The White House National Security Council says the deal was agreed and remains agreed. The parties are working out final logistical details. Our primary objective is to ensure that the hostages are brought home safely. Now, just hours ago, officials in Qatar which is mediating the negotiations said timing for the truce could be announced at any moment. CNN's Oren Liebermann is live for us in Tel Aviv. I mean, what are you hearing at the moment, Oren, about the timing?",

But whether that means at midnight or later in the day, that's still an open question, which is why we're waiting for the announcement from Qatar when the pause in fighting and then the release of hostages set go into effect.As you pointed out, U.S. officials have said the delay was over the final logistical details, and that includes the location and routes of the hostages that they would take outside of Israel, because that hadn't been hammered out yet in all the details needed to make it happen, it was agreed to between Israel, Qatar and Egypt, that there would be a delay in the implementation of the deal and therefore, a delay not only in the pause in fighting but also in the release of the hostages. Crucially, this does not mean, according to officials we've spoken with, that there's any expectation that the deal is falling apart. It simply has taken a bit longer to get to the point where all the details are worked out and we're waiting for that announcement from the Qataris on when it will begin.",

We don't have any indication that Israel has received that list, and yet, that's not yet a cause for concern. If there's no list of the first group later on tonight, that may then become a different issue.But it is expected that names will be shared later on this evening and that will begin the transfer of the first 50 of women and children. Families here, of course, hoping that it will lead to all of the women and children. And from there, there is effectively a hierarchy of how this will go into the next groups. After women and children, it will be elderly men, and then foreign nationals and then the last group, arguably the hardest group to secure the release will be men and women who are of the age to be in the IDF. That presents its own challenge and frankly may require its own set of negotiations just like we saw to negotiate the first release of the women and children.",

      "sentences": "That will be one of several options. So Hamas will transfer the hostages to the Red Cross, likely in different locations. The Red Cross will then bring them to border crossings. Rafah is the one we've seen used in the past. That's what the first four hostages came out, but it is possible that they come out simply straight into Israel.And then depending on age, the age of the hostage release will determine who meets them. If it's children under 12, they'll be met immediately or as quickly as possible by family. If not, they'll be taken straight to the hospital, where their family will meet them, and there are a number of hospitals who are ready to intake the hostages who are released, and then the process continues. Palestinian prisoners will be released. They are from the occupied West Bank in Jerusalem, so they will effectively return home. And then if the first day works well, the process continues. The first two days, in fact, are viewed as testing days, according to U.S. officials, and if this works out, then you can begin to talk about extending the pause in the fighting and growing that number of 50 women and children to be released.",

And you've seen that in the families -- certainly in the families we talked to and in talking to people on the street here.There is some option. First, we saw it in the full cabinet a couple nights ago where two of the far right ministers voted against the deal. Not nearly enough to try to sink it. And then there have been appeals filed at the Supreme Court to try to stop this deal, three in total to this point. Those were rejected by the Supreme Court. Those were appeals or cases filed to try to prevent the release of Palestinian prisoners as part of this deal which would have, of course, sunk the entire agreement. But those are rejected and the deal itself moves forward. There are some who want to see everybody released, an agreement that would see all 240 or so hostages released at the same time. There are others who believe that the military campaign needs to continue until Hamas is defeated, and then the release all of the hostages. But broadly speaking, there is support for the agreement we're seeing come together, and hope that it comes together as soon as possible.",

Our teams on the ground are saying they have never seen this busy, especially over the past few weeks. But what we do know is that they are waiting in anticipation for that truce to come into effect to get the much needed aid into the Gaza Strip. In terms of what we know that has already gone in, I'll bring you someof the numbers of the 6,000 tons of food, 2,000 tons of medical aid and also 4, 500 tons of water. That -- those numbers were until yesterday. So, we're hoping to see a lot more going in. It might sound like a significant number of aid, but frankly, the organizations on the ground, Max, have been very clear that they are running out of water, that food is scarce, fuel is a very big issue because it can't -- you know, it's one of the deficits that you can't keep hospitals running if you don't have any fuel for generators. As of November 21st, we have seen 378 tons of fuel going in to the Gaza Strip, but huge deficits. The U.N. has categorically said they want to see more than just a truce.

It doesn't mean that it won't happen, but there could be some other things that need to be worked out. And in particular, I think that the areas around the actual physical transfer of the hostages from Hamas to the Red Cross and from the Red Cross to the Israeli authorities, that is an area that absolutely needs to run smoothly, and working that out is certainly a necessity. Of course, each side could take advantage of this delay. They might give other reasons for it, but I think at this moment this is something that just has to be worked out at this point.

They are going to move their forces into places where they may have a better position to engage the Israelis once the truce ends. And they may also want to move forces in an area where they are better protected. So that is something that could easily happen and they also engage in concealing their forces and their weapons.

You've got some snow starting to settle in across Oregon, Idaho and then gradually spreading into Nevada, as well as Utah, Wyoming and eventually Colorado. But the eastern half of the country seems to be a bit less complicated and that does include New York City for the big Macy's Day parade. The high temperature is about 52. Now, this morning, it's going to be a little cooler than that, temperatures into the mid-40s. Light breeze maybe about 10 miles per hour, but that should be necessarily high enough to cause any issues with the balloons, especially since they're going to be a little bit higher off the ground. But the key thing right here, mostly sunny, so at least it won't be raining. It won't be snowing. You're going to have the sunshine out in full force. Out in the West, that's a different story. Again, we notice all of the snow there, look at all these areas that are under some type of winter weather alert, whether that's for this morning or if that's carrying into the afternoon and evening hours. And you can see the system will gradually progress eastward so eventually ending up in cities like Denver and Albuquerque, as we head into the next 24 to 36 hours. Pretty significant snowfall accumulations expected, especially the higher up in elevation you go. Widespread totals, a lot of these are 4 to 6 inches, but again, once you start going up, now, you're going to be measuring upwards of a foot. One thing to note after the other system moves through, you got a lot of this cold air that's going to start to spread in and it's going to shift eastward. So, really, as we get into the back half of the weekend, and especially next week, you're going to start to see those below average temperatures taking shape in the eastern half of the country. Denver going from a high yesterday in the upper 60s to a high on Friday of only 25 degrees, having those snow showers mixed in as well. But the cold snap is short lived. Notice those temperatures will get back up closer to normal once we get towards early to middle portion of next week.
