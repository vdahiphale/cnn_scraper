      "sentences": "That's right, Max. You know, it's ironic that the Chinese are now accusing other governments of overreacting given, as you mentioned, they maintained some of the of the most draconian rules for some three years including measures targeting international arrivals, which by the way are now totally going away until this coming Sunday on January 8.Now to be fair, some outside analysts have also said the new China specific rules are now going to be effective given the transmissibility of this virus and the lack of proof so far that a new variant or subvariant has emerged from the latest wave of cases here in China. But as you said, the Chinese have no one to blame but themselves because of their lack of transparency. Despite their repeated denial. Now Chinese experts themselves have acknowledged in major cities like Beijing and Shanghai some 70 or even 80 percent of the population have been infected. That's millions of people in just two cities. But when you look at the official national figures, the number of cases and especially the number of deaths remain ridiculously low and that just doesn't match the reality. From my vantage point what's happening on the ground, it's still very much a tale of two realities. On the one hand medical facilities from fever clinics to ICUs still overwhelmed by people seeking medication or treatment. Especially senior citizens with underlying conditions. But on the other hand, we are seeing crowds, traffic congestion returning to cities, especially involving younger folks who have recovered from their infections. You know, flocking back to not only office buildings but also tourist destinations and shopping malls. That's the side of the story that government and state media are trying to highlight while downplaying the more grim side of the story. But the biggest concern right now is the mass migration of millions of Chinese for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. That's the first time in almost three years we're going to see this kind of massive scale of travel nationwide. That's likely to bring the virus from cities to the countryside where the health care system is very much lacking or nonexistent and that is potentially going to have devastating consequences -- Max, Bianca.",

And I could tell you, it was a humbling experience going inside St. Peter's Basilica yesterday and witnessing those masses of people who were coming by to pay their final respects to Pope Benedict XVI.And you know, the Vatican said, it's been tens of thousands of people who have gone past here. I think that the number yesterday after the second day of him lying in state was about 130,000. I could tell you today having been here and stood here throughout the morning, there are already a lot of people who are coming once again. Now at the end of the day the coffin will be sealed in a special ritual that is going to be taking place and that's going to be overseen by Pope Francis. And then tomorrow at this time, the service, the memorial service, the funeral service will be well underway for Pope Benedict XVI. And that's of course also, when a lot of heads of state are going to be arriving here. And that will also be overseen by Pope Francis as well. All of that is going to take a little over two hours. And in the end, we're talking about a ritual where you have Pope Benedict who will be lying in a wooden coffin which will then be placed into a zinc coffin. Which will then be placed into a wooden -- another wooden coffin and then be laid to rest in the tombs underneath the Vatican. The place that Pope Benedict is going to be taking there is the one that was formally occupied by Pope John Paul II until he was declared a saint himself. So, it's going to be a very, very long ritual that's going to take place tomorrow. And you were talking about the fact that in 2005 I was here when John Paul II was laid to rest. It is certainly back then it was a gigantic event with literally hundreds of thousands of people here and millions of people coming to Rome. Pope Benedict himself had requested a smaller, more humble ceremony for himself. Of course, only to the extent that something like that is possible with a gigantic body like the Catholic Church that of course is so influential in so many countries around the world. Nonetheless, a lot of heads of state are going to be arriving here. The U.S., of course, sending only the ambassador to the Holy See. But the German delegation, for instance, all the heads of Germany's constitutional bodies including the president and the chancellor are going to be here at the Vatican for that tomorrow -- Bianca.",
