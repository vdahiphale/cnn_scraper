Fifty people raised their hands, and he threw them out. Now, that judge could have kept those jurors, because if he'd asked each -- every single one of them, you know, you've said you can't be fair. But what if I told you what the facts and the law were? Could you then follow my instructions? And some of them would invariably say, yes, I could do that. I think what the judge was doing was just getting rid of anybody who might have even been a shred of a problem, recognizing that it was going to take a very long time to pick a jury, and he's just getting out the chaff from the wheat and trying to thin the herd as much as he can.",

I mean, what's the point of saying he didn't nod off?DAVID FRUM, STAFF WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\": Well, the silliness is this claim about high school graduations. There are Internet sleuths who have pointed out that Donald Trump has never attended any of his previous children's high school graduation. One of the follow-up questions would be the son who's graduation you'd like to attend, what is his name, please? Because Trump often seems to be unaware of the son's name. But there's a more serious point here. Donald Trump is talking about his presence in the courtroom as if it's a burden to him, as if it's an imposition. The reason he is there is not because he's being inconvenienced. He's there because it's a right to be in court. It's a right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. And the reason it's compulsory is because American judicial precedent says this right is so precious that, except in the most extraordinary circumstances, it cannot be waived, even by the right-holder himself or herself. You -- you must be there, because it must be seen by all that you have had the opportunity to be confronted, to confront your accusers, to hear the charges in open court, to see that due process is done. Now, the fact that the right is so precious doesn't and cannot be waived voluntarily doesn't mean it cannot be forfeited by bad behavior. And I quoted on Twitter this morning a precedent from 1970 were Hugo Black said, look, facing a contumacious defendant, courts have three alternatives. One is to bind and gag him. That is not recommended. But the other two bars are contempt charges, and also that he could be temporarily removed if he behaves very, very badly. GARCIA-NAVARRO: Word of the day, contumacious.

Elliott Williams, thank you for being with us this morning. Coming up next, the world waits on Israel's response to Iran's weekend attack. Plus day two of jury selection in Trump's hush-money trial. We've been talking about that. What to expect when the former president returns to court. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)",

Joining me now, CNN's senior national security correspondent, Alex Marquardt. Alex, you know, the Pentagon spokesman, Pat Ryder, said it's up to Israel to choose how they respond. But it seems as though, you know, over the weekend, the president was clearly sending the message, if you do this, we may not be with you. But Israel is making it pretty clear they're going to do something.",

And that's the clearest sign that the U.S. doesn't think that this is over, and that -- and a potential Iranian reaction to whatever maybe coming from Israel could then threaten U.S. troops.But it is clear that the us hopes that for the moment that this is over, that as we've been told, that Israel takes the win, Israel certainly has, you know, support domestically to do something against Iran. This is just -- you know, it was a stunning hours-long attack of some 500 projectiles being fired at Israel. But as a senior administration official told me yesterday, the U.S. sees this is kind of the equilibrium being re-established. You had the Israeli strike against the Iranian consulate in Damascus that killed five senior Revolutionary Guard commanders, including the the guy who's in charge of Lebanon and Syria. And now you had this Iranian response. But the way that Israel sees it, is they attacked our homeland with this huge, you know, retaliation. And even though there wasn't any damage, we need to respond to this. And, you know, Israel now finds itself in a situation it hasn't really felt in the past six months, where it has a fair amount of goodwill. You know, it's come under massive criticism for the war in Gaza. We haven't really been talking about the war in Gaza for the past few days.",
