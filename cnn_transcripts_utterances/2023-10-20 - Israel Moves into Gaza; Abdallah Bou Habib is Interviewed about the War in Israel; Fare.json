And we're beginning to hear from Israeli politicians what the goal of this operation is.We've known for some time, and our teams have witnessed, all the forces, all the armor, armored personnel carriers, tanks, arrayed around Gaza, particularly this northern area. And now Israeli politicians are publicly describing what the goal of this operation is. To go in, they're saying it may very well be a long war, but then create these barriers here around Gaza, basically a no man's land. They say it's going to be a free fire zone so that no one inside Gaza, in particular Hamas fighters, Islamic Jihad, et cetera, can get even close to the border. [08:35:02] But also then, afterwards, reserving the right and the ability for Israeli forces to go back in as necessary. One of the Israeli politicians mentioned how things work with the West Bank. That's how it works now with the West Bank. Israeli forces, they go inside frequently. They carry out attacks frequently there against militants. They are basically setting up for the same thing when we look at what's happening in Gaza city now. And that, we should note, portends a difficult operation inside Gaza.",

Were they targeting the USS Carney, the destroyer involved, or something else? We learned throughout the day what they were actually targeting, it seems, the U.S. believes, was Israel. And the Carney was able to shoot those missiles down before they got there.Why is that important? Because the great fear is that this expands into a multifront conflict against Israel. Of course, you already had Hamas coming in from here. You have Hezbollah in the north. The idea of Iranian-backed Houthi rebels firing missiles from here and then perhaps from Iran self. Then you begin to see the precarious geographical position that Israel is in. That's the concern. You've already seen what you might call potshots taken at Israel, not a full- scale offensive, but it shows where the power is. And then you mentioned U.S. forces, Poppy.",
