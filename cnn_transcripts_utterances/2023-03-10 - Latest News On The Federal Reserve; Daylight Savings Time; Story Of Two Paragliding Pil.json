      "sentences": "This means something for every American here, whether you`re talking about your job or you`retalking about all these ways that higher interest rates are going to affect you. And I want to just look at the mortgage market, for example. 30-year fixed rate mortgages are indirectly tied to these Federal Reserve rate hikes, and you`ve already seen mortgage rates rising here. You`re paying about $700 more a month in interest on a typical mortgage today, a new mortgage today than you would have if you`d got that mortgage last year. On credit card interest rates, those are at record highs here, 19% for a typical credit card interest rate. This bears repeating, you guys. If you are putting money on a card and not paying it off, you will spend a long time and a lot of money to get out from underneath that debt. So that`s a really important part here, too. And now in savings rates, you`re seeing a little bit of money. Eventually you might get a little bit more by having your money in a certificate of deposit or in a savings account that has lagged, I`m going to say sadly. But eventually saving money because of these higher rates could be a little more advantageous. It`s just not happening quite yet. But you will feel higher rates in just about everything. And the Fed is signaling higher rates for longer here. And that`s really one of the worries here. The Fed only has that one big tool, and that is raising those interest rates. They`ve done it eight times. How come inflation is still above 6%? How come the job market is still so strong? How come consumers are still so flush with cash and still spending so robustly? You have underlying strength in this economy. That means the Fed has to move harder to get these interest rates higher so that they can cool down the economy, and that could throw the economy into a recession. It`s a very, very dangerous and delicate balance that the Federal Reserve is trying to do. And I think what we heard from the Fed Chief yesterday is that this economy has been stronger than they thought, it really has been. And we`re going to hear a lot more information over the next week to 10 days that could, I think, really rattle markets and rattle that confidence in whether the Fed has done the right thing at the right time here.

      "sentences": "OK, this weekend, most clocks in the U.S. will spring forward for the start of daylight-saving time. That means Sunday, March 12 at 02a.m. clocks in most U.S. states will suddenly jump to 3:00 a.m.. And not everyone`s a fan of time changes, especially when we lose an hour of sleep. And there`s this push by some to end daylight saving altogether. The Sunshine Protection Act, a bill aimed at eliminating those changing clocks in the U.S. was passed in the Senate last year by unanimous consent from both Republicans and Democrats. But then it stalled in the House of Representatives. This topic remains controversial. Some believe making Daylight Saving Time permanent would help us avoid losing sleep and would lead to brighter afternoons, making people more productive, rested, and happier. But some scientists suggest that bright mornings help people wake up, be more alert, and that the dark nights allow the body to trigger hormones that help us sleep. Where do you stand? Here`s CNN meteorologist Jennifer Gray, who has more on the origins of the tradition. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "So, why don`t we change the clocks ahead 1 hour in the spring and back 1 hour in the fall? Well, it`s actually toreduce the electricity consumption by extending the daylight hours. In the U.S. we change our clocks at 02:00 a.m. on the second Sunday in March, that begins Daylight Saving Time. That`s when we spring ahead. On the first Sunday in November, we change our clocks at 02:00 a.m. again, that`s actually just going back to Standard Time. Believe it or not, this started with an idea from Benjamin Franklin. Franklin did write an essay suggesting that people could use less candles if they got up early and made better use of daylight. In 1918, the Standard Time Act established time zones and daylight-saving time. But not all states participate. To this day, most of Arizona and all of Hawaii did not change their clocks. Over 70 countries across the world observe Daylight Saving Time, with notable exceptions of China and Japan. In 2007, we actually changed the date of when we set our clocks back an hour to the first week in November. This helped protect trigger traders by giving them an extra hour of daylight. One of the other lines of thinking was that we would have a better voter turnout on election years. Experts say each time you change your clocks, it`s always a good idea to change those batteries in your spoke detector. And always look forward to fall when you get that extra hour of sleep.
