The leaders of NATO's 32 member countries will be marking the 75th anniversary of the world's largest security alliance. The war in Ukraine will be high on the agenda and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be in Washington during the summit. A wildfire near Santa Barbara, California is spreading. It's burned more than 21,000 acres so far and is only 8 percent contained. The so- called Lake Fire is threatening homes as well as Michael Jackson's former Neverland Ranch. A jury selection begins today in Alec Baldwin's involuntary manslaughter trial. The actor is accused of killing cinematographer Halyna Hutchins when a prop gun fired a live round on the Rust movie set in 2021. Baldwin has pleaded not guilty, saying he didn't pull the trigger and didn't know the gun contained live ammo. The White House is dismissing concerns about President Biden's mental acuity as more Democrats are urging him to step aside. Visitor logs showed a Parkinson's disease specialist visited the White House eight times in the past year. Mr. Biden's physician says many military personnel who serve at the White House experience neurological issues and the neurologist visits regularly. Here's Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Has the president been treated for Parkinson's? No. Is he being treated for Parkinson's? No, he's not. Is he taking medication for Parkinson's? No. So those are the things that I can give you full blown answers on. But I'm not going to -- I'm not going to confirm a specialist, any specialist that comes to come to come to the White House out of privacy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The party on Monday approved a new platform with more language. It's more Donald Trump and less far right conservative.CNN's Kristen Holmes has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump cementing his grip over the Republican Party on Monday after his platform was approved. And this is not just the platform of Donald Trump. He actually wrote parts of it. He also edited other parts, spent a lot of time, and it really mimics who the former president is. It looks almost nothing like the past platforms we've seen in 2020, 2016, when he was still the candidate. But instead, it looks like the candidate himself. That means they've softened language on abortion. That is something that Donald Trump does not believe is a political winner. There is no mention in this new platform of a national abortion ban, something Donald Trump has said he would not put into effect if he were to be reelected to a second term. The other part of this is this idea of, quote, unquote, traditional marriage, something that Donald Trump has not campaigned on at all. And this platform reflects that. No longer is there any words about a traditional marriage being between a man and a woman. And perhaps the most surprising of all of this is this idea around the national debt. One of the long-term policies and things that the Republican Party has been focused on is this idea of reducing the national debt. There is no emphasis on that in this new platform. Instead, it is all about getting rid of inflation. The rest of the platform obviously still focuses on things Donald Trump cares about, particularly immigration, talking about mass deportations, ending the weaponization of the government, something we hear from Donald Trump often in these rallies. But what this really does is it shows you the power that Donald Trump has over the Republican Party as we head into next week's convention. Kristen Holmes, CNN, Miami, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, this is a partnership between India and Russia that really goes back to the days of the Cold War and the Soviet Union. And what Narendra Modi is doing now is reaffirming that and talking about deepening that friendship. So these are very important symbols, the scenes of these two leaders embracing themselves on the steps of Vladimir Putin's residence outside of Moscow.Modi making this pilgrimage to Moscow and in comments that he made just an hour or so ago, saying, quote, this is a relationship built on a foundation of mutual trust and mutual respect. Now, the Indian side says that the two leaders, in talks later today, they will be discussing defense ties that, again, go back to the Cold War. India buys a lot of Russian-made weapons. Trade ties today, India buys a lot of cheap, discounted Russian fuel that used to go to European countries that have now put sanctions on the Kremlin for its full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Modi has demonstrated that that is not a problem for him, that he is willing to deepen his relationship with Russia despite the ongoing war. To date, the Indian government has not condemned that invasion. In fact, in comments today, Narendra Modi thanked Putin for helping secure the safe exit of Indian university students who were trapped by Russia's invasion of Ukraine back in 2022, despite the fact that it was the invasion that put those students in harm's way in the first place. So we're expecting to hear a little bit more. Modi has said that the Indian government will be opening consulates, for example, in the Russian cities of Yekaterinburg and Kazan moving forward. Meanwhile, he's come under some pretty harsh criticism from no one less than the president of Ukraine himself, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who pointed out that the same day that Modi was embracing Putin, the Ukrainians are accusing Russia of firing a cruise missile at a children's hospital in Kyiv, where Zelenskyy tweeted, 37 people were killed, 170 injured, including 13 children. He went on to write, quote: It is a huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow on such a day. No official response from the Indian government yet to that criticism. The U.S. government has said it is watching this closely. And here's what a State Department spokesman had to say about Modi's trip to Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: India is a strategic partner with whom we engage in a full and frank dialogue, and that includes on our concerns about the relationship with Russia.
