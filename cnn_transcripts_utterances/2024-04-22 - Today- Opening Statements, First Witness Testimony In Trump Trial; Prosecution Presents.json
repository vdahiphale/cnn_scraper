The first witness took the stand today, David Pecker, a longtime friend of Trump's and the former publisher of the National Enquirer. He testified for about 20 minutes today, so that's just the beginning. He is expected to return to the stand tomorrow. Prosecutors say Pecker was involved in numerous so-called catch-and-kill schemes he orchestrated on behalf of Trump, basically finding out a bad story, buying it from somebody in order to kill it and never run it. And apparently, according to the, albeit (ph), case here, brokered a deal with adult film star Stormy Daniels to keep her silence over an alleged affair, Wolf.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, opening statements began today. Donald Trump sitting there watching a screen of himself watching the proceedings as he sat at the defense table, the first former president to ever do so.And prosecutors began their - telling their story to the jury, telling the jury that this was a conspiracy and a cover-up, all to hide the hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels to stop her from going public with her allegations of a sexual encounter with Trump a decade earlier, and that they falsified business records in order to cover up the reimbursement of the money that Michael Cohen had initially given to Stormy Daniels. As the prosecutors put it, this is a conspiracy, this is a cover-up, it's election fraud, pure and simple. Then Trump's attorneys addressed the jurors who were given notebooks and pens so they could take notes during opening statements. Trump had turned in his chair to watch his lawyer talk to the jury. And what the first words out of his attorney's mouth, he's told the jury, President Trump is innocent. President Trump did not commit any crimes. the Manhattan District Attorney's Office should never have brought this case.\" He then went on to attack the credibility of Michael Cohen, who's expected to be a key witness in this case, saying that Cohen has previously lied under oath saying that Michael Cohen was obsessed with Donald Trump and his entire financial livelihood depends on him trying to take Donald Trump down. So trying to put in the jurors' minds this notion that they should question some of Michael Cohen's testimony. They also said that they expect that the jury will hear from Stormy Daniels, but saying that her testimony really doesn't matter because she has nothing to do with how the documents were kept at The Trump Organization. The core of this case, 34 counts of falsified business records, and Trump's attorney saying, you will not hear testimony from anyone who said that Trump told them how to record these payments in the company's books and records. So the jury is trying to keep him far from the cover-up part of this alleged crime. We had the first witness on the stand, David Pecker. He just began his testimony. Longtime friend of former President Donald Trump and his testimony will continue tomorrow when court gets underway at 11 AM with him back on the stand, Wolf.",

Lots of bad acts, lots of his prior behavior, such as the E. Jean Carroll defamation, the Letitia James' lawsuit against him for fraud, those can all come into play, and he has to address them and that can be very uncomfortable for him. BURNETT: That's right. And the Sandoval hearing, of course, established what they were allowed to ask if he does take the stand. As you point out, all those prior cases are now fair and square on the table. One thing, John, though, that is not on the table, the judge said that the Access Hollywood tape, the infamous \"grab 'em by the pee\" tape, could not be shown to jurors. Now, I guess on the one hand, I don't think there's anyone in this country who doesn't know about that tape and hasn't heard that tape. Nonetheless, it is years ago at this point. Many people on this jury may not have thought about it for a long time, may not be thinking of it in the context of this. So the fact that they're not allowed to play it may matter. How do you see it and what do you make of the judge saying no to that tape?",

But still, they're going to get the content. They're going to get a transcript of what was said on that bus pulling into the Access Hollywood show.So - and that is the - a chance to actually hear it word by word in a way that is even clearer and more disgusting than to listen to it. So I'm not sure that there's any real difference. In fact, it might be a benefit to understanding why this issue was so sensitive and so central to the case and understanding it when you actually just have the transcript.",

Now, prosecutors say that Trump has violated it at least times - 10 times, I'm sorry. And, John, as you know, in this gag order, he was prohibited from saying prejudicial or nasty things, really, of any sort, against potential witnesses or jurors or family members of the judge, although not the judge himself. So 10 times they say it was violated. And today, Trump said this about somebody who was obviously anticipated to be a central witness, his former fixer, Michael Cohen. Let me play it.

This had to do with the taxi cab company that he owned, which is just something he owned, and medallions and borrowing money and a lot of things, but it had nothing to do with me.And what are they going to look at all the lies that Cohen did in the last trial?

He's certainly putting it out there in the atmosphere where they could easily get access to this information and hear his characterization of the witnesses and that's what the order tries to avoid.So Trump just seems unable to control himself. If it's in his mind, it often comes out of his mouth. And he's thinking terrible thoughts about Michael Cohen after hearing the opening statement. And he knows what is that issue, so he just can't control himself. And so we'll see what the judge does with this tomorrow. I'll - it's a very tough ruling and an interesting one.",
