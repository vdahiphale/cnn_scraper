I'm Fareed Zakaria, coming to you live from New York.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ZAKARIA (voice-over): Today on the program, as Israel celebrates 75 years since its founding, I talk to its longest serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. With a resurgence in Israeli-Palestinian violence, can Israel continue to make peace with Arab states? How will it handle an Iran that could reportedly make a fissile material for a nuclear bomb in just two weeks? And the court crisis. How to heal the country's divisions, Israel's greatest existential threat according to its president. Also, Washington has declared that America's COVID national emergency will end in a matter of days. So what lessons have we learned from a pandemic that took more than a million lives in the United States alone? I'll talk to Philip Zelikow whose COVID crisis group just released its report.

      "sentences": "I think that's completely not only wrong, but also misinformed. There is a very broad segment of the Israeli public, 2.5 million people, the majority who voted for me and my government, who are eager to see a restoration of the balance between the three branches of government.In Israel, you know, all democracies are based on the balance between the will of the majority and the rights of the minority and individual rights. That balance is assured by the balance between the three branches of government, the executive, the legislative and the judicial. In Israel, over the last 20 years, the judiciary has become increasingly powerful and has dominated, both -- well, actually overriding decisions by the democratically elected legislature and executive. So people want to bring it back in line. On the other side, hundreds of thousands of people showed up in a demonstration, a day after Independence Day, hundreds of thousands, who are supporting this reform. On the other side, people are saying, well, if you tilt the pendulum to the other side and have the legislator have overriding -- unrestricted overriding power over the Supreme Court, you will impinge on his individual rights. So there has to be a happy middle here. And what I decided to do about a month ago is to, well, press the pause button and allow for an attempt to reach a consensus on something that I think is important for Israeli democracy. But one thing I guarantee you, at the end of this process, Israel was democracy, is a democracy, will remain as robust a democracy, and you could see that by the fact that hundreds of thousands of people are demonstrating for or against this -- and against this judicial reform in peaceful demonstrations in ways that are not possible within an enormous radius. And when you have that, as you have in France or protests in France or protests in the United States, it's not a sign of the collapse of the democracy, it's a sign of the robustness of the public debate which I'm sure, and I hope, and I'm working to resolve by as broad a consensus as I can.",

And, you know, you talk about three branches of government. But in Israel, you have a parliament democracy so the executive branch and the legislative branch are fused, you control both, you don't have a constitution, you don't have an upper house of parliament, you have no Senate.You don't have state governments so when you look at American system there are all those checks and balances. The Supreme Court is the only check on an elected government in Israel. And that is why so many constitutional scholars around both in Israel and the United States, diehard supporters like Alan Dershowitz are all opposed to this plan. Are you willing to compromise and withdraw those elements of the proposal?",

It's got a -- I think we're very proud of the fact that we've built here a real robust and responsible free market economy.And because Israel -- the worry that I think was reflected in the beginning and is hyped up as though the independence of the judicial will any way be compromised, that's false. It's not going to happen, there is a difference between an independent judiciary, which Israel must always have, and an all-powerful judiciary, and I think that people are beginning to recognize, when I look at the -- what is happening, they recognize that Israel's future economically, including in the high-tech sector, is going to be secure.",

Israeli police said they took the action after, quote, \"hundreds of rioters and mosque desecrators barricaded themselves,\" unquote, inside. The raids prompted a major uptick in violence including rocket fire from Lebanon, Gaza and Syria, and Israeli airstrikes in response.Back now with more of my interview earlier today with Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Prime Minister, when we last talked before you were prime minister just a few months ago, you had hinted that you thought there was going to be some movement on relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. You of course managed to normalize relations with the United Arab Emirates, with Bahrain. But we are hearing reports here that the Saudis, the Emiratis, are all concerned about the rising level of violence between Israeli government and Palestinians. Is that going to put a freeze on your plans which were, I think, to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia?",

But what we hear from -- what we hear from our Arab neighbors, of course, is something else. I think they have no illusions about the danger of Iran and Iran sponsored terrorism and aggression in the region and they also have no illusion about the fact that Israel is a force for stability, for peace and for security.And that's why the relations are actually, well, they're improving. We just signed a free trade agreement with the UAE. We've just expanded the semi-normalization, well, the baby steps normalization that we've had with Saudi Arabia. You know, we've been flying over Saudi airspace, hundreds of thousands of Israelis, actually that began two years before the historic Abraham Accords. That was done obviously with Saudi acquiescence to say the least. Now recently, under my government, we opened up the route to fly to India and Asia through Oman, again going through Saudi airspace. So I think that there is -- I'm very hopeful and I believe this is not pie in the sky, that we will actually expand the historic Abraham Accords to -- in a quantum leap because I think that peace with Saudi Arabia, normalization with Saudi Arabia is in the interest of peace in the Middle East, is in the interest of both of our countries. And I think it's possible. When I spoke about the Abraham Accords, and you may remember this because we've been talking to each other many years. But when I spoke about it a lot of people poo-pooed it. They didn't think it was possible. And they said they raised the Palestinian issue, and they raised other issues, and I said, no, no, it's not only possible, it's going to happen. And people had a problem seeing the impossible turn into the inevitable. Well, I'm saying now that peace with the major Arab countries is not only possible, I think it's likely and I'm doing everything that I can, not everything above surface, to advance it because I think it will change history. It will be a pivot of history. It will end the Arab-Israeli conflict and will advance the solution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.",

So there wasn't as much of a partisan push for it.In the administration, there was at first a reluctance to be distracted by an investigation, then they realized the investigation would investigate them, too. But the bottom line is, I think people didn't want a commission because they didn't realize what a commission could tell them. They didn't realize what a commission could help them do, because they themselves internally didn't really understand what happened and how to fix it.

We have to train people to do it. We have to have the capacity and equipment to do it. And you have to make those preparations in advance. So what happens in a crisis is really fairy quickly folks really didn't know what to do. And the public could kind of tell that people were flailing.

Because a public health emergency unlike a national security emergency is one where it is not just the federal governments that has to act, it is the federal government in coordination with the state governments, in coordination with local governments. There were thousands of public health authorities within the U.S. and this is something that we are very bad at. ZELIKOWSo, we didn't design a very good test. But even if we had designed a very good test, we hadn't prepared with the private sector to make millions of them. Even if we had prepared with the private sector to make millions of them, we didn't have any plan of what to do with the tests. Exactly how should we use them? Should we use them to protect nursing homes, to reopen schools, to have 10,000 drive-through sites for anxious citizens, to do biomedical surveillance, then you'd have to coordinate that nationally. That is what we mean about preparedness. It is kind of this unglamorous stuff that actually isn't really a partisan story.

Back in 2011, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared, \"Software is eating the world.\" By that he meant software companies were infiltrating large swaths of the physical world and conquering analog industries.Netflix disrupted movie theaters and video rentals. Apple and Spotify rendered CDs obsolete. Amazon, despite shipping physical goods from warehouses, was fundamentally a software company dislodging traditional retail. Even cars had increasingly become software on wheels. More than a decade later, venture capitalists Paul Kedrosky and Eric Norlin asked in a recent blog post, \"Why software is taking so damn long to finish eating.\" They argue software could be much more widely deployed if it weren't so expensive to produce. Along comes ChatGPT, made by OpenAI. It is a cheap powerful software that could disrupt a host of industries. It can answer all kinds of questions and write everything from marketing materials to news articles to legal documents. It can also supercharge existing software. For example, Salesforce has integrated ChatGPT into its Einstein assistant tool. When a sales rep is put on a new account, the chatbot can provide an overview of the company, find content information for the right people and compose a personalized email. Then make the email less formal if needed. Instacart has debuted ChatGPT function that suggests a recipe, turns it into a shopping list and prepopulates the items to add to your shopping cart. Simply put, ChatGPT is an amazingly versatile software. Anyone could use it, though it often takes some skill to craft the perfect prompts. That is why a new job has sprouted up called prompt engineer, for people who are adept at writing prompts. These may be English majors rather than computer scientists but they are a new kind of tech wizard. The wizardry reaches a whole other level when you consider the chatbot software can be used to create other software. After all, chatbots generate writing. Computer code is a kind of writing. So, now someone can build their own software simply by feeding prompts to ChatGPT. Tesla's former head of AI, Andrej Karpathy, who also helped found OpenAI proclaimed, \"The hottest new programming language is English.\" The implications are huge. Kedrosky and Norlin argue, \"A software industry where anyone can write software, can do it for pennies, and can do it as easily as speaking or writing text, is a transformative moment.\" They compare this to the moment microchips and internet access started to become widely available unleashing astounding innovation. Software development using ChatGPT is in its infancy. But people have found it can make simple programs that highlight words or randomize a list of names. One developer wrote a program using ChatGPT to interface his smart home with ChatGPT. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
