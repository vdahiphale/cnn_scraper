      "sentences": "Victor and Alisyn, this is part of an expansion of military relations between the U.S. and the Philippines access for the U.S. military to more bases in the Philippines. And from China's perspective, that means perhaps a greater U.S. military presence close to China and crucially close to Taiwan.Take a look at this map. This is where the U.S. currently has access to military bases. This Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in the Philippines where the agreement was reached. This is the map where the U.S. currently has access to military bases in the Philippines. This will expand to four more bases. Now, neither the U.S. nor the Philippines will name those bases. But we know from a few months ago that the US was interested in bases in the north that is closer to Taiwan, as well as on in the western Philippines, close to the South China Sea there and close to militarized Chinese islands. And that's why China has accused the U.S., perhaps, of having a selfish agenda and blamed the Washington for being the one that was responsible for regional instability. This is all part of a force posture shift towards China and towards the Indo-Pacific region. It's the expanded military access in the Philippines. It's a revamped marine unit in Okinawa, again, fairly close to Taiwan on the northern side there that will have advanced capabilities, advanced weaponry like anti-ship missiles, and a newly opened Marine Corps Base on Guam, so just east of the Philippines there. All of that is an effort to shift the Pentagon's focus to China with growing concerns over China's intent towards Taiwan and fears over a potential invasion of Taiwan in the coming years. Victor and Alisyn, there's also a bigger picture perspective here. The former Philippine's president had shifted the Philippines towards Beijing, even threatening to kick out U.S. military forces. The current president, although he was walking very carefully with Beijing, is clearly realigning the Philippines back towards the U.S. and that has angered China.",

And so the fact that someone, you know, might make it some say something humorous or whatever, doesn't qualify or disqualify them from anything. Like I said, there's a lot of politics to be played out. I think people are going to look at not just who can win, but who can actually get stuff done, right? Who's going to bring the results to the table? I'm incredibly proud. People want me to run -- talking to me about running for president, because of the results we've gotten here in New Hampshire, we have no sales tax, we have no income tax, the lowest poverty rate, the most efficient government, number one and individual liberties.

If you're a private business, I might disagree with what your private business is doing. But that doesn't mean I'm going to use government to penalize you because we disagree politically on something. I'm going to lead by example. Right? I am -- so there's just a variety of ways. I think we're going to differ ourselves. Nikki is going to do it. Vice President Pence is going to do it. A lot of candidates are going to potentially get in the race, they're going to differentiate themselves.

And that 60 percent is the threshold that researchers use to assess whether it hypothetically passed the exam. And it appeared to do so in most cases. So this really shows that it could be a reliable tool for possibly writing reports, writing medical studies, possibly making diagnoses or helping with developing treatment plans.

A lot of astronomers like to think of them as dirty snowballs. That's kind of the way that they're often described. And so this dirty snowball making its closest approach to Earth yesterday and today. And, you know, the other big question that people have, Victor and Alisyn, is, how can I see it? Well, the answer to that is your best bet is to really just get somewhere away from a city, get out of New York City, get out of Washington, D.C., wherever you are, find some dark skies, preferably skies with no clouds. And a lot of folks are having luck simply seeing this comet with their naked eye, if you know where to look. But it's really advised that if you can get your hands on binoculars or an amateur telescope, that is really going to help your chances of seeing it and it really is such a rare sight to see. I mean, think about this. This is a visitor from the icy outer reaches of our solar system. It only comes here, you know, every 50,000 years or so. The last time during the Stone Age.
