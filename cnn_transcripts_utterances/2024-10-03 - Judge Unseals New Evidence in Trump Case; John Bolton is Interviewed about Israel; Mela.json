You can make the decision, but telling them what you're giving up or what you - you hope the Israelis give up is just a failure of diplomacy 101.And second, the position itself as wrong. Israel's response should not be proportionate. I don't know what the word proportionate means here. It's - when - when Japan attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor, should our response have been proportionate to seek an equal number - sink an equal number of battleships that Japan had sunk? I mean, it just doesn't make any sense in this context. Deterrence has obviously failed. Israel followed Biden's command really back in April that they not respond effectively to that attack by ballistic cruise missiles and drones. I think Israel fired one missile at one missile launching site. Obviously didn't deter Iran in the slightest.
