Up first, special counsel Robert Hur is set to testify in a matter of hours before the Republican-led House Judiciary Committee. Hur investigated President Biden's handling of classified documents last month. He concluded the president did mishandle the material. Hur, however, chose not to prosecute. Still, it was his assessment of Biden's mental sharpness that caused political shockwaves. Hur's report described Biden as a sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. He claimed that the president's condition would make it hard to get a conviction. He also called into question the president's memory, noting that during an interview in October, President Biden didn't remember exactly when his son Beau died. That was something that the president took issue with. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's start with what we're expecting on Capitol Hill today because Robert Hur -- Robert Hur, in an interesting twist, is actually going to be testifying as a private citizen.

And this has become I think a really big general election argument because of this report. Before the report, there were always questions about Biden's age. There are questions about Donald Trump's age, but it was less of a sort of mainstream issue compared to what we are now seeing.And so I anticipate that that's going to be one of the main focal points during this conversation.",

      "sentences": "It's really odd, quite frankly, right? Because we don't anticipate already being in general election mode. And even though they haven't technically clenched, we are essentially in general election mode. I mean, you've seen the shift in terms of messaging from both Biden and Trump in the past few weeks.But I still do think that today is going to be important. It might be a little bit more symbolic, but I'm also going to be looking at, A, that uncommitted protest vote that we talked about a few weeks ago. Does that continue to gain momentum? That could mean trouble for Joe Biden down the line as he tries to get that left-wing back into his good graces. The other thing I'm looking for is Georgia, right? Black voters, how do these candidates perform in Georgia? Which is clearly a key state for both of them. They were both there in the past few days. And so there's still, you know, important things to take away from today, I think. Yeah. I mean, in Georgia specifically, you're looking for whether there's black turnout in the Republican primary. I mean, how -- how are you viewing that? Because we have seen these numbers change in a way that's potentially very dramatic for Democrats in particular. Yeah, I think its important for both though, because I think Joe Biden has to show that he can still garner that sect of the base, which he's struggled with, but I also think Donald Trump performed relatively well in that state in 2020. And so, that's important for him, too, and it's also important because he's been trying to garner that Black vote. You know, he's not just leaving it up to chance that they're not going to turn out for Joe Biden. Donald Trump's campaign also wants that voter base. And so, I think it's equally important to see how, how both sides, how that voter base turns out for each of them. HUNT:  Yeah. And, briefly, let's touch on what Trump said. I mean, he's sort of blew through it a little bit and later tried to clean it up and say, well, I was talking about managing waste in Social Security and Medicare. But it, of course, did not take the Biden campaign very long to say, hey, look, Donald Trump said he is going to cut your Social Security.",

I remember several months ago during the Republican primary, the Biden campaign was focusing on all of these other candidates, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, when it comes to do wanting to prioritize their past support for privatizing Medicare and Social Security, wanting entitlement cuts.So this has been a topic that the Biden campaign thinks that they can win on. And so as soon as Donald Trump said it, regardless of what his campaigns said afterwards, they saw an opportunity to make this a mainstream topic and I anticipate going forward that this is now going to be one of the big focal points for the Biden campaign as they seek to attack Donald Trump on things.",

Now this, Benjamin Netanyahu's viability as Israel's leader, apparently in jeopardy, according to the conclusion of a national security report presented to Congress on Monday. U.S. intelligence officials citing growing divides between Netanyahu and the Israeli people, a fracture that played out with violent anti- government demonstrations in Tel Aviv over the weekend. Joining me now from Abu Dhabi is CNN international correspondent Paula Hancocks. Paula, good morning. This seems to just basically represent a U.S. assessment that there's a crisis of confidence in Netanyahu's leadership.

This is not what you would want to wake up to, having to clean up after this mess.You can see some of that inundating some of the garages and the buildings within Fairfield, New Jersey, but the good news is the storm system that brought that weather to the East Coast yesterday in combination with the new moon. So, we had exaggerated tidal levels. That's really moving on. So the good news is we've got to dry day today to clear things out, but several other storms to discuss, including the potential of a major snow storm in and around Denver later this week. And then are ongoing fire risk across the Texas and Oklahoma panhandle. We also have severe weather threat today marginal at best across central Missouri. So heads up Kansas City to Springfield. That does start to increase in severity, at least potential for the day tomorrow. And then once again, on Thursday, we see a larger outlook in terms of the severe weather probability as we head out into the second half of the week. But look at how the fire weather outlook also starts to degrade as we head into Wednesday, we get the critical conditions re-introduced to this forecast across the most hardest hit areas across the Texas panhandle. The good news here is that the Smokehouse Creek Fire, the largest fire in Texas history, now, nearly 90 percent contained. So that is good news, firefighters getting a great handle on that system. We do have winter storm watches just issued for Denver with the potential for several feet in the foothills. So messy Thursday and Friday along that I-25 corridor in and around Denver.
