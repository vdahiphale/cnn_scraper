      "sentences": "Look, that is certainly the hope for many in the international community. We heard yesterday from a U.S. official saying that those discussions are nudging forward, but that they are still difficult. And, of course, as we saw in those talks yesterday, according to the U.S. officials, no major breakthroughs that would result in any sort of agreement at this stage are yet to have been reached according to U.S. officials.We know that negotiations are still ongoing. And, of course, we heard from a Hamas official telling CNN that if there is indeed progress in these talks and negotiations, that they would be prepared to send a delegation back to Cairo for further discussions. At this stage, two Hamas officials have told CNN that they have no immediate plans to send a delegation back to Cairo. So, of course, those talks are still very much ongoing. And as we know, according to one U.S. official, one of the key sticking points, one of the key areas of disagreement remains the ratio of Israeli hostages to Palestinian prisoners that would be exchanged as part of this agreement. As you mentioned, Poppy, we did see last week the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, dismissing that counter proposal put forward by Hamas, which would see a prolonged truce and the gradual release of Israeli hostages held captive by Hamas, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Prime Minister Netanyahu described this as delusional. We know, of course, that Hamas is calling for all Palestinian prisoners to be released. The Palestinian prisoners commission says there are around 8,000 Palestinians held in Israeli jails, many of them are believed to be held under administrative detention, meaning no clear charges laid against them. Hamas has said the next 24 hours will be critical, that we may have a clearer picture of where these negotiations stand over the next day. But, of course, mounting pressure from the international community, particularly as we continue to hear warnings of a looming ground offensive in the southern city of Rafah, and fears that that ground offensive could put those talks in jeopardy.",

They say they've been developing intelligence about where Yahya Sinwar is, those movements from Hamas captives, particularly sort of Hamas officials, that they say they're detaining, they say they've captured or killed or injured about ten -- 20,000 Hamas operatives so far.So, from those intelligence investigations, interrogations, that the IDF are performing, they believe that they're building up a better picture of where Sinwar is and they're presenting this material as an indication of that. They also showed material that they said, the IDF said, we can't stand up what the IDF is putting forward, but they showed video of what they describe as millions of shekels and dollars in a room that they said -- a bunker room, deep in a tunnel system, where they said Sinwar was using. I think this is indicative of where the conflict is at the moment. For months in, the IDF said that its direction, political direction, that it was given, and what it intends to do, which was crush Hamas, but take down its leadership as well. And I think this is indicative of the fact that for months in they have not been able to capture or kill Yahya Sinwar. And I think by offering this material publicly at this stage kind of keeps alive the narrative that they're on his trail.

I applied a little bit more makeup than you did, but we had a long conversation about this. You have an interesting take on what's going to happen here. MAX ROSE, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE (D-NY): Sure. I mean there's a few options here for the speaker. One, he could split the votes into three separate packages, put them all individually on the floor, Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan. In addition, though, they could pare back, particularly to Ukraine bill. One of the principal criticisms from folks like J.D. Vance has been that the Ukraine aid actually would extend nine months into the next presidency, and to which they purport will be the Trump presidency. I, of course, disagree. But they think that this would handcuff Donald Trump. So, potentially, Speaker Johnson could pare that back. Of course, the worst thing he could do is not put anything on the floor because that, once again, just talking strictly politics, would put his moderates in such a disadvantage to say that once again the Republican Party is on the side of extremism and authoritarianism, both at home and abroad.

There are probably 300 votes for all of this. And maybe they could tinker with it and find a way to modify it to help people. But remember, the bulk of this money goes right back to American companies in American states that have American workers that are making these munitions and weapons for Ukrainians. So, I think there's a misperception that we just basically write a check and, you know, FedEx it over to whatever, Ukraine. That's not the way this works. And my hope is, is that cooler heads prevail, and we realize it's not a good idea to let the Russians run all over Europe. I mean that's our traditional view as Republicans, and we ought to keep it. S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, to that exact point, if you had told me ten years ago that Democrats would be begging Republicans to do something to stand up against Russia and China and help out Israel against Republican desires, I would not have believed you. That's -- that shows just how completely the Republican Party has changed. And it's not just about intransigents, because it's a lot about intransigents and just not doing something that Democrats want. It's more than that.
