I'm Erica Hill. This is \"CNN Newsroom\" Just ahead, urging caution. Diplomats push for a tempered response for Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu's war cabinet considers its response after Iran's weekend attack. We are live in Jerusalem and Beirut. Also, a major international airport underwater, motorists stranded in floodwaters. We will take you live to Dubai for the latest in this history-making downpour.

Iran's president is once again warning that any attack by Israel would be dealt with fiercely and severely. Speaking at an annual army parade in Tehran, Ebrahim Raisi called his country's weekend strikes on Israel limited and punitive. Iran fired more than 300 drones and missiles toward Israel in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month. Israel's war cabinet is weighing its options as the IDF again confirmed, retaliation is simply a matter of time. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM.

They had met with president of Israel and with the foreign minister, and the message to them both was thank you very much. We really appreciate the support and help over the weekend. We need your diplomatic support now, particularly at the G7 meetings for foreign ministers coming up in the next few days and at the U.N. as well, to kind of really give some shape, an impetus to the diplomacy, and Israel wants to see the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps of Iran designated on the international stage as a terrorist organization, that is once that they want to see that was what was told so the visiting foreign ministers today.So, their message is don't escalate the situation and I think that resonates. It appears to resonate at least with the Israeli public. In a poll today by a university in Israel, they say about three quarters of people, Israel -- don't want Israel to we have a strong military response against Iran if it costs that international support, that defense alliance, which protected Israel from that massive onslaught so effectively at the weekend. That's the concern there and I was speaking last night to a former head of one of Israel's intelligence agencies, who by the way was the bomber -- the fighter jet bomber who dropped a bomb on Iraq's nuclear reactor in that daring raid in 1981 and was the intelligence chief who came up with the plan to take out Syria's nuclear reactor in 2007. And he said, look, the reason Iran has decided after all this time to strike back at Israel and this gets for the understanding here of what people are concerned about, he believes that Iran reads Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu's support from the United States as being weakened because of the tension between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, and that is something that Iran thinks it can exploit. And of course, Israel now on the dilemma, do they go maximalist and then potentially lose and widen that support? And Iran sees them in an even weaker position. I think that's where the prime minister finds himself at the moment, trying to balance that and that's why you hear the words from David Cameron saying, we know you're going to strike, but strike in a way that's not going to escalate.",

You heard from Kara there that the judge did admonish Donald Trump at one point when he was physically reacting to what one of the jurors was saying when they were questioned about their social media posts. But the end of the day, it's clear that all parties, both parties are laying the foundation for a fair trial, and both sides are really stressing and emphasizing the need for jurors to be impartial, to be able to render a fair verdict in this case, which really was the biggest challenge people speculated leading up to jury selection that how can you find 12 jurors plus about six alternates who can render a fair verdict in a case dealing with somebody as polarizing as Donald Trump. So far, they've found seven that they believe that can do it, remains to be seen how they'll fill out the rest of the jury. That process will pick back up on Thursday, but the judge was optimistic, maybe suggesting that he thinks this trial can start to move forward on Monday.

One person who is ready for those lawmakers there to get to work understandably is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who spoke with PBS News and repeated his earlier warnings that without U.S. aid, Ukraine risks losing this war.Zelenskyy pointing out the U.S. and others jumped in to shoot down Iranian drones and missiles fired toward Israel just days ago, after choosing not to step in and defend Ukraine. Here's more. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): When someone says that our allies cannot provide us with this or that weapon, or they cannot be in Ukraine with this or that force because that would be perceived as if Ukraine is engaging NATO in the war, well, after yesterday's attack academia, I want to ask you a question. Is Israel part of NATO, or not? Here is the answer. Israel is not a NATO country. The NATO allies, including NATO countries, have been defending Israel. They showed the Iranian forces that Israel was not alone and this is a lesson. This is a response to anyone on any continent who says you need to assist Ukraine very carefully, so you don't engage NATO countries in the war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Donald Trump's social media company Truth Social announcing that they are getting into the streaming game, saying that they are going to launch a streaming service. It's been a bit light on the details of what exactly will be on this streaming service, what you'll be able to actually watch. But according to the company, they say the streaming service will focus on content that is otherwise, they say being suppressed or husband canceled, or is at risk of being canceled. This will span everything they say, from news to religious shows, to family-friendly content, including films and documentaries.We still haven't heard any sort of personalities or more specifics about who will be on this streaming service, only that they're going to be launching it in three different phases, starting from an app in your phone, all the way until you can watch it on a streaming service on your TV. Now, the big question of course, is how they will be able to run this and will it make any money because it costs a lot of money and it is a lot of work to run a successful streaming service. Keep in mind, a company, even like Disney, that has so much content that is well-suited to have a streaming service, even their streaming service, Disney Plus is struggling to turn a profit that we've seen from other streamers like a Netflix. And there is competition in this space. The Trump audience, the people who will be wanting to watch this sort of content, it is a smaller slice of the broader audience pie and they're already being served by services like Newsmax, like OAN. So, there is a big question about whether they will be able to capture that audience. Now, Trump obviously has a very loyal fan base. Will they be willing to pay and will this be a successful streaming service? The announcement though of the streaming service did not help the stock of the company. It's been in a free fall since a high in March on March 26, it has lost something like 70 percent of its value since then. And even after the announcement of the streaming service, the stock tumbled something like 14 percent, if not more, even after this announcement. There are sort of questions about whether this is just a meme stock. They've erased something like $5 in market capitalization as a result of this drop. And keep in mind that Former President Donald Trump himself, he is the largest shareholder in this company, he owns something like 60 percent stake in the company. So, this drop in valuation, that is directly affecting his net worth. Hadas Gold, CNN, New York. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
