With so much at stake, politicians have been hitting the campaign trail with urgency, trying to clinch dozens of seats up for grabs; 218 seats are needed to control the House.Right now it looks like Republicans have a slight lead with 212 likely wins. In the Senate, three seats are considered tossups. CNN estimates that 12 are solidly Democratic or leaning that way; about 20 are either solidly Republican or leaning to the right. In the state of Georgia, voters have been casting early ballots in record numbers. So far, about 660,000 people have shown up to vote in person, with more than 140,000 going to the polls on Friday alone. Officials say the numbers are shattered previous turnout records. CNN's Nadia Romero has more from Atlanta. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADIA ROMERO, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  This is the first weekend of early voting here in Georgia for the midterm elections. Take a look at this polling location in Atlanta, long lines here. One voter took 27 minutes to get from the back of the line to the front. By the time she handed her ballot ID to poll workers, it took 10 minutes to vote. That's what it takes at some of these polling locations; 4,000 people, workers told us, have been here, early voting, since Monday. Take a look at those numbers. Look at early voting all throughout Georgia from Monday through Friday, more than 660,000 Georgians have already participated in the voting process. You compare that to our last midterm election in 2018, just about 398,000. So you can see that number so much larger this time around. People tell me it's all about the key races. That's what they care about. The governor's race with the incumbent Republican governor, Brian Kemp, with a rematch with his Democratic challenger, Stacey Abrams, and everyone's keeping watch on the Senate race that has national implications, take a listen.

You have to add crime in there as we've just heard. And many women, of course, are registering to vote in record numbers and are turning out very much on the basis of their fear of losing that right to choose, that control over their own bodies. I think the question then is what happens overall. One real concern is whether men will turn out. And especially I think for the Democrats, a real concern is whether minority men, Black and Latino men, will turn out and on what basis. So there is a division; the headline, again, looks like it's back to the economy, a real concern with inflation, a real concern with the stock market. But we've seen also that President Biden is squarely taking on this issue of the economy. And he's trying to make the point that, if the Republicans come back, there will be tax cuts but that will add to the deficit.

The 2018 midterms had the highest turnout, about 122 million Americans voted. That was the highest turnout since 1978. And I think right now we're on track to surpass that. So again, the intensity around these midterms suggests that voters care passionately, that they're very worried about their issues. I think they're very worried about democracy. I think we're all very concerned to see whether these elections are free, whether they're fair and especially whether they're nonviolent. As we get closer to the actual day of those elections, the campaigning is fierce, the candidates are out on the ground, the president is visible, the former president is visible for a number of reasons.

And so, you know, the facts on the ground are one thing but you're right, that right now people are blaming this president. President Biden has struggled. And the other thing that we're seeing is that, you know, a number of Democrats and Republicans on the ground are having to make a very specific choice about whether to align themselves with the president in the case of the Democrats or the former president in the case of the Republicans, because both of these leaders are struggling with significant constituents. President Biden hasn't been polling well since that exit from Afghanistan. So very difficult politics. But remember, the stakes are extremely high. They're high for the economy, they're very high for abortion rights and they're especially high for the question of climate. This is where President Biden has had tremendous success, putting through that Inflation Reduction Act and the future of this question has very significant stakes, not only for America, for Americans, but for the entire globe.",

He actually gained notoriety during Shanghai's very chaotic two-month COVID lockdown from April to June because he is Shanghai's party chief. There is video online of angry local residents shouting at him, blaming him for the Shanghai government's mishandling and asking him, how is it possible for residents of China's biggest and wealthiest city to go hungry and have to search for daily necessities during that lockdown? But it doesn't matter; that hasn't prevented his political rise. In another highly symbolic moment on Saturday during the party congress closing session, we see Xi's predecessor, Hu Jintao, being escorted out of the Great Hall of the People. We are still not sure about the exact circumstances surrounding that moment but you can see Hu obviously appearing to be reluctant to be led out. after some brief exchanges of words with two staff members as well as to Xi, he was still, you know, eventually had to leave. That is really another moment showing the era of collective leadership during Hu Jintao's time that is gone and the lack of visible reactions from all the people sitting on the stage.

Electricity is being cut to mines that produce coal which means that coal isn't available to fuel the power stations. So that real assessment is from Ukrainian officials is that Russia is very carefully strategically targeting the weaker areas within the power grid, the bits that are outside of the buildings, not the big generators and turbine systems, if you will, but the transformers, the switching gear, the high voltage lines. These areas that are outside and vulnerable to missile strikes. So you know, Ukraine is doing its best to improve the air defenses, it's waiting for more supplies to come from allies and partners in the West. But in the meantime, some strikes are getting through. So it's a real question at the moment. Can Ukraine repair quickly enough to counter Russia's sort of attritional attacks on the system across the country?

MICK RYAN (RET.), AUSTRALIAN ARMY:  What we're seeing at the moment, particularly from this new Russian commander, is a campaign against the Ukrainian people, because he can't lay a hand on the Ukrainian army on the battlefield. The Russian army has lost all momentum in every area of Ukraine and, in many respects, these missile attacks are about the only thing he can do against Ukrainians at the moment while he builds strength through the mobilization program.",

Now an administration official tells us they have already seen a significant decrease at the border by 80 percent. Now the mayor spoke with CNN's Chris Wallace, telling him that, even though the numbers may be decreasing, there are still thousands of people here in New York who will need access to resources. In fact, the city of El Paso alone sent more than 10,000 migrants here to the city in the last couple months. The mayor says the city is preparing and will need federal resources to deal with people here who will need that help. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NY), NEW YORK CITY:  We must sit down at the table and have a clear pathway for those seeking to experience the American dream. And I think we have failed to do that for generations. And I'm hoping with the decompressing strategy and a real strategy that the White House has put in place, we're finally going to deal with, number one, allowing those who are here to work, to give them financial resources to those who are really carrying the responsibility of those who are coming here to our country. (END VIDEO CLIP) PAZMINO:  And what the mayor is saying there is also what service providers here in the city have been telling me over several weeks. Even as the numbers continue to decrease, there are thousands of people now living here in New York who will need to be connected to legal resources, health care, public education and who will likely need housing as they move through what are very complicated asylum cases. So even as the arrivals begin to decrease, still thousands of people here in the city who will likely be in need of help for several months to come -- Gloria Pazmino, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

We saw over the weekend the continuation of those protests. Despite that crackdown, students in Tehran University, students taking to the streets, chanting \"freedom, freedom,\" \"Death to the dictator,\" \"Death to Khamenei,\" according to video we have seen that has been provided by the pro reform outlet IranWire, which has been working with CNN. These videos are pretty remarkable to see the brazen and clear public rejection of the Iranian regime. We also saw university students in the east region also protesting in huge numbers. According to video we have seen circulating on social media, chanting the regime's days are numbered. This is, of course, coming in its sixth week of protests. These are continuing to gain momentum up and down the country. Not only are we seeing protests now but we're also seeing strike action by business owners, by factory workers, even teachers going on strike in solidarity with the protest movement. In the northwestern Kurdish region over the weekend we saw video of the streets eerily quiet and empty, storefronts closed as business owners took part in that strike. Teachers across the country, a teachers' union calling for a sit-in today and tomorrow in protest against the death and detention of students and young people. And, of course, we have seen hundreds of people being detained according to human rights organization Iran HR, which is a Norway based human rights group, focused on Iran, has been tallying its own death toll since the beginning of the protest movement. While it's impossible for CNN to independently verify the death toll, this human rights organization has tallied it at more than 200. So there is clear and growing concern over the crackdown that could intensify as these protests continue to gain momentum.",
