      "sentences": "That's right, Bianna. I think there's some good news and some bad news in this report. Let me run you through the numbers quickly. Wholesale prices jumping by 7.4 percent year over year in November, that is high historically, and hotter than expected. Month over month point 3 percent. That is hotter than expected as well. Now, we follow these numbers because it shows how much inflation is in the pipeline. These are wholesale prices, and companies pass along these costs to consumers.Now, the good news here is that yes, this inflation metric has improved. You know, it was nearly 12 percent at the peak back in March. As you can see on that chart, it is a big improvement, five straight months of cooling and this is actually an 18-month low. I think the bad news is that inflation hasn't cooled as fast as hoped, and it does remain very high historically. That's going to force the Federal Reserve to continue to raise rates, including at next week's meeting. Now, we know that high inflation and the high borrowing costs have hit consumer sentiment but new numbers out today from the University of Michigan show that consumer sentiment actually ticked higher to start this month. As you can see on that chart, though, sentiment remains pretty low historically, well below pre-COVID levels. But, Bianna, it is starting to move in the right direction. And I suspect part of that reason is the fact that gasoline prices have plunged so dramatically. If food prices start to come down too, that could help boost sentiment even further.",

It's the highest we've had so far this year.Why is Joe Biden's approval rating going up? Well, if you look at folks, and you ask them, you know, how do you think the shape of the country is? Things are going well in the country today, it's now 35 percent. Again, that's not that all that good, but it is the highest number that we've had since last December.

Well, listen, a senior administration official said to us last night that Russia essentially, it's in their best interest to continue talking to the United States about Paul Whelan because there are things in this world, in the words of that senior Administration official, that Russia wants. Essentially, they are in a position where they can get something out of the United States. And, of course, getting back Viktor Bout in return for Brittney Griner was a political win for President Putin. We're seeing that just today in Russia.And so, the administration feels pretty confident that dialogue between the U.S. and Russia is going to remain open. It's significant that President Putin himself said today that that dialogue will remain open, that a future prisoner swap is in the realm of possibilities. And when you look at exactly what the United States has to offer, that's the key question here. And we don't have a direct answer to that. But administration officials say that they are thinking of something more, something different. They're trying to be creative, thinking of new ideas that they can put on the table because even though the Secretary of State said yesterday that they had to -- they had exhausted essentially all options that they could think of to try and get out Paul Whelan at the same time as Brittney Griner. They're trying to go back to the drawing board now to see if they can push this forward and see if there can be any momentum created out of this prisoner swap, Bianna.",
