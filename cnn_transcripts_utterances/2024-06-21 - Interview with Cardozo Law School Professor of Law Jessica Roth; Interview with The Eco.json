Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. It's decision time at the U.S. Supreme Court. The nine justices ruling on a series of cases that may change the course of America before going into their summer recess. Today, the court offered a boost to the Biden administration backing a federal gun ban for domestic abusers. But all eyes are on some key decisions yet to be released, whether Former President Trump is prosecuted or protected from prosecution for actions taken while he was president, whether the prosecution of January 6th rioters via an obstruction statute is lawful. And if a restrictive Idaho abortion ban, which is preventing some patients from getting treatment, can continue. A case that comes almost two years to the day since the overturning of Roe v. Wade by the same court. Well, joining me now to discuss today's ruling as well as what lies ahead is Jessica Roth Professor of Law at the Cardozo Law School. And Steven Mazie, the Supreme Court Correspondent for \"The Economist.\" Welcome both of you. Let me start with you, Jessica. Just your reaction to this near unanimous decision, which for the first time, I believe in recent history at least, narrowed the scope of the Second Amendment as opposed to really interpreting it in a more expansive way.",

And the court applied the approach it articulated in the Bruen case, which has been this expansive ruling in favor of Second Amendment rights. And it said in this majority opinion, again, for eight members of the court, that this particular law prohibiting people subject to an order of domestic violence was consistent with test articulated in Bruen, and it said that lower courts had perhaps been misunderstanding what the court had said in Bruen. And specifically, that it wasn't necessary for the government to identify a regulation or restriction on gun possession at the founding that was identical to the restriction that the government wanted to adopt in modern times, it just had to be similar enough. And there's really interesting language in the opinion saying basically that our law is not fixed in amber, it can, in a sense, be evolving. And so, those were really important statements in the court, in the opinion for the court as well as the ultimate holding that this gun restriction was valid.",

The court, at various points in the opinion for the majoritysaid, we're not addressing this, we're not addressing that, right? We're only addressing the narrow question before us of this particular statute. And it was a facial challenge, which meant they were considering whether it could be constitutional at any circumstances. And they said, well, as applied to this particular defendant, it is constitutional. And they said, we're not presented with a broad prohibition on the possession of firearms, like New York had that was at issue in the 2022 decision. This was a narrow restriction on certain categories of people who had been adjudicated to be a danger to the public or to a specific individual on Kerrying firearms. And the court said, we find a sufficiently similar historical analog to that kind of restriction on gun possession at the founding, on people who were found to be essentially dangerous to the public. This is close enough to that. And we're going to uphold this particular provision. But there will be challenges to other provisions of the same statute -- statutory scheme in federal law that prohibits different categories of people from possessing firearms, such as people with a felony conviction, people who have used or addicted to controlled substances. So, I imagine we're going to see each and every one of those other categories of people who are prohibited from possessing firearms under federal law, testing it as applied to them and that particular provision of the statute.",

That's whether there's presidential immunity, whether Donald Trump is immune for prosecution for subverting the 2022 election, the question of whether prosecutors can use a federal obstruction charge statute to charge January 6th rioters, and whether an Idaho abortion law prevents a federal law that requires emergency rooms to treat patients.

And I think that that's probably why it's taking so long is that there are multiple authors drafting opinions and seeing if they can get some other justices to sign on. What I'm really watching for is whether they are going to ultimately issue an opinion that sets forth a standard for when there is or could be presidential immunity from criminal prosecution and send it back to the lower courts to apply it. And if they do that means there'll be another round of appeals up through the courts likely before any trial could go forward or whether they might say, we're not going to articulate a standard and send it back, we're just going to say on the facts presented in this case, there is no immunity, and we can decide that narrowly without having to send it back. If they choose the latter approach, then there's possibly a window for a trial to occur before the election. But if they send it back, that just means things take much, much longer because of that additional round of appeals.

Obviously, the Senate has to confirm them, but really highlighting for voters what's at stake and how the legacy, the longest lasting impacts of a presidency can be the justices appointed to the Supreme Court by that president. And we're seeing that with the Trump appointees on the court now. And so, I think it is appropriate for President Biden to be highlighting that issue for voters, especially in the context of these very important decisions coming down in these final weeks of the term, hoping that this will resonate with voters as something that they care about, even if they might disagree with the president on some economic issues or other policy issues, perhaps who's on the court for the decades to come and the rights at stake is something that would drive people to the polls who otherwise might stay home or people who are undecided to make a decision.",

Well, according to the latest data, not nearly enough. A report by the Energy Institute finding that despite a rise in renewables, the world consumed record amounts of fossil fuels in 2023. Well, joining me now for more on this is Radley Horton, a climate scientist and professor for Columbia University's Climate School. Welcome back to the program. First, if we can just get your reaction to what we saw at the Hajj there in Saudi Arabia, government officials saying that they deployed 1,600 soldiers, thousands of volunteers issuing a statement saying \"the state did not fail, but there was a misjudgment on the part of people who did not appreciate the risks.\" As we continue to see temperatures climb at events like these tragically over the years and to be expected in the years to come, what more responsibility can states and local governments take on? RADLEY HORTON, PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY'S CLIMATE SCHOOL:  Yes, I think towards your point, society really is showing that it can't keep up right now with the scale of these emerging heat challenges and challenges with other type of extreme events. They're happening simultaneously, for longer duration and more intense than they have in the past, and we're having trouble keeping up. So, towards solutions, obviously, the first thing we have to do is dramatically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We need to rapidly upscale the use of renewables, to electrify our systems. We also need to do much more in the way of adapting, protecting people, including the vulnerable, as we just heard about in that story, when these heat events strike.",

We find them in some parts of the world. We're still in school, right, when these extreme heat waves are hitting, posing threats to children. And really, fundamentally, even their ability to learn in these really high temperatures. Also, cooling centers may not be open yet.

But most fundamentally, as you're getting to, the issue is based -- our basic human physiology, right? We, as mammals, need to shed a lot of heat, right? Everything from thinking to working outdoors to just basically maintaining our bodies produces heat and energy. So, we need to be able to sweat effectively. And as we see temperatures getting higher and higher in the subtle, gradual way, we're losing in these really extreme events the ability to function. So, we see long-term effects on our ability to learn, people with preexisting health conditions, respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, under great stress, the elderly, under great stress.

But as you've alluded to, scientists are also very actively looking at whether we're seeing bigger changes. The kinds of high-pressure systems or heat domes that can get established in a region and not sort of gradually move out west to east as most of us and say the U.S. or Europe or Asia tend to think of storms moving -- of weather systems moving in summer. When these high-pressure systems get locked over a place, you're just baking under that sunlight, you have sinking air that's causing more warming and preventing any clouds or rain. And research is beginning to suggest that a changing climate could set up conditions that enable more of those heat domes to happen in the first place and to get locked in place, which causes feedbacks where it very quickly dry out your soils, which causes even more warming, which can then also set the stage -- is setting the stage for these terrible wildfires that we're seeing and major crop losses as well, in addition to the human health impacts we've been talking about.",

And until we face the reality of white poverty in America and all poverty in America, this book is written to say, we must truly look at all of the poor in our nation, not make it a marginal issue, but a central issue. Because in the richest nation in the history of the world, the poverty that we have now that's undoable -- that you can change, that's abolishable, is in fact one of our greatest immoral realities.",

BARBER II:  Well, it's really bothersome. I made it in public administration and public policy. And when you talk to the average personal fact that they the government person, they'll tell you, oh, poverty is only 30 some million people. Our nation actually says that if a person makes $7.25 an hour, they're not poor. We know that that's not true. The best economists know that not true. When you look at those who would be in poverty if there wasn't some form of government assistance, if you look at those who are in poverty, no wages is because they make less than $15, $16 an hour, they make less than a living wage. And look at the fact that we've not raised the minimum wage for 14 years, since 2009. When you look at the fact that waiters and waitresses for instance make $2.13 cents an hour by law, and what you recognize is the poverty numbers are much higher. In fact, our numbers show that they're around 135 million for and low wage people in this country. And every time we suggest any way, this 30 some million is primarily a black or brown issue, it is a lie. It's a damn lie in the sense that the ancient prophets damned situations and said they were just wrong because it's a lie. And poverty is not an anomaly. It's a feature, it's a central feature of our economic system. Over 41 percent of our adults are poor and or low wealth, and almost 50 percent of our children, and we must deal with it wholly by recognizing it.",

      "sentences": "One of the themes of your book, the core theme, is a core theme of policy in American history, which is the notion that blacks and whitescould be together in a war on poverty as in the old progressive movements and what Dr. Martin Luther King tried to do. But nowadays, blacks and whites are pitted against each other instead of unifying in a war on poverty. Why has that happened? DR. BARBER II:  Well, what we say in the book is there's a history of division. It's not recent or new. It's a continuing of the divide. There was the welfare rights of women, black and white women, who went to Dr. King and said, we needed a Poor People's Campaign. And one of the things Dr. King talked about was (INAUDIBLE) Americas that exist, one flowing with milk and honey and all of the things needed for a life of prosperity. And then, the other one sort of church (ph) and pain. What we know is, down through history, whether it was the effort to break apart the coalition of black -- former slaves and free men and poor and low wage white people that came together after the Civil War to reconstruct America, or whether we saw the -- see the efforts of the Southern Strategy in the late '60s that decided that they were going to engage in intentional polarization and they were going to split out black and white people, (INAUDIBLE) in the south so that those persons would not come together and form a powerful voting bloc that could shift the economic architecture of the country. We have seen, down through history, this attempt to separate the very people that should be together. In our book, we talk about myths. One myth is that pale skin is a shared interest. In other words, that skin color outweighs the ability for people to unify around policy and around saving their lives, and we believe that's a mythology. Only black folk want change in America. We want (INAUDIBLE) that that is not true. The fact of the matter is, over 60 percent of Americans want to see the raise, the minimum wage to a minimum wage.",

BARBER II:  Which is why we question it, right? Well, we say that Republicans are wrong when they suggest that poverty is a moral failing of individuals and not an issue of policy. Because it doesn't matter how moral you live, if you only make $7.25 an hour, you're still coming out poor, and that's a policy issue. Democrats do often talk about middle class, and they talk about lifting some of the middle -- or they talk about those who are trying to get into the middle class.

BARBER II:  This is an American -- it's not any one particular president or administration. What this book points out is far too long that we made politics some marginal issue. And when we do talk about it, we tend to -- let me make up a word, we tend to blackenize it. And when we do talk about it might be one day on the news, then it goes away, or we only talk about homelessness. What we're arguing, whether it's Biden, or Trump, or Obama, or Clinton, or Bush, or whoever comes next, that we as America must face this issue. We must face poverty. We must face the wounds of poverty to black people and white people. When eight Democrats and all the Republicans voted against raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, we didn't care if they were Democrat or Republican, that was wrong. And not only is it wrong based on our constitutional claim of justice for all, it's wrong based on (INAUDIBLE) and religious traditions. And all of these politicians, they put their hands on Bibles, they swear to uphold the constitution, when inside of that bible, that bible says that whether it's from the Jewish tradition or the scriptures that Jewish, Muslim, and Christians that all honor or whether it's from the New Testament, that the poop must be at the center of how we handle and build our society. In fact, there's a great scripture I use often, Isaiah chapter 10, verses 1 through 3, woe onto those who legislate evil and rob the poor of their rights and make women and children prey, P-R-E-Y. Both the bible and our constitution says that poor people, those on the margin, have a right to justice. They have a right to a just society. They have a right to the kind of policy that will allow them to come out of the unnecessary, abolishable, damnable, and death killing reality of poverty.",
