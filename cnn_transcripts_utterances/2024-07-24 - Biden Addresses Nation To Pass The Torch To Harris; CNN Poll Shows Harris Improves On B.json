And that three- point differential, well, that's about half the margin of error that Joe Biden was trailing Trump with just in the spring. He was down six points in our spring poll.So, how is Harris narrowing that gap now into a margin of error race? Well, among young voters 18 to 34, Harris has a four point advantage over Trump in this poll. Trump had a seven-point advantage over Biden with young voters. Black voters, Harris advantage, 63 percentage points over Trump. Biden had a 47 point advantage over Trump. Hispanic voters, Donald Trump's advantage over Biden, was 9 points, now Kamala Harris has narrowed that to a two-point advantage for Trump, still a warning sign. Democrats won the Hispanic vote in 2020 by 30 points. And among female voters, Kamala Harris has a five-point advantage over Trump where he was tied with Biden. Take a look here, too. She has flipped the script on whether or not people are voting for her or against Trump. 50 percent now say they're voting for Harris, 50 percent say they're voting for Harris to cast a vote against Trump. Look at what it was with Joe Biden. Only a third of his voters were voting for Biden.

And that came through tonight.He knows this country. He loves this country. He knows its people. He has great love for the democracy that has made us what we are today, and he will do anything to prevent this country from getting off track. From the very beginning, it was a recognition that we're not perfect. We all got to know the history of this country, far from being perfect. But then we decided, the founding fathers did, to start on a track toward a more perfect union. And we are still on that track. And Joe Biden has done his part to keep us on that. But the other side seemed to want to take us backward. We've done that before. After the 1876 presidential election, which they were trying to replicate on January 6, 2021, we took a backward thrust that led us to Jim Crow. Jim Crow caused things to happen in this country that none of us ought to ever want to revisit.
