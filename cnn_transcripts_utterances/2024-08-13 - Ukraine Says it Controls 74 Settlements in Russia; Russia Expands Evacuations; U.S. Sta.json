And we must warn you, his report does contain graphic images.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice- over):  A Russian attack gunship firing at Ukrainian forces from the air in the Kursk region inside Russia. While on the ground, a Russian soldier's body cam records what appear to be several killed Ukrainians near their destroyed armored vehicle. The Kremlin trying to show its forces are halting Ukraine's advances. But the reality is this, more Russian civilians having to evacuate their towns and villages as Kyiv's troops press ahead. We left the chickens at home, this woman says. We gave them two bags of grain, some water, and left. Maybe there will be nothing to return to. What seemed to be Russian prisoners of war transported in a Ukrainian pickup, as a Ukrainian soldier spray paints the Ukrainian spelling of a town's name inside Russia. Kyiv's lightning offensive caught not just its allies off guard, but Moscow as well. Russian President Vladimir Putin trying to publicly brush off Ukraine's incursion, meeting with the head of the Palestinian Authority in Moscow, after earlier berating his generals to oust Kyiv's troops from Russian soil. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  The main task for the Ministry of Defense is, of course, to drive and squeeze the enemy out of our territories. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  Russia has vowed a massive retaliation in Kyiv fears Moscow could launch even larger missile strikes at Ukrainian cities, but Ukraine's president vowing not to back down. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Russia needs to be forced into peace, especially if Putin is so set on fighting. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  And Vladimir Putin's grip on power may not be as strong as some believe. Russian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza, who was recently released from a Russian jail in a prisoner's swap, said on CNN's OutFront. VLADIMIR KARA-MURZ, RUSSIAN OPPOSITION POLITICIAN:  I don't only think, I don't only believe, I know that Russia will change and I will be back in my homeland. And as I told him, it's going to be much quicker than you ever think. PLEITGEN (voice-over):  But for now, Moscow says it will bring more reinforcements to its southwestern regions to try and oust Ukraine's invasion force before it can dig in.

And this weapons approval, a proposal for approvalof this $20 billion worth of weapons for Israel certainly can potentially be seen in that context because of the timing, because this been -- this approval process has been in the running for a long period of time. And when it times just before these talks and just when other diplomats and leaders in the region are expecting and hoping the United States to put a lot of pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu to take him a more moderate course at these talks on Thursday so that there is a chance of success that they can produce some progress for -- on peace in Gaza. Then certainly it looks like a way of encouraging Israel in that direction. And certainly, the defense minister here, Yoav Gallant, tweeted that this was a positive signal of U.S. support for Israel, a message perhaps not just for politicians in Israel, but also for the Iranians. The Iranians believe to be watching the talks or the potential for the talks hugely closely because therein lies whether or not or how hard they will retaliate for the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran two weeks ago, how hard how much they would strike back at Israel. The idea is if the talks are a success, then that will mitigate a larger Iranian strike. But as President Biden says, it is anyone's guess, if you will, at the moment if this is going to be successful. A huge amount of pressure being put on Hamas as well at the moment who are insisting that any participation that they may have in this process on Thursday will be conditional that it is President Biden's framework proposal for peace in Gaza that emerged in July that is implemented, not negotiated. They're very afraid that Prime Minister Netanyahu will come and make add-ons. His office has said that they haven't made add-ons, but that's the big perception in the region here. So, the pressure is on hugely, but the fact that diplomatic process is still working and that talks are still expected to happen Thursday is indicative that there is a possibility here, at least to get the talks restarted after the killing of Ismail Haniyeh, who was, you know, the principal Hamas negotiator in and around those talks.",

Tropical Storm Ernesto, likely to become a hurricane overnight. Hurricane watches are posted, not warnings, because as storm becomes a hurricane, it should be moving away from the islands. So, hopefully, they never get any hurricane conditions. But about 50 miles from St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands, likely to go pretty much right over the British Virgin Islands. Here's the latest radar here. Now, it's moved to the east there just now of San Juan Puerto Rico and will likely only maybe give 40-mile per hour, 60- kilometer per hour winds to San Juan and for most of Puerto Rico as it's a brushing on by just off toward the east. An awful lot of rainfall. Still going to see it, though, move up as we talked about yesterday toward Bermuda. And Bermuda, you are still right in the middle of the cone. Hope that this would go left or right, really to the right into the middle of the Atlantic. But so far, it has not. The water temperatures are 1 to 3 degrees above normal Celsius, 3 to 5 Fahrenheit. And the models still bring it very close to Bermuda Friday night into Saturday. The European model slightly to the east of Bermuda, the American model slightly to the left, to the west. I don't like that because when you add them together and divide by two, you're just too close there to Bermuda. And there's the radar and the satellite. So, there it goes. There are the models. And Bermuda, that word right there in the middle of all those lines. Now, we shift our attention back out toward the west, taking a look at what's going to happen toward Japan, toward Tokyo. Tokyo, you are in the cone of a typhoon. Yes, and possibly about 170 to 180 kilometer per hour typhoon as it works its way toward Japan. And that's -- finally, that would be 72 hours from now. So, kind of in the window of the weekend as we get closer and closer. But here comes the rainfall one way or the other. Does the wind actually get on land? Yes, some. Does it get to Tokyo? A little jog to the left. And this is way too close. You can see Tokyo right there. Here's Sendai up there where the -- obviously, the earthquake took place years ago.

But whatever happened here, it was not a good look for the company. Musk circled back this morning and did acknowledge that it was due at least in part to what he called unforced errors on the part of this company.

The Mars InSight mission is an absolutely remarkable accomplishment to deliver such a sensitive piece of equipment tothe surface of another planet that can detect the minute marsquakes equivalent to earthquakes. And when a seismometer records vibrations of the ground and this is what marsquakes do. And the speed at which these waves move through the crust of Mars tells you something about the properties of those rocks, what they're made of, are they filled with cracks, and what's inside those cracks. Is it water, is it ice, or is it gas? And the speed at which seismic waves travel on Mars is best explained by having a crust full of cracks and cracks full of liquid water.",
