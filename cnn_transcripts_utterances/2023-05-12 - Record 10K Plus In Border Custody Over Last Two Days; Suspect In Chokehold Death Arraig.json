So, you have, Areva, Penny charged with second-degree manslaughter here. Walk us through these charges.AREVA MARTIN, ATTORNEY &amp; LEGAL AFFAIRS COMMENTATOR: Yes. Essentially, Brianna, what a second-degree manslaughter charge is in New York is that someone has to have been reckless in -- with regards to their actions, and their reckless actions resulted in the death of another person. These are very serious felony charges. They carry up to a 15- year jail sentence if there is a conviction on these charges. We heard that Penny's lawyer is going to argue self-defense. But I think there's a real problem with that defense, Brianna, because as we just heard also, Penny did not see Mr. Neely engage in any kind of physical conduct. Yes, he may have been loud. He may have been shouting that he was hungry. He wanted food. But Jordan Neely never struck anyone. He never used any level of force and you can't use self-defense that is disproportionate to the threat that is -- that you may perceive. It's like taking a gun to a fistfight. So, although Mr. Neely may have been loud, he may have been boisterous, he wasn't using any kind of physical actions to attack anyone. KEILAR: So, anticipatory self-defense, let's call it.

And I think there's testimony out there where one of the individuals on the subway was yelling to Mr. Penny, you know that that's a hell of a chokehold or something to suggest that he was using a level of force that was not reasonable.And that's what this case really comes down to was that level of force necessary and wasn't reasonable.
