We continue our breaking news coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. I'm Rosemary Church. And we are following a surprising delay in the agreement between Israel and Hamas that puts off the expected release of hostages until Friday.A temporary truce is also delayed. The update came just hours before a humanitarian pause in fighting and the initial release of 50 women and children hostages was expected to begin. Both U.S. and Israeli officials point to logistical details for the delay, while one Israeli official says Israel has not yet received the names of the first hostages to be freed. Meantime, Israeli forces are still pressing on with their offensive against Hamas, striking parts of North Eastern and Central Gaza. Though Palestinians say areas further south were also hit. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is making it clear the war is not slowing down, and he expressed confidence the deal would soon go into effect. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL (through translator): Which paved the way to the current agreement was a combination of two big efforts. The first one, being a massive nonstop military pressure that we are putting on Hamas. The second is the heavy diplomatic pressure we've been applying to release our hostages. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Rosemary. It seems to be a more about execution and logistics than about the core of the deal itself which as we know, has been approved by the Israeli cabinet. Now, obviously, we're hearing from not only Israeli officials but the White House as well, the White House National Security Council spokesperson, saying that this was about ironing out final logistical details that delaying one day was in effect to minimize the chance of something going wrong.I think that's a measure of just how delicate and how hard won this agreement is. As to what happens next, what we're hearing this morning from a diplomatic source in Qatar to our Becky Anderson saying that Qatar is expected to announce in the next few hours when the truce between Israel and Hamas will begin as you know, that was also delayed it was expected to start this morning. Now the earliest that would start according to this source would be midnight local time which is 5pm in the -- in the eastern coast of the United States. So that would be the earliest that this would start. Now, obviously, what happens after that, we expect suddenly, according to the Israeli Security Council that will progress along the lines of the agreements, the details of which we already had seen many of that, essentially, that an initial group of 50 Israeli hostages, this would be heavily focused on women and children to begin with would be released over the course of a few days. A minimum of 10 per day according to the Qatar residers, of course, the key mediator in this. This wouldn't be accompanied, of course, by that four-day pause. And in return, the homicide would get the release of some 150 Palestinian prisoners, minors and women from Israeli prisons as well as of course, a significant increase in aid trucks going into Gaza. And a six-hour window each day when neither Israel nor the U.S. would fly surveillance drones over Gaza. So that's what Hamas would be getting in return. Obviously, now, we know that some of those logistical details are still being ironed out. There is an option, this is critical to extend baked into that agreement if things go well. There could be further pause and fighting, followed by the further release of both Palestinian prisoners within Israel and Israeli hostages. But it's not clear at this stage how far this can be pushed because of course, Israel has two key goals with its operation in Gaza. One to free these hostages and two, to completely dismantle Hamas. This is why Israel continues to say that it will return to fighting once this pause is over. Take a listen to what Prime Minister Netanyahu had to say on that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NETANYAHU (through translator): Citizens of Israel, I like to be clear the war continues. The war continues. We will continue with it until all our goals are achieved. To bring back the hostages, to demolish Hamas and ensure that the day afterwards, there is no source that educates terror to children and the terrorists. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "New York Governor Kathy Hochul saying there is no indication of a terrorist attack at this point in the investigation of that explosion that happened at the Rainbow Bridge crossing there -- the crossing between U.S. and Canadian border. What we're learning from sources is that a vehicle was traveling on a local road on Niagara Falls at a high rate of speed, before it hit a curb, went airborne and then eventually collided and exploded really into the secondary screening at that border crossing.And investigators from the federal -- at the federal level, state level and local are looking at surveillance video in that area, getting a registration for that car, and sort of tracing its movements prior to this explosion happening to get a better sense of exactly what happened. The governor actually saying that the debris field of this explosion spans about 13 or 14 booths at that crossing, and only an engine is left of that car. So that, of course, as you can imagine, is making this investigation go a little bit slower than typically one would go, because of the size of that debris field. But the big point here though is that, at this point, it does not seem there's any indication of terrorist activity which was, of course, something that everyone was concerned about as we are all in the state of heightened -- especially authorities are in a state of heightened alert in response to what is happening overseas, but also because of what is happening right now in this country as our thanksgiving holiday. We know also in response to this, in the immediate aftermath, that borders were -- the border checkpoints were all shut down. We know some have reopened and we also know that there was extra security measures that were taken at the airports in that area, and even really in some U.S. major cities in the northeast. But we know some of that has tamped down, but certainly, heightened security is the theme here as we head into the holiday. And that was the case even before this incident happened. But again, the headline here that it does not appear to be a terrorist incident. I'm Brynn Gingras, CNN, New York. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Temperatures are going to be in the 50s in New York City, 40s in Chicago, and 40 in Denver after an afternoon high in the upper-60s yesterday. But if you're going west of Denver, you are going to get snow and that is likely what you want if you're going there because these are all the (ph) ski resorts are. There will be significant snow on some of the peaks of those 14ers all the way down towards Crested Butte, even up into Wyoming, significant numbers likely over a foot at those highest of ski resorts.Cold weather across most of the U.S. over the next couple of days, at least below normal. Denver, you were upper-60s yesterday, and 13 by tomorrow morning. That is the cold front that is going to affect even Chicago, although not quite as dramatic because we are already in the 40s and the morning lows are going to be in the 20s over the weekend. There will be some snow on the Rockies for your way home, possibly all the way up even towards Chicago, but none of this likely enough to cause too many slowdowns. Hope you have a Happy Thanksgiving.
