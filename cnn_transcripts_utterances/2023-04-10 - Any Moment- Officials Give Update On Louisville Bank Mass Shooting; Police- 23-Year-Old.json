      "sentences": "All right. It's the top of the hour in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Fredricka Whitfield in New York and we are moments away from an update on today's deadly mass shooting in Louisville, Kentucky.A gunmen opening fire at a downtown bank, killing at least four people and wounding nine others. Police responded quickly getting into a gunfight with the shooter, two officers were injured in the exchange with one now in critical condition. The shooter is dead and police are still trying to piece together how he was killed and why the former bank employee may have gone on this shooting spree. Officials are expecting to hold a briefing at any moment. Of course, we'll take that to you. But before it begins, let's go first to CNN's Shimon Prokupecz Sherman Procopius. So Shimon, what do we know about how all of this unfolded? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Right. So sometimes it's around 8:30 this morning or after 8:30, before the bank was open, the shooting took place. Police saying that they were there within three minutes. Just think about that. The fact that they got there so quickly and yet still not enough to save those four lives. And they encountered gunfire almost immediately. They exchanged gunfire with the shooter and then they at some point went in. It's unclear if they killed him or if he killed himself. They also say that some of the employees were hiding in the vault. It sounds like there were actually a lot of people already inside the bank. A lot of the employees were at work already. But obviously, the big thing here is what is this person's connection to the bank.",

      "sentences": "We've heard the police say that this was either a former employee or a current employee. So hopefully, in this press conference, which hopefully is minutes away, we'll learn more about the connection. Also the weapon here used. We've learned that it was an AR-15-style rifle, something we've heard about so often in all of these shootings. It's a gun that, sadly, has been used in many of the mass shootings that we've covered.So perhaps we'll learn more about that. But obviously, there just are a lot of questions still remaining about this person, about the weapon and what else we can learn about the victims. We saw the governor in that press conference get emotional saying these are his friends - friends of his that were injured and killed inside his bank. So this is really hitting this community pretty roughly as one can only imagine. But hopefully we get to hear or learn some new information that could shed some light on the motives there.",

Joining us right now, CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst and former FBI Director, Andrew McCabe and CNN Senior Law Enforcement Analyst and former Philadelphia and Washington Metro Police Commissioner, Charles Ramsey, good to see all of you. So Andrew, you first. We're waiting on this briefing to Begin. What are the questions that you are hoping will get answered at this stage? So very early on, the gunman is dead, but what are the expectations that you have?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, you're right. I mean, that's going to be important to find out how he gained access, is he a current employee, is he a former employee, did he just follow somebody inside. I mean, we don't know that and hopefully we'll get more information at this press conference.One of the things, though, I think that'll be covered, as well as the rapid response of the Louisville Metropolitan Police to the scene, three minutes is incredible response time. I heard Andrew actually mentioned this earlier and he's absolutely right. People need to also consider the fact that it takes time between the initial call from 911 dispatcher getting the information and dispatching to the police. In the best of circumstances, you're talking about adding another minute to that. It's unavoidable, but it's going to happen and someone with an AR-15 or any kind of assault weapon, a lot of damage can be done in a very short period of time, so this is really tragic in many ways.",

But even when police were to get there, perhaps they already had some kind of inkling about what kind of firearm may have been used just simply by the sound of it and how equipped are they to respond to something like this, Andrew.",

      "sentences": "Well, there's no doubt that as a law enforcement officer, especially if you've trained around these weapons, if you have an AR- 15-style rifle, which many patrol officers have issued to them now, they carry them in their vehicles, you fired that weapon, you know exactly what it sounds like. And you can just - you don't have to be an expert firearms person to distinguish the sound of an AR-15 from, let's say, the sound of a handgun report.So when police officers arrived on that scene, they hear shots being fired what is likely a high powered rifle. They are going to arm themselves with the best, the strongest and the most lethal weapons they have in their vehicle. And we haven't heard these details about this level of specifics about the response, but it's my strong suspicion that some - at least some of those officers who responded likely had long guns rifles that they brought to the response, which is absolutely necessary in this day and age, when every day as an officer on patrol and you get in your car, start your shift, you run a pretty, pretty scary likelihood of coming across an individual who might be armed with that kind of lethality, whether it's a mass shooting or just this straight up criminal gun violence issue on the streets. The fact is, in this arms race that we currently have in this country where perpetrators are more and more often armed with military-style weapons, we have to have an equivalent response, we have to arm our police officers with the sort of weapons that will enable them to handle someone who is armed and potentially protected in that way.",

I'm sure warrants are being executed, they're trying to get - they'll take computers, they'll take any other kind of items from the home that can give them some indication as to why, as more about this individual so that they can try to determine a motive.They're also in the process of interviewing people that know him, whether it's family, friends, co-workers, whatever it may be. So you've got a lot of things going on right now that are taking place and it'll continue for a period of time, but we'll find out more. I see the ...",
