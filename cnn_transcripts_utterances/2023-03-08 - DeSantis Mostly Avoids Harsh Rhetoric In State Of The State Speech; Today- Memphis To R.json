He's going to speak just a few miles from me later today so I guess we'll know then.But look, the fact remains that there is a whole long list of priorities that are divisive and ideological that DeSantis and Republican lawmakers are pursuing this legislative session. It includes things like restricting abortion to as early as potentially six weeks in a pregnancy. It includes lifting permits to carry a concealed gun in public. They want to ban gender studies and diversity and equity and inclusion programs on college campuses. The bill that last year said you couldn't teach sexual orientation or gender identity until third grade -- that's back, extending it to eighth grade. There are bills targeting teachers' unions and liable laws, and in-state tuition for undocumented students. The list goes on. And DeSantis has a plan to rack up as many legislative wins as he can and there's really nothing Democrats can do to stop him. The Republicans have a supermajority in both chambers. DeSantis knows this. And really, they can push through anything that he wants. And this is an advantage that DeSantis has over the other potential 2024 contenders. You know, Donald Trump -- he can't use executive authority anymore. Former Gov. Nikki Haley -- she can't set a legislative agenda or sign bills. DeSantis can do all of that. And over the next 60 days he intends to flex that power -- use the legislature to rack up as many policy wins as possible before he makes a decision on whether or not he wants to run for president, Christine.",

They announced that their investigation -- the administrative investigation into these officers is now complete and that 13 officers were brought up on administrative charges. Seven of the officers have been fired, three have been suspended, and two actually -- their charges were dismissed and so they are back on the job, and then one of the officers resigned. So a total -- a total of 13 officers were brought up on civil charges and administrative charges there with the department. Of course, five of those officers have been charged by the Shelby County D.A. there in Memphis.

You know, we've seen the Fed on this really clear pathway towards slower, more gradual rate increases. They've been sort of trending towards and then as of February, were moving at this quarter-point per meeting pace on rate increases.
