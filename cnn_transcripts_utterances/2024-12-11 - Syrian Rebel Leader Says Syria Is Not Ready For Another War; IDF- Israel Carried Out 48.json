Tonight, the leader of the Syrian rebel forcesthat toppled Bashar al Assad's regime is now overseeing quite a delicate as well as dangerous, potentially chaotic transition of power. And this map that we've shown you of Syria shows really extremely complicated web of alliances, the green area here that they're overseeing, mostly HTS. In fact, the HTS leader, Mohamed al-Jolani says foreign governments should not fear war with Syria, and he believes his country is heading towards political stability. But that hasn't stopped foreign powers from taking this moment to work toward their own strategic goals. Israel says it struck Syria nearly 500 times in just a period of two days. And reports from Turkey say a Turkish drone this week destroyed military vehicles as well as ammunitions in northern Syria that had been seized by a Kurdish group. Germany's Foreign Minister is urging Turkey as well as Israel not to jeopardize a peaceful transition in Syria. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNALENA BAERBOCK, FOREIGN MINISTER, GERMANY (through translator): If we want a peaceful Syria, the country's territorial integrity must not be put into question. I will say just as clearly, neighbors such as the Turkish and the Israeli governments, which claim security interests must not endanger the process with their actions. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, we're looking really at this part here of land. CNN cannot independently confirm that claim, but it's near an area, Israeli forces captured on Sunday. Our Jeremy Diamond has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): In the dead of night, Syrian Naval ships going up in flames. At daybreak, this is all that remains of the Syrian fleet at Latakia after Israel launched a wave of strikes intended to destroy the strategic arsenal of the newly-deposed regime of Bashar al Assad. Israeli missile ships fired the fatal blow at Latakia. Many more were carried out by Israeli jets. Altogether, nearly 500 strikes since the fall of Assad's regime. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator): We have no intention to intervene in Syria's internal affairs.

Darayya was also the scene of some of the worst atrocities really that we've seen of the war. Huge swathes of the Damascus suburb are now rubble. Jomana Karadsheh met with one woman there whose loved ones disappeared in Syria's notorious prison system. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (GUNFIRE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): What's left of Darayya tells of the horrors that unfolded here. Every corner scarred by a ruthless regime's fight for survival. This Damascus suburb rose up peacefully, demanding freedom. More than a decade on, a shattered Darayya and its people are finally free. \"This was for our children\", Um Firas tells me, \"it's so they don't have to live under the tyrant's rule.\" Her story of loss and pain, so unfathomable for us, yet so common in this place that for years endured some of the most brutal tactics of the Assad regime. Besieged, starved and bombed into surrender. (on camera): Um Firas says they came out asking for freedom, and they were met with bullets and tanks. She says we're not  terrorists, and they did this. And imagine, she says, there were women and children living in these homes. So many men like her husband Marzin(ph), detained and disappeared. Two years later, a released prisoner told her he saw him in jail. \"They beat him so much his wounded leg was infected. He was in so much pain\", she says. \"There was no medical care in prison and because of all he was going through, he lost his mind. The prisoner last saw him taken away, crying and screaming hysterically.\" She went from one detention center to the next, searching for him until they broke the news to her in the most cruel of ways. They handed her his belongings and told her to register his death. \"There are no words to describe how I was feeling when I left\", she says. \"I was holding on to the hope he would be released and our family would be reunited. They didn't even give me his body.\" This is the last photo she has of Marzin(ph) and his youngest boy. Ghaith(ph) doesn't remember his dad, Nord(ph) was six and so attached to his father. Every day he would wait by the door for him to come back. \"When I would hear someone calling Baba, dad, it was torment for me\", Um Firas says. \"What did these children do to be deprived of their father?\" She has to be strong for her boys. She says she is all they have. Her father also disappeared into the black holes of Assad's jails, like her husband, their only crime, she says, was being from Darayya. She says I'm just one of thousands and thousands of stories, and that's just in Darayya. And just imagine how many more there are across Syria.

We are learning that FBI Director Christopher Wray is saying he will resign sometime before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's return to the White House, of course, which happens next month in January. Wray still had some years left to serve out his term, but Trump has been pushing for Kash Patel to take over. I want to bring in Katelyn Polantz who joins us now. So, Katelyn, what more has the FBI director said? It's no surprise to any of us that President-elect Trump wanted him out, right? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Trump wanted him out. But this is a position where Christopher Wray has three years left of a ten-year term that he was appointed to that he will not be serving out. This is a man who came from a very well respected history, working in private practice law was chosen by Donald Trump in 2017 to fill the shoes of Jim Comey, who was the FBI director Trump fired. And then Trump became very unhappy with Wray over the course of his presidency. Wray continued to serve as the FBI director, overseeing the bureau at a time where the FBI was under intense fire and he was defending them on the work they were doing with January 6th enforcement, prosecuting all of those Capitol riot defendants, finding all of the evidence against them. That was part of the FBI's work as well as the work the FBI did on that search of Mar-a-Lago, Trump's own residence. So, it became quite clear Wray was not going to be sticking around one way or another once Donald Trump retook the presidency, Trump made clear he would be wanting his -- a different person in, Kash Patel, that -- that is the person he would want to nominate for the FBI director. And so, Wray is now heading that off by saying today in a town hall with people in the FBI that he is going to be serving only until the end of this administration. I'll read for you a couple of the things that he said. \"After weeks of careful thought, I've decided the right thing for the bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current administration in January and then step down. My goal is to keep the focus on our mission, the indispensable work you're doing with the FBI on behalf of the American people every day, in my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the bureau deeper into the fray while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.\" So, Chris Wray, exiting or planning to exit quite soon as the FBI director, so that a different person that Donald Trump wants to take that job. Kash Patel, who has been very at odds with many of the things --",

There have been so many people within the FBI that Trump personally was publicly criticizing, and also some of the practices of the FBI, including how they were obtaining foreign surveillance warrants. That was something that even courts started looking at more closely, and that there were reforms coming. So, Wray has been out there in recent years defending the bureau and trying to instill a confidence in the people who work there. Again, but it is a moment where Trump has issues still with the way the FBI does its work. And so, this final message from Chris Wray, you know, is one in which he's trying to keep things steady, at least from the remarks that we've been able to obtain.
