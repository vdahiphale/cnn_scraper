      "sentences": "And tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.The staggering cost of Donald Trump's own words, $83 million, for years of defaming the writer, E. Jean Carroll, even after a jury found that he sexually abused her. But is this enough to make it stop? We'll see. Because Trump is raging, tonight, not even sticking around in court, to hear the verdict as it was read. Tonight, we have two insiders, with their takes here. Someone who was in the courtroom; along with the person, who first told E. Jean Carroll, to consider suing Donald Trump, the chance run-in at a party that got this case going. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. An astounding $83.3 million. That's on top of the $5 million that Trump was already ordered, by a jury, to pay E. Jean Carroll, after he was found liable, for sexually abusing her, in the 1990s. Today's eye- popping number is for defaming Carroll, in 2019. There she is, with her legal team today, after the decision made, by nine jurors, seven men and two women, who deliberated for less than three hours. As you might imagine, Trump is livid tonight, not even staying at the court, for the verdict to be read. He actually left twice today. The first time, storming out as Carroll's attorney was making her closing argument. This is a court sketch of that moment. There were no cameras inside. Earlier tonight, Trump took to social media, posting quote, \"Absolutely ridiculous. I fully disagree with both verdicts, and\" we \"will be appealing.\" He also tried to blame President Biden, who I should note is not involved, in this case, and was in Delaware in 2019, not in the White House, when Carroll filed that initial lawsuit. Trump's attorney, Alina Habba, whom the judge at one point today, threatened to lock up if she didn't sit down and follow the court rules, caused quite a scene outside, after that verdict was read.

He thinks they don't apply to him. And as bad as what he did to E.

It's about -- it's about right and wrong. It's about truth and lies. It's about justice, and injustice. This is about nine regular people, in New York, picked randomly, giving justice, and meting it out to a man, who was President of the United States, a man who has, by his own account, billions of dollars, and showing to the world that America still stands for justice. That still means it doesn't mean what Donald Trump wants it to mean, which is that he can do whatever he wants, with impunity, that he is above the law that he -- that he is accountable to no one.

Well, there is no new Donald Trump. The Donald Trump that you see today is the same Donald Trump that people have, who have been watching him closely, for years, and who I unfortunately had to watch, over the last several years, it's the same Donald Trump. He is, as Judge Kaplan, the president judge in this case, said, he's somebody, who can't control himself. And he can't control himself because he's a deeply disturbed, a deeply morally bereft human being, who has no conscience, has no morality, has no empathy, has no remorse, and is sadistic, as we saw during the trial. And as the jurors saw, in the trial, right in front of their very eyes, that he had nothing but contempt, for the woman that he raped and libeled and defamed, so many times. This is a sick man. He is a bad man. And what's most disturbing about this is that so -- so many people make this about politics that they want to support him, for whatever reason, or because they've done it in the past, and they pretend that he is not who he is. And many of them -- I mean, some of them are regulars (ph). But many of them, in the upper reaches, of his political party, know better. They know who he is. They talk about who he is behind closed doors. They know he is an evil man. They know he is a sick man. They talk about his mental deficiencies, his psychological disorders. They talk about what a pathological liar he is. And then, when somebody asks them to go on the record, to talk about it, they say, oh, no comment, I didn't see the tweet. They say, like a presidential candidate recently did, I haven't been following the case, or something like that. And they're all lying, lying to protect a pathological liar. And it's about time that these people look themselves, in the mirror, and start telling the truth, OK? It's better for them, in the long run, to start telling the truth, and admit that they've been covering up, for a sexual predator, a criminal, a thief, a man who does not deserve to hold any office, let alone the highest office in the land. But this is, again, it's not about politics. It's about right and wrong. And people need to start looking at it that way.",

ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY: Yes. The liability issue, which is what Alina Habba was talking about, was already decided. That's what was resolved in the first trial, back last spring. And so, Judge Kaplan correctly ruled, this is not about that. That's already settled. This is only about damages. So, what she was complaining about there was completely coming from another universe. And to Kristy's observation, I think it's important to understand just how bizarre and self-destructive it is, to get up in the middle of a closing argument and walk out. I mean, we've practiced in that courtroom. You are trained. You're sitting feet away from the jury. They are watching everything you do. We are trained, you don't even drink from your water cup, if they're looking at you, like that's how paranoid you are, about giving a good impression.

LEE CARTER, FORMER REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST &amp; POLLSTER, PARTNER, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS, AUTHOR, \"PERSUASION\": Right. She is talking about it being a distraction. But I think she's trying to focus the American voters, on what's most important to them, saying that we know that the number one issue to Americans right now is immigration. We're not talking about that. We're talking about Donald Trump. She didn't really have to get into all the details on the rest, to really make her point. And I think her point is well made with her supporters. And you look at Republicans by and large, there's really two sets of them. There's those that are going to support Trump, no matter what, that are right now in rage, that are rallying behind him, that are going to say that no matter what, this was unfair. And then, those that are saying like, I cannot believe this is the candidate. And those, you saw in New Hampshire, about 35 percent of those that voted, that were Republicans in New Hampshire, said they would never ever vote for Donald Trump.

The court did stop short of calling for a ceasefire. That's what many Arab American leaders in Michigan want to see.

H. HAMMOUD: I'm not even saying that a ceasefire gains back support. I'm saying that a ceasefire provides a pathway to have a conversation.

She's mitigated -- mitigated her risk, by being really careful what races she enters in. And I think it's been a great tactic so far. It's served her very well. She obviously has 95 World Cup wins. And she knows what she's doing. But I think it's different, when you fall in downhill. You're going a lot faster. You're going anywhere between 70 and 85 miles an hour. She definitely hit the fence hard. So, I'm sure she's going to be sore. And I'm sure she's going to be back soon. I know she's trying to get her bearings, right now, as everyone does when they crash.
