Heartbreak at the Qatar World Cup. Acclaimed sports journalist Grant Wahl, dying suddenly, while covering the soccer tournament. Circumstances of his passing remain unclear at this moment. Witnesses say he collapsed in the press area of the Argentina-Netherlands quarterfinals match. Wahl was one of the preeminent voices for soccer in the U.S., covering the sport for decades. His death triggering a response from U.S. sports figures, from soccer and beyond. The U.S. state department is now working with Wahl's family during this very difficult time. CNN's Amanda Davis and Nic Robertson joining us right now. So, Amanda, you first. This is not the kind of news anyone expected to be covering for this World Cup. What are you learning? AMANDA DAVIES, CNN SPORT ANCHOR (on camera): Yes. Not at all, Fredricka. And I have to say it's really strange standing here outside the Al-Bayt Stadium with England against France. The fourth quarter final set to kick off in just a couple of hours. Time thinking it was just 24 hours ago that Grant Wahl walked across the concourse at the Lusail Stadium with a couple of his European football colleagues, excited to attend that Argentina-Netherlands match. And there really is utter shock, disbelief, people trying to comprehend really. I was there in that media tribune last night. It's a huge, huge area. And I have to say, myself and a large number of my colleagues enjoyed the game went home and it was only when we woke up this morning that we learned the tragic news. And what we understand, Grant had been very open over the last couple of weeks talking about the fact he wasn't feeling well. He was suffering some chest pains and chest tightness. He wasn't alone in that. There's a number of bugs that have been going around here at The World Cup. He took himself to a medical center, he was given some antibiotics, what -- for what he understood to be treatment for bronchitis. But then, as the match went into extra time yesterday, as you mentioned, he collapsed in the stands. He was treated by medical professionals for 20 to 25 minutes, and then, taken to hospital here in Doha where sadly, it was announced in the early hours of this morning, he had passed away at the age of 49. And in true Grant fashion though, for somebody who loved football or soccer -- I feel I should be calling it soccer in tribute for two grand over the next 24 hours or so. He was at this game enjoying every second of this match. His final tweets on social media talking about the late, late free kick from the Netherlands that took the game into extra time. And those trying to take some comfort from the fact that he passed on doing what he loved best, a little bit earlier on. We got the thoughts of his podcast co-host Chris Whittyngham about the facts he was there, as a member of the U.S. soccer contingent writing about Argentina. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS WITTYNGHAM, CO-HOST, FUTBOL WITH GRANT WAHL (via telephone): Actually spent a year in Argentina in the 90s around the time that the USP Argentina and the Copa America. And he told me a story about how he wore American colors in Buenos Aires that evening, and was nearly, you know, beaten up by some locals because he dared to celebrate an American victory in Argentina. But he loved that country and would have loved seeing them get through to the World Cup semifinal today, and we would have loved talking about it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But they are doing what they can, and this is exactly where diplomats around the world play a big role.At times like this, at times of family's crisis, where loved ones need to get -- need to get that -- their family member back home. Need to get the medical support, the medical understanding, the details of what happened, clearly, so, they can have a clearer picture of what happened, and this is what the state department is doing now. We know that they are reaching out and connecting with Qatari officials to urge them to do everything that they can expeditiously to meet the family's wishes. Now, the United States has a really strong diplomatic relationship with Qatar. United States has a big military base there. When United States was trying to evacuate people from Afghanistan, somewhere before, those Qatar, stepped up, helped out massively there. So, the good news for the family, and what is an absolutely tragic time for them, is that the diplomatic relations are good and that the help should be forthcoming, and that they should help them get the answers, they want the clarity, they want -- and bring -- ultimately, bring Grant back home. And that's what the state departments working towards with a Qatar is right now.",

The Moroccans have traveled in the 10s of 1000s. Extra flights being put on from Morocco here to Qatar over the last 24 hours for this moment. And they had said, please don't write us off. Yes, we're further in this tournament than we have ever come before. But we now believe we can go on and win this tournament. And they have taken a huge, huge step forward to defying the odds once again. So, Walid Regragui's Morocco into the semifinal of a World Cup at the expense of Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal.

The Democrats will still have a lot of the power that they get with that 51 seat majority. She will, of course, be keeping her committee seats.

Well, when you know the -- when you know what happened now, you sort of put together some of the pieces differently before. But she is kind of without a political home. I mean, part of this is, you know, I think that how Arizona is an emerging swing state. But also, she was going to face a competitive primary and another Congressman Greg Stanton released a hypothetical Democratic primary poll for 2024. This showed him leading cinema 58 to 17 in a Democratic primary. I think this is, you know, she was looking for a path forward and realize that running as a Democrat wasn't going to work. That doesn't mean that running as an Independent is going to be any easier, it's just a more different -- it's a different and complicated race. And Republicans. They -- I think Republicans like Sinema, because she kind of makes it difficult for Democrats, but they don't necessarily want to embrace her. I mean, she voted to impeach Trump. She's voted for all of Biden's judicial nominees. So, she is really searching for political home right now.",

And now, she's shifted all the way to where she is now. And so, I think that Sinema is actually a smart politician, she's sort of realized how she can both get attention and do what's right for her constituencies.

The women alleged their previous romantic partners used the AirTags to track their whereabouts potentially putting their lives at risk. Joining me right now is Mark Rasch.He is a lawyer and a cyber and privacy expert. Mark, so good to see you. Oh, also, with your credentials here, you're also a former Justice Department prosecutor for cybercrimes, can't leave that out. Good to see you. So first, you know, the women claim that AirTags made it possible for their ex partners to stalk them. So what is the main purpose of these devices? MARK RASCH, CYBER &amp; PRIVACY EXPERT: So the AirTag is a small device about this size. This is an AirTag holder that you can use to track your bicycle, your car, your purse, you know, you put it in there. And then if that device is stolen, you can track where it is, also finding lost keys, finding a lost wallet, that kind of stuff, so it's very useful for that type of thing.",

And it is a very common thing for people to use these kinds of devices to try to track people that they want to follow. [12",

      "sentences": "OK. And Apple has not commented specifically on this case. But earlier this year, Apple added more safeguards to the AirTag to cut down on unwanted a tracking and that includes alerting people sooner and louder if the small Bluetooth tracker is suspected to be tracking someone. In announcing those changes, Apple released a statement and it read in part here it is, we've become aware that individuals can receive unwanted tracking alerts for benign reasons such as when borrowing someone's keys with an AirTag attached or when traveling in a car with a family members air pods left inside.We also have seen reports of bad actors attempting to misuse AirTags for malicious or criminal purposes. We condemn in the strongest possible terms, any malicious use of our products, end quote. So is that enough to protect Apple from this lawsuit?",

And so there's a number of claims in the lawsuit. One is product liability. This is a known or anticipated misuse of their product. The second one is violation of California privacy laws. The other one is deceptive trade practices, that this is an unfair invasion of the privacy of these women.Now Apple does do a number of things to as you said, to prevent this from happening. One is if you have an Apple device like an iPhone, and you're traveling with it, and there's somebody's air -- a tracker, an AirTag in your car or on your person that you didn't put there, it will give you a notification on your phone saying, hey, there's some unknown AirTag traveling with you assuming that you've updated the operating system of your phone. But that won't work if you have an Android phone.",

The idea is if you have a product and introduce it into the stream of commerce, you get the benefit of the sales from people using it properly. But there's a risk of misuse. And in those kinds of cases, the manufacturer of the product can be held liable for any anticipated misuse of the product. But in this case, the product is doing what it's supposed to do.It's tracking where the AirTag is. And in fact, if you made that impossible, then the AirTag wouldn't be useful. If I have one, for example, in my bicycle, if someone steals my bike, I can track where the bike is. But it did have to alert that person, hey, the bike that you just stole has an AirTag in it, then it defeats the utility of the AirTag because that person will just take the AirTag out, remove it, throw it away, and I can't track the bicycle. So you have to do this balance.",
