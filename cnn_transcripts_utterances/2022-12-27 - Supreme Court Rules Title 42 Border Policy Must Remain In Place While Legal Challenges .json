They also made their position quite clear, saying that, quote, Title 42 is a public health measure, not an immigration enforcement measure, and it should not be instead it indefinitely. Now, since this has come down, there is already confusion around the border. Immigrant advocates and groups have been disseminating information to migrants on both sides of the border to try to convey what this means, which is ultimately that this public health authority that was invoked at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic will continue to remain in effect, meaning that officials can continue to expel migrants who they encounter at the U.S.-Mexico border. Now, Lee Gelernt, the attorney of the American Civil Liberties Union, said that it is, quote, deeply disappointing. Republicans on the other hand pleased with the order, saying that it will prevent a surge of migrants, but, ultimately, the White House making it quite clear that they will continue their preparations for the end of this authority whenever that may be.

In fact, they're doing more than they're constitutionally allowed to do, even Justice Gorsuch pointed that out today. They've gone beyond their role. Congress has to fix this.

And the border is a problem that is at best managed, not solved.But to get a better handle on it, the ingredients of a solution have been the same for 20 years, more money for border enforcement and more money for the asylum system to clean up this huge backlog in asylum claims, some path to legal status for the people who were here illegally and then something that deals with the future flow of workers. After this previous decade, 2010 to 2020, was the smallest population growth in American history, except for the depression. The Senate passed that kind of package in 2006 on a bipartisan basis with Mitch McConnell among those voting for, it under George W. Bush. The Senate passed that package again, similar, in 2013, on a bipartisan basis under Barack Obama, with Marco Rubio, among others, voting for it. Each time, the Republican-controlled House would not take it up. And if we are going to find a true solution that more effectively controls the problem, those are the ingredients. It's not like a mystery or that there's a hidden answer. In fact, even when Trump was president, the Senate Democrats offered him a deal to finish his border wall in return for DACA legalization, and it ran aground when Stephen Miller and others in the White House demanded cuts in legal immigration, even amid the slowest population growth in any decade, except for the depression. So, you know, we're going to keep banging against each other, red states against the federal government, Democrats against Republicans, indefinitely until there is sort of an awareness that the only solution is one that is comprehensive.

And so, politically, there is just no real appetite yet to find that sense of common ground. And the people we should say that are hurt most for that are the actual migrants involved with the kind of chaotic ping-ponging, back and forth policy.But we can't -- this is a Republican Congress coming and that can agree on the speaker yet to paper over the divisions within their caucus. With an issue like immigration, which not only has divisions among the Republican caucus but also among the Democratic one, it is a real tough challenge to see a path forward for this politically. I mean, I think back to the Democratic primary years ago in 2020 to even nominate Biden, and it's not as if those candidates were learning out affirmative immigration policies, to the folks on the panel, they have been running from this issue.

So, it's multifaceted issues here and all those things, I think, wind up in the discussion around a possible deal because it's what someone wants or it's the most important thing for some political constituencies, so you wind up tacking it on. But it strikes me that the most important thing you could possibly do is stop the influx today, get a handle on what we have in terms of the backlog and stop adding to it. And that, I think, is the fundamental disagreement between the parties. The Republicans want to put a stop to everybody coming in and being added to the asylum backlog and the Democrats just say, well, just do the paperwork faster.

See, an asylum seeker is someone who has a -- who claims a well founded fear of persecution. So, she presents herself to the Border Patrol. She's not trying to avoid anything. She's not stopping a wall. She's going to the gate. She's going to the border patrol and saying, here I am, take me in.And these are people fleeing murderous communist dictatorships. They're fleeing narco trafficking gangs that have taken over in various areas of Central America, the kind of folks -- I mean, you'd have to shoot me if it was the only way to feed my family, to protect my children for these gangs or these communist dictators. So, fundamentally, we have to have security at the border. By the way, liberals have to say that. Join me, liberals. We have to secure the border.

The legal analysts will tell you that is very important in terms of establishing his state of mind.But there was also a moment in the testimony where Raffensperger gave perhaps the most pointed, concise testimony on how Donald Trump operates. At one point, he said that Trump has basically learned the lesson in life that if you intimidate people, he disparage them, you make up things about them, you get what you want. And there is the quote. And that, in some ways, is the summation of all of these thousands of pages. I would defer with Paul only in one respect. Trump was certainly the driving force behind all of this but he could not have done it alone. There were dozens, really even hundreds of local elected officials and members of Congress who supported him in various ways in trying to overturn the election. The committee chose not to really stress that, like Biden in '20, they chose to present Trump as a unique threat.

But it could be folks that were driving during ace -- on travel ban where, you know, whiteout conditions where maybe somebody was driving.That's why having a travel ban is so critically important and it's so important for people to adhere to it. And County Executive Mark Poloncarz has urged Governor Kathy Hochul to bring in state troopers to do traffic patrol in the city of Buffalo so that we can do snow removal appropriately and quickly because of the life and death happenings that could potentially happen. And I also want to just stress that what we're facing in the city of Buffalo is different from snow removal to just snow plowing. We need to snow, we move, meaning we need equipment where there's one truck driving and then another forklift putting the snow into the truck and then removing it from the street. Because we have old historic dense one-way streets and very dense neighborhoods, and we don't have anywhere to put it. Which leads to, with temperatures rising, a potential of flooding our neighborhoods.",
