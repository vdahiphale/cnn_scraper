Do you pick Nikki Haley? Do you go for the suburbs? Do you try to broaden your coalition? His answer was no.His answer in 2016 was quell a convention uprising, pick Mike Pence, a traditional establishment Christian conservative from the heartland. This time, there's no doubt on that floor who the Republican Party, who the leader of the party is. He's officially the nominee now. He's the leader of their party. He has grassroots enthusiasm and they have made the calculation that he can win by picking -- President Biden just called J.D. Vance a clone. That will be the political argument made. Someone who has -- who didn't begin there, but has come to the Trump agenda and has come to be a Trump loyalist and that by turning out their voters, they can win the election. And it's -- we'll know 16 weeks from tomorrow, if it's the right bet. As someone who studies the map and the demographics, it's not a bad bet. It's not a bad bet. He did it in 2016. And again, you have a very unpopular incumbent president and you have, in many of the states that matter most, third party candidates on the ballot, that if there are people out there who can't vote for Donald Trump, but don't want to vote for Joe Biden, have options they didn't have in 2020. And so it's, there's a bit of a risk to this as there always is. There's also going to be the debate about does it matter? But I can get the path. I can get the path for Donald Trump and I can also get, if you look at the other side of this arena, we're not showing to the viewers right now, there are other networks where you speak to the Trump base. That's where you go to speak to the Trump base. That's how they want to use J.D. Vance.",

The reality is that in this moment, the strength that Trump has with the party enabled him to ignore what was a pretty concerted push behind the scenes against J.D. Vance. I mean, if you look at some of the graphics that were airing on Fox News tied to Rupert Murdoch, they were listing out all of the nasty things that J.D. Vance has ever said about Donald Trump in a very straightforward way.\"The Wall Street Journal,\" \"The New York Post\" issued separate editorials advocating for Doug Burgum. There were donors behind the scenes. Ken Griffin reportedly one of these major Republican donors who were actively trying to get him not to pick J.D. Vance. And what did Trump do? He ignored them. He went with the guy that he had a personal connection with and if, and we're starting to get more reporting about how that connection was built over time because obviously Vance had a lot of work to do to convince Trump that he was really on board with him and he did that. He was one of the first senators out of the gate to endorse Trump when it was clear that Trump was going to run again and that was not lost. This of course after Trump endorsed him for the Senate and somewhat, you know, he noted that at the time Vance had said some, some nasty things about him but that that was like many other people who had done the same thing and he, and he went ahead and supported him. So I think these are all factors. I will also say Vance has in many ways a biography Donald Trump always wished he had. That Ivy League --",

But I've been on the floor for the last several hours talking to Republicans. I was sort of struck by, yes, they all support Donald Trump. There's very little dissent there. There were some questions about what does he bring to the ticket? There were some questions about how they really view, this is the real handoff here in terms of national security and populism. This is not the Republican Party from yesterday. But we, of course, know that. Donald Trump has made that very clear. But J.D. Vance certainly is someone in that vein. But I think going forward, we're already hearing from Ohio Democrats and others, his record is going to be certainly examined on abortion.
