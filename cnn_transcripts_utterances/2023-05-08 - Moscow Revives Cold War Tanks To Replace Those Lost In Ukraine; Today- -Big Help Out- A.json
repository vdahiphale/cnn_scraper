Several regions have announced, particularly the ones closest to Ukraine, that they are either canceling or scaling back parades and things like fireworks displays. Many of them citing security concerns.But on the one hand, we will be seeing Russia try to put out its top military capabilities, and all while we're seeing significant losses of equipment on the ground. We know that sanctions are hurting their ability to produce more quick enough. And we found evidence that this means that Russia is having to dip so far back into its historical stockpiles that it's bringing out 80-year-old tanks onto the battlefield. Take a look.

The details aren't being released, basically, until the time because they are going to be out and about on this volunteering effort. So this is an idea of using this public holiday today there because of the coronation but to emphasize public service. Everyone being encouraged to go out and do something for their local communities. We're going to see the prime minister out and about as well today -- the leader of the opposition. So this is sort of uniquely Prince Charles' kind of effort -- King Charles, rather -- very much King Charles, as you can see from the images. Very much his idea to get people out and about. The other thing we're expecting today, hopefully, is the formal portraits of the coronation, which were taking place at Buckingham Palace, but after the coronation, after this balcony moment -- so those outfits in a portrait setting. And we're waiting to see that probably a bit later on today. So they are the big events today. Hoping to see the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, but also the Prince and Princess of Wales out and about today. So this is the final day, really, of coronation celebrations and then it's down to the hard work, I think, of being monarch, Christine, for the king as he steams ahead.

This sector added back another 31,000 jobs in April trying to climb out of that big COVID hole for those jobs.Looking at markets around the world right now, Asian markets ended the day mixed. The Hang Seng finishing up more than one percent. Investors focusing on Chinese inflation data due out this week. European markets are higher. Markets in London, though, closed today. The Bank of England will make a decision on interest rates later this week. On Wall Street, stock index futures at this hour narrowly mixed here after a pretty volatile week last week. The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 recorded their worst week since March. The Dow finishing more than one percent lower. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq finished slightly higher. On inflation watch, gas prices holding steady overnight at $3.54 a gallon. Another critical week coming up on the economic calendar this week. We've got Consumer and Producer Price Indexes, so important inflation information. Jobless claims and consumer sentiment data.

More than half of U.S. adults say money has a negative impact on their mental health. To break down these numbers let's bring in senior industry analyst at Bankrate.com, Ted Rossman. Good morning, Ted. This survey caught our attention here. What did you find about the correlation between money and mental health? TED ROSSMAN, SENIOR INDUSTRY ANALYST, BANKRATE.COM (via Webex by Cisco):  Unfortunately, it's worsening. Fifty-two percent of us say that our mental health is negatively impacted by money worries, and that's up from 42 percent a year ago. And pretty much every demographic is feeling worse about this. Some that really stood out were women, Gen Xers, and lower earners. But really, across the board, inflation is the problem. That's the number one factor by far that's stressing people out. Connected to that, of course, being able to pay for day-to-day expenses. It does seem like we've taken a notable turn for the worse over the past year, unfortunately.",

A lot of these people are worried every single day so I definitely empathize with that. Maybe get a zero- percent balance transfer card or have money automatically transferred every paycheck into your savings and retirement accounts. I know it may be easier said than done but I do think starting to move in the right direction will help.
