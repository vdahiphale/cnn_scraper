And I want to start with what Peter Baker wrote for \"The New York Times,\" he has, of course, chronicled a number of administrations over the years.He says this, quote: No longer can the political establishment right off former President Trump as a temporary breaking from the long march of progress, a fluke who somehow sneaked into the White House in a quirky, one off Electoral College win eight years ago. With his comeback victory to reclaim the presidency, Mr. Trump has now established himself as a transformational force, reshaping the United States in his own image. And while tens of millions of voters still cast ballots against Mr. Trump, he once again tapped into a sense among many others that the country they knew was slipping away, under siege as economically, culturally, and demographically. Is that what we have seen with these results?",

That is not discount the fact that people know what Trump is. Theyexperienced four years of him in the White House.

So, yes, to some extent, when it comes to the issues that were resonating, be it immigration, be it the economy, certainly the Republicans seem to have the upper hand there, certainly in the polling and certainly in the results. There's also the factor that Trump isn't always consistent on the message. And so that adds another complicating factor to Johnson's argument there.",

But certainly, the window seems to be closing on that opportunity with every passing day, and as more votes are tallied, there are a lot of reliance on California. Can they maybe hold on to any of those seats?But at the end of the day, as you just hinted at were now entering into a presidents presidential term where the Supreme Court is essentially removed some of the guardrails here, Congress is completely different than it was in 2017 in terms of the folks that were skeptical of Trump are no longer in Congress, largely on the Republican side of the aisle. And so you have a lot of Republicans who are going to be folks like Mike Lawler might object to this notion, but are going to be more than willing to fall into line with whatever Trump decides to pursue. And so there will be simply fewer guardrails here in Washington. Part of the way that the constitutional republic that we have operates is that the president kind of self-regulates, to some extent, based on norms. And we know Trump doesn't like to pursue that.

In exchange, the U.S. would continue to pump Ukraine full of weapons to deter a future Russian attack. Under that plan, the front line would essentially lock in place. Both sides would agree to an 800-mile demilitarized zone, who would replace police.

The European leaders and discuss whether or not this is doable. Also, an awareness that Donald Trump wouldn't want to be seen to be losing this war against President Putin, but clearly they have to keep those American funds coming into the -- into Ukraine. Otherwise, you know more of Ukraine will be taken over by Russia. So it's a big debate for them. But I think obviously Donald Trump has all the control here.",

This is equivalent to a category one hurricane for some of these locations in southern California.So, what in the world is Santa Ana winds? Well, we get this high pressure that builds in across the Great Basin. And because of the way that air flows around an area of high pressure, it flows through the canyons and over the ravines of the mountains and then down towards the coast, drying out and warming up as it does so. And the winds accelerate with that down-sloping trend. And of course, this is the area that it's impacted the worst, Santa Ana winds, right over Los Angeles and Ventura County. Now we will continue with the gusty winds today, but there is some relief in the forecast late tonight and certainly into the day on Friday still critical fire danger. Just north of the Los Angeles region, gusts to 50mph. And then with the ongoing fires which you saw on your TV screens just a few moments ago, there's plenty of smoke inundating this area.

If you were an American voter and leaned Republican, it was inflation and the border and related security concerns. If you were -- if you lean Democratic and you were an American voter, it was inflation and abortion rights and reproductive rights, and maybe some of the democracy stuff. But trying to separate the economy message from the reproductive rights message and just focus on that second message left a lot of voters behind. And I know Vice President Harris had a short span for her run sought to tie the economy to the pitch for her at the end and that leaders all around the world, in places like the UK, Japan, Germany, like we know all this already. Everyone, everyone who's an incumbent or seen as an incumbent excuse me, has been impacted by the backlash to inflation and the post-COVID supply chain reality. So she was had an uphill battle against her anyhow. But you see, in all of this exit polling how it wasn't just Latino men who moved away from the Democratic Party, it was a Latino women as well. They may still prefer Democrats by a little bit, but not nearly as much as they have in past election cycles. You had young people, Generation Z, who we have thought of alongside millennials as being extremely progressive, moving towards a former president, now president elect Trump, or just not voting for Vice President Harris. So there obviously were underlying concerns about people just not being sure that Democrats could get the economy back where they wanted it from. A pocket sense but some of these cultural messages also leaving a lot of men feeling left out of the Democratic message.",
