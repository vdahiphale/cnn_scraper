Police say he lives in an apartment building in front of the shooting scene. According to an affidavit of probable cause, Eaton told ATF agents, \"I've been waiting for you.\" Investigators say a pistol found in his apartment matches the shell casings at the scene and that Eaton acquired the gun legally just a few months ago. He was arraigned Monday and pleaded not guilty. Eaton is being held without bail. The families of the victims released a joint statement Monday calling the attack \"A crime fueled by hate\" and saying they welcome \"The investigation and pursuit of hate crimes charges.\" R.

He could do that as soon as next week. Republican leaders are insisting on making that aid contingent on tightening immigration laws. Schumer warning those demands could sink the whole thing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY):  The worst thing we can do is to make something as bipartisan as Ukraine aid conditional on partisan issues that have little chance of becoming law. Sadly, that's what may well be happening right now because the biggest holdup to national -- to the national security supplement is an insistence by some Republicans -- just some -- on partisan border policy as a condition for Ukraine aid.

Engineers are currently trying to restore electricity to the areas.It comes as the city of Kharkiv completed its mandatory evacuation of children. That evacuation began after local officials said there have been increased Russian attacks on civilian targets. Nearly 300 children have left since the November 3 order. It highlights an escalation on the eastern front of the war. Right now, fierce fighting has raged for more than a month. Russian forces have launched a large-scale attack with round-the-clock shelling and waves of armored vehicles in an attempt to encircle certain towns. We are getting a new look at the front lines there from a soldier who recorded his experience in the trenches where he and his team came just feet from Russian tanks. CNN's Anna Coren has the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA COREN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  In the predawn light, a cacophony of military firepower fills the air. Incoming explosions, outgoing fire as one of Ukraine's assault infantry units of the 47th Mechanized Brigade tries to take back trenches in Avdiivka captured by Russian forces. \"We need drones! We need drones!\" says company commander Oleh Sentsov, filming on his GoPro. \"The bastards are sitting in the tree line shooting at us,\" he explains. In a rare interview, the former filmmaker imprisoned by the Russians in 2014 for five years tells me about last month's mission in what has become one of the hottest spots on the eastern front. [07:50:04] OLEH SENTSOV, COMPANY COMMANDER, 47TH MECHANIZED BRIGADE (through translator):  My goal was for people to watch this and know what this war is really like because it's very important to record it so that people know now and know later what a cruel and terrible war it is. COREN (voice-over):  One of his troops has been hit. They remove his body armor to reveal a bullet hole. As they apply a chest tube, the team has even bigger problems. \"Duck! The tank is coming,\" yells one of them. And then the war from the sky begins. \"Drone! Drone! FPV,\" cries a soldier. \"I see it,\" another shouts back. Minutes later, another soldier is hit -- this time, shrapnel to the legs. While talking on the radio reporting on his injured troops, Oleh also gets hit but doesn't realize for a few moments. \"There's a small hole. I see the blood. You're bleeding,\" says the female paramedic. Quickly patched up, Oleh remains focused and composed until suddenly, they hear the rumble of tanks. Oleh's unit tries to bury themselves in the earth as one drives by. The female paramedic cries, \"We are surrounded. The tanks are shooting on us.\" Approximately 40 tons of terror so close the earth is shaking. Drone footage taken by the Ukrainian military shows four Russian tanks firing on the tree line. Positioned in those trees are three Ukrainian assault groups in trenches spread out over a kilometer. Oleh's unit is in the middle. They were the only ones to be spared. SENTSOV (through translator):  We failed to hold our position and had to retreat. We had injuries but survived. But the other two groups were almost completely destroyed. COREN (voice-over):  This is the first time Oleh has failed a mission as commander in the almost two years that he's been fighting. The 47- year-old tells me he wants the world to know the truth on the front line -- a war this father of four is returning to this week. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

ABC News reporting Pence told prosecutors it should never have been placed there. That it was supposed to be an admonishment. CNN's Elie Honig joins us now. Elie, without getting into the comma specifically, what does it tell you that Smith seems to be that granular about their process here? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, FORMER FEDERAL AND NEW JERSEY STATE PROSECUTOR:  Well, Phil, this is what prosecutors do. Let's remember, this trial is going to happen. It is under 100 days away from right now. Mike Pence is going to be a pivotal -- perhaps the pivotal witness for the prosecutors. He has the sort of unique standing here where he's both an eyewitness and a victim. He's a victim in the sense that he was the recipient of Donald Trump's pressure campaign. He was the one who the rioters were chanting for. But he's also a witness to crucial one-on-one conversations, at times, that he had with Donald Trump. And there's no other person on the planet who can give prosecutors the kind of insight that Mike Pence can give them. I think the key reporting here is that Pence directly told Donald Trump he had seen no evidence of election fraud -- add Mike Pence to that long list -- and that he did not believe he had the constitutional authority to throw out the votes.",
