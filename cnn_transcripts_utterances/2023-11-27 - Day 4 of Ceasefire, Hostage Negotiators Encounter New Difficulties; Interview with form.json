      "sentences": "I think the challenges continue to be very difficult. The one glimmer of hope is, I think, That the original and early fears back immediately after the events of October 7, that this would lead to a regional conflagration that would not just involve Israel and Gaza, but would bring in Hezbollah from the north and perhaps even Iran directly. I think fears of that kind of escalation have died down a little bit.But now there is the concern which has been there really from day one, and that's when Biden has been expressing that privately in all kinds of ways. And increasingly, publicly, that the strategy that Israel has embarked upon is not going to be able to succeed in eliminating the threat of Hamas without causing incredible and untold damage to the people in Gaza. And that ultimately the strategy doesn't have a good sense of what comes after. And so, the president, while supporting Israel, something he feels in this core, also given the events of October 7, inevitable for any American and any American president to support them, has used that support to try to convince Netanyahu to find new ways to alter his strategy, and he's been successful to some extent. He -- Israel did not attack Hezbollah, which some people wanted. Israel delayed the ground invasion. It didn't have as many troops in the ground invasion as possible. And of course, now we see humanitarian aid coming in, which Israel prevented and hostages coming out. That is all due to President Biden using his private diplomacy to try to get the Israeli government to move in a direction that is more successful than it was initially engaged on.",

Because the future of this aid, these -- now these two that they would like to be linked is really coming to a head this week and next as the Senate majority leaders promise that they're going -- he's going to hold a vote on the Senate floor over this emergency aid funding that's really been caught in limbo now for weeks over interparty and intraparty kind of disagreements over how much aid, any aid, conditions on aid that is needed.From your unique perspective, where are you on this?",

You can see people here from the campus community gathering here right in front of the statue, and that is where the wreath laying ceremony will take place with members of her family, as well as folks from the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers that has been on this campus for several decades. That was an issued caregiving near and dear to the former first lady's heart.You can feel her presence all across this campus. Earlier this morning, I spoke with the president of the university and he was telling me that she was so important for this campus community for the students here to see from this region that just because you are from a small town, maybe a town like Plains with a few hundred people, it isn't an impediment to your success that you can go on to have global impact. So, we are waiting now about 11:00 for the family to come on the motorcade, ad that is when the wreath laying ceremony will take place. And then her body will move to Atlanta where she will lie in repose, and then members of the public tonight will have the opportunity in Atlanta to pay their respects. John.",

In the course of looking for witnesses who heard what, who saw what, they encounter this individual, Mr. Eaton. And, I can't tell you what happened between them, but something in that encounter made them want to focus on him more directly. At that point, they were able to get a search warrant for his house. And at that point, they recover a shotgun, we are told by law enforcement sources, and a 380 Ruger pistol. A semiautomatic 380 matches the caliber used in the shooting. Right now, the ATF Ballistic Lab is looking at the projectiles they recovered from the victims in the scene. The shell casings they recovered on the ground, and attempting to make the determination whether that gun scientifically matches it. So, that's where we are on the suspect.",
