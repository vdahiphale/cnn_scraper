She's a former press communications director for Donald Trump's 2020 campaign and a Republican strategist for Axiom Strategies. We're also joined by Tim Hogan. He is a Democratic strategist and former spokesperson for Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. I wonder, Erin, you're hearing what Trump is saying here. What questions, concerns is this raising for you? ERIN PERRINE, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST &amp; FORMER PRESS COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2020 CAMPAIGN: I think ultimately everybody needs to remember that crazy doesn't know a political party or ideology. There is extreme rhetoric on both sides of the political spectrum. And everybody needs to accept a little bit of culpability and responsibility for what becomes inflamed rhetoric in this country. But to be clear, this isn't a Republican or Democrat issue. This is an American issue. And we should be treating it like that. For President Trump right now, I think his best course of action would be to be a bit more like he was -- this is really hard to believe I'm saying -- after his first assassination attempt where he was much more unifying. If people want to try and make this political, let other people do that. Be the leader that the country needs at a time where this rhetoric has led to two attempts to kill Donald Trump. Everybody needs to take cooler heads. The world will not end, this country will not end and cease to exist as a democracy if Kamala Harris wins or if Donald Trump wins.",

      "sentences": "Tim to you. President Biden addressed this at an event in Philadelphia earlier today. He talked about there being no place for political violence in America, saying, \"We resolve our differences peacefully at the ballot box, not at the end of a gun.\"He also said earlier today that Congress needs to act in order to provide the Secret Service with more recent sources. I'm wondering what you think about what you heard from President Biden, and specifically that call on Congress. TIM HOGAN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST &amp; FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR HILLARY CLINTON 2016 CAMPAIGN: Yes. I think that that is the type of leadership that we need in this moment for cooler heads to prevail. Look, we're in a heated election. The stakes are high, whether you care about health care or abortion rights or the economy. But the point is we resolve our issues and the call to action to set a vision and a course for the country is always at the ballot box. Both Vice President Harris and President Biden have said they're deeply disturbed by the attack, but that they want to make sure the Secret Service resources are there to make sure that nothing think like this happens again. And look, to Erins point, look, Navigator Research last week released a poll about political violence in this country. And 84 percent of Americans are worried about political violence. That's Republicans, Independents, Democrats. They were worried about it today. And 87 percent say they worry about it in the future. So this is in the background of this conversation of this election cycle the entire time. And we just need to have cooler heads prevail. You should be able to say and condemn what happened to Donald Trump. You should be able to say and condemn what happened to Paul Pelosi. This should not be a political issue.",

I mean, look, we had -- we had some explosive hearings with the former head of the Secret Service after the first assassination attempt.And to Erin's point, again, it's kind of shaking your head to say we're doing this a second time. All, the resources need to be there. This is a bipartisan issue. It's why we have a bipartisan committee that is heading up and making sure that this doesn't happen again. It is heartening to hear from President Biden and from Vice President Harris that, look, whatever resources are needed, whatever resources are necessary. As we learn more about this attack, about this person, about how he gained access, about how he was 300 to 500 yards from the former president, what needs to be done to make sure that that area, wherever he is, where his family is, is fortified and safe. Again, it's a bipartisan issue. It has to be approached that way. And I hope this committee moves quickly.",

      "sentences": "Well, a vacuum of knowledge is what leads to conspiracy theories. When people feel that they're not getting the accurate information.Again, I -- it catches me each time I say this. After the first assassination attempt on Donald Trump's life, the head of the Secret Service at the time wasn't putting out information. That is a bad strategy in a crisis moment, especially when people really have a sense of fear and urgency. And that polling really shows that. To Tim's point here, that over 80 percent of Americans are worried about this violence. We need to be shining the daylight on what has happened in these incidents. Because that is how you stop crazy conspiracy theories about what could have happened to him. And to the question before to Tim about getting this done and with urgency, an emergency supplemental can easily be done in Congress. They can allocate more resources to the United States Secret Service so they can train more agents, they can get more people on the job, they can fortify a bit more. But a lot of this needs to come through the full process. But people have a problem right now with Alejandro Mayorkas and being able to trust him with all of this chaos. So there needs to be definitive, clear leadership in order to get an emergency supplemental done. The speaker could lead on this. Chuck Schumer can lead on this. This could be a really good bipartisan moment for the country.",

But, like, there is nothing more fundamental than an issue like this that goes at the core of our democracy. Look, we have two very different competing visions about what thiscountry is going to look like and what policy we are going to have in place, who you trust to lead. But at the end of the day, we have to make that decision as Americans at the ballot box. And that means that the security of the candidates, the security of the candidates' families is at the very top of the list of things for Congress to do right now. So I think we've seen the president come out and say, and the vice president come out and say, whatever the resources are that are necessary to get this done, to make sure that there is security surrounding everyone who is on the ballot in this race, it has to get done. And I think if there's any hope for some sort of bipartisan action in Congress and to do it with some sense of urgency, it's an issue like this.",
