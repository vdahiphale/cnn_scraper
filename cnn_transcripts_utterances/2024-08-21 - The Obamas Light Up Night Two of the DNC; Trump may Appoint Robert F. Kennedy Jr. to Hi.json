Well, if the Democrats needed any more enthusiasm around the presidential campaign of Kamala Harris, they got it in abundance from Barack and Michelle Obama, who delivered rousing endorsements on the second night of the party's convention in Chicago. The former president took aim at Republican Donald Trump and what he called his weird obsession with crowd sizes, but he spent most of his 35-minute speech explaining why he thinks Kamala Harris is the president the country needs.Former first lady Michelle Obama energized the crowd with her line of the night, Hope is making a comeback. She accused Trump of doubling down on racist lies while Harris is working to make people's lives better. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MICHELLE OBAMA (D), FORMER U.S. FIRST LADY: Her story is your story, it's my story.  It's the story of the vast majority of Americans trying to build a better life. Look, Kamala knows, like we do, that regardless of where you come from, what you look like, who you love, how you worship, or what's in your bank account, we all deserve the opportunity to build a decent life. All of our contributions deserve to be accepted and valued. (APPLAUSE) M. OBAMA: Because no one has a monopoly on what it means to be an American. No one. (APPLAUSE) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But even more striking to me was the way that this night of the convention dealt with the potential threats of a second Trump term in a very different way, I think, than Joe Biden had been doing. Because tonight was less about preventing the darkness that could come from a vindictive Donald Trump in the White House again, than it was about encouraging voters to envision the morning which we heard specifically, almost like a morning in America, of a less divided America. It reminded me that a Democratic consultant said to me last week that the last voters Harris needs, she has to inspire, not scare. And I thought tonight was a striking pivot in that direction.",

The initial reaction has been positive but people don't really know a lot about her and that creates obviously a risk that Republicans could fill that in, but it creates the opportunity that more people would tune into the convention precisely because they want to learn something about her. And the Democrats would have more opportunity that is usually the case at a convention to define their nominee because so little space on the canvas has been written on yet. And so it'll be interesting to see. I would not be surprised if the audience for her acceptance speech is higher than -- than Trump's and don't forget half of all the people who watch Trump's acceptance speech watched it on Fox. And that was an indication I thought in early indication of what ultimately occurred which is he did not get much of a bounce out of his convention he did not really speak to people beyond those already in his camp she clearly has an opportunity to do that Barack Obama was kind of summoning her precisely to do that and we'll see if you can deliver on it on Thursday night.",

This comes as more than 40 people were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza in the past 24 hours as mediators push for a ceasefire and hostage release deal.In Gaza City, an Israeli strike on a school sheltering displaced Palestinians killed eight people. The IDF says it conducted, quote, \"precise strikes\" on a Hamas command center hidden in the school. Meanwhile, Israel released video of its operation to recover the bodies of six hostages. It says soldiers found them in Hamas tunnels under Khan Younis. The Israeli military is investigating what caused their deaths. Gaza ceasefire talks are expected to resume this week amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts to end the war. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with top officials in Egypt and Qatar to get the latest on what they're hearing from Hamas. Blinken says Israel has agreed to a bridging proposal meant to close the remaining gaps in a potential Gaza ceasefire agreement. And this comes despite reported comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that cast doubt on a potential deal. So let's go live now to London and CNN's Salma Abdelaziz.

And for more let's go to CNN's Fred Pleitgen who joins us live from Tehran. So Fred, what is the latest from Iran's leadership as Israel braces for a retaliatory response to the killing of a Hamas leader in Tehran? FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Rosemary, first of all, a lot of really interesting new nuances coming out, not just from the U.N. mission of Iran, but of course last night also from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who also said that there could be a prolonged period of waiting before a retaliatory strike by the Iranians happens. And all this, of course, also coming at a pretty key time here in Iran. In fact, I'm right now inside Iranian parliament, inside the modulus with a confirmation hearings for Iran's new cabinet. Of course, they just voted for a new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, and those ministers are set to be confirmed today. The debate about that is going on right now. That's what you're seeing in the background. But right now for the Iranians, they're saying that there could be a prolonged period of waiting before retaliatory strike takes place. They're also saying that they will not give any information as to what exactly that strike could look like. One of the things though that we've heard is that the Iranians do want to create deterrence through a strike that they plan on. I was able to speak to the former head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and here's what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MOHSEN REZAEE, FORMER COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS (through translator): The occupying power of Jerusalem is a regime that will continue its evil acts if it does not receive a harsh response.

Therefore they will avoid taking action against Iran. On the other hand, the U.S. is facing problems regarding their own defense coasts. There has to be a ceasefire in Gaza soon. The United States and Israel should not repeat their mistakes. If in the first weeks of the Gaza war the United States has stopped Israel and Netanyahu, the war would not extend. So the main element of the extension of the war are the US and Israel. The more this war extends, the more the United States will be damaged. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think one of the interesting things that we took from that statement coming from Iran's U.N. mission now overnight is that they also say that any sort of retaliatory action that they might take. They don't want that to have adverse effects on possible ceasefire negotiations and on the ceasefire being implemented.One of the other things that we also took from that as well is they said that a strike could look unlike anything that you've seen in the past before.
