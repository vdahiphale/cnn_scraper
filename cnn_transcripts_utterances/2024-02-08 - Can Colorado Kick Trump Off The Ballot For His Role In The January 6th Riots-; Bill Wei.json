This is obviously an issue that does deserve a hearing in the Supreme Court. And I think what needs to be separated is the politics of this, some of which are partisan. The, the practicality of what's being done by Colorado, and then the intent of the language that's written in the U.S. Constitution. (INAUDIBLE) 14th Amendment, Section 3. All those things are intention, frankly. I think from a practical standpoint, especially the question of whether one state can block a president a person from appearing on the ballot, that gets very dicey, because you have your 50 different standards, potentially 50 different states. So, this needs to be federalized. And that's why it's in the U.S. Constitution. Politically, we'll see how it breaks down. Clearly, Chief Justice Roberts would like to have some degree of bipartisanship. I would suggest that we're having studied this intensely, partly as a result of my book on Lincoln And The Post-Civil War Period, that the language in the Constitution is clear, its implementation is vague, and we only have that precedent. But to argue that this was not supposed to be prospective, it was only supposed to be retrospective to the Civil War does not fit the clear intent and statements around the ratification debate about this amendment.",

He did not march on the Capitol on January sixthwith the violent mob of his supporters. But the language as you point out in the 14th Amendment, Section 3 says, give aid or comfort to insurrection or rebellion, aid or comfort to. Now the criminal statute for sedition includes incitement of an insurrection, which was actually part of the language of his second impeachment, which passed majorities in both the House and the Senate, though he was not convicted in the Senate. But I find particularly troubling and slightly absurd the argument that this does not apply, overthrowing the government of the United States by violence. OK. So, a violent mob was deployed to the Capitol with some degree of coordination among his supporters and various groups designed to not just obstruct an official proceeding, but to stop the official certification of the balance after an election. An overthrow of the government is not simply an a, an organized army, marching on the White House. Overthrowing our system of government involves stopping the processing of a fair and free election, according to constitutional processes. And it's very clear that that's what Donald Trump and his aides engaged in. They tried to overthrow an election in our democracy that contradicts and cuts to the horror of our core of our constitutional republic.

And of course, youknow, the scientists turned out to be spot on correct and what they warned about years ago. And so, we should pay more attention to the warnings they're issuing now. If we do not sharply reduce the burning of fossil fuel, the climate crisis is really a fossil fuel crisis. So that's 80 percent of it. And we have this mandate now to transition away from fossil fuels. If we do not do that quickly, what the scientists are telling us is that things are going to get a lot worse and cause great havoc. But there's great hope. And you have to balance the warnings with the fact that there is really good news. As Bill says people are working on it. But here's some good news from the scientists as well. Once we reach true net zero, and stop adding to the overburden of this heat trapping pollution that we're spewing into the sky every day, then the temperatures will stop going up almost immediately, with a lag of as little as three to five years. And if we stay at true net zero, then half of all the human caused greenhouse gas pollution will come out of the atmosphere in as little as 25 to 30 years. And the long slow healing process can begin. The challenge, of course, is to stop using fossil fuels as quickly as possible. But there again, there's really good news with the solar and wind and batteries and electric vehicles and green hydrogen is coming on. Now we're online and regenerative agriculture, which is one of the real keys and sustainable forestry and circular manufacturing, the list is a long one.

But -- and we're running some unacceptably high risks with large global systems that are important for the flourishing of humanity that are now being destabilized. So, the sooner the better. The issue you're referring to is over how sensitive the climate is to more and more greenhouse gas pollution. And ultimately, they agree on far more than they disagree. They're all saying the same thing. We got to switch away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible and stop using the sky as an open sewer. That's the basic problem. We're putting 162 million tons up there every day, and the accumulated amount, it stays on average each molecule for about 100 years. And the accumulated amount today, Christiane is trapping as much extra heat, as would be released by 750,000 Hiroshima class Oppenheimer era, atomic bombs exploding on the Earth every single day. That's insane for us to allow that to continue, particularly when we have the alternatives available now that are cheaper, cleaner, create three times as many jobs per dollar invested. All we have to do really is to overcome the political power and influence of the fossil fuel companies which have, you know, been trying to persuade people that this is not such a big deal, and they're trying to extend their business plan and the petro states put up a lot of resistance in the international negotiations. We are getting there. And we will solve this people should be of good, good hope on this. But the question is, will we solve it in time, we have to speed up this process.

But it is really important actually, to dig these snow pits. Because the deeper you go, the further back in time you can -- you can be. And what we saw was a series of ice lenses. And as beautiful as they are, they're not a good sign. These ice lenses tell us that there were moments during the past few months on this ice cap that is at the periphery of the Greenland ice sheets, moments with melts with rain. And this was highly unexpected, actually, for this part of Greenland that is supposed to be quite cold at this high altitude.",

I mean, we were constantly talking about risk, we're constantly talking about how to mitigate risk and manage and like whether or not we feel comfortable, whether or not we feel safe. So, you certainly see glimpses of it in the film. But the reality is, we were talking about it all the time, because we all want to come home safely. But one of the things that isn't shown in the film is that, you know, after that conversation, Mike, he decided that he didn't want to participate in the climb on the face. But instead, what he did was guide the camera crew up the backside of the mountain so that they could film it, because he is basically a professional mountain guide, and a filmmaker himself. And so, part of what isn't said in that whole exchange, is that he was deciding to use his unique set of skills in a different way to help the team in a way that he felt was safer, but still incredibly useful.",

But I really wanted to be there to see it happening. And luckily, you know, they trusted me, they thought that by giving me the right training, I would be able to do it.

But as she was just alluding to the science, I found that consistently throughout the expedition, it was harder to do the scientific experience, it was harder to collect data than I may be expected. Because a lot of the things, a lot of the protocols are just like, oh, drill a sample into the rock. But then it turns out, it's really hard. And it's hard to line up the trail properly, it's hard to manage the batteries. Like everything was more challenging than we expected. And so, I think it was actually incredibly helpful to have Heidi overseeing everything. Like there's no chance that we could have done any of the science without Heidi on the team, because it just turned out that it was all too difficult for us.",

Because I mean, it really that's the challenge of doing a first ascent because nobody's been there. So, you don't really know which way to go. And we definitely both felt very uncomfortable the whole time. You know, like there was a lot of tension around how to -- how to weave our way off the wall.
