Good morning everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's wonderful to have you with us. A brutal Winter storm impacting much of the country this morning. More than 55 million people under Winter weather alerts from the central U.S. to the east coast. More than 1,200 flights already canceled this morning, including hundreds of flights in and out of Washington D.C. as this region prepares for up to 16 inches of snow possible in some parts. Our city's mayor already declaring a snow emergency. Federal offices in D.C. are closed because of the snow. The closures not set to impact Congress, which is getting ready to certify the 2024 election results later today.

I think that how it happens will take a while and Speaker Johnson has acknowledged that it may take until April or May to get all of this done.But he's got to write the bill first, and there's going to be a lot of negotiations. And he has acknowledged that he wants everybody to be heard and to be seen in some of that process, and then they'll have to go to the Senate where, you know, there's going to be a majority for that to pass. But even there, because, you know, there's just less room for people with objections to really make themselves feel heard.

Starmer leads the more liberal Labor Party in the British government, of course.Musk has posted more than 50 times since the new year, calling for Starmer's removal from office, even arguing that he should be put in prison. Musk is alleging that Starmer failed to prosecute child sex abuse cases in the country. Musk has also been apparently alienating right-wing allies over his calls to free a far-right activist in Britain. It's putting reform U.K. party leader and Trump ally Nigel Farage at odds with Musk. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIGEL FARAGE, REFORM U.K. PARTY LEADER:  The fact that he supports me politically and supports reform doesn't mean I have to agree with every single statement he makes on X. And I think you're getting bogged down in this. You know -- you know, I will at the inauguration have a conversation with him on a variety of things, this will no doubt be one of them.

You know, they were meeting up, and there was all this talk that Musk was about to throw millions of dollars at Farage's Reform Party.So, it appeared to be going that way. I mean, Westminster was full of, you know, reports of this money coming towards Reform, which would give it huge power in the U.K. election in a few years time, and everyone's talking about Farage becoming the next Prime Minister. That was linked to the fact that Musk was throwing his support behind Farage. But suddenly, you know, in one tweet, Musk has thrown that all out. I don't know what he's trying to achieve from this, because obviously, Farage was a big supporter of Musk as well. He continues to be.

This is part of the ice storm in this very dynamic Winter storm that's unfolding across the country right now.

The radar lighting up like a Christmas tree, even though we're past the holidays now, rain to the south in Atlanta, but snow stretching from St. Louis all the way to the nation's capital, temperatures are below freezing, so, we will support snowfall in and around D.C., and it's going to get messy if you haven't noticed that already. The i-70 and Interstate-95 is going to be hit hard with several inches of snow up to 6 to locally-higher amounts possible within the area.
