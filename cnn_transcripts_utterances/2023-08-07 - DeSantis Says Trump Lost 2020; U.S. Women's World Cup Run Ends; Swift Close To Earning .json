Then on Wednesday he heads to the state of New Mexico, where he will focus on the manufacturing portion of the Inflation Reduction Act, clean energy manufacturing in particular, but I think you can also expect to hear about the Chips and Science Act, which invests in semiconductor manufacturing.And then, of course, on Thursday, the president heads to the state of Utah to talk about that Pact Act which provides veterans benefits to those affected by burn pits and other toxic chemicals. But the through line in all of this is going to be the impact on the economy and the uphill battle that the White House faces as it tries to convince Americans that the economy is indeed doing better and that it is because of those various policies that we were just talking about. Look at this number, though, on economic approval. The president is under water still despite the slowing inflation, despite the fact that unemployment remains at a 3.5 percent low. Sixty-three percent of Americans still disapproving of the president's handling of the economy. A majority, a slim majority of Americans, still believe that the economy is in a downturn. So, this is the challenge that the president faces and why you're going to be hearing him talk about those legislative accomplishments, try and tie it to this improving economy. Now, one silver lining that White House officials do see, the Michigan consumer sentiment, which shows consumer confidence in the economy. That number in July was the highest it has been in two years. So, the White House believes that as Americans feel more confident about their personal finances, they'll feel better about the overall economy and better about the president's handling of that economy.

You know, losing by now 30 points in the - in the national polling and still a substantial deficit in Iowa where he's putting a lot of chips. Inevitably, and inexorably, he's moving toward more criticism of Donald Trump across multiple fronts. But it is always, at least so far, been nuanced and qualified and offset by other comments, like him saying that the indictment last week was, of course, politically motivated and not criticizing Trump's underlying behavior.I think there's only one direction that this can go. I mean he has to provide Republican voters a stronger, more compelling reason to move past Donald Trump than he or anyone else has so far. What we saw in 2016 and what we're seeing again in 2024 is that hoping that Trump somehow collapses of his own weight, that some external event knocks him from the race and you're there to pick up the pieces with his base, if you don't offend them, that simply doesn't work. So, I think we know where this is going, but he's still kind of hemming and hawing as he gets there.",

You know, it may be true in the end and there are yellow warning lights on the dashboard for Republicans in terms of public reaction to the indictments beyond the Republican coalition of what it would actually mean to have a nominee who was facing multiple criminal trials, but DeSantis has chosen to run at Trump, as we talked about before, almost entirely from the right, trying to pass him on the six inches of shoulder to his right that he is leaving in the Republican race.And that does raise questions about whether he would be any more successful at Trump at bringing back in particular those white collar suburban voters who have moved away from the party in the Trump era, even in the Republican primary itself. I mean this is a -- kind of a fraught decision for DeSantis because he is not consolidating the more moderate voters, the college educated voters, who have always been the most skeptical of Trump. He's trying to peel away a significant portion of Trump's base. Maybe that is the only way to beat him, but if you leave a lot of those moderate voters, even the primary on the table, it's going to be hard to make the math add up.",
