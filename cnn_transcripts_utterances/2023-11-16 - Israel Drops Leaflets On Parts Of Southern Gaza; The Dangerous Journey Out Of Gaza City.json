President Biden says he still believes Xi Jinping is a dictator. The comments could cause friction as leaders gather for the APEC Summit in San Francisco. And a new survey shows climate anxiety is global, 93% of us believe it poses a serious or imminent threat to the planet. Live from New York, it's Thursday, November 16th. I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Once again, the Israeli Defense Forces are warning people in parts of southern Gaza to leave their homes and head to, quote, \"known shelters.\" These leaflets were dropped over four communities east of Khan Younis. They say everyone who, quote, \"finds themselves near terrorists\" or in buildings used by terrorists is exposed to danger. In northern Gaza, the IDF also says troops found the body of an Israeli hostage near the Al-Shifa Hospital. Yehudit Weiss is a 65-year-old grandmother who was kidnapped on October 7th. Nic Robertson joins us now. Nic, that news, of course, devastating for the family. I believe her husband also died in the events of that attack on October the 7th. But also crucial in light of breaking news in the last 15 minutes or so, the Israeli is saying they found an operational tunnel shaft inside the Al-Shifa Hospital, and they'll provide evidence of it. What more can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yes, they have found what they say is a tunnel shaft. It appears to be very close to theperimeter of the hospital complex, but really clearly, you can see the hospital buildings from the hole in the ground. And what the IDF have been saying through the latter part of this day is that it's going to take them a few days, or even weeks, to properly go through the whole extensive complex of the hospital. They say it's a precise search that they're doing. They're going through all the different floors of the building, looking for other indications of Hamas' presence, the sort of command-and-control node that they've talked about. But, of course, it's the bunkers underneath the hospital that they have talked about in advanced of arriving at the hospital. And they -- the evidence that they presented today, we're not there to independently verify, but we can see from the images this apparent tunnel shaft is within the complex at the hospital itself. This is, it appears, their intent to show the indication that they have begun to find some of what they believe to be at the hospital. The elderly lady, Yehudit Weiss, 65 years old, as you said, was found in a house near the hospital. This is what the IDF are saying, found by their troops. They say near her body were weapons belonging to the terrorists. We don't have details about how she died, and we don't have details about their condition of the building she was in. Of course, many relatives of hostages have been concerned that as Israel has targeted Hamas, Hamas has been using the hostages as, if you will, human shields, that their loved ones would get caught up and killed. She was from a community, a kibbutz called Be'eri, which is quite close to the border with Gaza. And it had perhaps the highest death toll of any single kibbutz. I think more than 100 people were killed there when Hamas arrived. But many also, like her, were taken hostage. The IDF now saying, yes, unfortunately she is confirmed dead.",

Theyinitially indicated people in the north to move south of this dividing line, if you will, this Wadi across the middle -- a dry river across the middle of Gaza. And the IDF now has control of that area and has divided Gaza into a north and the south. And a vast number of civilians living in the north have escaped to the south. So you almost now have a double density population in the south. And that raises, in and of itself, so many concerns, given the high civilian death toll when the IDF has been going after Hamas in the north with double the population, in essence, in the south. That puts double the number of civilians potentially at risk of what the IDF is doing here is what they've done in the north, which is drop these leaflets, which tells people to move to known safe areas. It's not clear precisely what the IDF is indicating here, but they have talked about a humanitarian zone in the southwest of the Gaza Strip, an area close to the Mediterranean Sea. It's not clear what this zone is, who polices it, who makes it safe for the people who arrived there, what accommodations or anything they have. The best indication we have so far is no NGOs have been establishing camps and bases there. The NGOs and the UN say they're running out of fuel to do anything in Gaza, never mind establish huge displacement camps. So who's going to manage them? How will people be made safe? The weather is deteriorating. The UN agencies are concerned about the outbreak of diseases in the communities. But if -- as the -- if -- as it appears that the IDF will continue their operations into the south, disease, possible human casualties, all of those will be concerns in an environment, again, with a double density population and now, with a deficit of hospitals because the vast majority of hospitals in Gaza are out of action.",

It's interestingPresident Biden wrapping up that speech that you just played a little bit about -- just a short time ago, and he was at a building just across the street here. He's now made his way to another series of events in the building we're in. And it shows you just how important, to your point, all these regional partners are. I mean, because I think when people think about this big Xi-Biden summit, they forget it is on the sidelines of what was already planned, and that is APEC where you have 21 economies from the Asia-Pacific, here, very much looking at the two superpowers, where China and the US stand right now and how that might impact them. And we know that obviously from a political perspective, the US is trying to catch up in many ways with where China has been focused, and that is trying to win over some of their partners or within the region, some of the other Southeast Asian countries there as well, and so the US, interestingly enough, taking that focus here to APEC. And, in fact, even when you think about the Xi-Biden meeting yesterday, what followed that meeting? Two different dinners. President Xi was at a dinner that was focused on business leaders -- American business leaders at that. You had Apple's Tim Cook. You had Elon Musk there. And so it was very much trying to win back, if not to encourage businesses that are already in China to expand. And that speaks to their need -- China's need in particular. It's an economic one. It's to boost what is a very much struggling economy, the housing marketing crisis, youth unemployment at record highs. So where was President Biden while President Xi was at his dinner? He was at another one. In that audience, mostly diplomats and political leaders from APEC, from the countries that are here represented and are trying to figure out how the US can play a role in strengthening its, really, bolstering of economies within the Asia-Pacific. So it's just interesting to compare the two, Julia, when you look at where they focus their time after that big summit yesterday.",

As I was mentioning there with David, low expectations perhaps met in this meeting, but a couple of clear points wanting to perhaps change the narrative around or the perception of concerns around China's relationship with Taiwan, and then the breakdown in communications between China and the United States over their military, particularly when they're operating in close quarters in Asia-Pacific.

TheBiden administration -- President Biden met very low expectations for a relationship that is really in a period of decline. The two leaders are trying to manage that decline because they both have incentives to do so. But the strategic differences between them remain. And I think that's the first key point. The second point is there were some tactical areas of convergence, and I think that reflects the fact that both of them thought things got a little out of hand in 2022 on Taiwan. They don't want to end up in a conflict through carelessness or miscommunication. And so I think you see in the three or four key outcomes of this meeting, a reflection of that tactical convergence. So I think we can talk a bit about the specifics, but I would point to three. One is a very consequential resumption of military-to-military channels that have been suspended for over a year. Two, I would say that the deal that is emerging on the fentanyl and on the fentanyl precursor chemicals that, primarily, come from China could be very consequential. And third, I think this agreement to discuss the issue of artificial intelligence and keeping it out of the weapons control chains is potentially consequential because, ultimately, the US and China are the only two countries that really face that challenge today.",

I mean, so long as the reliance is on state industrial policy and related measures that aim ultimately to dominate advanced technology and have a mercantilist flavor, it's going to be a very hard and unstable economic relationship.

Peter Valdes-Dapena has more on this bold move by Toyota. And it is a bold move. It tells you something about the acceptance level for American consumers it seems of an electric vehicle battery and combustion engine. Perhaps it's about having your cake and eat it. You have both options. PETER VALDES-DAPENA, CNN BUSINESS SENIOR AUTO WRITER:  Exactly, that's what, these are not plug in hybrids, these are going to be regular hybrids that you drive and their cars that have their own motor. But Toyota is the biggest seller in the EVs of hybrids rather by far. The company said they want to make all of the vehicles in their lineup at least have a hybrid option. In this case they're going to go fully hybrid only on this, not the first model for Toyota but this is the most popular car in the U.S. So car model, not a truck or SUV. You have to figure, though customers that are buying a sedan, instead of a truck or, SUV, what are the priorities? Well, probably fuel economy is a priority. I think that's what Toyota is thinking here. And so this is a great place they figure to drop in a hybrid system and make it the only option.",

Again, this points to that bridge needing to be longer, perhaps, and, bigger -- the bridge I mean, sort of playing both sides to some degree. VALDES-DAPENA:  Right. And Toyota has always said, for a very long, time Toyota has made this point, hey, wouldn't it be better instead of selling fully electric vehicles, with zero emissions to a relatively smaller number of people, what if we sold more hybrids, took those batteries and put them in hybrid vehicles that everyone can afford, everyone can, buy nobody has to worry about charging and bring down the total global carbon emissions that way by sort of putting less batteries in more vehicles, rather than putting them all into a few fully electric vehicles for a small number of buyers.",
