But I do think it's worth asking the question, who benefits from this happening? Who benefits from these leaks getting out there? And I think that the first country that comes to mind, obviously, is Russia on that one. Russia does benefit by driving wedges between America and its allies. It does benefit when it says things like, well, you know, that the Ukrainian Armed Forces have lost a lot more than apparent, or that has been made public, and that the Russians have lost a lot less. So, when you look at it, the Russians certainly have a lot to be gained from being involved in this, at least from the start, or perhaps later on just jumping on and trying to take as much advantage as they can from the situation.",

That, of course, has to be investigated very, very carefully. And that gets to one of the earlier questions that you asked, which is, OK, how. If it wasn't the Russians who produced this themselves, or somehow, you know, got access to this information, then how did this information get out? And that is what I think the Department of Justice, the Pentagon, and a lot of counterintelligence folks are trying to figure out exactly what happened. I'm sure that behind the scenes, even though there may have been no formal briefing with the Five Eyes, you can be sure that our liaison, our intelligence liaison relationships with those people is robust enough to have offline discussions about what's going on.

And then there was the Edward Snowden NSA leaks back in 2013. Before that the WikiLeaks released the Iraq War logs that was back in 2010. They're just the major ones.

This clash took place near the abandoned Israeli outposts where Israel's national security minister led a call for Israel to legalize the outpost. More settlements on land Palestinians claim for a future homeland is seen by these ministers as a way of preventing terrorist attacks inside Israel. Meantime, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke about tensions between Israel and its neighbors, which fled after Israeli police raided the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem last week, the third most holy site in all of Islam.

Crisis started when Israeli security forces raided the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem twice last week, arresting hundreds of people. Israel answered a barrage of rockets fired from Lebanon and Gaza with airstrikes. And even this weekend, things didn't stop. Israeli war planes and drones bombed positions in Syria after several rockets were fired from there towards the Israeli occupied Golan Heights.

Because quite often, when these marches take place to these evacuated outposts, the settlers who go there, they tend to stay, and they tend not to leave not without a struggle, not without a fight. So, what's the situation now?ELLIOTT GOTKINE, JOURNALIST (on camera): Well, John, I mean, the settlers that you saw marching there, and supporters of Evyatar being legalized will still maintain their position. For now, the big Israeli Government position is that it is an illegal outpost, and that it is not there for a settlement that it is going to support. Now, of course, that could change when you see senior government ministers like National Security Minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir marching there, along with several other ministers as well. But for now, the situation remains that it is not an official settlement, although, as I say, that could change. And of course, the other big thing that we were watching yesterday, John was this press conference from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Now it's quite rare for him to give a press conference of this nature, not unprecedented, but quite rare. And I suppose what he was trying to say, following the deteriorating security situation, not just visa vie the West Bank, not just because of clashes we've seen between Israeli security forces and the worshipers, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and not just because of the rockets fired from the Gaza strip into Israel from the Hamas controlled entity, and also that barrage of rockets from Lebanon, the biggest barrage from Lebanon into Israel since the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. But really just to show that his hands are still on the wheel, that Netanyahu is still in control, that he is going in his words, to reestablish deterrence and fix the damage we inherited. He blamed the previous government that was in power for one year for the current situation in terms of Israel's security. And he was also I suppose, really trying to respond to this. His plummeting poll numbers, opinion poll published by channel 13, showing that not only is Netanyahu no longer Israeli's first choice of Prime Minister, he's not even the second, he would be the third choice, and that if an election were to be held tomorrow, he and his right wing allies would be out of office. The other big news of course, which you mentioned in your introduction, was the sacking of his Defense Minister Yoav Gallant which turns out not to have been a sacking at all. You recall that the sacking of Yoav Gallant after he came out and called for a pause to the government's judicial overhaul, which would remove pretty much all checks and balances on the government, that sparked mass spontaneous protests and a general strike and finally persuaded Netanyahu to hit the pause button on those plans for a judicial overhaul. Well, in his press conference last night, Netanyahu said that he wasn't sacked after all, and that he remains the defense minister, you have Gallant even tweeting out a picture of the two of them together, showing that they are very much in control and doing their best to promote and support Israel's security. The other thing to watch out for today, John, is the funeral of Lucy Dee This is the mother of the two British Israeli girls who were killed by Palestinian government in the West Bank. They were buried a couple of days ago, the mother succumbed to her wounds from that attack yesterday. The funeral is expected to happen this afternoon in the same settlements of Kfar Etzion, just south of Jerusalem, John.",

He tells great stories of growing up and basically growing up in an Irish household, even though, you know, obviously, they were very much American.
