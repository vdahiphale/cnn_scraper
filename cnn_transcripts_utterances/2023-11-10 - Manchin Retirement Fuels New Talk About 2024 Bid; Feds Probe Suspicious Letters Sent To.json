They're so endangered now.Joe Manchin, that brand of Democrat, rural, more conservative, do you think that there is an appetite for that? Do you think it's just kind of unanswered because of the way gerrymandering is? What do you think?",

And I know that it doesn't seem like there is because just the way the politics are, as you said, the gerrymandering, nobody is threatened in these congressional districts.But I hear from people all the time that are frustrated, and they want to see -- they'd like to see things accomplished. We talk about the border or the economy or, you know, a million other things, that would be happy to try to get things accomplished. Brianna, here's an interesting story -- is that Joe Manchin was instrumental in getting the Inflation Reduction Bill passed. Right? And he included in there -- his office essentially wrote a lot of the energy parts in there. And that included billions of dollars for green energy projects. A lot of those are going to benefit West Virginia. But in West Virginia, he got heavily criticized for that. Why? Because it was seen as kowtowing to Joe Biden in a state that is deeply red. So it's tough, it's tough out there now because it is the far left and far right that is driving the narrative. But I still hear from people who are in this middle, I don't know how big it is, who say, look, we just want to get things done. We're not as interested in the partisan politics. And again, that brings me back to Manchin. If there is a person that can tap into that middle, if it exists, it is a Joe Manchin or a -- a Larry Hogan or people like that. So let's watch and see what happens because Manchin is now running to see if he's going to be running. How about that?",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, (R), GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE: A postal official has some capabilities I guess that they don't talk about much, but somehow, they have a tracking.

We know this large law enforcement is under way after these letters were received in several states, including here in California, Georgia, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, and Washington State.Most of them appearing to target election officials. As you mentioned, at least one, according to state officials, testing positive for Fentanyl. We did get a statement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I'll read part of that. They say, \"The FBI along with our law enforcement partners responded to multiple incidents involving suspicious letters sent to ballot- counting centers and is reminding everyone to exercise care in handling mail, especially from unrecognized senders. If you see something suspicious, please contact law enforcement immediately.\" So law enforcement certainly taking this very seriously, Boris. It is important to note, just for perspective -- I was just speaking with a medical professional who specializes in Fentanyl overdoses. We're not talking about anthrax, which is highly lethal in small quantities. Unless you ingest Fentanyl, it's not likely that that could actually lead to death, in some type of casual inhalation. So that's important to note to tamp down any hysteria. But nevertheless, if you are an election worker out there, certainly you are in fear with these letters targeting your workplace. Which is why I expect we will see very serious charges if and when this person is taken into custody, both for interstate threats sent through the mail, but also targeting the U.S. electoral process -- Boris?",
