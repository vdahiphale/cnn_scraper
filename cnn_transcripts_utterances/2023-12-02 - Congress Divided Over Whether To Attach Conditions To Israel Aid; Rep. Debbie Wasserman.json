Today, how much pressure can and should the U.S. apply on Israel to save innocent lives? A lawmaker opposed to putting conditions on aid to Israel is with us.Plus candidates running for Senate and Michigan claim their campaigns were offered millions to instead challenge the only Palestinian American in Congress. One of them, actor Hill Harper is here. And we brought you the story of the first now a second family in Jackson, Mississippi says that their loved one was killed and buried and local police did not tell them. The investigative journalist who's reporting alerted the family joins us. I'm Victor Blackwell. Let's start the show. Well, the truce is over, the fighting between Israel and Hamas is back and so is the nightmare for innocent civilians. Israel says that it's using QR codes now and interactive maps to tell Gazans where to go. Remember cell service and electricity sparse there. National Security Council Spokesperson John Kirby was asked on Friday about the number of civilians who have already died since bombing resumed in Gaza. And he would not say if the Biden administration has seen more deliberately targeting from Israel. Secretary of State Antony Blinken had said that he wanted to see Israeli plans to protect civilians before fighting resumed. This is his latest comment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I have seen the bad information start to get out. I've saw the plans that Israel has in a multiplicity of ways to do everything possible to protect civilians, including making sure that they have the information they need, and that there are ways to accommodate them. And this is going to be very important going forward. And it's something we're going to be looking at very closely. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Several progressive Democrats now have primary challenges after they criticize the Israeli government since the beginning of the war, I should say. But in Michigan, a different kind of pressure campaign may be happening. Two candidates for Senate there say that they were offered $20 million in campaign funding support if they were to drop out of the Senate Democratic primary and instead run against Representative Rashida Tlaib. Tlaib is the only Palestinian American in Congress.Now the Senate campaign say the offer came from a large donor to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee or AIPAC. A call to that alleged donor were not returned. Nasser Beydoun says that he got that call this week. And actor turn candidate Hill Harper, he is running to replace Senator Debbie Stabenow there in Michigan says he got the call too. He joins us now. Hill, good to see you again. I want to ask you about the call, the approach. You say this came back in October, but it only became public just a few days ago. Tell us about the offer that you were made. HILL HARPER, (D) MICHIGAN SENATE CANDIDATE: Sure. You know, Victor, this -- the call came, I was driving to another event outside of Pontiac, Michigan where we weren't going to raise a whole lot of money. Our campaign is a grassroots campaign and we weren't going to raise $20 million. But it was a call that -- it was in -- the way I took it as a twofer. It was a call to get me to stop and not run against a candidate in this U.S. Senate primary, Democratic primary, that the caller supports to get to and then target and run against Congresswoman Tlaib. And so, it's actually, Victor, not even about that fundamentally about this call, it's about the fact that the system is broken. Our democracy and our campaign finance is broken that someone feels that the ability of the wealthy and the powerful to control elections, to control candidates.

Tell us this story, because unlike Dexter Wade who was killed by an off duty officer, this man, Mr. Moore, was found dead and then reported to police. What's his story? C.J. LEMASTER, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, WLBT: So what happened here is a situation where he was killed by blunt force trauma, that's what we know. He was found wrapped in a tarp on a street in the western part of the city. And at that point, police claimed they did not -- there were conflicting reports as to whether there was even an I.D. found on him. But suffice it to say it took some time for them to identify him. But at that point, all we know from the captain who was in charge of detectives for the department, he told us in an interview that essentially they sent a detective to a home that was -- that they found in connection with Moore, they left a card, and that was it. There was no follow up. We pressed the captain for this in one of our interviews, and he didn't really have any explanation. He said, well, that is sufficient. Now we know now that since all this had happened since NBC and other national news agencies have picked up the story as well, that now the city of Jackson, the police department, for the first time has a death notifications policy, a six page policy. So that came out of this. But it took the family not finding out about this until October for any of this to happen and for the ball to be rolling. And I got to tell you, Victor, this is something -- it was one thing for us to find out that there were 24 individual victims, 22 cases that the public that we had not been told about.

All right, this group that's doing this, they say it's because they're against affirmative action. So here's the explanation. In San Francisco, there's a program called the Abundant Birth Project. According to a KFF Health News, it's helped about 150 pregnant black and Pacific Islanders with $1,000 monthly stipend. It's gone on since 2021. And back in 2020, community researchers for the Abundant Birth Project, they produce this video to explain how the money helps these women. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
