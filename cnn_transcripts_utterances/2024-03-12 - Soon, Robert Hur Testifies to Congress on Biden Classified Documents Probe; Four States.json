But, of course, he caused a huge stir when he cited the president's memory as one reason he did not charge. This morning in his opening statement, Hur will reportedly testify, quote, my task was to determine whether the president retained or disclosed national defense information willfully, meaning knowingly and with the intent to do something the law forbids. I could not make that determination without assessing the president's state of mind. For that reason, I had to consider the president's memory and overall mental state. Again, the opening statement Robert Hur will deliver very shortly on Capitol Hill. CNN's Lauren Fox in Washington. I have to say, if he wanted to take down some of the drama, I'm not sure this opening statement will do that, Lauren.",

But Hur is defending this, saying that he couldn't very well say the president shouldn't be prosecuted without providing a detailed explanation as to why.In his opening statement again obtained by Politico, he said, quote, I needed to show my work. I knew that for my decision to be credible, I could not simply announce that I recommended no criminal charges and leave it at that. I needed to explain why the evidence and the president himself put his memory squarely at issue. He goes on to say, we interviewed the president and asked him about his recorded statement. I just found all the classified stuff downstairs. He told us he didn't remember saying that to his ghost writer. He also said he didn't remember finding any classified material in his home after his vice presidency, and he didn't remember anything about how classified documents about Afghanistan made their way into his garage. My assessment in the report about the relevance of the president's memory was necessary and accurate and fair. Now, I talked to a number of Democrats yesterday going into this high- stakes hearing who said that they hoped that this issue of the president's age would not be front and center. Reading that opening statement, I think it's clear that that is going to be a key cornerstone of this testimony this morning. And we should just note that this comes as Democrats were feeling very good about the president's memory, feeling very good about the public perception of the president's energy levels after that State of the Union speech last week. I think Democrats were hoping to turn the page. Obviously, today they're going to be going back in time a bit. John?",

There were no charges there. But, again, Sara, this is a White House that has taken issue with the report from the beginning. They pushed back on the substance of this report, even though there were no charges in the present. The president was clearly irritated by it, particularly mentioned that he couldn't remember when his son died. Take a listen to what he said in February at a press conference following its release. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  How in the hell dare he raise that? Frankly, when I was asked the question, I thought to myself it wasn't any of their damn business.

We're told that they announced many of these layoffs yesterday in an internal email.And, again, you pointed out, Kay, and you're totally right, that, yes, when there is a new team that comes in, new leadership with a nominee or a candidate, that isn't totally out of the norm, neither are layoffs, but I think the depth of these just underscore how much the new leadership wants to overhaul the committee. And I did speak -- I was in Houston last week, while they had these elections where the new chairman, Michael Whatley, and Lara Trump became the co-chair. And I spoke with many of the staffers there as well, and they told me that they were expecting some layoffs, but, again, I don't think they're expecting the depth of some of these cuts. We're told that the affect departments ranging from communications to the data team, to the political team. And they are not just senior staffers that are being laid off, also vendors and also having their vendor contracts be revoked. And so wide changes here. And we did hear from one person in this internal e-mail, Sean Cairncross. He's someone that Chris LaCivita, one of Donald Trump's senior advisers, who is now going to be -- have a new role at the RNC, as well as chief operating officer, he brought in Sean Cairncross as his number two. This is what Sean wrote in that internal e-mail. He said, quote, Chairman Whatley is in the process of evaluating the organization and staff to ensure the building is aligned with his vision of how to win in November. So, Kate, I do think this is a bit of a preview of what we can expect the new leadership at the RNC to be really overhauling the committee, wanting to change things and really align themselves with the former president's campaign. I'm also told that the Trump campaign wants to really have the RNC be an extension of them. They want it to operate as one and the same. And so I think we'll see a lot more of some of these changes and what the RNC is doing to help Donald Trump and boost him in any way that they can ahead of November. Kate?",

Mary, thank you for coming on. So, the airline, let's walk through this a bit, some of the new details we're getting. The airline is calling it a technical event. This passenger that we just heard speaking to CNN's Erin Burnett says that the pilot reported to him his gauges went blank, then the plane took a dive, and then the pilot told the same, these passengers that briefly after the dive, the gauges came back on and everything went back to normal.

Now, ordinarily, when something like this happens in flight, particularly over an ocean, they say it's clear air turbulence or turbulence that isn't visible on the weather radar. And usually, that's what this gets blamed on.But by saying it was a technical event and the instruments briefly went blank and that he lost control of the plane, three huge clues here, that does suggest there was something wrong with the plane. And what that could be is obviously the mystery. But this should be a major investigation, particularly since it's a new plane, a 787. And I searched the databases. I went back through what's called airworthiness directives, where Boeing has to put out warnings about its aircraft. And there was one way back in 2015, 2016, where if they left a 787 powered continuously, this is unlikely, but powered continuously for 248 days, that the instruments, that the power could go blank to all the instruments, and it would have to reset. So, that's the closest thing that I can find, but it does sound like a technical event with the plane.",
