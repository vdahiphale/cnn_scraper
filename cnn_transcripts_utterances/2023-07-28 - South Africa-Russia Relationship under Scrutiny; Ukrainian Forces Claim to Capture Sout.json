Coming up,Vladimir Putin offers free grain to six African countries in an attempt to \"Regional Leaders\". Niger's army throws its weight behind a coup against President Bazoum as he vows to protect the country's democratic gains. July is already the planet's hottest month on record. And we remember provocative Irish Singer Sinead O'Connor as new details emerge after unexpected death. Well, we start in St. Petersburg, Russia, where President Vladimir Putin just held a Summit with African Leaders. The main talking points were grain supplies after Russia withdrew from the Black Sea Grain Initiative wheat prices shot up 20 percent. But Putin insists that won't impact food supplies to Africa, even promising to supply grain to six countries for free. The Summit was also an opportunity for Putin to appear politically supported by global allies alongside his ongoing war in Ukraine. But notably only 17 African Heads of States attended, down more than 50 percent from the first and most recent summit in 2019. But one unlikely leader spotted in St. Petersburg today is the Head of the Wagner Mercenary Group. CNN geo-located a photo showing Yevgeny Prigozhin in a St. Petersburg hotel this is the first time Prigozhin has been seen publicly inside of Russia. Of course, that is news that we've been covering over the past couple of days. I now want to take you through to David McKenzie. He's standing by for us, in Johannesburg. David, great to have you on! Look, there's been a lot that's been happening as part of what we've seen today in specific a peace, you know, proposal by African Leaders has been put on the table and a lot of the agenda, but notably, the South African strategic conversation is one that we cannot ignore.",

But there have been reports that Putin is also planning generally to find new markets for its own grain, so to benefit, basically from getting out of the Black Sea Grain Initiative.

I think it's worth noting that last year,Russia exported a record amount of wheat and grain, Russia has been able to export all the grain it wants. And that's what shows that this new policy of President Putin is designed to destroy the Ukrainian economy and make African countries suffer because of his war. When grain prices increase, it's the poorest of the poor, who are made hostages to Putin's war. The Russians can and do export as much grain as they want. We've always allowed that. And that's a classic example of what we call disinformation. Russia's President says the sanctions block food aid, they don't -- they exported a record amount of food last year. So this is just another way for President Putin to try to divide the world into camps. And I think it's unfortunate that the poorest of the poor are now being held hostage to a war that's already damaged so much.",

And I suspect there are many reasons why some African countries have had such a difficult time accepting the simple fact that Ukraine was invaded and Russia is an aggressor, is because of a relentless disinformation campaign that's been going on for a long, long time. We're working to combat it. I think when Russia sees how African countries are becoming less and less supportive of Russia, when their promises are not met when they use food as a weapon. I think no information war is going to solve that problem for the Russians. Ukraine is divided countries from Russia because Russia chose to go to war, and is now choosing to attack the Ukrainian economy and make food a weapon.

They have made some modest but I would say important and certainly encouraging gains for the Ukrainian side. Remember, their goal is to try to punch through this Russian line on the southern front. One of the main priorities of this counter offensive is to divide what has become known as the land bridge, that long Russian occupied section of land that runs along Ukraine's southern coasts. And so what Ukraine has been trying to do is prod and poke all along that line trying to find weak spots trying to keep the Russians guessing and trying to get through. We do know that they have taken a town called -- that is in western Donetsk Province. It had been fought over for quite some time. It is in very bad shape, lots of destruction there. But it was heralded by President Zelenskyy as a victory. That's one of the lines that Ukraine is pushing on to try to drive south. And then elsewhere in Zaporizhzhia region we understand that Ukrainian forces are also trying to push south from around a town called Orikiv (ph). We believe that they've made some gains south of there, though it is not clear how far they've actually pushed. There's fierce fighting around there. The Russians are saying that the Ukrainian forces are using all kinds of armored vehicles using that training, that so many of these new Ukrainian brigades got in Germany, that combined arms training where they use artillery and forces on foot as well as these armored vehicles. And so we've also seen at least one Ukrainian vehicle running into what are known as these Dragon's Teeth. They are the Russian defenses that they've laid behind the first line of defenses, they're these cement pyramids that that armored vehicles and tanks have a very hard time getting over there. Its formidable defenses, they're laid out several in a row and then for mile upon mile, but that would indicate that at least partially at least this vehicle managed to get through that initial Russian defense. But Eleni they are very long way from piercing that line. We have spoken to Ukrainian forces on that front line. They say that it is a very tough fight, that those fields are heavily mined, that they're trying to cross that they come under fierce artillery fire. Their hope though is that once they're able to penetrate that line and pour through that this counter offensive could accelerate, Eleni.",

Specifically, there was a surveillance video system set up throughout Mar- a-Lago. And the allegation is that Donald Trump uses some of his staffers to try to interfere with or destroy or delete that video surveillance.
