It's Friday, November the 1st, 8 a.m. here in London, 3 a.m. in Milwaukee in Wisconsin, where both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will be campaigning in the coming hours.With just four days left to go to the race for the White House, more than 62 million people have already cast their ballots in early voting. Both Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have been crisscrossing the handful of battleground states experts say are likely to decide the election. The two held dueling rallies in Nevada on Thursday, taking shots at one another and urging voters to cast their ballots as soon as possible. And they'll do the same today in Wisconsin. Kamala Harris enlisted more star power to get her message out to voters in the key swing state of Nevada on Thursday, as actress and singer Jennifer Lopez joined her at a rally in Las Vegas. J-Lo used her time to urge supporters to get out and vote as early as they can. The Puerto Rican superstar also condemned the joke made by a comedian at Trump's rally in Madison Square Garden, where he called Puerto Rico a, quote, island of garbage. And both women worked to highlight the differences between the vice president and Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JENNIFER LOPEZ, SINGER/ACTRESS: It's about us, all of us no matter what we look like, who we love, or who we worship, or where we're from. Her opponent, on the other hand, doesn't see it that way. At Madison Square Garden, he reminded us who he really is and how he really feels. It wasn't just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day. OK. It was every Latino in this country. It was humanity and anyone of decent character. KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S. (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We will win because here's what I believe. When you know what to stand for, you know what to fight for. (CHEERING)",

Well, then she drops below 270 electoral votes. But you know what would get her right back over it? Let's just say we give her the state of North Carolina. She gets up to 271 electoral votes. So the bottom line is these southeast states can very much sort of prove as a backup path potentially for Kamala Harris. Let's just say we're going to put Michigan back in the blue, but we give Pennsylvania away to Donald Trump. Now Kamala Harris is again south of 270 electoral votes. Well, what can sub in? Well, why don't we give her the state of Georgia? Right, it went blue last time. That gets Kamala Harris well above 270 electoral votes. The bottom line is this. Look, Kamala Harris's best path to 270 electoral votes still runs through that great big blue wall up here in the Great Lake states. But the southeast provides this backup to her. One little last nugget I'll sort of point out to you. You know, we're talking about the importance of Georgia and North Carolina. When was the last time a Republican won without Georgia? You got to go all the way back to 1980. Of course, Jimmy Carter was the Democratic nominee. Not a big surprise. He carried his home state. How about North Carolina?

Explain why that matters and who's got the edge, you think? THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: Well, thanks so much for having me, Max. It's great to be with you. The Hispanic vote is certainly a demographic that Donald Trump has been making inroads with. He performed reasonably well in 2016, reasonably well in 2020. And I think he's poised to do so again in 2024. One of the things about the Hispanic vote is that there's much more heterogeneity there than we often give it credit for. They're also not necessarily just single issue voters on immigration. But this is a large and growing constituency in these key swing states and nationally. And so Trump, even if he doesn't win the majority of Hispanic votes, which he certainly will not, just making some dents in the lead that Kamala Harris seems to have would make a big difference.",
