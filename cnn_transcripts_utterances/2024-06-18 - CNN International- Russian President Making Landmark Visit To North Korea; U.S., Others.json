      "sentences": "Good morning or good evening, depending on where you're watching. I'm Lynda Kinkade in Atlanta.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, Russian President Vladimir Putin making his way to North Korea for a much anticipated meeting with Kim Jong Un. We'll look at what the two leaders are hoping to get out of this visit. Plus, action on immigration, U.S. President Joe Biden set to unveil a new executive order. What that will mean for the hundreds of thousands living in the United States illegally? And we'll have the latest on Popstar Justin Timberlake's arrest in New York. Well, for North Korea, it's an opportunity to deepen relations with one of its only allies, and for Russia, it's a search for more weapons in its war against Ukraine. But, for the Western allies, Russian President Vladimir Putin's two-day visit to Pyongyang is raising international concern. Here is what it looks like in the North Korean capital, posters and Russian flags up in place to welcome Mr. Putin. The Russian leader was in North Korea more than 20 years ago. North Korean President Kim Jong Un visited Russia's Far East in September. In this latest gathering, the Kremlin said both leaders plan to sign a new strategic partnership. Well, CNN has this story covered from all angles. In London, we have our Clare Sebastian, and in Seoul, Mike Valerio. Good to have you both with us. I'll start with you first, Mike. Military cooperation, of course, is key here. The latest there, they're also going to discuss education and tourism. Take us through the point of this trip and how they aim to strengthen this partnership.",

      "sentences": "Well, Lynda, I think that's the biggest question mark, right, and we'll know the answer to that question tomorrow evening when this song and dance is all said and done. How are they going to enhance their quote unquote \"strategic partnership\" that was agreed when the two leaders visited each other in eastern Russia in September of last year? So, they could either go small ball with, as you were saying, tourism, economic measures, or they could go hard ball from the American, Western and certainly South Korean point of view, deciding to enhance their military ties, perhaps engaging in military drills in some areas that North Korea contests or at least close to some of these areas, outlying islands, where North Korea contests close to the border between North Korea and South Korea.So, we're going to be waiting to see. But, each country certainly wants a whole laundry list of items from the other country, as we look at this video from Pyongyang of how people there are cleaning up the city and getting ready for the show tomorrow. So, what North Korea wants? It wants help with missiles, its satellite program, food assistance, energy assistance, certainly the quote unquote \"prestige of Kim Jong Un\" standing on the stage on Kim Il Sung Square with Vladimir Putin. And what Russia wants, they need more ammo to prosecute their war against Ukraine. But, on that note, Lynda, Vladimir Putin very publicly, very interestingly said last week that he is grateful to South Korea for not, I repeat, not sending lethal weapons to Ukraine. Now, because South Korea has refrained from sending lethal weapons to Ukraine, there is a thinking that perhaps Vladimir Putin may not go all the way with a new military alliance with North Korea because he doesn't want to rock the boat too much, according to that train of thought. He doesn't want to upset the South Koreans who, again, are not sending lethal weapons to Ukraine. Listen to some points on that front. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I think that's clear. Then there is certainly comments that we've had for -- from Putin and the facts on the ground in Ukraine speak to the fact that Russia is very much bent on this strategy of attrition of trying to exhaust Ukraine, to destroy as much of it as possible, essentially in order to get Ukraine to agree to the terms that Putin laid out for peace on Friday, which is -- involves Ukraine withdrawing from some of its own territory that Russia doesn't even occupy yet. So, that is one thing. They would need more weapons and ammunition to continue to prosecute the war under those terms, if they do agree to some kind of military partnership to beefing up any kind of trade between the two countries. That has already started.It is not necessarily likely we'll hear about that publicly, because that would be an open violation of UN sanctions on North Korea, which prevent both import and export of arms. And of course, both countries so far have denied that this is happening. But, I think the optics of this trip really matter. And if we really look closely at this article that Putin wrote in North Korean state media, sort of an open letter to the North Korean people, much of it really focused on the whole idea of countering the West of shoring up this coalition, essentially of autocracies against what Russia sees as U.S. and Western dominance in the world. And I think on the one hand, you could look at courting North Korea as an act of desperation, right? It wasn't that long ago that Russia was backing UN sanctions against North Korea. But, on the other hand, this is a powerful way to send a message to the West that courting this country with its growing nuclear arsenal, with its complete lack of scruples when it comes to threatening the West shows just how much of a global spoiler Putin could be, and perhaps they want to send a message to the West that Russia is not to be trifled with in their dealings with Ukraine, Lynda.",

North Korea didn't get to even test them like these most ballistic missiles and so on.

But, the administration says this applies to people who've already been living in the country for 10 years. The move could protect around half a million immigrants from deportation.

But, it does come as the administration is very quick to point out that Biden is taking action after Republicans had tanked those bipartisan border talks up on Capitol Hill, something that Republicans opposed at the urging of Donald Trump. So, the White House and the Biden campaign very quickly will try to note that Biden is trying to take action on each of these issues at a time when Republicans have really stood in the way up on Capitol Hill.",

Now, we have the Secretary General here in Washington ahead of that NATO summit that is in three weeks' time. They've got a lot of pressing issues to talk about, obviously, foremost among them is Ukraine. We saw Stoltenberg give a speech yesterday and sit down with President Biden, which he told the President and announced really to the world that some 23 of the 32 NATO countries are now spending two percent of their GDP on their defense budget. That is a non-binding requirement for NATO members.But, it is significant Stoltenberg highlighting the fact that just four years ago, it was -- this is -- this number of 23 is twice the number that it was four years ago. So, you can expect him to trump at that in this press conference that he is going to give with Blinken. But then, of course, they want -- they're going to be talking about Ukraine and making sure that Ukraine is getting the support that it needs from NATO allies, making sure that that pipeline for weapons is in place for Ukraine. There has been some slight criticism from Stoltenberg in the past few weeks directed, not directly at the U.S., but you could tell that it was in reference to the U.S. and others who don't want to let their weapons to be allowed to be used inside Russia. I know that that has been controversial. I can also see these two men have just come out on if we want to listen in.",

Putin's visits to North Korea demonstrates and confirms the very close alignment between Russia and authoritarian states like North Korea, but also China and Iran. And this also demonstrates that our security is not regional, it's global. What happens in Europe matters for Asia and what happens in Asia matters for us, and this is clearly demonstrated in Ukraine, where Iran, North Korea, China, are propping up, fuelling Russia's war aggression against Ukraine. So, this idea that we can divide security into regional theatres doesn't work anymore. Everything is intertwined and therefore we need to address these challenges together.We are, of course, also concerned about the potential support that Russia provides to North Korea when it comes to supporting their missile and nuclear programs. We see how much military support Russia gets from North Korea but also from Iran, and how China is propping up their war economy. And this is also one of the reasons why, at NATO and at the NATO summit here in Washington next month, we will further strengthen our partnership with our partners in Asia-Pacific region, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan, also to address the fact that the challenges they see, we see, in Asia and Asia-Pacific are directly linked to the challenges we face in Europe. And let me also say that I also fully agree that China cannot have it both ways. They cannot continue to have normal trade relationships with countries in Europe and at the same time fuel the biggest war we have seen since the Second World War. So, at some stage, this has to have consequences for China.",

And we need to react to this in a calm and measured way, but at the same time to take it very seriously. And that's also why NATO allies have agreed response options that the allies can take both individually and collectively.On the NATO level, this is about increasing awareness, sharing intelligence, making allies aware that this is not individual, not linked the incidents, but there is actually a pattern or Russian behavior over some time. And I welcome also the U.S. sharing a lot of intelligence on these actions with other NATO allies. Then it is about protecting our critical infrastructure, including undersea and cyber infrastructure. I've taken several steps to increase the protection of critical infrastructure. And then, of course, many of these actions are met by individual actions in the individual member states. So, there have been several arrests across the Alliance in the United Kingdom, in Poland, in Germany, in the Baltic countries. We have seen those behind this sabotage actions being arrested and there are legal processes going on.

And one of the things that I think is really important to note, some of the major economies in Europe, Germany, and France are included in this two percent totals now, and they had to overcome significant domestic political hurdles in order to get to that point. This is actually a remarkable achievement for all of those countries. Of course, when you look at the percentages, Poland is number one with over four percent that they've committed to defense spending.
