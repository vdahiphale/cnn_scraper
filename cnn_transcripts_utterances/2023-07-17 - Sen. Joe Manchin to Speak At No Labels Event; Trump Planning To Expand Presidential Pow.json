When will these fires go away? When will they burn out? Leading this hour, however, with the 2024 race and a preview of what a second Trump White House might look like. \"The New York Times\" reporting that Donald Trump plans a, quote, \"sweeping expansion\" of presidential power if he occupies the Oval Office again, intending to bring independent agencies directly under his control. This comes as the Republican presidential race is heating up with only 37 days to go until the first GOP debate. One Republican candidate, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson, will join me live in just moments. But first, on the Democratic side, an appearance by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia is terrifying Democrats and sparking speculation of a White House run for Manchin on a third-party ticket. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in Goffstown, New Hampshire, ahead of the No Labels event -- that's the name of the group. And this is expected to start at any moment. Jeff, Senator Manchin has poignantly refused to rule out a presidential bid or an independent ticket. Democrats must be nervously watching this No Labels event for a potential announcement.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, there's no doubt that Democrats, particularly the White House, are watching carefully the No Labels movement. This has been a movement underway for more than a decade or so in Washington, promoting bipartisanship. But, tonight, here outside Manchester, New Hampshire at St. Anselm College, where many presidential candidates have stood in this very room to give presidential speeches, West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin is coming.He's not yet said if he's running for re-election to the Senate. He also has not ruled out a third-party presidential run. He'll be appearing on stage behind me here with former Utah Governor John Huntsman. The two of them are the front men, if you will, for No Labels. That is the group that is promoting a unity ticket. Now, they have not decided if they are going to go forward with this in 2024, and the reality is, they're only on the ballot in about five or six states, but by the end of this year, they are raising $70 million with the hope of getting on the ballot in a majority of states across the country. And that's exactly what is worrying some Democrats, because they believe that they realize that there's an enthusiasm gap for President Biden. They realize that the idea of a rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump simply is not palatable with many Americans. So that's where No Labels is coming in. But one thing they are doing tonight is releasing a policy book. They're handing out these books to everyone. It's called a Common Sense Policy Book. They're really trying to strike a middle ground on abortion, on immigration rights, on gun rights. But, Jake, it's more of a utopia in a deeply divided Washington. So, this is very much the prospect of what could come with a third-party ticket, but much has to happen between now and then. But Joe Manchin, he knows he's getting a lot of attention for this. Of course, he's famous for being a thorn in Democratic Party sides, so he'll be doing that tonight as well. Again, he says he has no intention of being a spoiler in the 2024 race, but that's what many Democrats fear he could be if he moved ahead with this.",

Also, on our \"2024 Lead,\" presidential power may never look the same if voters put Donald Trump back in the White House. Trump and his allies are planning a major expansion of the powers of the executive branch. According to \"The New York Times,\" those plans include bringing independent agencies under direct presidential control. That would include the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission and chiefly the Justice Department.He also would refuse to spend money Congress has appropriated for programs he does not like and he would remove officials he does not like from intelligence agencies. With us now, Alyssa Farah Griffin, CNN political commentator and former White House communications director for the Trump administration. Alyssa, let's say it's 2025, Trump is president once again. What do you think it will look like if he is able to increase his authority over every part of government knowing what you know about him having worked for him?",

What's laid out in \"The New York Times\" reporting is the opposite. It is making the president significantly more powerful than the co-equal branches, the judiciary and the legislative branch.And it's kind of being pitched under the guise of dismantling the administrative state, something that is popular with conservatives, but that's not in fact what Donald Trump wants to do. He wants to basically strengthen every agency with loyalists to him, staff them with loyalists to him, and then bring any independent agencies under his purview so he has more authority over them.",

It's not usually a group dynamic between people who hide bodies, so there's that. But then there's also, frankly, in a highly suburban, densely populated area. It's one of the few desolate areas where from the road, you have a really good line of sight of anybody coming up on you in a car from either direction.
