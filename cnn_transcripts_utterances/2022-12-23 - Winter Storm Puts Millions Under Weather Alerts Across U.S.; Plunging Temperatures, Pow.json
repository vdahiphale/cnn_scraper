What the panel recommends now.But we have to begin with this, more than 200 million Americans spending the holiday weekend under wind chill alerts as a major Arctic blast plunges temperatures to dangerous levels all across this country. The storm causing the extreme cold is expected to unleash more heavy snow and blizzard conditions on parts of the country, strong winds causing poor visibility, authorities urging people to stay off the roads. More than 650,000 customers across several states are without power right now. That number is expected to rise. And the storm also creating travel chaos ahead of Christmas. This morning, more than 3,000 flights have been canceled already. Let's begin with CNN's Polo Sandoval live in Buffalo, New York for us. Polo, good morning to you.

So, the big concern here in Western New York is the flooding with the -- near the lake and the freezing as well.These roadways as you can see, completely drivable right now. But what authorities are doing in just the last hour since we spoke to you, they actually are in the process of closing down some of the major interstates around Buffalo basically recommending that only essential travel be done. There is no driving ban in place just yet, like what we saw during the snowstorm last month when we got about 6.5 feet of snow just south of here. But the big point that officials are stressing here in Western Buffalo, too, Don, is the snow won't be the big issue, as it will pale in comparison to what we experienced last month. It's going to be the flooding and also those freezing conditions. And that's why New York Governor Katy Hochul recommending that New Yorkers resist the urge to travel out today and especially tomorrow with the blizzard white out conditions and that coastal flooding.

In fact, this could end up being one of the coldest Christmas Eves on record here in Atlanta.Just to kind of show you how cold, this is a towel, frozen, rock solid. And that's because the temperatures here dropped so quickly overnight, which also means if there is any leftover rain on the roads this morning, maybe some puddles, those will completely freeze over, making for dangerous conditions on the roadways as well. But, look, we're not the only ones that are cold outside right now. You have wind chill alerts across much of the country right now. So, yes, it includes portions of Georgia, it includes portions of the eastern U.S., as well as areas of the Midwest. But, again, we also are talking about the winds. And that's going to be the key issue here. You have got winds across the southeast, 40 to 50 mile-per-hour gusts, even higher off to the north. So, if you have some holiday decorations out, you may want to strap them down and secure them, unlike my sister, who is now having to retrieve her inflatable Santa from the neighbor's yard after the wind picked up. So, again, also the snow too, keep in mind that wind, any snow that falls is going to blow that snow around reducing visibility in some areas to less than a quarter of a mile. And that's just going to add to any of the travel problems across much of the northeast and mid- Atlantic. Overall, most of these areas likely to pick up an additional four to six inches of snow.

It is blowing all that snow onto the highway, making it very hard to see, not to mention the snow packed on the ground, making it difficult to get through. So, if you are out here on the roads here in the Ohio area, keep that in mind. As you can see, if you can see, the car in front of us has his flashers on because they're trying to take it slow. This isn't the only car that we have seen out here with their flashers on. And right now, the temperature is six degrees. And we are really worried about the pavement freezing over and making that black ice which obviously I don't have to tell people how dangerous that is.
