If you want it to be critical, you say that Biden still looked frail, that he displayed a distinct lack of awareness of the urgency of this situation. Biden's down to Trump nationally and he's down to Trump in virtually every swing state; 72 percent of Americans, 72 percent say that Biden isn't (INAUDIBLE) or mentally equipped to be president. I think the problem for Biden is that Americans can't unsee what they saw at last weeks debate.

But where I do think Biden has erred very severely is in his post-debate spin. Messaging really matters and I think he and his staff have turned in sort of one excuse after another that hasn't really reassured Americans as well as lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Saying that he had a cold, that he had jet-lag 11 days after he returned to D.C. But he's OK between the hours of 10:00 am to 4:00 pm and just needs to get more sleep.

Now really if you're a Democratic donor, there's only one vehicle through which to get to the White House right now. That's Biden's one game in town. So I'm not entirely convinced that all the money is just going to flow out. And that's what's going to stop Biden's campaign.

For months now they have been negotiating, trying to reach that framework and a senior administration official in Washington now saying that it appears that there is indeed a framework agreement in place.

The Nasdaq has surged more than 22 percent this year and the S&amp;P has gained nearly 17 percent. That's an incredible performance. As analysts say, at least parts of the market surge was sparked by hope that the Federal Reserve could soon cut interest rates. That speculation was driven by new U.S. government data showing marginally slower job growth in June. But even with job gains cooling, overall employment activity remains stable. CNN's Paula Newton has that information for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

OK. So 206,000 new jobs created. That's a little bit less than May but still incredibly robust. What's interesting here is that the unemployment rate did increase to 4.1 percent. Now it's still not a high unemployment rate. It has to be said. But as you can see, it is starting to tack up a bit. And why is this so important, though, it's because Fed chair Jerome Powell, who's in charge of setting those all important interest rates, has said repeatedly that he is watching this jobs report, all this kind of data very carefully. I want you to listen now to what he said before this jobs number came in to talk about how important this figure would be for him. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But that is still incredibly good news for American consumers because it will hopefully bring down mortgage rates, car loans, credit card interest rates.And still though, at this point in time, it seems that no one is concerned, that although the labor market is weakening, no one seems to be concerned about any kind of a recession, just a progressive slowdown in the economy. Which everyone is welcoming because it means there will also be a sustained lowering of the inflation rate -- Paula Newton, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The election was held after a helicopter crash that killed previous president Ebrahim Raisi in May. Russian and Saudi leaders have congratulated Pezeshkian on his victory. For more now, we've got Fred Pleitgen, joining us from Berlin. Fred, good to see you. So the results are in. The big question is, what is Pezeshkian going to do from a policy perspective? The first moves and how much power he'll ultimately have in a country that has a lot of hardliners could, that could potentially block him, especially if he's looking at enacting social changes.",

If you look at the Middle East but not just yet, for instance, Iranian relations with Russia, with Vladimir Putin, have really peaked over the last couple of months. Iran is very important to Russia and, of course, also to Vladimir Putin's war efforts in Ukraine as well. So certainly a lot of countries are looking at this and I think it's quite interesting to see who has congratulated Masoud Pezeshkian already. One of the first ones being Vladimir Putin, who once again said that he hoped to expand relations with Russia. You also had Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia as well. That of course, also is going to be very interesting to see how relations between those two countries develop. We have seen a bit of a detente recently between Saudi Arabia and Iran. That was something that also happened under the Raisi government. And certainly something where we expect that that might continue as well, we haven't yet heard much of, is in the way of Western reactions to this, Western leaders possibly congratulating Pezeshkian as well. But definitely right now with all the turmoil that's going on in the Middle East, with all the turmoil that's going on in Europe as well, with the war going on in Ukraine, it's going to be very interesting to see where the chips fall.

He in fact himself said that he believed that he was also to blame as someone who is a very -- or was a prominent -- or is a prominent figure in Iran as well.And that in general he felt that the crackdown that followed, that was way too hard. That's going to be a very, very interesting thing to watch in Iran as well. In fact, recently we have had the supreme leader, for instance, double down on the very strict hijab laws and saying that they needed to be enforced by everybody in society. But we know that Masoud Pezeshkian takes a very different path in that as well. That's going to be one of the ones that we're definitely going to watch. And certainly something that does seem to be very important also for at least the moderate voters, at least from what we saw, we did go to one Pezeshkian rally before he was elected.
