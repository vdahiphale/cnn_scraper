They were warning the administration about a dire -- dire warnings about what was getting ready to happen in Afghanistan if certain actions were not taken.Sadly, I don't think the administration really listened to what they were saying and it ended in this disastrous evacuation that we saw in mid-October. And it crescendoed with a suicide bomber going off killing 13 servicemen and women and about 170 Afghans. Turning it over to the Taliban was a major mistake. I will tell you that the embassy employees deserve a medal for sending this to sit cable to the administration not only warning them but telling them what to do to avoid this situation, and also to save American citizens left behind, Afghan partners left behind, the interpreters, many of which were, as you know. And we left American citizens, we left most of our Afghan partners behind, and the Taliban are now hunting them down with the biometrics that we left behind as well. A disastrous result. I think the administration is embarrassed by this, obviously. And all we want to do is bring out the truth. And I think the veterans of Afghanistan and the Gold Star families deserve to know, not only accountability and answers, but they need to know what happened. And they do want accountability for how this ended.",

But I think it's vitally important. I think the counteroffensive will be successful. And I was pleased to see out of the G7 you know, the talk about F-16s going in. And the UK has really stepped up to the plate where I think in many ways, this administration has failed to give them longer-range artillery to hit Crimea. The security defense I talked to in the UK, they're putting those weapons in. In France, for that matter is as well.

So, don't blame me for reaching out to the Democrats, for begging the president to meet with me, or trying to find it. And don't blame us, Republicans, when we put a reasonable bill together that we actually took Democrats' ideas.So, when we put spending for government, and increase it one percent each year to cap it so the slow growth of government, so the economy can catch up, that was a Democrat idea. When we put work requirements in to help people get a job, that's something Senator Biden voted for, and President Clinton signed into law. That was a Democrat-supported idea, too. So, it's not my fault that the Democrats today had become so extreme, so far to the socialist wing, that they are now opposed to work requirements, that they are now opposed to saving one dollar less than you spent the year before.

So, now in America, 17 cents out of every dollar that comes in just goes to interest. But now you owe so much on your credit card. You have to pay for it. But you owe more than you make an entire year. So now for America, we owe more on our debt than our whole economy is worth, 20 percent more. So, should you just raise the debt limit or should you literally think let's eliminate some waste? If we had spent money, billions of dollars for a pandemic that the money has sat there for two years, pull it back. If we can have a provision to help people find jobs? Let's do that. If we can find a way that cut red tape, they let people go back and build things in America and make us energy independent and not beholden to China. Let's do that. That's all we're asking.

Again, negotiators going to the White House, the word he used was to finish the deal. I don't know whether that was deliberate or not but it does paint a slightly more optimistic picture than we'd heard the last 24 hours.",

But also, his rhetoric indicates that they are nowhere near a deal, one that can get through both chambers of Congress and signed into law within a matter of days, given the fact that what he is still insisting on are things that Democrats have not agreed to.So, the only indication is that there has been some change in the posture of the White House to agree on the spending cuts that he has been demanding as part of raising the national debt. I tried to press him about the exact concessions he's willing to offer. As you know, yesterday, he said the only concession they're willing to make is to raise the national debt limit. Democrats want their priorities added to it as well in order to get Democratic votes in the House and the Senate. He said that his priority is the Democratic concessions that he'd be willing to make are ones they've already rejected, including work requirements on social safety net programs, and spending caps, rolling back current spending levels to major areas of significant dispute with the White House. So, unless there's been some paid change in the posture of the White House, they are still far away from getting a deal, which is why today's meeting with the top negotiators and the White House officials at the White House will be so significant if they can actually close the gap, get closer to getting a deal, announced something before the House is expected to leave town tomorrow and return as soon as next week if there is a deal. All major questions that they head into this moment, but the speaker indicating there's still a lot of work to do.",

If that's watered down in any way, expect sizable Republican defections on any bipartisan deal.And if McCarthy were to bypass the 72 hours to review the legislation, he could potentially lose even more support, which is why he said that he will stick to that timeframe. And that adds to the time crunch here, given that June first if that is the real deadline here. Not much time to get to the House and it takes about a week to get through the Senate.",
