Nikki Haley is second with 20 percent, and Ron DeSantis is third at 16 percent.CNN's Chief US National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny is there in Iowa, and he filed this report just after the poll results were released yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  With two days to go before the Iowa caucuses open the Republican presidential nominating contest, Donald Trump still remains the far and away front runner in Iowa, according to a new Des Moines Register/NBC News poll. This Iowa poll, which has a storied history of capturing the final movements in this race shows that Donald Trump is at 48 percent in the poll. The race for second place is a fascinating one. With Nikki Haley edging out, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis just narrowly. Nikki Haley has 20 percent in the poll, followed by DeSantis at 16. The rest of the field is far below Vivek Ramaswamy, eight percent. The rest goes down from there. But it is the top of the field, showing that Donald Trump still has an overwhelming commanding lead of this race. His supporters are the most committed. The reason some of these matters, of course, as weather has really been a central concern here, blizzard warnings and dangerously cold weather, those committed supporters may be the answer to who shows up on the caucuses here on Monday night in Iowa. But Haley clearly is riding a wave of momentum, although the poll finds that her supporters are not as committed or as enthusiastic as others. It also shows that some 68 percent of people have made up their minds, a quarter of Iowa voters have not made up their minds. So, there is still room for movement in this race. But bottom line, this is still Donald Trump's race to lose, there is no doubt. Also, this poll raises expectations a bit. He's 28 points ahead of his leading rival, so his margin of victory, should he have one on Monday night, certainly will be judged against that number. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, Des Moines. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He has visited 99 counties, put a lot of money into his campaign.But Trump supporters are really passionate about him. They're willing to wait hours and hours in the cold just to see him speak. And as the report mentioned, he has this huge lead going in, and that's likely to hold. In fact, if he doesn't get a 25, 30-point lead or result in the Iowa caucus, that would be a sign that there was something a little bit off with the campaign. But I would like to point out that I think Trump's campaign in Iowa has been much more well organized and more effective than, let's say, it was back in 2016 when he lost to Ted Cruz. So, though he might not be physically appearing in Iowa that much, the organization itself has been making a lot of calls, sending out a lot of e-mails, and appears to be really effective in rallying his supporters. So, this is a contest for second place. It is to see how well Nikki Haley does. Can she build on some of the momentum that she has? She kind of edged out, DeSantis towards the end. And then that may bring her more support in New Hampshire. But I would expect Trump to win by 25 points at least.",

And DeSantis hasn't been able to really distinguish himself from Trump other than he's just not Trump and trying to make the argument that he has too many legal issues at the moment and that that will, you know, disrupt both his campaign and so forth.

Most of Iowa is under blizzard warning on Saturday with wind gusts more than 40 miles per hour.

As that Arctic air invades and spills south, this is some of the coldest air that we have seen so far this season, and it's coming right in time for the Iowa caucus on Monday.Iowans waking up Sunday morning to wind chills as cold as 45 degrees below zero frostbite, they are happening in 10 minutes or less. By Monday evening, we're still looking at wind chills as cold as 30 degrees below zero with frostbite times at 25 minutes or less. This would by far be the coldest caucus on record. Most caucus days have been in the 30s and 40s. You do have one that sticks out 16 degrees back in 2004. Now, it looks like this one will be much, much colder than that, probably not breaking zero degrees in Des Moines with a high of only minus two. So, very cold. And again, factoring wind chills even colder than that. In the evening, most of Iowa looking at temperatures at 10 degrees below zero. So, subzero temperatures. And then you factor in the wind chills, again, 30 degrees below zero. It's not just Iowa. Look at these temperatures. These air temperatures for the upper Plains here, the Northern Plains where we're looking at subzero temperatures lasting through Tuesday and Wednesday for places like Rapid City, Omaha, Chicago as well. Minus 10 as you're waking up on Tuesday morning. That cold air gets as far south as Texas. We're looking at temperatures in the single digits and the teens for places like Lubbock, Dallas, Austin, waking up to the teens by Tuesday and Wednesday morning. So, as this continues to spill south, it's going to impact most Americans looking at 80 percent of the lower 48 with temperatures below freezing. By the time we get to Tuesday, almost 20 percent of us subzero that we're looking at records falling maybe 250 or more records, both daytime cold highs and overnight low temperatures that could fall as a result of this Arctic invasion. Now, this is coming, kind of, the first of the season. A lot of these places, especially in the upper Midwest, are in the midst of their warmest winter on record. All of the red dots there, that's the difference between weather and climate. This is really their first cold snap, but the trend since December 1st has been a warm one. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, today marks 100 days since Hamas launched its deadly rampage in Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking around 240 hostages. Right now, a massive rally is underway in Tel Aviv to mark the occasion, set to last for 24 hours straight, calling for the release of hostages still held in Gaza.

We are continuing to the war to its conclusion, to total victory, until we have achieved all of our objectives, the elimination of Hamas, the return of all of our hostages, and the guarantee that Gaza will never again pose a threat to Israel.

But of course, the focus very much on what's going on in Israel and in the renamed Hostages Square there in Tel Aviv. Organizers say 120,000 people turned up last night to continue to keep up the pressure on the Israeli government to do everything that it can to bring those hostages home.And also, to continue to remind the world that 100 days into this war, as you say, sparked by Hamas's murderous rampage through southern Israel. 100 days on, more than 100 hostages remain in captivity, probably deep underground in Hamas's tunnel networks. We've heard from, released hostages talking about the lack of food, the lack of medicine, and about female hostages being tortured and sexually abused. And the families there in Tel Aviv, really just repeating and trying to maintain that pressure to try to get those hostages home. And there were messages of support for that objective from French President Emmanuel Macron. There was the U.S. Ambassador, Senator Chuck -- and others. And of course, they have also been hearing from freed hostages. And I think one of them summed it up. I suppose the way that many of these families are feeling. Gabriela Leimberg, who was in captivity for 53 days after being kidnapped by Hamas saying, I cannot imagine how we can continue to exist and think that we will move on as a society in the state without returning all the hostages as soon as possible. Of course, the problem is that there's no sign of another truce coming into effect. Israel has only so far managed to rescue one hostage despite many attempts since that war began on October the 7th. And so, these families becoming increasingly desperate, I think. They say that time is running out. And earlier in the week. we actually saw a number of them go to the border with the Gaza Strip with specially designed loudspeakers, with megaphones to try to call out so that their loved ones if they are in Khan Younis nearby, whether they are deep underground or not, so that their loved ones could hear them from the -- from their own mouths, telling them to be strong, that they haven't been forgotten, and that they are loved. And so, they're continuing to keep up this pressure. There's no sign of it having an impact just yet, but certainly 100 days on their hope is that their loved ones, those hostages, more than 100 of them still in the Gaza Strip will be home very soon.

China despises Taiwan's president-elect, Lai Ching-Te. They hate his Vice President Hsiao Bi- khim, the former U.S. envoy even more. She's banned from even entering China. Diplomacy? Forget it.

Taiwan is China's Taiwan. The DPP does not represent the mainstream view on the island. They did capture 40 percent of the vote, turnout more than 70 percent. About 20 million Taiwanese, more than 80 percent of the island's population eligible to vote. And many did. In Taiwan, there are no absentee ballots.",

With low pay, expensive housing, lack of opportunity, local issues have never been the ruling party's strength. It's why they lost the last round of local elections. But the party's two-term President Tsai Ing-wen did put Taiwan on a global stage like never before. Lai, her VP and now successor, ran on a continuity ticket.

They've only been doing these full elections here in Taiwan since 1996. But as Taiwan celebrates this peaceful transfer of power, the inauguration happening on May 20, they do so under the ominous cloud of China's Persistent threat of a potential war.

Now, the event is set to last 24 hours straight.

Saying U.N. workers have recently seen corpses on the streets and survivors desperate for food. He says, the local health system is, \"In a state of collapse.\" Controversial strikes on hospitals in Gaza have happened often in the first few months of the Israel Hamas conflict. Here's CNN's Katie Polglase with an in depth look at those attacks. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE RESEARCHER (voice-over):  Inside an ambulance at Al-Awda Hospital in Northern Gaza on November 9th. Nearby at the Indonesian Hospital the same night, sheer panic. The first two months of war decimated Gaza's health care system as Israel launched an air then land offensive on the north of the Strip. Out of 22 hospitals in Northern Gaza, CNN has identified 20 that have been damaged or destroyed between October 7th and December 7th. Imagery analyzed by CNN shows over half have been directly attacked. Several, including the two largest in Gaza, Al-Shifa and Al-Quds, were directly attacked by the Israel Defense Forces, this evidence suggests. At Al-Ahli Hospital, CNN previously found evidence a misfired rocket from Gaza was likely responsible for a deadly blast, but this appears to be the exception.",
