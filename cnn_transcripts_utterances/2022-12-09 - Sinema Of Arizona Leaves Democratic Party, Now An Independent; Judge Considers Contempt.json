Welcome to CNN NEWSROOM.We begin with a surprise shake up in the Senate, Democrats are now down one member, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona announcing today that she is leaving the party becoming an Independent. Now, just three days ago, Democrats clinched a clean majority in the chamber gaining a 51st seat with their re-election of Sen. Raphael Warnock in Georgia. Sinema explained her decision to our Jake Tapper. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA (D-AZ):   I've registered as an Arizona Independent. I know some people might be a little bit surprised by this, but actually I think it makes a lot of sense. A growing number of Arizonans and people like me just don't feel like we fit neatly into one party's box or the other. And so like many across the state in the nation, I've decided to leave that partisan process. I just not worried about folks who may not like this approach. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That was one of the main controversial issues that she did not want to go along with Democrats on.But look, this doesn't change a whole lot in terms of how the Senate is going to work day by day. And she did address that with Jake in her interview. She still is going to keep her committee assignments and in a statement from Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's office he said this, \"She asked me to keep her committee assignments and I agreed. Kyrsten is independent; that is how she's always been. I believe she's a good and effective senator and am looking forward to a productive session in the new Democratic majority Senate. We will maintain our new majority on committees, exercise our subpoena power and be able to clear nominees without discharge votes.\" A.k.a. moving those nominees much more quickly than they were before and that 50-50 Senate. So looking forward, this is not going to change a whole lot day to day in the Senate, but certainly, this is a very symbolic move and it is something that Sinema felt like she needed to do. And we should note, she did not say if she's running for re-election, but if she weren't going to run for re election that's just around the corner.",

So John, as someone who knows the Senator who has been described as mercurial by members of both parties over the past few years, what do you make of this decision? JOHN LABOMBARD, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, SEN. KYRSTEN SINEMA: Yes, thank you for having me, Bianna. I would say that this really is Sen. Sinema's registration, catching up with the reality that she's exhibited over the past few years in the Senate. Even in the House before she was elected to the Senate, she was always quite independent minded. She laid out a lot of issues with partisanship in this country, in her op-ed and announcement that I think a lot of Americans will find resonance with. As Lauren rightly just pointed out, I think people are zeroing in on what will stay the same, which is equally important today. The balance of power in the Senate by all accounts will not change nor were her values or her voting record. That's a voting record that is a hundred percent pro choice that's supportive of LGBTQ Americans and of dreamers. And it'll allow her, I think, to potentially have an even bigger platform with which to get some of these big bipartisan deals accomplished that she has led so far in the Senate.",

So I think when she says this is kind of a natural extension of what she's done in the past, I think it also shows the demographics in Arizona, the fastest growing group is independents.",

We are hearing more and more.I mean, Ruben Gallego just spoke today and thought that - and said publicly in a statement that he basically viewed this as a selfish move on her part, because she fears a potential primary from him.

So just because the party leadership isn't necessarily saying they're in supportive things, doesn't mean that Democrat voters wouldn't vote for her along with those independents that she needs. But I do think it's a smart move politically, because it avoids that primary process.   GOLODRYGASenator and you had been there when the White House was not singing her praises and supporting her the way they have been today and citing how her voting percentage and how much she's voted alongside, I believe 93 percent, alongside with the President's agenda?

Sinema was at the table negotiating these big bipartisan deals that were frankly sought by President Biden and his team, those ranged from infrastructure to the first gun safety and mental health bill passed in a generation to protecting gay and lesbian couples who were married.I honestly think that for all the hubbub and the back and forth, Sen. Sinema and President Biden and his team do have a really good working relationship because of that reason, and I think you can see that in the statement that the White House put out today. But there's no denying and it's really hard to look at these past few years especially and not see - not just in the Democratic Party, but I frankly, think in both parties that every day it gets a little bit harder to be around that table, to strike that sweet spot of bipartisan compromise for moderates in both parties, because of the partisan pressure that's really pulling elected leaders to the edges. That's what I think really animated this decision from Sen. Sinema to hear her talk about it. It's something I saw as well. And honestly, I think it's something that kind of transcends both parties. But I think this will set her up for success to keep pursuing those kinds of bipartisan deals that could renew Americans' confidence that our government can work.",

Our team has actually staked out at the courtroom, but they're unable at this point to get a lot.A lawyer though has for several media outlets has asked this judge to open up the proceeding. It doesn't look like that's happened at this point. But this is of such critical importance, because this really does represent a major clash and essentially culmination in this fight between the Justice Department and Trump's lawyers over these classified documents, hundreds of which of course, were seized by the FBI when they searched Mar-A-Lago in August. But DOJ, we've learned just isn't confident that it has all of those records back. So now prosecutors are asking this federal judge to hold Trump in contempt of court for failing to turn over all of these classified records. Now, we'll see how this hearing plays out. But if this judge agrees with DOJ here, she could actually impose on Trump and his team a daily fine for refusing to comply with turning over all these classified documents. And in addition here in this constant back and forth between DOJ and Team Trump, we've learned that another sticking point is that at this point no one from Trump's legal team is willing to sign off on an attestation that all classified documents have been returned. So that's a real problem from the DOJ saying, hey, Trump Team, why can't you at least tell us a hundred percent if all of these documents have been returned. So Bianna, this has already been a long legal fight where DOJ has been working for months, if not more than a year to get these documents back and now they're taking this big step here asking this judge to hold Trump in contempt, all of it happening in a non public hearing right now. So we'll see what else develops over the rest of the afternoon, Bianna.   GOLODRYGA:   Listen, Trump's lawyers can't be blamed for not wanting to sign that document given that they were burned for doing just that over the summer.",
