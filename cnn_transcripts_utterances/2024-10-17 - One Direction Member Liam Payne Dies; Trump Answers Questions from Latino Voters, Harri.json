And that in and of itself is noteworthy.According to three U.S. defense officials, the targets here were Houthi weapon storage facilities, including underground facilities. The officials say these weapons were used by the Houthis to target commercial and U.S. military vessels operating in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, where we have seen those Houthi attacks snarl and disrupt some of the most important commercial traffic in the world. Although the U.S. doesn't often carry out this level of strikes, We have seen the U.S. carry out routinely strikes against Houthi missiles, as well as drones to try to clear those out of the air or on the ground before they're able to carry out their attack. And then on some occasions we have seen the U.S. carry out wider strikes. This is very much one of those occasions using the B-2 Spirit bombers, far larger than the fighter jets the U.S. has used over the course of the past year or so to carry out strikes in Yemen. What that signifies? Well, the B-2 has a larger bomb load and can carry heavier weapons, so perhaps those weapons were used to target the underground weapon storage facilities. That would certainly be an option available to the U.S. in using that much larger, heavier bomber platform here. Now, the U.S. carried these strikes out alone. We have seen them in the past carry out strikes in coordination with the U.K. But in this case, it was the U.S. acting unilaterally. The U.S. also carried out a series of strikes earlier this month against several Houthi targets in Yemen. And then it's also noteworthy that the Houthis have continued to attack not only shipping but also Israel. At the end of last month, we saw Israel carry out strikes against targets of the Iran-backed rebel group in Yemen. This here, the latest round of strikes carried out by the U.S. Oren Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The foreign minister says everyone seems to be moving in a circle with silence from all parties.Alright. I want to bring in Nada Bashir who's following the latest developments from London. So Nada, in Gaza a bad situation just getting worse by the day. NADA BASHIR. CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, that is certainly the message that we're hearing from medical workers on the ground. Of course earlier in the week we had that warning from the U.N. Human Rights Office saying that northern Gaza had essentially been sealed off by the Israeli military. We've been hearing from civilians on the ground who have told us that even when they attempt to heed those evacuation orders that are coming from the Israeli military to move to humanitarian zones or so-called humanitarian zones in the coastal area of Gaza that they are being targeted by the Israeli military that they are being shot at. Of course, this has been denied by the Israeli military but there is a really troubling picture being painted of northern Gaza at this stage where countless civilians are still essentially stuck and trapped in what has been a besieged region of northern Gaza since the beginning of the month. And of course, we heard yesterday at the U.N. Security Council pretty firm statements from both the ambassador for the United States to the United Nations and of course the U.K.'s ambassador to the United Nations. We heard there just a bit from the U.S. Of course earlier in the week as well it was understood that the U.S. had issued a letter to the Israeli government essentially calling on the government to do more, to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe that we're seeing in Gaza, to allow more aid and to take action within 30 days otherwise they would be at risk of violating U.S. laws governing foreign military assistance, essentially putting U.S. military aid to Israel in jeopardy. We heard yesterday again from the U.S. ambassadors from the United Nations, they do not believe that Israel is carrying out an intentional starvation campaign that they have called on Israel, that they will be watching or to see whether Israel does take substantial action and we have, according to U.S. officials several aid trucks now getting in to northern Gaza, whether this will be a sustained operation, whether we will continue to see enough humanitarian aid getting in, particularly as we near the winter months, of course that remains to be seen. But also as you mentioned we are now learning that at least seven NGOs or medical NGOs have been banned essentially by the Israeli government from accessing Gaza. Some of these NGOs have been quite crucial in providing updates on what is happening on the ground for many of us, including us at CNN, have been of course hugely crucial in providing medical assistance to Palestinians on the ground, an area where of course the vast majority of hospitals are now inoperational. So this is a desperate situation. It is concerning that we are seeing NGOs now being banned from accessing the Gaza Strip, in addition of course to foreign media workers who have been banned since the beginning of this war, but again that pressure is mounting for more to be done to alleviate the humanitarian crisis that we're seeing in Gaza. This is of course going to be a long process, the U.N. is still of course carrying out its second round of the polio vaccine rollout and has also called for more to be done, including humanitarian pauses, including opening more aid crossings to allow more aid in, and of course we are still seeing those rates of malnutrition rising in Gaza, the fear is this will only continue to rise regardless of the aid that we're seeing getting in now. So clearly a lot more to be done there.",

And just to go back to that plan, some have said that this is a prelude in northern Gaza, not only to a permanent reoccupation, but to reestablishing Israeli-Jewish settlements there. I mention that because we just heard news in the last couple of days that the Likud Party, this is an official Likud invitation to a meeting that will take place next week in the Israeli parliament to call for the reestablishment of settlements in Gaza, to prepare for that.That's openly now being said on an official Likud notification. But you asked the important question, why now in terms of this Americans concern, this has been going on, the inability, the refusal by Israel to get this relief in. It's just gotten worse. You know, there've been occasional periods of slight easing. There are two expressions we're all very familiar with, and better late than never, and too little too late. I'm afraid we're much closer to the latter, and it's I don't want to go here, but it's hard not to see this with a little bit of a cynical eye given where we are in the election cycle and given that the administration and the Harris campaign in particular are trying to find this balance between not alienating Israel-centric voters and campaign contributors while at least having something to go to those who care about Palestinian lives, all lives, human rights, and say, no, we're trying to do something. The 30 days that is threatened in that letter, and it's a very timid threat as well, but that 30 days takes you past the election date. Where have you been until now? Why are you not leaping into this immediately? And unfortunately, the balancing act on the political side just cannot live alongside the binary on the ideological side. And the ideological binary is what we have seen throughout this, which is a U.S. sending the weapons without which this couldn't be done running the political and diplomatic cover and aligning with Israel on narrative and messaging and really not being credible when it comes certainly not to caring about Palestinian lives, even Palestinian American lives, but also, if we zoom out a moment, Kim, this broader question of a region that has gone an awfully long way down the road to a broad conflagration. We see attacks in Yemen now. Because by failing to push in a serious way with leverage being used. Not doing that in Gaza means the region is ever more volatile.",

Today he said to also be going to meet with the head of the European Parliament and with the new NATO Secretary General because at the same time as the E.U. Leaders Summit NATO defense ministers are meeting in Brussels. So look on the one hand the optics of this are very welcome for Ukraine. Part of the victory plan is of course they want an invitation to NATO, they want to take their place in this sort of Euro-Atlantic security architecture post-war. So being able to address these gatherings is certainly a good thing for Zelenskyy, but I think the backdrop to this is that his diplomatic efforts have not been going very well. His trip to the U.S. led to him being entangled in partisan politics. He had a four-country sort of city-hopping tour of Europe last week, which ended with a lot of sort of positive rhetoric, but no real concrete decisions, especially on the issue of lifting limitations on using Western long-range missiles on Russian soil. And even the NATO Secretary General, speaking ahead of these meetings today, said he is not 100 percent sold on all parts of the plan. He cannot say that he fully supports it. Of course, there is a lot in this victory plan. So this is the uphill battle that Zelenskyy faces.

Part of the reason could be, and this is speculative, because fuel has become so expensive in Nigeria after the removal of fuel subsidy with the election of President Bola Tinubu. Unfortunately a fire broke out and burned through this area quite quickly appear to show this entire area engulfed in flames.More than 90 people died on the spot, but as more were getting treated in hospitals, the death toll continued to climb and police warning that the actual death toll could be much higher because some are in serious condition. Unfortunately, this is not the first fuel tanker tragedy in Nigeria. Truck accidents are quite common in the country. There was one just last month where more than 40 people died and there have been so many more across the country. They are partly blamed on poor road conditions, sometimes on reckless driving and often on vehicles and road work. They are not in good mechanical condition to be on the roads but the effect is that these accidents cause very high death tolls when they happen.
