Because I know about two months ago, it was not looking great. GOV. JOSH SHAPIRO (D-PA): Right. Look, on Monday night President Biden eloquently passed the baton to Kamala Harris. Over the next several nights since then, we've been laying out the case. Tonight, she gets the opportunity to lay out the case to talk about her background, to talk about her view and vision for leadership, the kinds of things she wants to do for this country and the direction she wants to take. And I'm sure she will hit a home run tonight. As for what has transpired, Jake, Dana, over the last 30 or so days since Joe Biden dropped out, I think what you have seen is the race effectively be tied. Maybe up one or down one on the poll you're there, but the race is tied and if you think about it this way, she has marched 49 yards down the field. You know Pennsylvania really well, that last yard and a half to get to the other side of the field, that's a hard yard and a half. The good news is, I think this campaign is showing incredible nimbleness and skill to be able to go out and grab the yard and a half. I think every day Kamala Harris is on the stump, she is earning more and more votes. I will share with you anecdotally, when I'm out in rural communities in the areas of around Pennsylvania where maybe a voter voted for Obama and then Trump and moved to Biden, voters who shift around. They are really curious about Kamala Harris. They will say to me, what you think of her? What do you think she will do on this, that or the other thing? I think curiosity is important, it means they are open to casting a vote for Kamala Harris and I will make the case as I know she and her campaign will going forward.",
