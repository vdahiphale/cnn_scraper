For days now, festivalgoers have been trapped in treacherous ankle-deep mud, advised to shelter in place and to conserve food, water and fuel. The area was slammed with two to three months' worth of rain in just the span of 24 hours. Officials say about 72,000 people are still stranded, some of them choosing to risk it, hike for miles in the mud to leave, one of them being the popular musician Diplo. He actually posted this video after he trekked through the mud, hitching on the back of a pickup truck alongside comedian Chris Rock. We should anticipate hearing some jokes about that pretty soon. CNN national correspondent Nick Watt is covering all of this for us. So, Nick, what are officials saying are the next steps in trying to get folks out of there?",

But we have seen some people trying to get out this morning and succeeding in those vehicles. The issue is, the more vehicles that are on that mud before it's really dry could cause problems later in the day. The sun is the savior here. Listen, the rain, that makes that clay very quickly unpassable, but the sun also dries it pretty fast too. I mentioned some people have already made it out. CNN spoke to one of them. Take a listen.

And then some kid passing in a pickup truck recognized Diplo and gave them a ride, and they eventually made it to Reno. But a lot of people decided to stay. There is a real kind of ethos of self-reliance around this festival. And some people said, listen, I could have walked out, but then I leave my R.V. and all my stuff. What do I do? And nothing really bad happened. One person did die, but we were told that that was not connected to the weather.

A new \"Wall Street Journal\" poll out today shows that just 37 percent of respondents approve of Biden's handling of the economy. Nearly six in 10, nearly 60 percent, disapprove.

But he also used this speech as an opportunity to take a swipe at his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. He never named him by name, but he was trying to make an economic contrast with him.

It's a bit lower when you take a look at his handling of inflation. All of this, the White House has really, over the course of the past few months really tried to chip away at, trying to show that the policies that he has enacted, things like the Inflation Reduction Act, things like the bipartisan infrastructure bill, that those are ultimately paying off for voters. Of course, the question will be whether, in November 2024, if Americans are feeling that the economy is at a good state. Of course, the president traveled here to Pennsylvania, a battleground state that he won. It helped him win against Donald Trump back in 2020.

TIM KAINE (D-VA):  The language is specific, if you give aid and comfort to those who engage in an insurrection against the Constitution of the United States. It doesn't say against the United States. It says against the Constitution. In my view, the attack on the Capitol that day was designed for a particular purpose at a particular moment.
