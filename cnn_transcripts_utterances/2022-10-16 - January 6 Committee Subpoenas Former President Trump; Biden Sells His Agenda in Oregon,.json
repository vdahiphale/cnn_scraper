He had done it many times before. As a real estate developer, he claimed his buildings were taller than they were, which is amazing. As a reality television star, he had made it conflicts between contestants to induce his ratings. As a political provocateur, he claimed without a lick of truth that the nation's first Black president was secretly born in Africa.

So, he was for months preparing in a very calculated way. And in fact, he told the public again and again, any outcome of the 2020 election, which I am not the winner, I will contest. I will not concede, I will not do this. So, it's very disingenuous. Even many of the Republicans who later broke with Donald Trump, people like Bill Barr, the former attorney general, or Mitch McConnell, the Senate at the time, majority leader, they say, oh, well, Donald Trump went crazy essentially after the 2020 election.

And so, when it comes to, you know, things like mail-in voting, for instance, before the 2020 election, there's a broad majority of Republicans and Democrats thought mail-in voting was pretty good. But as soon as the 2020 election comes around, suddenly, Republicans began backing off of it, and saying they don't think that's a good way to vote, et cetera. So, you -- even setting aside the result of the 2020 election, we've seen that Donald Trump has really been able to shift Republican voters' views on the active voting, how do you vote. And I actually think there's a chance that this backfires a little bit on Republicans in the midterms because in states like my home state of Florida, you had a lot of Republican Party operations really built on getting voters to vote in certain ways, that Donald Trump could come out and say, no, no, no, just vote on election day a person.

CNN's Isaac Dovere writes this, \"With invitations flowing into the White House and the Democratic National Committee, a relatively low ranking cabinet secretary staff has to choose between Democratic candidates trying to chase him down. There's no precedent for the winner of the Iowa caucuses becoming the transportation secretary and proving to be more agile on camera than the vice president and than Joe Biden.\" Isaac is here with us now. This is very interesting reporting because as we all know, the presidential sweepstakes never really die. But explain to us what is going on here. Why is it that Buttigieg is such a hot commodity? ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: Look, some of it -- and I hadn't done the count that he's 14th in line in succession, but I'll try to (INAUDIBLE) on that. But I think some of it is that he is good on camera and people respond to that. That's made him even more of a hero for liberals on Twitter than he was during the presidential campaign. But some of it I think really speaks to two things that are going on here larger in the country. Number one, Joe Biden is not so popular as we know. And that means that he's bringing Kamala Harris down with him. But their agenda is more popular, especially when it comes to infrastructure which is Buttigieg's place in the world. The other thing that's going on is that you see a hunger in the Democratic Party for a fresh face. And looking at Joe Biden, they don't have that fresh face there. Kamala Harris again gets lumped in with that, sort of unfortunate for her that she is in this way connected to President Biden and has -- takes sort of the political baggage that he has. And Buttigieg comes forward and he is a fresh face to a lot of people. And so that benefits him in a lot of ways.",
