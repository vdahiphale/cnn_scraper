A new Quinnipiac poll shows that 57 percent of Americans think criminal charges should disqualify him from running in 2024. But look at the party breakdown here. Only 23 percent of Republicans feel that way. Seventy-five percent don't think charges should disqualify him. So joining us from D.C. to discuss this and more is reporter Shelby Talcott. She covers Trump and Republicans for Semafor. Shelby, good morning. Thank you for joining us. What does this poll say about Donald Trump's standing in the party among voters?",

And while that's certainly part of it, the other part of it, accordingto sources I spoke with, is because of Florida's really broad Sunshine Laws. They have some of the broadest laws in the country when it comes to public records.

They cited basically four reasons why it's unlikely we're going to have a pause.Number one is that it's not necessarily good for innovation here in the U.S. We're competing with China and other countries to be ahead in tech and so pausing puts us behind. Two, technologically, it's going to be pretty different. This is like trying to put the toothpaste back into the tube. So many of the products that we use every single day, including products that make our world safer, already include AI. And so pausing on the technology is going to be pretty, pretty hard. And I think the third and final thing is that it would require a lot of sort of inner government and technology coordination that we just don't have yet. Regulators can barely grasp the concept of AI let alone pass any sort of bills that would force anyone and compel them to pause. So it's unlikely at this point that we are going to take a pause. But what the letter does show is that there is an understanding amongst the tech community that AI poses risks if we don't move carefully when we're creating these algorithms, making sure that we are accounting for things like bias.",

We're still in a very, very early stage of implementing AI at that level into society.And one of the things that the letter calls out -- it says we shouldn't be building AI that's more sophisticated than ChatGTP-4, which is the new AI program that OpenAI debuted two weeks ago. I mean, ChatGTP-4 is innovative, it's amazing. It can help generate text from images. But we're nowhere near it replacing all human jobs.

The drug will soon be available on shelves, potentially saving thousands of lives.CNN's chief medical correspondent, of course, is Dr. Sanjay Gupta. He joins us. Good morning, Sanjay. What kind of impact could this decision have? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Don, since we've been reporting on this over the last two decades more than a million people have died of drug overdoses and the majority of those are -- have been opioids. I mean, people have been hearing these numbers for some time and the numbers have been getting worse. I mean, in 2020, you had some 69,000 people who died of opioid overdoses, specifically, and the numbers have gone up since then. So, I mean, any strategy that could potentially be helpful is what people have been looking for in Narcan is essentially an antidote to an opioid overdose. It can block opioids from actually killing you. Right now as things stand, Don, you can get Narcan in any pharmacy in the country. There is these access laws that allow you to get that without a prescription. What this is going to do -- and this will be by the end of summer -- is allow the Narcan to be purchased over the counter. So in the same place you buy your Tylenol or allergy medications and things like that you could get it there. So would it make it more likely for people to buy the Narcan, put it in their medicine cabinet, and have it ready to go should some terrible overdose happen? That's the question.

Ninety-nine percent of the illicit drugs that are currently being seized have fentanyl in them. It's remarkable. I mean, it's something we barely talked about a few years ago and now all the illicit drugs have fentanyl in them. If you're not -- and that could be in your Adderall. It could be in your anti-anxiety medications. Places where you would not expect it all, they could be tainted with fentanyl. So one of the strategies is to allow people to start testing for this -- test strips. Making them available in the field. So you could test your drug ahead of time for fentanyl and also for other things like xylazine, an animal -- a sedative drug. That is being used now to taint a lot of these drugs.
