You know, that is really speaking to the right, the base of the Republican Party, and so I think folks were hoping he would take off, but you can't peak too soon and maybe if he was going to run maybe he should have ridden that wave and now the story is still going to be told, you just better hope it's in your favor and right now it's not going that way.",

Number three, it strikes me that 100 percent of the Democrats want Trump, 100 percent of the political media wants Trump, half the Republicans do and half the Republicans don't, but you can see there are massive forces aligning to get rid of DeSantis now because for many reasons people would rather have Trump. And that's what's happening and I don't know if DeSantis was caught flat-footed by that but I think it's pretty apparent. Many, many corners of our political spectrum see him as a threat, Trump, the left, and they're working together right now to try to stop him before he ever gets started.",

That's what he said during the Republican primary. We should not be fighting trans people when it comes to bathrooms.Fast-forward to the indictment in 2019, all of a sudden now he's going after trans, he's going after LGBT, he's gone to black, he's gone up to everyone. Why? Because Trump looked vulnerable. Look at the timeline. Prior to Trump's indictment, he seems to be more of a moderate Floridian. After the indictment, he started pushing towards Nebraska, pushing towards Louisiana, leaving Florida behind because he needed to appeal to a broader base across the country.
