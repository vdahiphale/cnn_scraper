I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We're getting a new window into former President Donald Trump's willingness to associate himself with incendiary figures. Just days after announcing his 2024 run for the White House Trump is now trying to explain away why he hosted a dinner at Mar-a-Lago with white nationalist and holocaust denier Nick Fuentes and rapper Kanye West, who has been in the headlines for antisemitic remarks. Trump saying in a statement this past week, \"Kanye West called me to have dinner at Mar-a-Lago. Shortly thereafter he unexpectedly showed up with three of his friends whom I knew nothing about.\" Again, this is his statement. \"We had dinner on Tuesday evening with many members present on the back patio. The dinner was quick and uneventful. Then they left for the airport.\" Joining me now, CNN political commentator, former Republican Congressman from Pennsylvania Charlie Dent and Democratic strategist and former Clinton White House aide Keith Boykin. Charlie, let me start with you first. What is your reaction to how Trump is -- it sounds as though he is trying to make this go away, but it doesn't sound like it's going to go away.",

It is simply appalling that this happened.And in fact, it's incumbent upon the Republican establishment, what's left of it, to stamp this kind of element from within the GOP once and for all. We saw it with William F. Buckley and many other back in the day, the John Birch Society, got rid of these radical, extreme elements. There needs to be a concerted effort. This whole America First movement and the ugly historical connotations back to the 1930s has been forgotten by too many of our fellow citizens, regrettably. But it also speaks to a larger problem for former President Trump, that there apparently are no gatekeepers. There are no adults. There doesn't seem to be any political discipline to speak. How a dinner like this could even happen is also horrible. But finally, I guess I would say this further diminishing Donald Trump as a serious political figure. His erstwhile presidential opponent should be quite happy about this event because it will simply elevate them and hurt Trump, and Trump is diminishing. But he's still a dangerous figure. But the party needs to deal with this larger issue. We can't embrace the likes of Fuentes and Taylor Greene and others while alienating and ostracizing people like Kinzinger and Ms. Cheney.",

But really what brought them to the table, belatedly admittedly, is the fact that they have seen defeat. And nothing gets more people more motivated to change course than defeat. Now, I wish people became more offended by these incendiary and inflammatory comments that Trump has been making over the years. We always knew these were disqualifying comments. But until enough of the elected leaders of the Republican Party and the Republican establishment stand up and forcefully condemn this, that is what will change the narrative. If it's too few people, we're not going to make a difference. We need strong leadership. Silence is not a way to counter that ugly Trump narrative.

No one is really commenting because this is who Donald Trump is, the former Republican president, and they know that is who he is.And so when you talk about the idea that there are no gatekeepers who are preventing this type of meeting from happening, I understand that, too, Charlie, but that is also part of Donald Trump's brand. There were no gatekeepers when he was in the White House. That was the reason why we had the insurrection that took, because there was no one to tell him no. We saw that from the January 6th Committee hearings. He has consistently lived in a world from his business experience to his political experience where he has never had anyone tell him no. And when he does have someone tell him no, he continues to do what he wants to do anyway. So I'm not convinced a gatekeeper would make a difference. This is who Donald Trump is.

Silence is not an answer. And if not now, when, I guess. This is the time, Trump, I think, in many respects is reeling because of the midterm election and some of these other recent events. I think now is the time to put him down. And you can't let him off the mat again like they did after January the 6th. We need this Republican Party to rid itself of these elements.

Nearly two weeks after the killings, no suspect, no murder weapons, no arrest for that small Idaho community. The public is flooding the FBI with tips. Investigators are now reviewing more than 260 digital submissions, including photos and videos on the night of November 12th just hours before the students were found stabbed to death in their Moscow, Idaho, home. Two of the victims were at a sports bar, the other two at a fraternity party. And detectives are asking for all available videos near those areas, hoping it will shed some light on the mystery. But the small community of 25,000 is growing more rattled by the day. Police are trying to dispel rumor and false information that are stoking even more fears. And CNN's Camila Bernal joins me now.

I want to bring someone you know well, the Points Guy, Brian Kelly. He is no stranger to the TSA line. Brian, people were cooped up during the pandemic.

Malls are packed, but airports are even more packed. And Jim, I just have to say, as a procrastinator myself, do not wait to book travel these days. We're seeing dramatic increases and even flights selling out to popular destinations. So if you snooze, you lose this year with travel. More people will be traveling than last year certainly because we were up against the Omicron outbreak this time last year which really put a damper on travel.

Not only can you save money, but it also gives you that extra flexibility, if you need to cancel at the very last minute, you get all those miles and taxes back free of charge with most airlines. So it's tough out there, especially for families with their school holidays where you don't have a lot of flexibility.

Director James Cameron -- and by the way, he is an amazing director, but he is revealing that his upcoming movie, \"Avatar, The Way of Water,\" which looks incredible, will need to make $2 billion at the global box office to break even. Am I reading that correctly? Cameron told \"GQ\" the movie is very effing expensive?(LAUGHTER)",

So he is pushing the boundaries of the cinematic universe. And so \"Avatar 2\" is going to come out on December 16th. It's also going to be released in China, which is huge news. We are expecting this to break box office records.But James Cameron says it's going to take a lot of money for him to break even. And like you said, it is going to take over $2 billion because he has gone so far with the budget. He has gone overbudget. He's missed all the different release dates when this movie was supposed to come out. It's been pushed back several years. But I am telling you, Guillermo Del Toro has come out and it looks as though he has seen the film or some final cuts, and he said it is just a feast for your eyes. We know that back in preproduction for this movie in 2017, some of the actors, they were practicing underwater training. And James Cameron says that you'll see the actors and that they actually are underwater holding their breath, even a seven-year-old actor at the time, upwards of three, four minutes long, and that they are actually acting underwater. I remember when I took my children to Disney World. I took my five- year-old son this summer on the Avatar ride. And I'm telling you, it's all he still talks about, OK. So we are all going to be going to see this movie in a few weeks. And you saw people sort of fall off of going to the movie theaters during the pandemic, obviously. And now they're starting to go back. So it will be interesting to see if people rush to theaters. I think they will on December 16th.",

We appreciate it.Growing tension in China today over lockdowns brought on by the country's largest COVID outbreak. Videos posted to social media show protesters smashing fences and calling for an end to the lockdowns which they blame for delaying firefighters from reaching the scene of a deadly fire on Thursday. CNN's Selina Wang is in Beijing with more. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Anger is rising and tragedies are mounting, but China shows no sign of budging on zero COVID. Authorities are clamping down with more lockdowns, mass testing, and quarantine, and people are getting more and more frustrated. Adding to the anger is a fire that broke out in the capital of China's far west Xinjiang region on Thursday night. Ten people were killed and nine were injured at a fire at an apartment building in Urumqi. Most parts of Xinjiang have been under lockdown for more than 100 days. The deadly fired sparked nationwide outrage because widely circulated videos which have now been censored in China show that COVID measures, COVID lockdown measures very likely delayed firefighters from getting to the scene. State media claims that people in the compound were allowed to leave the building, that it was considered a low-risk COVID area. But video shows fire trucks unable to get close to the scene because the compound entrance was partially blocked. The video shows it's blocked with fences, tents, and metal barriers that are normally used as part of COVID measures. The videos also show smoke and flames coming from a high floor of the building, but the water failing to actually reach the fire. What adds to the tragedy is that those who died in the fire likely spent their last three months largely confined to that building, if not entirely. The fire really struck a chord with the public here because we have seen scenes of tragedy and suffering play out over and over again since the start of the pandemic, countless stories of people struggling to get enough food, daily necessities, and emergency care in lockdown. Three years into these draconian policies, frustrations are more frequently turning into public protests, which are normally rare in authoritarian China. Last week in the southern city of Guangzhou some residents revolted during lockdown by tearing down barriers and marching through the streets. There were violent clashes at the Foxconn factory in Zhengzhou this week. But still there's no end in sight to zero COVID. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEO TAPE)",
