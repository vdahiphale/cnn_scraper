U.S. President Joe Biden will unveil more than 300 new sanctions targeting Russia. They're meant to degrade Moscow's ability to source materials for the war, particularly from the Russian ally, China. Mr. Biden is also expected to sign a new 10-year security pact with Ukraine on the sidelines of the summit. It will include training for Ukrainian forces, more weapons and military equipment and greater intelligence sharing. And G7 leaders are set to announce a $50 billion loan to Ukraine paid for with proceeds from Russian investments, which have been frozen since the war began. More now on President Biden's agenda from CNN's senior White House correspondent MJ Lee. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MJ LEE, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Here in the coastal Puglia region of southern Italy, the leaders of the so-called G7 nations set to convene on Thursday. U.S. President Joe Biden landing here late Wednesday night for the final G7 summit of his first term. But questions loom large in the aftermath of his son Hunter's conviction on three federal gun charges, including whether the president would commute his son's sentence. The White House on Wednesday would not rule it out. In a show of support for his son, Biden spent the previous night with Hunter and other members of his family in Wilmington, Delaware. In Italy, a myriad of weighty and urgent issues on the world leader's agenda. At the top of that list, the continuing Russian assault on Ukraine now in its third year. Biden, along with the heads of Italy, the U.K., France, Germany, Canada and Japan, preparing to announce a series of significant joint initiatives. The president pushing for a $50 billion loan program for Ukraine, which would tap into the interest accrued from frozen Russian assets and a new 10 year U.S.-Ukraine security pact. The U.S. also expanding sanctions on Russia, targeting foreign financial institutions supporting the war and Russia's access to critical I.T. technology, software and other equipment. This year's gathering of world leaders kicking off almost exactly three years to the day after Biden's first G7 as president in Cornwall, England. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: The United States is back.

Just one member defecting, that was Republican David Joyce of Ohio.But what we saw in this fight was Republicans demanding that Garland comply with a subpoena, the subpoena demanding audio recordings of an interview that the special counsel Robert Hur did with President Biden over Biden's handling of classified documents. Of course, in that report that Hur released months ago, it details how Joe Biden responded to some questions, questioned about whether Biden could have even been prosecuted over this because he believed the jury would view him as a sympathetic elderly man with a poor memory. Now, there was a transcript that was released that Democrats and the Justice Department believe were sufficient to satisfy Republican demands. But Republicans wanted the audio tapes as well, something Democrats believe would be used for political purposes. The Justice Department contended that releasing that audio tape essentially would impair the ability to go ahead and interview witnesses in separate investigations in the future. Perhaps witnesses would not want to come forward if they were concerned that audio would release publicly or released to Congress. But even as this vote happened today, some Republicans called for prosecution of Merrick Garland, and even some said he should go to prison. REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA): Is Merrick Garland above the law? I mean, I thought the whole argument is that no one is above the law. And now that we've held him in contempt of Congress, he should be prosecuted by the Department of Justice. And he deserves the exact same fate as Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon. REP.

Now, on top of that, the White House has asserted executive privilege on those audio tapes. And the position of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel is that if the president asserts executive privilege and they affirm that it was correct in this regard, that essentially that is the correct position of the executive branch. So this is essentially a dispute between the executive branch and the legislative branch.And ultimately, if this gets resolved, it would have to be by the courts to determine whether Congress has the right to that audio. And if this plays out in the courts, this could take months and months and months to resolve, certainly after the November election. So ultimately, that's how it could play out.

Four Russian Navy vessels, including a nuclear-powered submarine and one of Moscow's most modern warships, have arrived in Havana, Cuba. The deployment may be routine, but the Russian military drills in the region are not common. Details from CNN's Matthew Chance in Moscow.

And the nuclear-powered submarine, the Kazan, the message for many Cubans that Moscow, its Cold War ally, is back. We have historical ties with the former Soviet Union and now with the Russian Federation, says this Havana resident, something that, in my opinion, is very important for the country. I've never seen something like this so close, says another. Such a large ship of that magnitude. I'm very impressed, she adds. But the real message is aimed at Washington. Russian defense officials say the strike group, now just 90 miles off the U.S. coast, has been practicing the use of high-precision missiles against the mock enemy. U.S. officials are downplaying any threat, saying they don't believe the Russian vessels are armed with nuclear weapons. But U.S. officials tell CNN that ships and planes have been deployed to monitor the Russian exercises. And the naval deployment comes at a time of worsening U.S.-Russian relations, just weeks after President Biden greenlighted Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory with U.S.-supplied weapons. With Vladimir Putin warning Russia could arm U.S. enemies in response. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): If the West supplies weapons to the combat zone and calls for their use against our territory, then why shouldn't we mirror these actions? I am not ready to say that we will do it tomorrow, but we, of course, should think about it. CHANCE (voice-over): There's no plan to supply Cuba with the kind of weapons these modern Russian warships usually carry. But the Kremlin could still make trouble in America's backyard.

What's changed in terms of gun policy since then?",

We passed the first federal gun law in 30 years, and we're already seeing the results of that. After the passage of that law, we've seen just recently the FBI came out with a report that said this quarter, this past quarter of 2024 that the murder rate is down over 20 percent in comparison to the year prior.And that law passed after Uvalde also put billions of dollars into mental health programs and also into violence intervention programs aimed at stopping people from wanting to pick up a gun in the first place. Is it enough? Are there still school shootings that happen? Are there still instances of gun violence? Yes, there are. But we have to acknowledge there is progress being made because it's hard, frankly. It's hard to talk about the shooting that doesn't happen. But we know that there have been over 500 people since Uvalde that have not been able to purchase semi-automatic rifles because of the passage of the Safer Communities Act.",

And to me, it brings up questions of how much we can really call ourselves a democracy if when the majority has power, they can't actually use it to pass things.And I would really say, overall, it's not even one policy. It really is just the filibuster being in the way that prevents us from doing things like repealing the immunity protections that the gun industry has through things like PLACA. That stops them from being sued or passing universal background checks or other policies that are supported by the vast majority of the American people. Right. If you have a majority in the Senate, you should be able to pass a bill.",

Just the other day, he was openly talking about the need to ban assault weapons like the ones used in Parkland, Uvalde, Sandy Hook, El Paso, and just so many other countless shootings. And he's boldly leading on it. He's passed, from the best of my knowledge, the most executive actions of any president before to address gun violence.And he also, in collaboration with March for Our Lives and our partners, helped create the Office of Gun Violence Prevention that I spent several years working to create since I was a freshman in college. And in the time since, we've seen that office work to implement pieces of the Safer Communities Act to make sure that states are actually using the money that has been allocated to them to help prevent gun violence. Because it doesn't just matter if you pass a law. It matters how that law is implemented. And we're seeing great progress being made on that.",

This is about trying to make sure that we have as many people like Congressman Maxwell Frost out there as possible, which is why, in addition to what I do with March for Our Lives, I now run a PAC and Super PAC called Leaders We Deserve that helps support young people running for state legislature and Congress.And just recently, our first elected candidate, Darius Clark, was running in the most competitive race in Virginia for the state legislature. He secured that seat with 800 votes. And he won. Democrats got a one-seat majority in that House. I got to go down and lobby and testify in some of these committees. And one of them that our candidate, Darius Clark, chairs is the Public Safety and Guns Committee and Firearms Committee. And I got to see him on the spot because of that one-seat majority, kill a bill to arm teachers, and he introduced a bill to provide tax credits to gun owners for gun safes and gun locks that received wide bipartisan support and actually was signed into law by the Republican governor in Virginia as one of the only pieces of gun safety legislation that actually passed this year.",

We're in the heart of \"FESTA 2024\" with the iconic Olympic rings with the Seoul Olympic Stadium just over my left-hand shoulder. But, you know, Lynda, we're having a fantastic time. We have met people from all over the world who have been here since 3 am to make sure that they had a piece of this.So some people here are going on nearly 15 hours. And people who we've met around the globe, they've, of course, part of the magic of this is exchanging, you know, their love and affection for Jin and BTS. So this is from our new friend from India. She gave us a photo card of her favorite Jin headshots. Jin, very handsome, as well as this is from our new friend from Thailand. She made gourmet cookies in the shape of, I should say, a carbon cookie cutout of the cartoon character that Jin made to help promote his music a little while back. So to give you a sense, Lynda, of what we're looking at, we're going to go over my left-hand shoulder. So this is one of the queues just to get in here, the grounds that are in the shadow of the Olympic Stadium. Again, we're going on nearly 15 hours. And the headline are the people who have gotten the golden Willy Wonka-esque ticket to hug Jin. About a thousand fans in total. Jin is just fresh off military service. So we heard from him yesterday while he was still in his military fatigues, as well as one super fan from Bangkok we ran into just about two, three hours ago. She's elated to be hugging Jin. Listen to what both of them had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JIN, BTS MEMBER (through translator): It was so fun for the last year and six months. It's such a relief. I met so many good people.",

There is one clip which we are getting loaded into our CNN control room of one person trying to kiss Jin on the cheek. Starting to go viral. Jin sort of played it off very well. But there's a concert here at 8 pm and you know, the wider factor as we wrap up, Lynda, for why this matters, K-pop is such a cultural force, a multi-billion dollar soft power industry for Korea. So the fans who we're talking to here, they say Jin, the first member of BTS to come out of compulsory military service because he's the oldest. This is like a new beginning for BTS. The band will be back together by this time next year.So they're seeing this as a new chapter for K-pop music. Certainly a moment where the genre can be supercharged to the elation of fans worldwide, Lynda.",
