Instead, it presents a series of eight options to reduce emissions and askes countries to, quote, contribute to the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.While the agreement leaves open loopholes that will allow the continued use of coal, oil and gas, some climate experts say the mark -- the deal marks the beginning of the end of the fossil fuel era.

But it does leave many loopholes, as you say, allowing countries to continue to exploit fossil fuels, but pushing for things like carbon capture, renewed push on energy transitions through the use of cleaner energy, like solar and other forms of energy.And then here's some live pics in fact as we see the delegates talking at the end of these meetings. Now it was a marathon session of negotiations, Max. The COP president said that it is a historic meeting and that it could turn the page on our efforts to fight the climate crisis. Take a listen.

There was a lot of pushback from nations like Saudi Arabia, the oil giant, but also from countries here in Africa that saw the future of not exploiting their fossil fuel reserves as punishing the countries that have little to do with the climate change crisis.This will be seen as a compromise document. It isn't legally binding and that is worth again mentioning.

And the last time Xi Jinping was in Vietnam was six years ago. So, you know, I think it is fair to say that there was some pressure for him to make his presence known. These nations are neighbors. They are both communists, but there's also some division, especially when it comes to the South China Sea.But as we are hearing from Chinese state media, there is this new positioning of relations, at least that's the term that's being used. [04:45:00] And Xi Jinping was welcomed to Vietnam in grand style. There was a 21- gun salute. We saw children waving flags. There was a military band giving a serenade. So, it was certainly full of the optics that are very important in this part of the world. Xi Jinping met with Vietnam's prime minister. He met with Vietnam's president. They did discuss some of these maritime issues, the South China Sea. In particular, there's an area called the Gulf of Tonkin, which is off the Vietnamese coast. It's a very resource-rich area. The nations agreed to join patrols in that area. They also agreed to set up a hotline if there's any kind of incidents from fishing boats, for example. And then there were other agreements signed. Not necessarily very headline grabbing but it did show that there was an effort of cooperation between the two nations. Also, a lot of discussion between economics. But again, the timing of this likely cannot be ignored. Again, President Biden was just there in the fall. We now have President Xi who has been making his presence on the world stage much more visible lately. We saw him at the APEC Summit in San Francisco just last month. So, he is certainly trying to produced this idea of a new world order and an alternative to the West. And so, Max, in many ways, this visit to Vietnam falls in line with President Xi Jinping's broader goals, broader expectations.",
