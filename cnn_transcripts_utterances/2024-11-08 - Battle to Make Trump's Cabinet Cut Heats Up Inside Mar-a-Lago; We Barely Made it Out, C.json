Not a state he needed to win the presidency, obviously, but this morning, it is further evidence of how broad and decisive Trump's election victory is. He is now one state away to winning all seven battleground states. Arizona is now the only state yet to be called. And this hour, Donald Trump leads Kamala Harris there by over 155,000 votes.While those votes continue to be counted, the focus of Trump's transition is centered squarely at his Mar-a-Lago home, lots of jockeying to make the cut for White House or administration top job going on. And with Donald Trump making his first job announcement, naming his top political aide, Susie Wiles, as his White House chief of staff. She will be the first woman to ever hold that post. Alayna Treene is in Florida for us with much more on this. And, Alayna, what should people know about Susie Wiles and also what her pick means potentially for how the White House is going to operate this time around?",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, I mean, chief of staff was always going to be the first announcement he made, and it is a massive deal, of course, but particularly when you know about how Donald Trump operates and how he ran the White House the first time around. You know, some chiefs of staff did not have as much power as they had in the past, but I think with Susie Wiles out the helm, it does show that she's going to have a very big role in whatever happens moving forward with regard to the transition and to operations overall.Now, one key thing to keep in mind about Wiles is that she has been incredibly loyal to Donald Trump. Of course, loyalty is one of the things that Donald Trump values ,ost in the people he surrounds himself with. And, really, she stuck by him ever since he left the White House in disgrace, really, and throughout. And one thing that I consistently hear from the people who work with him, but also people outside of Trump's inner orbit outside of really the MAGA politics, is that she is respected. And that's a very. Hard thing to do, particularly when it comes to people who are operating at such a powerful position within Trump's world is to gain the respect of those beneath you. And so that was a huge contributing factor to this as well. Now, one key thing I think that says a lot about how Wiles is going to kind of run the White House and run operations come January 20th is what we heard, what Steve Contorno had heard from someone who told him that she had reservations before taking this role. This is what they told him. They said, quote, the clown car can't come into the White House at will, and he agrees with her. Now, the reason I think this is so important is because one of the things that Susie Wiles had always done very well is she recognized she can't control Donald Trump himself, but she could control what was happening around him, particularly the access to him and trying to cut off access from very controversial figures. I'll remind you, back in 2016 and throughout his time in the White House, Donald Trump had a flurry of people calling him up, parading in to the White House, talking to him at Mar-a-Lago. That is still happening. But what Susie Wiles has been able to do is try and control that. And I think that's going to be a very big part of what she does come next year.",

I can tell you that Donald Trump is not immune from that. He is very aware of what is happening. But when I've talked to people close to him who are spending the days with him at his resort, they say that it's very clear that Donald Trump, of course, is reveling in his victory. He's very much loving taking these calls from world leaders and CEOs and them trying to get close to him already, beginning to plant the seeds of how their relationship could be moving forward.But one thing that I do think that's been fascinating to hear, and I've heard this from a ton of his top advisors, is that they argue that he is much more self-assured and confident in what he is doing this time around, particularly, of course, the people who were with him in the aftermath of 2016. They say that unlike before, where Donald Trump really relied on other people, he felt like other people made decisions for him because he was so unfamiliar with the with D.C. He feels far more confident now in making those decisions himself. He is very involved in this process. And they argue that's due to the fact that he has won the popular vote. Kate?",

This was a unanimous decision. Rates are not low. They're still kind of high, at almost 5 percent but moving in the right direction. So, this is good news for borrowers, especially people who are struggling to pay off credit card debt because we have seen credit card rates come down. It's good news if you're trying to get a car loan, a home equity loan.What's interesting though is that mortgage rates have not come down, right? Mortgage rates are actually controlled by the bond market, not as much by the Fed. And as you can see on that chart, even since the Fed has started to cut interest rates, we've actually seen mortgage rates go the other direction from just over 6 percent to nearly 7 percent. Of course, that is very frustrating, and that's because the bond market is getting more optimistic about the economy, pricing in a soft landing, not a recession, also because there is some growing nervousness about the potential for the incoming Trump administration to add trillions of dollars to the national debt. Now, the Fed has signaled they're not done cutting interest rates, but there is some growing uncertainty about how many more rate cuts there will be.",

Because, remember, mainstream economists have warned that the Trump economic agenda could be inflationary, perhaps very inflationary, mass deportations, tax cuts, and, yes, this very aggressive trade agenda. I mean, Trump has called for 10 to 20 percent tariffs on all $3 trillion of U. S imports, 60 percent tariffs on China. There's some research out there that these tariffs could hit cost the average American family $2,600 a year in extra cost.But Powell, he would not take the bait. He stressed again and again that the Fed would wait until policies are actually implemented. At one point he said, we don't guess, we don't speculate, we don't assume. And that makes sense because the Fed doesn't know what the president-elect is going to do. I don't think the president elect knows either because he just got elected. One person who might know is Steve Mnuchin. Jake Tapper asked the former Trump treasury secretary yesterday about this issue of tariffs and inflation. And Mnuchin told Tapper that he thinks that Trump will be very careful not to reignite inflation. One other point here is Powell was asked about what would happen if Trump told him to step down. He was asked about this during the press conference. Take a listen to that exchange. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
