At best, her doctors say her child is unlikely to live more than a few days outside the womb.And, she says, continuing the pregnancy is putting her own life at risk. That's why she now says that she is looking -- and why she is now looking to the court for help. She's 20 weeks pregnant and living in a state with a near-total ban on abortions. CNN's Whitney Wild joins us now. She's got more on this. Whitney, what more are you learning about this lawsuit?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, basically the crux of the lawsuit is that if she carries this pregnancy to term, she risks her own life or a possible catastrophic injury to her that would cause irreparable physical damage moving forward. And that, she says is actually one of the bars for the Texas abortion ban. So, the Texas abortion ban is banning abortions after six weeks unless there is risk to the life of the mother or a chance that carrying a pregnancy to term would cause irreversible physical damage to that person that would impair them long term. So, she says that she does qualify. However, she points out that that law is really vague. So, at this point, there was major concern among her doctors as well as her husband that if she goes through with an abortion, they face a legal risk because that's what the Texas law allows. It allows people to bring cases against other people who facilitate abortions.So, here's what's going on. Again, as you point out, she's 20 weeks. She's had these very severe complications. She's been to the emergency room three times with severe cramping with unidentifiable fluid leaks. This is she believes largely a result of her infant being diagnosed with an extra chromosome -- an extra 18th chromosome This is called Edwards syndrome. We have a graphic here that takes us through some of the facts of that. This is a very severe genetic condition. It caused -- it's caused, again by an extra chromosome 18. And at least 95 percent of cases, fetuses don't survive the full term. So, this is -- again, she believes that if she carries his baby to term, either the -- she's going to have to go through the absolute agony of her own very severe medical injury, the death of the baby in utero, or have to watch the baby die after it's born. Again, Kate, this is certainly a case to watch because it is the first that we know of where someone is trying to get a basically a court order to allow for an abortion. So, certainly, again a case to watch, Kate.",
