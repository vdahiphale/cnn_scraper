He took his religion for what it actually said and what he should actually do, and it's a good time in our country for us to remember somebody like that.(END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, it's a tremendously emotional time for many Americans.Right now, what is happening is the departure ceremony. So, this is here at the Carter Center. This is primarily Carter Center employees, many of whom the family has been connected to for several decades. What's going to happen is it's going to move -- the casket, it's going to move to Dobbins Air Reserve Base. From there they will arrive at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland. And then from there they are going to the Navy Memorial. President Carter, of course, served in the United States Navy. And Erica, what will happen after that is truly symbolic. What we're going to see is a horse-drawn casket go the very same route that President Carter did when he was President several decades ago, and make that very same journey that he did. He was among the first presidents to get out and walk in that inaugural route. We're going to see him take that journey today along with his family.",

I was struck by my colleague Eva McKend, who has been there at the Carter Center, speaking with a number of people who had come to pay their respects, said she was struck by the number of people who cited his connection to faith and how that allowed them to feel more connected to him. One woman, Eva just noting, had talked about how for him his religion was the religion that this woman felt she had grown up with it. It was not something that was worn on his sleeve. It was simply a part of who he was, and that was truly at the core of who Jimmy Carter was, Barbara.",

Now, some people didn't care for that, didn't like his authenticity, but there it was, and it's a big difference between, for example, John Kennedy, who felt that he had to make his Catholicism completely private so it wouldn't be used against him in 1960 when he was running for President. But, Jimmy Carter, again, as a contrast to the line and the deceitfulness and the scandals of Watergate, could say, I'm a born again Christian, and I live my faith, and therefore I will never lie to you, and that made it more genuine to the American people and why they voted him into office in 1976 and how he got the nomination in 1976 against a very strong field of Democratic hopefuls.",

It was so cold, the Potomac River froze over. So, I bundled up, and it was the last time that the inauguration was on the east side of the Capitol, facing the Supreme Court building. Reagan, in 1981, moved it to the other side of the Capitol, towards the mall. So, my friend and I, at the inauguration, had to run around the other side of the Capitol, and we just thought we would see the President and the new First Lady in a limousine, and we suddenly saw them get out and start walking hand in hand down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House.And I can also remember hearing the recordings of Walter Cronkite saying, he is getting out of the car. Oh my goodness, he is getting out of the car. It was something different, and that too was a symbol that he was going to have a different presidency, and he was going to be a man of the people.",

She didn't participate, as she pointed out, but she said he'd come back to the residence every night, and I'd say, Why did you make that decision, or why did you do that today? And he said, well, if you want to know how I make decisions and why I do the things I do, come to the cabinet meetings. So, she did.

And so, I've been struck by the fact that, in addition to saying he is the best ex-President we ever had, and moreover, he created the model of the modern post-presidency through the Carter Center, but that people have gone back in the light of history.

Like, let's remember, during the time when President Obama was in office, moving Obamacare and signing that into law was a gargantuan task. And here, look, even though the President has broad support, arguably stronger support among Republicans than we've seen in the last few Republican presidents, there are still Republicans in swing districts who are very concerned about their re-election prospects and will be hesitant about some of the aspects of a large package like he is proposing.So, it's unusual that there is this much disagreement between the incoming administration and rank and file Republicans in Washington on this idea.",

He is a Founder and Chairman of DAMAC Properties, Hussain Sajwani, very respected gentleman, and I'm thrilled to announce today that DAMAC will be investing at least $20 billion over a very short period of time into the United States, and they may go double, or even somewhat more than double that amount of money. It's a great thing, and I believe he will say that he is doing it because of the fact that he was very inspired by the election. They wouldn't do it without that election. I can tell you, a lot of people wouldn't. You saw last week where we have somebody who is going to go from $100 billion to $200 billion, and we have many other people, and we'll be bringing some of them out. Some of them like to do it somewhat more quietly, and some don't, and they feel so strongly about the country that they want to let people know about it. But, it's an honor to have such a great investor investing in our country. The investment will support massive new data centers across the Midwest, the Sun Belt area, and also to keep America on the cutting edge of technology and artificial intelligence. He is very big into the data centers, and that's going to be a very hot item in the coming years, as you know, with AI in particular. The first phase of the project will be in Texas, Arizona, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan and Indiana, those places. And Hussain, I'd love you to come up and say a few words.

Giving the Panama Canal is why Jimmy Carter lost the election, in my opinion, more so maybe than the hostages. The hostages were a big deal. But, if you remember, nobody wants to talk about the Panama Canal now, because it's inappropriate, I guess, but because it's a bad part of the Carter legacy. But, he was a good man. Look, he was a good man. I knew him a little bit, and he was a very fine person, but that was a big mistake. Giving the Panama Canal to Panama was a very big mistake. We lost 38,000 people.
