And these warnings or watches or advisories that are put out aren't put out because the temperatures are going to be summer-type warm. You have to be a threshold above that to get these warnings out there. So above where you should be across the Gulf coast, certainly above with the excessive heat warnings out in the southwest.We are going to see significant thunderstorms fire up along the Gulf coast today. If you're having a beach day today, watch out for lightning, in the heat of the day. Certainly, that is going to be a likelihood, not a possibility, but a probability. Think of Vegas, all the way to 115 later this afternoon. I know they say dry heat and all that, but it's very hot. Above temperatures for the next couple of days and really for the next couple of weeks here. Chicago, you finally get back into the act. It's been a beautiful couple of weeks, also even for Buffalo and New York City. Temperatures have been below normal in some spots, but that will change as the heat moves off toward the east and to the northeast. Could see some big storms along the coast today, likely even with the possibility with not only lightning but thunder of course, and hail, and even some gusty winds. Look at the nice temperatures across the east. Just across the deep south, that's where the weather has been just the worst we've seen. So yes, we are going to see the heat, it is going to spread out a little bit. But places that are hot are absolutely going to stay hot. I don't see temperatures going down below 110 for highs in Phoenix, until we get what's called monsoon. Monsoon is when the humidity comes, when it is no longer a dry heat, in Arizona, New Mexico, Vegas. That's when you get the thunderstorms to pop up in the heat of the day. That's when you get the relief. But before you get that monsoon, before you get those thunderstorms, those are the hottest days of the year. And that's where we are right now.",

We're really going to see an acceleration of tree planting in Phoenix and other cities all across the country. The federal government has really stepping up their commitment to this topic. We're excited to get those resources in the ground.But we also need to be thinking about indoor spaces, how can we weatherize as many homes as possible, make energy as affordable as possible for the people who need it. As we talked about before, air conditioning is such a critical lifeline, so it's attention to the outdoor space, the built environment, how we're using cool materials and cool technologies, but also how we can keep people safe in their homes, in their workplaces where they spend a lot of their time.",

      "sentences": "Hey, guys. Good morning to you.So there are a couple of reasons why investigators, since last spring, have been working under this theory that the suspected serial killer Rex Heuermann may have committed those killings at his home on Long Island. This according to information from a source close to the investigation. For starters, they have confirmed that Heuermann's wife was not actually at home at or about the time that these murders were committed. And this certainly goes with what the district attorney told me last week, that they were able to confirm, through phone and travel records, that she was actually out of town at the time. But secondly, and this is just fascinating, they are also using the victims' own cell phone data, mainly the cell phone towers where it pinged. And they were able to essentially retrace the victims' steps, according to investigators. And that cell phone tower data tells them that all or some of the victims were making their way to the suspect's home in Massapequa Park, Long Island. So when you look back at all of this data, it essentially tells investigators, at this point, that those victims were pretty much lured to their deaths at that home. Again, this is still very much a working theory, very much an ongoing investigation. You see investigators there at the home earlier this week, they are still there eight days into this investigation. The reason why this is taking so long is investigators look through the evidence at the suspect's home. They're looking inch by inch, making sure that they do not miss anything, mainly looking for any sort of trace evidence, DNA evidence as well. Amara and Victor, when you look at that case, it is very clear that DNA evidence has been really one of the most compelling pieces of the case from the prosecution of this.",

It's almost like they just become another person. This serial killer, to another named Dennis Rader, who actually gave himself a name, Bind, Torture, Kill, he was similar to this. John Wayne Gacy killed people in his own home. Jeffrey Dahmer killed people in his apartment. So it is not uncommon at all. Serial killers operate in a comfort zone. They like being in control.

Trump's defense pushed for it until after the 2024 election. Judge Aileen Cannon landing somewhere in the middle. What are your thoughts? NICK AKERMAN, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: I think it was probably, Judge Cannon's decision was really based on a speedy trial and what was realistic. The problem with the government's December request was that at oral argument, they basically conceded that the December date was aspirational. And I think what Judge Cannon did was simply look at all of the milestones that the government set up in its initial request and looked at it from a realistic standpoint. And I think realistically, this case will go to trial in May. There is no reason why at that point the motions can't be decided, the documents already have been produced, for the most part.

There is not a single lyric in the song that references race or points to it.\" Aldean goes on to say, \"There isn't a single video clip that isn't real news footage.\" But CNN's analysis found that some of the footage is from incidents in Canada that happened more than a decade ago. CNN has reached out to Aldean's record label, BBR Music Group, but has not received a reply. Joining us to talk about it is Chris Willman, senior music writer and chief music critic at \"Variety.\" His latest article on this is titled \"Jason Aldean already had the most contemptible country song of the decade. The video is worse.\" Good to have you with us. Let me read a couple of lyrics here. The song starts out, \"Sucker punch somebody on the sidewalk, carjack an old lady at a red light, pull the gun on the owner of a liquor store.\" Then he goes on to say, \"Try that in small town, see how far you make it down the road. Around here, we take care of our own. You cross that line it won't take long for your to find out. I recommend you don't.\" What is the message of this song?",

      "sentences": "Well, it is a very confused message, I think, between the lyrics and the video, and that's where Aldean gets a little bit of plausible deniability in saying, well, I never mentioned race. Obviously, there is nothing explicitly about lynching in the song.But originally, the song is just kind of -- it is very lazily written. It's kind of a laundry list of things you wouldn't want to happen in a small town, starting with carjackings, sucker punching cops, and then graduating to flag burning, and things like that. And so it is just kind of like a random list of city slicker ills that are imagined that are going to have to be dealt with, with a beating or worse if someone comes to town. The video compounded it by making it all about demonstrators, which the song itself really isn't, except for the mention of flag burning, which is very retro, 1980s, 90s, concern. But then you have all this footage projected on the courthouse, where, as you say, that person was lynched. What I think would appear to the viewer to be assumed to be Black Lives Matter demonstrations, even if it was shot in Canada and had nothing to do with that. And so the message that comes through in end with the video, I think, is that we'll deal with demonstrators, even if they are exercising their First Amendment right, the same way we deal with somebody who robs a liquor store or carjacks somebody, as we see in the video. It is all the same to us. It will be met with vigilante justice.",

This is the Maury County Courthouse, the backdrop of the performance in the video, 1927, Henry Choate, 18 years old, was accused of assaulting a white woman. He was stolen by a white mob and then lynched there. \"Try This In a Small Town,\" this isn't Jason Aldean's small town. He didn't grow up in Columbia, where this is, in Maury County.

And he says he doesn't, and we've read what he says about this video. The song appears to be a hit, though. You report on how many pickups it is getting on country music radio. What can you tell us about the popularity of the song? WILLMANcountry music for 25 years, and I have never seen anything this divisive in the community since the Dixie Chicks controversy in 2003. But in that case, the Dixie Chicks were pilloried, basically run off of radio. In this case, we're seeing the opposite, of the audience is standing behind him, certainly his audience. I'm sure that radio stations are being beset with requests to stands behind him and increase the air play. Whether that will happen, I don't know, because I think that even country radio worries about alienating a part of its audience, and certainly there's a large part of the country audience that is alienated by this. The national industry is not excited about something that is divisive at a time when they want to expand the audience. But there are a lot of radio stations that are going to see this as something that has gone viral, that is their ticket to getting more listeners on air plays. So it's really going to be interesting to see how it plays out on the charts after this really immediate boost.",

For the 14 of the 23 women on this roster who are World Cup rookies, it was an incredible moment to take the baton from the women who have multiple World Cup appearances and trophies, and it is really similar to how that torch was passed from Mia Hamm's generation of players to the likes of Megan Rapinoe, today's titan of the sport. It's part of the U.S. team's winning, and they were dominant in the three-nil win. Sophia Smith making her World Cup debut, driving the ball in the back of the net to open the scoring in the 14th minute. She is a superstar. She wasn't even done. Striking again deep in the stoppage time at the end of the first half for her second goal of the game. And at just under 23 years old, she is now the second youngest player in U.S. women's team history to score multiple goals in a World Cup game.You did have the veteran Megan Rapinoe making a little history of her own, in her final and fourth World Cup, coming in as a substitute in the second half for her 200th appearance for team USA. Incredible. Captain Lindsay Horan added a goal of her own in the 77th minute to officially put this one away.
