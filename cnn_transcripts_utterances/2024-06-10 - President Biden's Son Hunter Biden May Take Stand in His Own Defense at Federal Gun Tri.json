There's going to have obviously a full courtroom right now with family members offering his support -- offering their support. Rather.The defense has raised the prospect that Hunter Biden could testify on his own defense, but this is a risky proposition for this defense. The prosecution has already warned essentially that if he takes the stand, they're going to bring up a number of things, including his Navy discharge allegedly for testing positive for drugs about a decade ago as well as his tax charges, and the fact that he had admitted guilt as part of a plea agreement that fell apart spectacularly last summer here in this very courtroom. The defense wants to argue, in part, that he has been sober since 2019, and so that's part of what they would like to bring to the jury. Now, again, it's very, at this point, unlikely that this will happen. The risks are very high for Hunter Biden if he takes the stand. But he has been very, very forceful in trying to do a very public defense of himself over the last few months against Republicans, and there is some feeling around him that he believes he is his best advocate.

What you always want to do as a defense attorney is prepare your client for that eventuality. How? Asking them questions, furthering your narrative. And then you moot them by cross-examining them, giving them the pressure of what it would be like in the courtroom.But here's the problem -- number one, when you look to doing your case as the defense, the first thing you look for is raising the specter of reasonable doubt. The case becomes without your client testifying, have you raised that spectrum? You have to examine here, have they done that? The defense has shed a lot of light on at the time of this this purchase. Was he addicted then? Was evidence presented to the court and to that jury with respect to what he was doing at that time? Yes, prosecutors have shown that he was addicted in general. Have they shown he was addicted then? The other issue is you're then attacked in cross-examination with collateral issues. What am I speaking of? It's not so much that he cannot, that is, Hunter Biden get on the stand and advance his narrative with respect to addiction, advance his narrative with respect to the dark moments. But then you're cross-examined, not only factually with respect to what the case is about, what you were doing, who you were doing it with, the drugs you were having, you were ruining peoples lives, but other issues. You heard Evan Perez speak to the issue of when he was in the military. A discharge, what does that have to do with it? It goes to your credibility. It's just not an advisable thing. It changes the equation, puts too much focus on him. And then, final point, John, it then opens up this other pandora's box. What pandora's box? If you testify, guess what? Prosecutors say, judge, I'd like to rebut that testimony. We're going to bring more witnesses. And it just gets too messy. Leave it where it is. I think the defense has done a lot with respect to reasonable doubt. Make your arguments to the jury, but then again, John, expect the unexpected.",

The defense is trying to really narrow the timeframe, saying prosecutors, you've shown our client was drug-addicted for sure. I think the defense will also say you're shaming him as a result of that. Why are we shaming an addict? Shouldn't we be uplifting, getting people help? Are we really dragging people into court to humiliate them based upon this? The defense is saying in the 11 days that he owned that weapon, haveyou demonstrated then that he's been on drugs? Don't tell me about text messages about him sleeping on cars a day, after another text that he sent with respect to him using. Show me someone who saw him using drug. Can you do that, prosecutors? And if you don't, the defense will say it's not enough. The other issue, John, you know, trust me, because I don't know what I was doing at the time.

If you're going to travel, and by the way, if you're a presidential candidate, you're going to travel. You need the permission your probation officer. And number two, I don't live in New York. I mean, I have a building here in an apartment, but I'm a Florida resident. Can I get my case transferred to Florida? I think that's going to be likely request. And the answer is it can happen. One probation, one state's probation can transfer to another state for supervision if that's where the person lives. And then there will be some administrative stuff such as he's a convicted felon in New York state. They're going to ask him for his DNA and he's going to have to give that. They can do other things like unannounced home visits to check on his living conditions. That probably would be unlikely in this case, but the rules will be the same for him as anyone else.",

He will soon head to Israel to meet with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and also expected to be meeting with Benny Gantz, who just resigned from Israel's War Cabinet in protest of how Netanyahu is handling the war. Now this happened after the dramatic rescue operations Saturday that brought home four Israeli hostages after eight months in captivity in Gaza. CNN political and global affairs analyst, Barak Ravid joins us now. He also is, of course, a political and foreign policy reporter with AXIOS. Barak, it is great to see you.

      "sentences": "Hi, Kate.I think what we learned by what the hostages have been saying during that weekend since they were rescued, is that once again, there is a very different MO that Hamas has in different cases of different hostages. Some of them are in the tunnels, some of them are in houses of families who are affiliated with Hamas, with Hamas guards. And according to the place that those hostages were being held, they get different treatment and for example, Noa Argamani was held hostage and rescued, said that she was held with a family that had quite a lot of money, so the conditions were better than other hostages. And this family used her as a cleaning lady and told her to clean the house, to clean dishes, to make food, which is something that we haven't heard from other hostages. [08:20:00]   BOLDUAN:   And I want to ask you about Tony Blinken and what his mission now is as he is going to be landing because this is where kind of all of the focus will be quickly shifting. But also even before that Jake Sullivan, Biden's National Security adviser has been on since the operation and asked what the impact of the rescue operation would have on the hostage and ceasefire negotiations. He basically said it is hard to say. They haven't heard yet from Hamas and he doesn't know. What are you hearing about this?",

There is nothing to talk about and that's it. It did not say this in this case. So I think this is one interesting point.Another interesting point is that three of the hostages who were rescued, were men who are supposed to be released in a second phase of that deal in return for a big number of Palestinian prisoners who are serving life sentences. The fact that they were rescued took a lot of leverage from Hamas and was a big loss Yahya Sinwar because a lot of those prisoners that he wanted to release are people that he worked with together in prison. So I think the message that Hamas gets out of this operation also is that every day that passes, it could lose even more leverage. And therefore, maybe now could be a good time to cut a deal.",

So they got twice as much, the far-right, than the president's party and of as you mentioned, he came out and he immediately called for snap parliamentary elections. So he is not putting himself up for election there, but it is the Parliament that is going to be up for election, and that is really soon, that's on June 30th where Emmanuel Macron is hoping that if there is a national election, not as many people will vote far-right. But of course, it is a huge gamble and certainly also a big issue for Europe. And here in Germany, it is exactly the same thing. You have the right- wing AFD that got about 16 -- almost 16 percent of the vote, also more than the party of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. And there are a couple of trends that I think are really fascinating about all of this. First of all, in the former communist east of Germany, the far-right party called the AFD, is by far the strongest political force, but also a lot of young people voted for the far- right parties, and that is certainly something that is of grave concern here in Europe, of course, as far as a lot of foreign policy issues and relations with the US are concerned as well -- John.",
