Women can continue to take it up to 10 weeks pregnant. They can continue to receive it by mail and via telehealth visits with their health care providers. And the generic version will remain widely available. So this is exactly what the Biden administration and the FDA, what they were asking for. They warned that, if there were restrictions imposed on this drug, that there would just be confusion and chaos. So now this chaos is being averted. So the question is, where does this go from here? The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals will be hearing arguments on the underlying issue in this case. And that is whether the FDA properly approved mifepristone in 2000. The first briefings in this appeal actually must be filed the 5th Circuit next week. And the case will be fast tracked with these arguments set for less than a month from now on May 17th. But really, regardless what the 5th Circuit decides, any possible changes to this drug are being put on hold indefinitely by the Supreme Court decision, so women can continue to fully access mifepristone until the Supreme Court acts again at some point, which wouldn't be for months, if at all -- Jessica Schneider, CNN, Washington.

But on the other hand not that much to do with abortion in the sense that we're talking about whether or not a single federal judge has the power to undermine what an executive agency -- here the FDA -- did, again, almost a quarter century ago.

That's the second drug. Now misoprostol can be used on its own for miscarriages and abortions but studies show that it doesn't work as well. It's not as effective and there can be more complications and more side effects. And so doctors I've been talking to over the past two weeks have said, look, why should I be giving my patients a treatment that we know isn't as good?

Robert Singletary appeared in court on Florida Friday, a day after he was apprehended. It's not clear when he will be returned to North Carolina. He's accused of shooting a 6 year old girl and her parents after abasketball rolled into his yard. The girl and her mother had only minor injuries but her father was hospitalized in serious condition. And in southeast Washington, D.C., police say seven people were shot and wounded Friday night. Most of the 49 guns belonging to the shooter in the 2017 Las Vegas massacre have now been destroyed. An anonymous donor gave more than $60,000 to cover the value of the weapons in his arsenal on the condition they be demolished; 13 have been retained by the FBI. Stephen Paddock killed 61 people attending a country music festival when he opened fire from his room at the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas. Paddock shot himself before police could reach him. The liquidation of his estate generated more than $1 million and that money will be distributed to survivors of the victims who died. A manhunt is underway in South Africa, as police search for one of the suspects in a deadly mass shooting. Authorities say gunmen stormed a homestead in the eastern part of the country and killed 10 members of the same family. CNN's David McKenzie has the latest now from Johannesburg. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

An entire family, say police, were killed; 10 people in that shooting, the youngest being a 13 year old boy; the oldest, according to police, over 60. The police minister said that the quick work of community members to give a tipoff to police led them to several suspects they think may be linked to the shootings. They killed one in a action against the police or in their firing between the police and the suspects and they managed to arrest two. One got away. It's unclear what the motive of the shooting is and, in South Africa, there have been several shootings like this or similar to this in recent months, both in that province and other provinces. I have to say, in recent reporting across the country and particularly in Johannesburg, where I am based, there has been a sense by community members that they feel the police cannot help them in many instances with the levels of violent crime in this country, particularly with the resources that the police have. The leadership of the police, again on Friday, said that they are doing their best and are looking to increase resources. But the murder rates in South Africa in last year was extremely high, more than 25,000 people in murders that the police know about. This is in a country already dealing with high levels of violent crime -- David McKenzie, CNN, Johannesburg. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And one of the funnels did just that and then dissipated. The other waterspout was seen churning offshore before it, too, dissipated. There's growing concern that the Upper Midwest could see major flooding next week as several rivers continue to rise. The National Weather Service says, right now, 10 river gauges are measuring at major flood stage and another 43 are at moderate flood stage. River flooding is fairly common in Minnesota and the Dakotas in the spring as temperatures rise and snow melts. But because of record breaking snow over the winter, flooding is expected to be severe in the coming days and weeks. In parts of Illinois, the Mississippi River is rising and already moving into people's homes and businesses, flooding garages and exterior stairwells. According to the National Weather Service, the river levels are at moderate flood stage there and could reach major flood stage next week.
