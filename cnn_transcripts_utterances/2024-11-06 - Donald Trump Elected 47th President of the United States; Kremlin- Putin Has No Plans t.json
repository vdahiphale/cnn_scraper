You see the Blue Wall states. They're currently red. You see the Sun Belt states in the Southeast, they're red. What about the Southwest? They're red, as well. But dig a little bit deeper here to get a sense of how Donald Trump is doing across the country. Every county you see highlighted right here is a county that Donald Trump is doing better than he did in 2020 by three percentage points or more. And you realize, it's not just in the Southeast. There are a bunch of them in North Carolina and in Georgia, not just in the Blue Wall. There are a handful of them throughout those three states. But across the country, from the Northeast, we've seen states that normally would not be even close to being late calls, like New Jersey or like Illinois, that kind of continued to push out throughout the night. Now, the Western vote is still coming in. We'll have to see how that settles, particularly in California. But across the country, in places that we don't consider battlegrounds, Donald Trump overperforming. What do I mean by that? Well, where's he overperforming in terms of the actual states themselves? Overperforming in Texas, overperforming in Illinois, overperforming dramatically to the extent Florida even was remembered as a bellwether, gone at this point in time. But also in the Northeast, as well. It's not just a seven-battleground story. It's not just overperformance in the Blue Wall. It's overperformance across the board.",

You see the margin here in Chicago, 61.8 to 37 percent. You say that's a pretty big margin. There's still vote outstanding: about 12 percent of the vote is outstanding.

Let's look at some of the counties that he's overperforming here.If you talk to people who were on the Biden campaign, the key back in 2020 was not just running up huge vote in the Atlanta suburbs, in Cobb and Gwinnett. Or in the collar counties here in these suburbs outside of Philadelphia County. It was holding Donald Trump's margins down in this area right here. And what Donald Trump was able to do was not just match his 2016 margins; do better than he did in 2020, but in places like Luzerne County, where obviously, he had been in Wilkes-Barre, just a couple of days ago, I think, about a week ago, where in 2020, he won this county by 14.4 points. All that talk about running up the margins: bumping it up by three points. When you're bumping up your stronghold counties by two, three, and four points and, at the same time, the Harris campaign is unable to run up their margin in a place like Philadelphia. What happened in 2020? Joe Biden was at 81. Currently, Harris is at 28 -- or 78. We'll see where that comes in. But also right here, Bucks County, one of the collar counties, by far, the swingiest of the collar counties. Joe Biden was able to win it by about 4 and a half points.

Clark County was what Democrats had to have from a 7-10-point cushion in this Democratic county to offset whatever the Republican was doing in the rural counties and potentially the swingier county in Washoe. This margin is a yikes for Democrats. And it's been trending in this direction over the court of the last couple of cycles. But back in 2020, Joe Biden was able to win it by just shy of 10. Back in 2016, a little bit closer for Clinton. They were still able to pull it off. Back in 2012, 15, 16 points. Clark has been trending, particularly because of the Hispanic population, Donald Trump's inroads in that, as Harry can tell you at length. It is dramatic when you look at the exits right now.

Look at this: Donald Trump getting North of 20 percent of the vote with black voters in the Badger State. Four years ago, he was South of 10 percent. So, he's doing more than twice better than he did four years ago. But it's not just among black voters. How about voters under the age of 30, traditionally a Democratic bastion of votes, especially with the University of Wisconsin education system. Look here. It's a tie. It's a tie among voters under the age of 30 in Wisconsin. I never thought I'd see the day. Closely related, how about first-time voters in the Badger State? What are we seeing there? Look at this: Donald Trump leading, leading among first-time voters, leading by 17 points going away. Joe Biden won this group rather easily back in 2020. The bottom line is this: Wisconsin is something that we've seen throughout the entire nation. It's representative of the nation as a whole. If 2016 was the story of Donald Trump and white working-class voters, this, 2024, is about going into Democratic strongholds and taking those votes away and putting up historic numbers among those groups, John Berman.",

Except somebody like Donald Trump.And I think one of the things that's really important to keep in mind is that Trump essentially was a pariah in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 election. A lot of Republicans had the pandemic heavy on their mind. They felt like he had mishandled it. They felt like they [SIC] had cost them a lot. They also had January 6th on their mind, and they're looking at this man, and they're saying, We want nothing to do with him. Elon Musk, who's now up on-stage with him celebrating, says in 2022, Donald Trump should just fade off into obscurity. He should go live a nice life. But what we know is that that's not Donald Trump. And that one of the things that has emerged about Donald Trump that is radically different from any other president that we've seen, except Grover Cleveland, in fact, is that he has taken a very active interest in how the party -- how the party moves forward. And in fact, we've seen him, even in moments where -- where Republicans said, you know, he's -- he's not in favor. He's not, you know -- he's not in vogue, we saw that he had a lot to say and that his popularity only started to rise the more that we saw him engage in these things that we, that Republicans might call prosecutions or persecutions. So, as that started to change, it meant that the nature of Donald Trump's candidacy and his potential change.

And we're going to talk about the party's realigning. But I think it's even much bigger than that. I think that what we saw happen just in the past few hours is going to have great consequences, you know, not only in the near term but in the far term, right? If you look in the near-term right now, no more prosecutions against him. The J-6 defendants are -- are going to be pardoned. But let's even go beyond that, right? You're talking about Republicans possibly controlling every lever of government in Washington, D.C., from the Supreme Court, potentially through the House, certainly in the Senate, and now at the White House, as well. And then if you just even go even bigger than that, what is the Democratic Party going to do? Who is the Democratic leader? Right now, the only person that I can see who can lead the Democratic Party, certainly in the near-term, who has the power to do so, is going to be Chuck Schumer in -- in the U.S. Senate. But he's certainly not going to be the nominee for the Democrats in 2028. So, let's assume that that primary has already started, if it hadn't started before. And the very last thing that I think this is why Donald Trump won the election, is that the war, the cultural war that we saw on \"woke\" culture and the backlash we've seen against that, I think we're going to see a, quote unquote, \"realignment\" on what the definition of \"woke\" is.",

I'll tell you one other person who I think is going to be incredibly important; actually, two other people. The first person is Bernie Sanders. One of the things that Bernie Sanders has been saying, since at least 2014, has been about how the Democratic Party, if it wants to keep these coalitions, needs to talk about bread-and-butter issues. It needs to talk about politics. A lot of people attacked him for that, saying, well, are you saying that cultural politics don't matter? that's not what he was saying. He was saying we need to focus on these things. The other person is Stacey Abrams. We have not heard a lot from Stacey Abrams in this election cycle. But her organizations, particular Fair Fight, the New Georgia Voter Project, and other organizations, were instrumental in pulling together coalitions that ended up winning Joe Biden Georgia in 2020, but also Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.",

Now, Peskov was pressed by the journalists on his daily press briefing phone call, well, isn't this going to put you in a bad and worse position with the United States? Because it's very clear the implication and the question that President Trump likes to get these congratulations early. We've heard from the British just earlier today. We've heard from many European leaders earlier today, congratulating President-elect Donald Trump. And Peskov's answer was this. And he said, look, the relationship is really bad. How can it get any worse than it is already? And this is clearly a reference to something else that Peskov talked about in that phone -- in that phone call with journalists, saying that the United States is in a position to end the war in Ukraine; where Russia considers itself to be, essentially, in a war confronted by the United States, involving the United States. So, the Kremlin's position on this, I think, gives us a hint about what -- about what Donald Trump has spoken about previously, about ending the war in Ukraine in a matter of a day.

He was going to let him do as he pleases in the Middle East.

But bomb threats coming in, in Georgia, that we -- that the secretary state said emanated from Russia. So, you saw that play a role.But the war in Gaza played a more looming role, I think, particularly in a state like Michigan. You saw in Dearborn, for example, certain precincts. There are precincts in Dearborn, Michigan, that Kamala Harris finished third. I mean, you know, you have Trump, Jill Stein, and then Kamala Harris finishing third in those precincts. I'm interested as, you know -- as we go through -- I don't know if \"purge\" is the right word. I think that Republicans were going to go through a purge, Geoff, if -- if Donald Trump would have lost. They were going to be able to have this -- this kind of reckoning. I think Democrats are going to have this reckoning, and I'm interested to see how a part of our coalition, Arab-American voters, those individuals who are or were pro-Palestinian, are going to analyze this race and what Donald Trump, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the impact that's going to have on the war in Gaza. Because I just go back to Jared Kushner saying that Gaza would be good beachfront property. Right? And I'm interested to see how individuals who either set out or chose Jill Stein to punish the Democratic Party are going to reconcile that with what happens with Bibi Netanyahu. I, for one, believe we're going to have more chaos if you're going to -- I pray that he puts somebody like a Marco Rubio. And I'm actually -- I don't know if I verbally said that I'm praying for Marco Rubio out loud. But I'm praying that he puts somebody like Marco Rubio, who at least has some sense of -- of decency and common sense, although I don't agree with his policies, per se, as secretary of state, so we at least have a level of stability. My concern with Donald Trump is the lack of stability in our global standing.",
