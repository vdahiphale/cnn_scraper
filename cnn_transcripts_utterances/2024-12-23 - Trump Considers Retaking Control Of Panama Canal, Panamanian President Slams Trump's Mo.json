You are in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm Richard Quest.And we have for you, Donald Trump warning his administration to take back the Panama Canal, which has drawn a sharp rebuke from Panama's president. Police in New York say a suspect is now in custody after a gruesome attack on a subway car that left a woman dead. And Vladimir Putin is vowing to unleash destruction on those responsible for a drone attack that took place deep inside Russian territory. It's actually four weeks from now, Donald Trump will be sworn in as U.S. president. And he's previewing what he says will be a common sense revolution during his second term. It came in Phoenix during a first rally-style speech since the victory, where he told conservative supporters that by Turning Point USA, he would deliver on his campaign promises when it came to the border and immigration. And he also touched on a wide range of topics, including the Panama Canal, where he said he'd consider retaking control as he accused Panama of charging fees that he called ridiculous and highly unfair. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT: We're being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we're being ripped off everywhere else. It was not given for the benefit of others by a token of cooperation, but it was given to Panama and to the people of Panama. But it has provisions. You got to treat us fairly, and they haven't treated us fairly. If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America in full, quickly and without question. Not going to stand for it. So to the officials of Panama, please be guided accordingly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEVE CONTRONO, CNN SR. REPORTER: Speaking from Arizona on Sunday, Donald Trump delivered what his campaign called a rally-style speech in front of a friendly conservative audience. His first since winning election last month, and it was certainly reminiscent of many of the campaign speeches that he delivered over the past two years with a heavy focus on immigration and his plans for the U.S.-Mexico border. He did, however, tread some new ground, saying that he was open to allowing TikTok, the Chinese social media company, to continue to operate in the United States. He also considered taking back control of the Panama Canal and suggested that he would meet early in his term with Russian President Vladimir Putin about the Ukraine war. He also pushed back against Democrats' criticism that he has allowed billionaire Elon Musk to become the de facto leader of his party and the country. Take a listen to what he said.",

John Bolton said he was ready to leave NATO at various points. Marco Rubio is a mainstream Republican. His national security adviser is a mainstream Republican.
