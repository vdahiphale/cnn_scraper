It is noon here in Dubai.2 a.m. in New York -- New Mexico and in the southwestern U.S. where two devastating fast-moving wildfires are burning near communities leading to a state of emergency. Officials say at least one person has been killed and two others injured there. The fires have also forced thousands of residents to evacuate and we're hearing harrowing stories from some who have lost their homes or have done everything to try and save them. A 66-year-old man says he spent hours attempting to put out fires near his vacation home in the community of Alto but finally evacuated when he ran out of water. The fires broke out on Monday and quickly exploded in size. They've now burned more than 18,000 acres or 7,500 hectares combined. But crews are hopeful for more favorable conditions with rain in the forecast for the next few days. Now the state's governor says mandatory evacuation orders were necessary.

Trump backed state senator John McGuire claimed victory against Bob Good even though the race is too early to call. CNN's Projects Democrat Eugene Vindman, a high- profile figure during Donald Trump's first impeachment, will win the Democratic primary in Virginia's seventh district. In the Republican runoff race in Georgia's second district, former education department official Wayne Johnson is projected to defeat Chuck Hand who was convicted of a misdemeanor of illegally demonstrating in the capital during the January 6, 2021 riots. And in Oklahoma, Republican Congressman Tom Cole has won the primary race in the fourth congressional district with about 65 percent of the votes. U.S. President Joe Biden has announced a new executive action that will allow some undocumented immigrants to seek permanent legal status without having to go back to their country of origin. Immigrant children and spouses of U.S. citizens who have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years would be eligible for the program and the new policy would affect about 500,000 families and about 50,000 children. The application process will begin around the end of summer and the president made the announcement at the White House on Tuesday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: These couples have been raising families, sending their kids to church and school, paying taxes, contributing to our country, but living in the United States all this time with fear and uncertainty. This action will allow them to file a paperwork for legal status in the United States. Allow them to work while they remain with their families in the United States.

The adoring crowds, many of them waving Russian flags, a giant poster of Putin alongside Kim Jong-un up in the center of Pyongyang, they're riding together in an open top car.At one point, it looks a bit like a victory parade. And there's even less subtlety when it comes to the rhetoric. Take a listen to both men. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We highly appreciate your consistent and unwavering support for Russian policy, including the Ukrainian strand. I am referring to our fight against the hegemonic policy imposed for decades, the imperialist policy of the United States and its satellites against the Russian Federation. KIM JONG-UN, NORTH KOREAN LEADER (through translator): The DPRK expresses full support and solidarity with the struggles of the Russian government, military and the people, which are conducting special military operations in Ukraine to protect its own sovereignty, safety and territorial stability.

We've seen that in recent statements in Putin's letter to the North Korean people in North Korean state media ahead of this visit as well talk about jointly combating as illegal Western restrictions, read sanctions. Of course, the irony not lost there because, of course, Russia, as recently as a few years ago, was in fact backing U.N. sanctions on North Korea.And North Korea, you heard there also calling the war in Ukraine a special military operation, parroting the Kremlin propaganda around this now nearly two and a half year old war. So look, the optics, the rhetoric, all of that is very clear. They know the West is watching Russian state media, for example, is full of references to how the West is sort of hanging on their every word. One newspaper report said that the West is unable to hide its nerves around this. But of course, the rhetoric that we heard just there does not put paid to concerns about the fact that this may well be a burgeoning defense partnership. And of course, the quid pro quo, the worries about what North Korea may be getting in return -- Eleni.",

At least 41 Jordanians perished as they made their pilgrimage to Mecca, where yesterday they set a new all-time high at over 125 degrees.
