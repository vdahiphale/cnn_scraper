With critical aid for Gaza hanging in the balance, I speak to humanitarian organizations on the ground. And as the civilian death toll climbs by the hour, we have a report on the children caught up in Israel's war on Hamas. Then President Biden says both Hamas and Putin share a common goal to annihilate a neighboring democracy. I speak to veteran foreign policy analyst Robin Wright about the fear that war will spill out across the region. Plus, as a possible ground incursion looms, families desperately await news of their loved ones held hostage by Hamas. My conversation with lawyer and former hostage negotiator Ory Slonim. Also, ahead, bitter divisions leave Congress in limbo without a house speaker. Michel Martin talks to NPR's Steve Inskeep about lessons we can draw from history. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. We begin in Gaza, where the U.N. warns the conditions on the ground are \"increasingly dire,\" with food, water, and medicine all running critically low. As Israel's siege on Gaza and war against Hamas continues. The focus is on the Rafah Crossing between Egypt and Gaza, where right now, trucks carrying vital aid are unable to get to those who desperately need it. Here's the U.N. secretary-general highlighting this need as he arrived at the crossing today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL:  These trucks are not just trucks, they are a lifeline. They are the difference between life and death for so many people in Gaza. And to see them stuck here makes me be very clear, what we need is to make them move, to make them move to the other side of this wall, to make the move as quickly as possible and as many as possible.

Mohsen, thank you so much for taking time during this critical moment when you're trying to get aid to those desperately in need. I know that your organization is part of a larger alliance to help see those trucks cross into Gaza and deliver the aid. There were reports that they were allowed to cross in earlier today.

And I want you to remember the Ministry of Defense of Israel when he said, I will starve those people and we will treat them as human animals, and that plan has been executed now to the letter. People are being killed every day. Now, in Gaza, people cannot get their dead from under the rubble. They don't have equipment and they don't have enough manpower to keep up with the people that are stuck, dead under the rubble. So, now, Gaza is turning from the world's biggest open-air prison, and the whole world knows that. These people have been prisoned there for more than 70 years into the world's biggest open-air graveyard.",

Let's get now to Robin Wright, who can talk to us more about this. She's a contributing writer for \"The New Yorker,\" and she joins us now to talk about this and the president's speech last night. But Robin, I want to get you to respond to this breaking news, according to our Alex Marquardt and Kaitlan Collins, two American hostages, a mother and daughter, being released by Hamas for humanitarian grounds. How significant is this, especially as we're waiting for an imminent ground incursion by the IDF into Gaza? ROBIN WRIGHT, DISTINGUISHED SCHOLAR, U.S. INSTITUTE OF PEACE AND CONTRIBUTING WRITER, THE NEW YORKER:  Needless to say, two people being freed is a major development, but remember that there are some 200 -- more than 200 still remaining hostages to both Hamas and Islamic Jihad. So, there's a very long way to go. I think that in some cases, the hostage takers know that there are benefits to releasing those they can't take care of and they don't want to be held necessary for their deaths of these people. So, this is a token move. It is not -- is nowhere near a resolution and it's not -- we should not have false hope that the release of others or all of them is also imminent.",

But remember, hostage affairs often lead to whether it's the women, the children, the infirm, the elderly, they are often the first ones released.

They were intercepted by Iron Dome. We've just heard a couple of explosions, Israeli missiles or artillery, probably Israeli missiles, into the Gaza Strip behind us. So, when we were talking about the quietness of the day, that did seem to speak to something happening behind the scenes. And it does seem that something was happening behind the scenes.

They said they did it on humanitarian grounds to show the world and the citizens of the United. States that they say that President Biden is lying when he describes Hamas, that's according to Hamas. But I think it gives you this gives you an understanding here, just as your last guest was saying, that this could be a very, very drawn-out process. The price that Hamas will want to extract for each hostage, could be very high in terms of prisoner exchanges and other things. And at the moment, the price they seem to extract so far today was a pause, it seemed, subjectively from our position anyway, in missile and artillery strikes on their positions inside Gaza. It's very hard to predict where the situation develops from now that it is very clear that Hamas, as expected, are using these hundreds of hostages to their advantage to try to make themselves safer, to try to hold off an Israeli incursion and to change the global narrative about them, which is so critical to their future as well.",

Kaitlan and I have spoken to two different sources who haveconfirmed that these two American citizens who have been among these around 200 hostages held for almost two weeks by Hamas are now being released. We understand that they are still in the Gaza Strip, but a source I spoke with said that they are on their way out, and our understanding is that they are currently in the care of the Red Cross, so that they have been handed over to -- by Hamas to an independent body to get them out. So, this is not like it's going to be a Hamas hand over to Israel or to Egypt. And that is also another big question right now, Bianna, is, will they leave through the Rafah Crossing, that we've been talking about so much, because of the aid that we want to see go into Gaza or will they go out through another crossing called Kerem Shalom, which goes into Israel? Both of those crossings are in Southern Gaza. So, what we understand is these two Americans, a mother and a daughter are heading south, and then they would be handed over and -- to officials from one of those two countries that U.N. could also perhaps be involved. But, Bianna, they are being released, according to both the sources we have spoken with, as well as Hamas, which has put out a statement for humanitarian reasons, the mother, according to one source, is not in good condition, is not in good health. So, this is a mother and a daughter who for humanitarian reasons, according to all of these different parties, are now being released, but the fact remains that there are still around 200 hostages in Hamas custody. There are different nationalities. We have been told by the White House that the number of American citizens being held is less than a handful. That's a quote from the spokesman for the National Security Council. So, there are still a lot of hostages who are in Hamas custody, but this has been a major focus of the U.S. asking Qatar, Bianna, because Qatar has that link with Hamas. They host Hamas officials in Doha. So, this is a result of the negotiations that Qatar has undertaken with Hamas that these two Americans are being allowed out. Now, the negotiations continue, but certainly Hamas has a lot of leverage here because they still have so many people in their custody that they are detaining, Bianna.",

So, Juliette, listen, this is just a ray of good news. Obviously, there are hundreds, nearly 200 other hostages being held, but your reaction to the news that two Americans for \"humanitarian reasons,\" which is said with a large grain of salt given who these terrorists are, have been released, a mother and, and daughter.",

I want to make clear as you make clear, as Alex make clear, until we get verification from the United States government that in fact, our citizens are in custody, so to speak, of the Red Cross and our traversing lines, we are hearing this from non-governmental sources. So, we just given that news can flow in ways that we can't control. So, we -- the most important thing is that we're going to wait for some validation from the United States. And the reason why they may not be commenting, as Alex was saying, is because they the hostages may not actually be safe now. They may be in transit and then -- and this -- and the story has gotten out. That being said, if true, this is part of two pieces. One is, of course, Biden -- President Biden spoke last night condemning Hamas is terrorism. So, under the guise of humanitarian relief, it is not surprising to me that Hamas decides, or at least alleges that they're releasing two Americans. That's not a coincidence. Presumably a lot of these hostages are under some sort of medical duress. They are playing a narrative game. But I think what's also important for your audience is they certainly see in the Arab world, while there are lots of people very angry about Israel and the humanitarian issues related to Gaza, it is not at all clear that Hamas has a good narrative amongst, of course, the nonviolent Arab nations and the and nonviolent Palestinians. They have gotten a lot of criticism about what, in fact, was the plan, right? What was this about last Saturday? And I think part of this is also, if you've seen in the last couple of days as Hamas leaders are being criticized by media, criticized by Arab leaders, that they are trying to begin to control their own narrative. So, there's a lot going on with this. We will wait to get validation from our government as well -- from the United States government as well.",

If you can speak to Juliette's point, I mean, what is the best approach?

You have made an enormous mistake on October 7th, and the only way around this is start releasing American and European hostages and any others that are non-Israelis. I think there's going to be no negotiations for Israeli soldiers held by Hamas or even Israeli citizens. I think the best that Hamas can do before this incursion is cut off any western support. I don't know if this is going to work. But Qatar is the only country in the Middle East or any negotiator who Hamas will talk to, simply because Hamas gets so money -- so much money from guttering and private citizens. So, I think this is what we're seeing. And by the way, this has been talked about releasing European hostages for the last three or four days.

The second though, as President Biden has been saying, this question of whether Israel and the Arab nations both equally could move forward without addressing the Palestinian issue is now seriously, you know, sort of suspect. In other words, the president keeps coming back to the Palestinian issue.
