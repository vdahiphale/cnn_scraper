In response to some of those conversations, Israel's defense minister has said that they will be setting up a situation room and encouraging open and transparent communication about the location of aid workers as a result of this. But even so, there are still a lot of very serious questions to be asked by the U.S. government. And the format for those questions going on right now will be that conversation happening tomorrow between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where I'm told the themes will be anger and accountability and on a leader- to-leader level conversation, some of those very serious concerns are going to be presented to Bibi Netanyahu. Now, as far as the policies that the administration is pursuing toward Israel, the sharp rhetoric that we've seen coming out of the administration this week, both privately and publicly, now appears increasingly divorced from what the administration's stated policy on Israel is. The White House was asked repeatedly in recent days whether there would be consequences for Israel and conditions placed on military aid as a result of these strikes on civilians.

The 7.4 magnitude earthquake triggers massive landslides authorities say several people were killed by falling rocks. In the town of Hualien, apartment buildings on the verge of collapse emergency workers in action authorities say they've rescued scores of people from toppled buildings and highway tunnels, but more than 900 people have been injured and rescue teams are still trying to reach others trapped high in the mountains. The work has continued in Hualien throughout the night. No one is left inside this building, says this firefighter. He adds, people are frightened. There are constant earthquakes here, says this woman. I've lived here 50 years and never felt one so big. It's really scary. People in Taiwan are accustomed to feeling the earth shake but rarely with this much destructive force. (END VIDEOTAPE) WATSON (on camera): Now, Wolf, right now, we're monitoring efforts to rescue more than 70 miners in two separate mines that are believed to be trapped as a result of this deadly and powerful earthquake and we'll update as we learn more about what is happening there. In the meantime, Taiwan is still being hit by powerful aftershocks, at least 29 recorded in the first 12 hours after the initial earthquake. And the authorities here are predicting that there could be more very powerful aftershocks for the next three to four days.",

But they were very -- you know, heroic Americans that were working hard trying to do the right thing, trying to move our country ahead and aerospace and exploration, it's something that we do really, really well in this country.

That at times this spacecraft tries to talk to you and it tries to tell you it has a problem. And we should have seen this problem coming.And we had foam coming off the tank years prior to this, small pieces of foam. Not thinking that it was going to be a major problem and on lift off a big chunk of foam came off and flew right through the leading edge the left wing. And then that caused the disaster on re- entry, we should have seen it coming. We put more processes into place after this. And I think we realized that sometimes a team of people can make bad decisions. You often feel like if you pull the right people together, you're going to get the right answer. That's not always the case. And I tried to take that into my job here now as a -- as a United States senator.",
