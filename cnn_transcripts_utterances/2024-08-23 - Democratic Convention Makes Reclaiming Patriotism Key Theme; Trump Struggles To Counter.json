      "sentences": "This week was full of scenes that have traditionally been a hallmark of Republican conventions. From the sea of waving American flags, to deafening chants of USA, USA, to honor elected officials who served in the military. It was all part of a concerted effort by Democrats to try to reclaim the mantle of patriotism from Donald Trump's Republican Party.Joining me now is Florida Republican Congressman and Trump supporter, Mike Waltz. Thank you so much for being here. Your fellow House member and veteran, Elissa Slotkin, told Democrats here, don't give an inch to pretenders who wrap themselves in the flag, but spit in the face of freedoms. And that did sum up what they were trying to do last night, which is make the point that Democrats, they believe, should hold the flag and say that we are patriots and make a contrast between Republicans, some of whom who do things and support policies that they don't believe should be cast as patriotic. What's your response? REP. MIKE WALTZ (R), FLORIDA: Well, you know, Dana, that's unfortunate. I know many of those veterans that were on stage and serve with them. And what I found most unfortunate was not a single one of them said the word Afghanistan, said the names of the 13 gold star families when this week and this coming Monday is the three-year anniversary of the Abbey gate bombing. And I think the foreign policy debacle that was the original sin of seeing chaos around the world. In fact, Kamala Harris looked at you dead in the eye and said she was proud of the decision. She puffed up her chest and said she was comfortable with it as the last person in the room. And we saw over 800 Americans left behind, 150,000 of our allies that stood and fought with us and Putin and Xi and the Ayatollahs, all got the message that we'll abandon our allies from of that. This week, three years ago, not a single mention yet they're going to mention, you know, Trump and cheerlead and wave their flags. So, let's talk about actual action versus rhetoric. And I'll push back --",

She said last night that he wants to cozy up to dictators. Well, you know what? Ask Soleimani how he feels about that. Ask Baghdadi how he feels about that. They're both dead because President Trump took decisive action and restored deterrence and restored peace. And just final thing, because it was such a misleading statement on her part that she traveled to Europe to warn Zelenskyy. No, I'm looking at actual CNN site. She traveled to Europe to send a clear message to Russia to don't take action or you would face crippling economic sanctions. Russia and Putin clearly didn't take her seriously. They did invade and they're selling more oil and gas on the global market now through China and India than they ever did. That's fueling their war machine.",
