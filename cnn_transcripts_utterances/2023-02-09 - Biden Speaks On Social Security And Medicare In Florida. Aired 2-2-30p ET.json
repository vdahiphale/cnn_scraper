There are pamphlets of this plan throughout all the seats there as the president is speaking, but that is wanting to sunset entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security. Rick Scott has tweeted at the president. We'll get into all of this in just a moment. But we do want to begin with CNN White House correspondent Arlette Saenz along with two CNN political commentators, Alice Stewart, and Ana Navarro.Arlette, President Biden sharpening his messaging post that state of the union in several battleground states. We saw him in Wisconsin yesterday. I think it's kind of hard to call Florida a battleground right now, even though that's what he liked to see, but sticking to this one message, and that is defending Medicare and Social Security.",

Did Republicans in their behavior, and by putting Rick Scott of all people in -- and I'll come to you on him a little later, but putting him out front and behaving the way they did, they serve this up to the president?",

      "sentences": "Look. First, Victor, I don't -- I think the behavior, the heckling of the president during the State of the Union was unacceptable. But as far as this issue, look, Rick Scott wrote this up in a plan that is now collecting dust in Washington, DC. The most important thing is we have Mitch McConnell who says Republicans are not going to cut Medicare and Social Security. We have Kevin -- we have the leader -- Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy says this is not what we are talking about.You talk to Republicans here in Washington, DC, they are not looking to cut Social Security and Medicare. That is completely off the table. But here's what's happening is that President Biden is really using this as a fake argument. This is a false foil. And he certainly would much rather talk about something that is not true than run on his record, which many Americans are not satisfied with. That's why we see polls show that four in 10 Americans feel as though they are worse off financially. And here's the - look, I don't blame the White House for going after this and using this because it's clearly resonating with Democrats. The problem, once people recognize that what the president says about Republicans cutting these entitlement programs when they realize that's not the case, then they're really going to be left in a lurch trying to find a message that actually works. Because this is not a true argument for the Democrats and Republicans are going to work feverishly to make sure that the American people understand Republicans are not going to cut those programs.",

The location of where the president is is interesting given that \"another president, President Obama, the Democrats took a shellacking in the midterms,\" a historic shellacking, we should note in terms of losing to Republicans. Republicans are out fundraising Democrats in the state right now. The voter registration gap continues to grow.Clearly, they've got a lot of ground to cover here. DeSantis is saying this is a strong red state at this point. Is that the case? And do you think it's smart that the president is there this early and without even announcing that he's running yet?",

I think he's there because it's where the most amount of people percentage wise folks affected by these programs, look, the most amount percentage wise of senior citizens, the most people on Obama Care, people that would be affected by Medicare expansion. So, that's why he is there because of the message. And because he is taking it, giving it on the chin to Rick Scott, who can deny this all he wants.But he -- Joe Biden's got the receipts. You can see how much he relishes and enjoys lifting up the actual pamphlet. It's literally in writing. He is not making this up. And one of the things I disagree with Joe Biden on -- I loved everything he said. I thought it was right on point. But for the part about Charlie Crist, you're not done yet. No, no joke. Charlie Crist is done. He lost by 20 points. And what Republican -- the Democratic Party needs in Florida is a younger generation, a new stable of candidates, people that can energize the Democratic base. So, folks like Charlie Crist put a fork in them. They are done. They need new Democrats energizing Floridians.",

But I could not figure out -- first, I don't know how in the world we made him the governor of Florida. It's an indictment on us in Florida that that happened.This is one of the most awkward men, poor communicators, strange duck, who basically put in hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money to buy himself elected office, and he has achieved it. But then it was Republicans in the Senate who made him the face, the chair of the Republican campaign arm in the Senate, a huge mistake. He then had the gumption to try to contest Mitch McConnell's leadership, which got forwarded. But I think Rick Scott is as much an irritant and a thorn in the Republicans' side as he is to Joe Biden. He is frankly, not a thorn on Joe Biden's side, he is a gift that keeps on giving to Joe Biden. And he's been confronted about his plan, which is in writing, not only by Democrats, not only by Joe Biden but by Fox News, by people in his own party.",
