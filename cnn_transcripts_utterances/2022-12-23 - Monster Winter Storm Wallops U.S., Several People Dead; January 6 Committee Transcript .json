Ice, wind, snow, power outages, millions tonight feeling the impact of the once-in-a-generation storm.Plus, we have breaking news. More transcripts just released from the January 6th committee's investigation -- everyone from the president's daughter to his attorney general in a top White House lawyer. What they all had to say and how the committee's final report puts the blame squarely on Donald Trump. And shocking government numbers out of China about COVID cases. New infections reportedly in the hundreds of millions this month alone and growing. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening, everyone. I'm Kate Bolduan, in for Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, severe weather walloping the country as millions are travelling for the holidays. I want to show a scene, just look at the scene in Ohio where snowy conditions caused a massive pileup of roughly 50 cars. We are told at least one person died in this crash. And it's not just in Ohio, it's across the country, as we've been seeing all day. Cars sliding, being abandoned on the streets of Memphis, Tennessee. Today, more than 5,000 flights have been canceled due to severe winds and icy conditions. The storm's impact is widespread. Over half the U.S. population is under winter storm and wind chill alerts. At least nine people have died in the storm so far. Officials across the country are warning people of this impact. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D), NEW YORK:  It is throwing everything at us but the kitchen sink. We've had ice, flooding, snow, freezing temperatures and everything that Mother Nature could wallop at us this weekend. GOV. ANDY BESHEAR (D), KENTUCKY:  Stay inside, stay off the roads. The last-second shopping is not worth it if it would cost you your life. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Earlier today there was about a 79-mile-an-hour wind gust confirmed by the national weather service here in Buffalo.That exceeds the winds that they experienced here during the historic blizzard back in 1977. So authorities are not kidding when they say that this is just highly unusual storm, even for the likes of western New York. Authorities also confirming, the chief executive saying that there are currently, quote, hundreds of people that are stranded in and around Buffalo. And that is certainly a huge concern for authorities as they've seen that in previous instances. And so authorities at this hour, they are working nonstop in this weather, Kate, to try to get to some of those people that, again, according to the county officials here in Buffalo, are still stranded. And it really just underscores and punctuates and capitalizes the message that the safest place today and possibly tomorrow until Christmas day, perhaps, is at home even for those people who have lost power.

But it gives you an idea just how cold it is. I want to show you, just on my graphics, the forecast for Atlanta. This is much of the same for the Deep South because our temperatures are going to be below freezing for at least 48 hours. So if you don't have power, that's going to be a problem. Obviously you can't heat your home. And obviously we think about the homeless population in this area and how that impacts people. It is brutally cold. This cold has a different feel to it. It is bitter, with the wind, it is excruciating actually on your exposed skin. We dropped 35 degrees in eight hours here in Atlanta as that cold front came through. The emperor from the north, that's what I'm calling it because it originated from the Arctic Circle. We were 31 degrees warmer yesterday at this time in Atlanta.

But they're doing as little as they can to answer some of these questions.One of them is Elaine Chao who was the labor secretary under the former president. And she talks about how she doesn't really having a conversation about the Twenty-Fifth Amendment with other members of the cabinet, this idea that you could remove the former president, President Trump obviously, for what had happened on January 6th. She did resign that day after what she saw. And this is what she says. The reason why she did it, she says, was the full ramification of the actions that were taken by some people and the results that occurred. Now, she's careful not to mention Donald Trump himself and to criticize him, but she says I wish he had acted differently. We also learned that Ivanka Trump, the former president's daughter, turned over some of her text messages under the request from the committee. It goes to show you, Kate, the extent of the evidence that was gathered by this committee. And, of course, we know that at this point, they have now started turning over some of that evidence to the Justice Department, which is, you know, obviously doing a criminal investigation and has been asking for this evidence as part of their work that they are doing.",

And then to see the kinds of questions that the committee asked even if they weren't answered, because they're a powerful committee made up of former federal prosecutors and the like, triangulating time and again.

She was one of the original five in 2015 when I first joined that campaign. She's treated by that family like family. He treated her like a daughter. I'm sure this was not easy for her to do. Aside from Dan Scavino, she spent the most time with Donald Trump. And he trusted her implicitly. So, you know, you're not going to hear him have a feeling, Donald Trump come out and say Hope Hicks is a liar. She's angry. She's out for herself.

That seems to just be a federal crime that is a very, very active part of the current special counsel's investigation -- new evidence, brand new that we have not seen before that directs it right at Trump and Mark Meadows.Evidence, for example, that one smoking gun so far is a call that Trump makes to the head of the RNC. And he hands over the call to John Eastman to say, we want you to organize the false slate of electors. That's all we had in the past. We now know she calls Donald Trump back soon after the call and says, I accept your request, which means it's about him, it's not about Eastman. And their other lawyers for the Trump campaign who say to the committee that it was Donald Trump who put Giuliani in control of this false slate of electors and what Giuliani was doing, as far as they were concerned, was executing what Donald Trump wanted them to do. That's pretty devastating. Then there is a bunch of other testimony that we hadn't heard before from Cassidy Hutchinson saying that Mark Meadows was significantly involved, following it closely, making dozens of calls to try to operationalize the false slate of electors.

So this is the way that he works. This is just what he does. That piece by Olivia, I thought, was incredible. I think that people should really take the time to read it. I would echo what Mitch McConnell said earlier in that when I read the price, it showed to me kind of the novelty that Donald Trump has worn off. Every quote in there I could have said, oh, yeah, he's going to say that. It's all old retired, recycled things that he says about how successful he is and denying anything else that could possibly be perceived in his eyes as bad.

More bluster or something different now after Zelenskyy's visit to the United States? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, Kate, I think it's definitely, in part, bluster. But we do note that what Putin is doing is he's moving troops, or at least saying that he's going to move troops to their northwestern border. So that puts them right across from Finland and also close to Sweden, the two newest almost NATO members. So that's one indication that the Russians are ramping up certain activities, and, of course, Putin's visit to the industrial plant, that also shows that they're trying to not only streamline their war efforts but they're putting more emphasis on the industrial production, what we call the defense industrial base. So there may be some things that they're doing, and it's pretty clear to me what they're looking at is, at least verbally, raising tensions with the U.S. and then, on the other hand, we may see increases in asymmetric type warfare, things like cyberattacks increasing potentially, as well as special operations attacks.

The virus is going to infect everyone if it's wide open like this who hasn't been immunized either by the vaccine or prior disease. So there's nothing really to stop it, even mounting a huge precedent-setting national vaccination campaign right now, they don't have enough of the vaccine which is effective. So we have to just first of all realize what a humanitarian disaster this is and our hearts go out to the people in China that will get affected by this. But I do have to say, there is two other things I worry about. One isthis number of cases with this number of viruses replicating and mutating, the risk of new variants is increased and that's something all of us have to be concerned about.",

They try to gather as many blankets as they can and get as much human contact as possible. They get-togethers to try to do anything they can to stay warm during the night. You see here the cardboard boxes. They're using that to block the wind because the wind is also just so cold. They're lining up, trying to get into this shelter tonight but thereality is that not all of them are going to make it inside. They have capacity for about 130 people and they're trying to squeeze in about 200, but there is more than 200 here. The priority is the women and children but a lot of the men will end up sleeping out here tonight. Look, the problem is there are city shelters but a lot don't have the proper documentations from customs and Border Patrol. So the problem is they're not allowed in those city shelters because of state and federal laws. So the only option they have is shelters like this, a non-profit and the non-profits are over-capacity. So that is a problem that you're seeing and that's why so many people, Kate, tonight will sleep on the street.",

They'll get on the bus for maybe five minutes to try to warm up, some of them were able to sleep on the bus but the reality is a lot of them are scared to even get on the bus. These people, they want to live in the United States. They want to have a future here for their children. They're actually praying about it as we speak.
