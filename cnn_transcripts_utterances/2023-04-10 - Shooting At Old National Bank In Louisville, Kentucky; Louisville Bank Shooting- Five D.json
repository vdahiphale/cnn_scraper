We know the gunman is dead at this stage, and the big issue is, once again, every time is family unification and notification. There are five families whose lives have changed today as a result of what happened. Six additional ones around the six victims at the hospital who are looking to see where their loved one is. This is the primary focus right now. We need to do this right and you need to care for these families in terms of the unification and getting people to back together again. It's the primary.

And at this point, there is some kind of armed confrontation with the shooter. The shooter is down and deceased at the scene. Weapons have been recovered from the shooter, or I should say, a weapon or weapons. The circumstance that is not clear right now, and this is not uncommon to have this fog as an incident. It's unfolding quickly.
