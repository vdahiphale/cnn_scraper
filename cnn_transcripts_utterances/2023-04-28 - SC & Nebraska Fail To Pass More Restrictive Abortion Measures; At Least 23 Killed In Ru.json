Republican dissenters in both Nebraska and South Carolina blocked passage of laws that would have banned nearly all abortions and the stalled votes happened within hours of each other. South Carolina, five female state senators filibustered against the bill that led to its rejection. Earlier, one of those senators told Boris about the fight for a middle ground.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. PENRY GUSTAFSON (R-SC): I do not think we have a right to abortion, but we may not have a right, but it is the reality. And I've always said it needs to be legal, safe and rare - really rare. But there's got to be some gray area because life is not simply black and white. I recognize that and over 70 percent of South Carolina recognizes that. Most of us feel in our state there should be restrictions. So it's just reaching a happy middle or at least a general consensus among the bodies. And the South Carolina House will not accept our stance, the Senate. (END VIDEO CLIP) SCIUTTO: Well, in Nebraska, a six-week abortion ban failed there by a single vote after one Republican again, abstained. Check out the relief seen afterwards from those who oppose the ban, the footage tweeted out by a Democratic state senator. CNN's Dianne Gallagher, she's been covering this for us. So Dianne, walk us through what went into the calculation here, particularly among these Republican legislators who fought their own parties - their own party on this bill.",

And it was when two senators abstained from a vote to break the filibuster. Jim, one of those senators was actually a co-sponsor of the bill, an 80- year-old senator.He said that he basically did more research. He offered an amendment that would have made it 12 weeks as the limit. That never got a vote. In his speech, he warned of backlash, something that, look, has been felt by Republicans nationally. Conservatives once championed banning abortions as sort of a campaign cornerstone, but shifting public opinion, coupled with the Supreme Court making these outright bans a possibility with the Dobbs ruling, has challenged these hard-line positions as, look, their supporters have said it's time for you to sort of say what you're doing. You can do what you've always said, while others agree that it has just gone too far, according to polling. SCIUTTO: Well, I mean, let's be frank here. Six weeks was considered fairly extreme in this country. Many women don't know they're pregnant in six weeks, but South Carolina talking about banning at conception, which, prior to Dobbs, I don't know how many folks would have thought that was even a realistic proposal, but here we are.

They are pushing the upper Mississippi River beyond its banks and experts are warning that the snow melt could cause some of the worst flooding that we've seen in 20 years.In Davenport, Iowa, floodwaters have already swallowed much of the riverfront area. You can see it in these pictures. Here is the view from the ground just a short time ago. So far, the floodwaters are not deep, but they are widespread and the threat along the river, it's going to linger for weeks. Another danger today, tornadoes. Let's turn to Chad Myers who's following all of this from our Weather Center. We're looking at two threats, different parts of the country here. What are you tracking?",

      "sentences": "Right now, I'm tracking the tornadoes that were likely on the ground just a few minutes ago near Hamilton, Texas. We have our first two watches of the day. Severe thunderstorm watch for Dallas and a tornado watch south of there, including Waco.This storm right here that you see with a little pink boxes, which means tornado warning, was nothing to 52,000 feet tall in 25 minutes. That's how explosive these storms are going to be today. And we're going to have hail and we're going to have large hail. So even though you're under a tornado watch, Waco, you're also going to be looking at that hail just depending on where you are in the cycle of the storm. Hail that looked like this on Wednesday. It's a guy's hand. He's sitting in the passenger side of a car. So here's where we are right now. Storms are beginning to fire south of Dallas, maybe even just west of Dallas as well. Later on, it begins to move to the east and they're still rotating. But by later on tonight, they begin to line up and when storms line up, they kind of fight each other and they don't want to rotate anymore. They just want to make a wind gust. So as we line these up, the wind gust threat goes up, the tornado threat goes down. But for right now, we are certainly in that tornado threat. River flooding up here to the north, as you said. The entire Mississippi from really almost Davenport all the way up to Eau Claire (ph) and even towards St. Paul, out of its banks in many spots. It doesn't mean it's deep in many spots, but certainly wide - how wide that Mississippi can get, as you see miles and miles wide in that floodplain.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Spring is here, after winter's frozen horror. And the buzz and sting of Ukraine's looming counter-offensive is growing. Aiming at Russian positions within 30 seconds, the Ukrainian unit has moved away. It may be a precise operation, but the Russian response is not. Slamming into the nearby town edging closer to us. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WALSH (on camera): Impossible to tell what the Russians are trying to hit, but another example of the intense bombardment. Their bid to stop the counter offensive from starting. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALSH (voice over): It is ordinary civilians caught in the rising dust behind us, who bear the brunt of Russia's frustrated rage. Along and around the brutalized towns where Ukraine says it may launch its attack, there are more signs it is underway, lurking in the foliage than Ukraine has given publicly. That's because Ukraine has said nothing at all about when, where or how it will attack. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's speak now to CNN's Evan Perez and former federal prosecutor, Shan Wu.

They believe that based on what they've seen from his former aides, right, Greg Jacob and Marc Short, who were extremely helpful to the January 6 Committee, they believe that there's reason to distrust that behind closed doors, Mike Pence was a lot more helpful to prosecutors simply because, again, they don't know.",
