And as you cansee, the images just at the very start of that margin have now begun to turn a lot more violent. It's something we've been seeing these last couple of weeks, free of protests and had been remarkably peaceful for the first few weeks of this movement, Becky, that have become a lot more dangerous with the violence that we tended to see on the very edge is really moving front and center. And that's where you're seeing those extraordinary live pictures up at the very helm of the march, the so called Black Bloc; there is most violence, ultra left extremists who's at this direct confrontation with the police. There's been a lot more of that these last couple of weeks. So much so Becky, that there is also - there are also now allegations of police excessive use of force that have been investigated 45 of them by French police looking at those allegations. And we've seen over the last couple of weeks that said the increase of the kind of direct confrontation you're seeing there. We can hear, we can smell the tear gas from where I'm standing, and there seems much more violent ahead. As those more extreme elements seem that connotation. For now, as for the mostly peaceful majority, Becky, we've been hearing from the unions again this lunchtime, saying that they intend to carry on with this movement. Last night there were talks between the unions and the government they broke down, the government insisting and will plow on to the unions as long as they continue with this idea to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 these were the kind of scenes I think you will see here in Paris. We go through not just these many thousands of people protesting because the country but of course there's much more violent scenes at the very front of the protests with the riot police as they try and keep some sense of order to the streets with the French capital but other French cities as well Becky.",

The Israeli police spokesperson justifying the move as follows, in the wake of increasing incitement hundreds of youth and masked people came to the evening prayers at the mosque. They did not come to pray. They said they came with the aim of rioting and causing disorder. They came with stones, fireworks, wood plants and iron rods for the very purpose of violent fortifying.

Hundreds of Israeli police stormed into Al-Aqsa and attacked them vandalize the place and left and then people reacted. And this is not the first time that this has happened. It's happened before. And we've - again in the months leading to Ramadan because as you know, in cooperation with the U.S. with Egypt, Emirates other regional partners Qatar everybody, we've been trying to work to avoid this exact moment. And we've made it very clear that if we are to go through Ramadan, peacefully, the right of worshipers has to be respected. And we haven't seen that done. We've seen Israel imposing a ban on every Palestinian under the age of 40 from going to perform their religious duty. We've seen a very overwhelming show of force. So and again, if Israel had left it for the Jordanian work to manage the place, we would have been able to deal with any individual incident. But there is very little that the work can do 60 to 70 usher, when again police stormed the place and push them away and provokes confrontation with young people who are frustrated angry already.",

Nobody can take away that right from worshipers, the right to worship is sacred, and certainly not the work or anybody else tells people not to go to the mosque and pray. So that again, is a misrepresentation of the fact. Ultimately, Becky, I think the simple question is the Aqsa is a Muslim place of worship that is recognized by the whole world that's recognized by UNESCO decision. What business does Israel have going into the mosque storming into it and preventing people from worshiping? That's the essential question, and that I think speaks to a broader reality. Becky, when you put someone who was convicted by Israel itself, for racist incitement, who was a member of an organization that the U.S. itself has categorized as a terrorist organization, you put this person in charge of the police force and I think I don't need to see a more on that.",

And Israel committed in those agreements to uphold the status quo to freeze the building of settlements, to respect previously signed agreements. Unfortunately, the actions of the ground did not implement what was agreed upon. What we engage in, again, with the United States with Egypt and with Israel, was an effort to avoid this exact moment, as I said, and to restore political horizons so that we can move towards achieving just and lasting peace that all of us deserve and want. The agreement the Aqaba and Sharm el Sheikh has political products were significant, but unfortunately, actions on the ground are just rendering them void of any of any meaning. And that's putting us all under pressure. Because our people are saying, why did you hold those meetings? What did you achieve? And this is the reaction and this is how Israel implements those agreements, and then you're not getting anything done. So I think, again, looking at the broader picture Becky, what Israel is doing right now is pushing all of us into the abyss of violence, making it very difficult for us to continue to engage in peace talks undermining the peace treaty with Jordan and Israel with Israel and other Arab countries, and making it impossible to engage in all that we've been talking about in terms of regional cooperation to better the lives of everybody. The essential question is, and I think we have to go back to the drawing board here. There is an occupation that occupation power has responsibilities. It is not meeting those responsibilities. It is consolidating occupation, it's violating international law, and it's driving us all towards more conflict and tension.",

Very soon we'll have Easter. There's also pressure on churches, a suffocation of their space. If Israel does what's right, and does not allow the radical agenda advocated by some of its - the members of government, then maybe we have a chance of restoring calm and getting to the real important business of working towards peace and stability and security for all Palestinians and Israelis. If it does not, I think we're going to see the situation escalates in a very dangerous way. The problem is, yes, the Security Council will convenient, it will issue a statement, they are oblique dead, the Organization of Islamic Conference dead. But Israel feels it can do whatever it does with impunity. And that is the major challenge. What we tell Israelis is that, in order for you to have security, Palestinians have to have job security. A very alarming piece of news came out in the last few days, Becky. When an Israeli poll showed that 40 percent of Israelis agree with small text agreement - statement is mostly because the Israeli Finance Minister statement that the Palestinian people do not exist. This is the product of incitement, dehumanization of Palestinians which will not help the Israelis or the Palestinians? What we want is peace for all peace for Israelis peace for Palestinians for that to happen, aggression on the Palestinian rights must stop, occupation must end and engagement in meaningful talks to end this nightmare.

Other witnesses have testified about this and other investigations, and this one. Pence even talked about in his book, but here he would be discussing it under oath.

The Arab world has historically struggled with access to basic food needs. But the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have made the situation much worse, the report says. In 2020, at the peak of COVID, more than half the population, half the population in Arab states could not afford a healthy diet.

The country currently imports at least 90 percent of its food needs, much like its neighbors across the Gulf region. One solution, investing in indoor vertical farms, where crops grow in vertically stacked shelves without soil or natural light in controlled environments. But that doesn't address the challenges of traditional outdoor farming. So, the government here is stepping up its plans. Earlier this year, leading American vertical farming company AeroFarms announced that it was partnering with Abu Dhabi's Investment Office to build the biggest research and development facility of its kind. CEO David Rosenberg says, once ready, this 65,000 square foot facility will play a pivotal role in establishing Abu Dhabi as a global hub for agricultural technology or AG-tech innovation, addressing farming challenges both in the Emirates and across the region.",

So, there's one for Latin America, Sub Saharan Africa, this one specifically for the Middle East, North Africa, and there's for Asia and Europe. And then these are compiled in what we call the global SOFI, or the Status of Food Insecurity for the whole world. Now, this report, which captures the Status of Food Insecurity, and you rightly mentioned, some of the alarming figures. We have to understand that this region has been going through a lot really since 2007, eight, with the global economic crisis, then followed by the Arab Spring. And then we went in on some instability along the value chains and the food supply chains, then that led to the COVID crisis, and then the war on Ukraine and lately the earthquake in Syria and Turkey. Now those have disrupted the whole food systems in the region. And has created more I would say, in diversity and inequality among the different countries.
