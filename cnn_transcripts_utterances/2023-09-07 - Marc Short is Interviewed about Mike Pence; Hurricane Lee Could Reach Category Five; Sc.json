Of course, we're talking about the start of last school year. However, this year, it will certainly be more challenging given the sheer number of migrant arrivals that exceeded 100,000 just this past month. Of course, many o them are children.You mentioned that 19,000 number. That's the rough estimate of the total number of migrant children that are expected to start school today, or at least are already starting school today per some of those numbers. About 500 of them were registered just since last June. Now, when you hear from the Department of Education, they will tell you that they are confident that there's plenty of room for these students. That there have been about 120,000 families in recent years that have actually left the system. So that, presumably, would provide more space for these new enrollments. But, you know, one of the big questions here is, well, you can have all the space in the world, but if you do not have those personnel that actually speak the language of many of these students, then this is -- there is certainly going to be an issue. And that's why New York City Department of Education has really been working to try to boost those numbers according to what we've been hearing. About 1,700 bilingual teachers, about 3,400 English as a new language instructors. And we learned in the last hour, per the head of the DOE, that that is a number that will grow significantly to at least 500 as it will offer tenure to about 500 teachers that are already in the system they just haven't been using that license to actually teach English as a second language because we've heard something time and time again from officials at the local and certainly at the state level, those students have certain linguistic needs. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D), NEW YORK: This is a real challenge. You know, an unexpected challenge. But these children are embraced. You heard from Mike Mulgrew (ph), representing the teachers of New York City, that once they step foot in our door, they're our children. And we'll do whatever it takes to make sure they get the best outcomes. I think language is going to be a challenge, particularly in the early days.

As Ukrainian submarine drones, strapped with explosives, approached the Russian fleet, they, quote, \"lost connectivity and washed ashore harmlessly.\"Walter Issacson, who penned the book, also says Musk's decision was driven by fear that Russia would respond to a Ukrainian attack with nuclear weapons. A fear Musk carried after his conversations with senior Russian officials. And that's just the beginning. With us now, CNN's Natasha Bertrand. Wow, these are quite big revelations.
