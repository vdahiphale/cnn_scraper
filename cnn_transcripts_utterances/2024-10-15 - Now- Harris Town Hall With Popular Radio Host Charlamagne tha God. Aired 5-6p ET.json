And listen, she is sitting with Charlamagne tha God to get this message out there. He's a popular host with a big audience, a largely Black audience. He is a supporter of hers, but he is also known for being very blunt. And so she's going to get questions from voters across the battleground states. And what we have seen emerge from the vice president and really her Democratic surrogates on her behalf, is say, listen, we understand that Black men are persuadable voters, just like everyone else just because she is a Black woman, she is under no illusion that it is going to be easy to get their support, and that ultimately, even though they may feel a kinship with the former president based on machismo, ultimately she will argue that she is the one that is best suited for the community and really all Americans based on her policy proposals.So, she is going to make that argument tonight in Detroit.

There is so much at stake. Whether America is going to stand on its principles around the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity and stand with our allies around the world, or whether we're going to admire dictators and send during the height of COVID in the pandemic COVID test that nobody could get to the President of Russia for his personal use when Black people were dying every day by the hundreds during that time.",

We have a history of legal and procedural obstacles to that homeownership, starting with the fact nobody got 40 acres and a mule, to redlining, to issues that this Detroit area and people around the country know to be real. So part of my plan is that we're going to give people a $25,000 down payment assistance to get their foot in the door to buy a home for first time home buyers.The work that I'm going to do to increase housing supply in America, knowing that that's one of the reasons that rents and housing prices are jacked up, and to work with the private sector, cut through the red tape and work to build more housing 3 million before the end of my first term. And I give these examples, and there are many more which I will offer. So for example, the work that I will do to extend the child tax credit to $6,000 for young families during the first year of their child's life, because, as you and I both know, our families all have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always resources. So by expanding the child tax credit to the first year of child's life to $6,000 that gives that young family the ability to buy a car seat or a crib or clothes, the things that are so important during that critical phase of that child's development, so that they can get on the road and actually have a chance at succeeding.",

Now it's for federal law enforcement, but a national database for us to collect information and track police officers who have broken the law.

I believe that this is one of our biggest flaws in the current political process. I view politics as a business, and America is one of the biggest corporations in the world. With that being said, I'm here on behalf of the business of the Black community. With all that Black Americans have been through and contribute to the success of America, I feel that there should be an in depth investigation or evaluation of the lack of resources and current living conditions in Black communities nationwide. My question to you is, what's your stance on reparations? We all know that America became great, you know, off the backs of free Black labor. How progressive are you on making it a priority. And right in America's wrongs is understood that you are running for president for all people of America. Asking for specifics for Black communities doesn't mean don't do for others, but Black Americans are heavily asked to vote Democrat in every election for over half a century, with very little in return. What are your plans to address these very important issues and change that narrative?",

      "sentences": "I appreciate that. Thank you and thank you for your work.So, to your point, yes, I am running to be a president for all Americans. That being said, I do have clear eyes about the disparities that exist and the context in which they exist, meaning history to your point. So my agenda -- well, first of all, on the point of reparations, it has to be studied. There's no question about that. And I've been very clear about that position. In terms of my immediate plan, I will tell you a few of the following. One, as it relates to the economy, which is a lot of what you have addressed. Look, I grew up in the middle class. My mother, you know, worked hard, raised me and my sister, and by the time I was in high school, she was able to afford our first home. I know what it means for an individual and a family to have homeownership. I also know, in the context of history, nobody got 40 acres and a mule. We have a history of a number of things, including redlining. Detroit knows it well, a history of, for example, something that still exists that I've worked on to address, which is racial bias and home appraisals. And we know homeownership is Black families are 40 percent less likely to be homeowners than others. And that homeownership is one of the surest ways to build intergenerational wealth, right? Because when you own a home, that's when if your child says, daddy, I want to go to college, you can say, sweetheart, don't have to take out a loan, I'll take some equity out of the house. Or if your child says, I want to start the same -- a small business, same point, right? So, my plan includes making sure that for first time homebuyers, they have a $25,000 down payment assistance to just get their foot in the door, because we know folks will work hard, they'll save and pay that monthly mortgage. Second point is to bring down the cost of housing generally, because one of the issues is we have a housing supply shortage, and so that's about working with the private sector. In terms of our small businesses, which are part of the backbone of the economy, of the black community, and part of the backbone of America's economy writ large. My second mother, the woman who helped raise us was a small business owner. I know who our small business owners are. And I have convened black small business owners way before I was running for president. In my official office at the White House to talk with young entrepreneurs, mostly young, about the work that they are doing that is about clean energy, work, technology as well as the traditional, you know, whether it be a barber shop or a restaurant, one of the big issues facing black entrepreneurs and black small businesses is access to capital. Because unlike my opponent, who got handed $400 million on a silver platter and then filed bankruptcy six times, don't forget that, calls himself a businessman, not everybody has access to the capital, but they -- but we know in the community, we do not lack for ambition, aspirations, dreams, hard, work ethic. And so my work has been as Vice President to increase billions of dollars into community banks. And as Vice President, part of that work will also be to change the tax deduction for startup small businesses from $5,000 to $50,000 because nobody can start a small business on $5,000. And if you don't otherwise have intergenerational wealth, how are you going to be able to do it? Second point on small business is this, I'm going to do basically, it's a program that is about a $20,000 non-refundable loan to a certain to -- to, basically, businesses that don't have access to wealth and don't have those relationships, which is going to directly impact a lot of small, biz -- black owned small businesses. That $20,000 non-refundable loan is what would help somebody if they need to buy equipment, right? If they need to buy an extra chuck, depending on what that business is, which we know that's a big part of what holds back our small businesses, just having enough capital to actually pay for the things that allow you to then put your hard work into play to actually grow your business. The other piece, and this is something that is critically important, is to see black folks, and in particular black men as a whole human being. And understand that we are talking about sons. We are talking about fathers. We are talking about grandsons. We are talking about grandparents. We're talking about uncles. And -- and, and so I say that as a preface to say two other things, and then I'll -- I'll keep going. One to deal with --",

And then a similar point is this, 40 percent of caregivers are men. And we know culturally, we take care of our elders. And we have a lot of men in the community who are in the sandwich generation, who are trying to take care of their young kids and take care of an elder parent or relative. And it's -- it -- it -- it's overwhelming for people to be able to do both, and a lot of people have to end up thinking about leaving their job to just do it.",

Medicare cover the cost of home healthcare for seniors, which means that you are looking at individuals in the context of their whole family.Because what we know is, again, understanding the culture, understanding the reality lots of people are having to leave work in order to do that. So these are some examples of my agenda.

Democracy is also very fragile. It will only be strong, as our willingness, we the people to fight for it. And that as much as anything is what's at play in this election. Fight for our democracy, flawed though it is, imperfect though it may be. Because there are very two real paths right now, the man has told you he intends to terminate the Constitution, the man has told you all these things about his disregard and disrespect for your freedoms and liberty, including the right of a woman to make decisions about her own body. And he hand-selected three members of United States Supreme Court with the intention they would do exactly what they did. One out of three women in America lives in a -- in a state with the Trump abortion ban. You know every state except Virginia in the south has an abortion ban? You know where the majority of black women live? In the south, in those same states that have some of the highest rates of black maternal mortality.

So yesterday I read that there is a new opportunity agenda, a plan for black men which includes a proposal, a forgivable loans up to $20,000 for 1 million black entrepreneurs. What would you say to the people that will consider the timing of that -- of this proposal as political timing and how would you speak to the sentiment that support for black men is on the sought-out during election cycles and feels that building trust requires a consistent engagement and genuine investment into the community outside of election periods and po -- and political benefits for politicians and may view that some people in a Democrat Party use black Americans to play identity politics?[17:50:28] HARRIS: So first of all, thank you for your question and for being here. I've been in this race about 70 days. You can look at all my work before those 70 days to know that this -- what I'm talking about right now is not new and is not for the sake of winning this election. This is about a long standing commitment, including the work that I've done as Vice President and before when I was Senator and before that. In fact, a lot of what I'm doing that is about my -- my economic agenda, an opportunity economy was born out of the work I did as Vice President and before that as Senator most -- most recently to get access to capital for our entrepreneurs. The work that I did in the Senate was about getting a couple billion more dollars into our community banks and then building on that when I became Vice President. I created it -- it's called the Economic Opportunity Council bringing in some of the biggest banks and technology companies to put more into the community banks. And I'm going to tell you one of the reasons why because I have been aware for years, black entrepreneurs only get 1 percent of venture capital funding. Of all the venture capital funding, only 1 percent goes to black entrepreneurs. We don't -- we don't have the same rates of -- of access to capital, be it through family or through connections, which is why I've done the work of putting billions more dollars and working to put billions more dollars into community banks which go direct -- directly to the community. My work around the $20,000 is building on that and understanding that, you know, I convene for example, I -- I said this earlier, a group of -- of black entrepreneurs, way before I was running for -- for president in my official office at the White House, to hear some of the obstacles that they were facing and one of them was what we need to do around getting folks the help to just be able to buy the equipment they need to run their business. And often time, we find that when black entrepreneurs and black people apply for credit, they're denied at a higher rate than others. We have also seen and the data proves this, that all of those -- the realities also tend to -- to -- to swayed black folks and black entrepreneurs in particular from even applying for credit. So, my point is to work on every way that we can approach the issue to encourage people and -- and invest in their ambition. Because I know the ambition is there. I know the talent is there. I know the innovation is there. And certainly the hard work ethic. So, this is not new work for me. And --",

And, you are absolutely right, Charlamagne, you will look at the growth of the economy under in compare Democratic and Republican administrations.Democrats have been -- have accelerated economic growth. My plan for example, OK, so some of the smartest economists in the country have reviewed and compared my plan to Donald Trump's plan for the economy, from Goldman Sachs to Moody's to 16 Nobel Laureates and even most recently \"The Wall Street Journal.\" And in comparing our two plans, the net results is my plans will strengthen the economy. His plans will weaken the economy. There are reports coming back and include the fact that Donald Trump's plans for the economy would accelerate inflation and invite a recession by the middle of next year. My plans would strengthen the economy as a whole. You look at under what we've been doing. You look at the stock market is one of the strongest it's ever been. Wages have outpaced inflation. Inflation is going down to, I think it's now, the most recent numbers 2.4 percent. So but those, you know, nobody wants to hear a Econ 101 lecture, right? But the reality of it, to your point, is that under Democratic rule, the economy gets strengthened and certainly when you look at my plan for when -- for my presidency, it will strengthen the economy and it will help people. And as per the conversation we've been having today, perhaps the -- the -- the -- the issue is that I'm going always think about it in the context of, how am I helping working people? How am I helping families? How am I helping people in the middle class? How am I helping people who have been without access having access? That's how I talk about it. But my plan is about strengthening the economy and I know when you strengthen the economy that's how you do it. You do it by investing in the middle class. Let me tell you a contrast, Donald Trump thinks about the economy based on what he has done and will do, cutting taxes for billionaires in the biggest corporations. That's how he thinks about the economy. He thinks about the economy, not about the middle class people trying to, not just get by but get ahead, no.
