He sent a mob, an armed mob to the United States capital where they violently assaulted police officers, law enforcement officials and threatened the life of his own vice president. And he refused to engage in the peaceful transfer of power. Were it not for the courage and patriotism of Vice President Pence that day, Donald Trump might have actually succeeded in overturning the will of the American people. Let's reflect on that. And now Donald Trump is telling us how he intends to use power hour if he is elected again. He has stated that one of the biggest threats America faces is, quote, the enemy from within. (BOOS)",

It was actually my favorite committee for a number of reasons but specifically this -- there we dealt with some of the most pressing issues affecting national security, there we would talk about hotspots around the world, and what we needed to do, to focus on keeping America safe and secure. And to do that, we would review classified information which required us to meet in a secure room. Adam, you know it's called a SCIF, okay. When we would go in that room, with all due respect, no cameras were allowed. No press, and we would roll up our sleeves and get to work. I'm telling you, senators of both parties would walk in that room, take off their suit jackets, roll up their sleeves, have a cup of coffee on the table and we would have real conversations, real conversations, as Americans, because we understood that what happened in that room -- well, the stakes were so high, and therefore, it could not be -- we could not afford to let it be about whether one was a Democrat or a Republican. The stakes were too high. We were in that room and it was all about us as Americans, about doing what is in the best interest of the safety and security of our nation.

I'm Jake Tapper.And you have been watching Vice President Kamala Harris speaking at a campaign event in Washington Crossing, Pennsylvania, in battleground Pennsylvania, specifically Washington Crossing is in Bucks County, the most Republican of the suburban collar counties outside Philadelphia, where Harris needs to run up the vote in order to compensate for how well Trump will do in the more rural parts of Pennsylvania. She especially needs to run up the vote among many moderate Republicans. Harris was joined today. You see her talking to them right now. There's Bill Kristol, Olivia Troye, Adam Kinzinger, Geoff Duncan, others. You see them standing there. We also know Geoff Duncan, of course, the former lieutenant governor of Georgia, Adam Kinzinger on the right there from Illinois and others, Olivia Troye, who worked for Mike Pence in the White House. These are decidedly Republicans in a part of the state where she needs to do well with Republicans. Let's bring in CNN political commentators Kate Bedingfield who is the former Biden White House communications director, and former Obama senior advisor David Axelrod. David, what do you make of the case Harris just laid out and what do you make of Democrats who are critical of the fact that she is reaching out to Republicans instead of focusing more on getting out the Democratic base, African-Americans, Latinos, young people, et cetera.",

Obviously, she needs to talk about the economy. She needs to talk about cost. She's been doing that I think.But we have seen evidence -- we saw it in the 2022 midterms, we saw it after the vice presidential debate in some of the focus groups here on CNN after that debate, some of those moderate swing voters undecided, said that the moment that J.D. Vance wouldn't say that Donald Trump lost the election in 2020 was a deal breaker for them. So we know that for moderate independent suburban voters, some of whom are going to be critical in deciding the outcome of this election, especially in a state like Pennsylvania, you know, we know that this argument does carry weight with them. And you know, the other thing that she has to do here in the final stretch of the campaign is, you know, she has to motivate people who may be feeling across the board apathetic about the process, may be feeling not super energized to vote, and laying out the stakes, reminding people what's really at stake here, showing, you know, Republicans, lifelong Republicans who won't vote for Trump because of the things that he said, you know, that undermine our constitution, you know, that's reminding people that this is a critically important moment that choosing not to vote is effectively voting for Trump, and so trying to really kind of light a fire in the last three weeks of this race.

Why is healthcare so radically underfunded when it comes to other federal programs like the V.A. or Medicare or Medicaid? When you start talking about economic development, inside the -- inside Indian Country, the -- we -- it's like a third world country when you go to some of these reservations. The economic development is rich, be underneath our feet and above the ground. But for some reason we have to ask permission. And what President Trump is trying to push out there is self- determination and sovereignty, actually understanding Indian Country and what that means inside the treaties when it talks about self- determination and it talks about a sovereign nation.

And how would we really get after it understanding that Social Security and Medicare together account for about 40 percent of all federal government spending? And so some thoughts about how to balance the budget need to be put into context of what we're really spending today. And what we're spending it on, second area. Third area, we talk about health. The rise and accidental deaths, which includes most significantly the rise in overdoses is tremendous. We all know that, but if you really look at the data, we've gone from about 3,000 deaths per -- sorry, yeah, about 3,000 -- so about 73,000 deaths per year from fentanyl and that's in an environment in which there are other overdose types, cocaine, meth, that are exploded.
