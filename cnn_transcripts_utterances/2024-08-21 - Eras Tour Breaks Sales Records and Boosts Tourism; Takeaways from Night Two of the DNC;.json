You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz will headline day three of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The Minnesota Governor will give his speech tonight after former President Bill Clinton. Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz has fought off a primary challenge in Florida, setting him up for a chance at re-election this November. Gaetz was up against a candidate backed by his nemesis and former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy. And Montana is now the eighth state to add abortion rights to the November ballot. Voters will consider an amendment to the state's constitution that would protect access to the medical procedure. Abortion rights have become a key election issue nationwide after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade two years ago. Iran now says its retaliation against Israel for the killing of Hamas leader in Tehran must be carefully calibrated. Iran's U.N. mission says it's to avoid adversely impacting a possible ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas. Well, for more, let's go to CNN's Fred Pleitgen live in Tehran, live in the parliament there, where they're voting in a cabinet. We'll get to that in a moment. But just, it does seem that Iran is sort of walking back, if you like, the seriousness of the strike that could yet be coming against Israel. What's the feeling from there?",

They also said that there would be an adequate response, but not necessarily how hard they plan to hit the Israelis. Now, overnight, we had that statement from Iran's U.N. mission in New York, where they also said that it would be at a time of their choosing. But they also, for the first time, said that they did not want all of this to have adverse effects on a possible ceasefire in Gaza. Of course, those talks are ongoing. I spoke to the former commanding general of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps yesterday, and he did say that he believed that Iran needed to create deterrence. Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MOHSEN REZAEE, FORMER COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY GUARD CORPS (through translator): The occupying power of Jerusalem is a regime that will continue its evil acts if it does not receive a harsh response.

What's your reaction to that?REZAEE (through translator): The U.S. is highly vulnerable to Iran. The commanders of the U.S. military are aware of Iran's capabilities. Therefore, they will avoid taking action against Iran. On the other hand, the U.S. is facing problems regarding their own defense coasts. There has to be a ceasefire in Gaza soon. The United States and Israel should not repeat their mistakes. If, in the first weeks of the Gaza War, the United States had stopped Israel and Netanyahu, the war would not extend. So, the main element of the extension of the war are the U.S. and Israel. The more this war extends, the more the United States will be damaged. (END VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (on camera): And that's something, John, that we've heard from several Iranian officials, that they do want a ceasefire to happen. Obviously, the Iranians are also very closely watching the talks that have been taking place, first in Doha and now a set move to Cairo. At the same time, the Iranians did change their tune to a certain degree in that, in the past, they had said that the issue of the ceasefire and the issue of their retaliation were completely separate. Now, for the first time, they are saying that they don't want any sort of retaliation to have those adverse effects, as they put it, on a possible ceasefire -- John.",

Lithuania even suggested they were bringing troops in from the Baltic enclave of Kaliningrad.I think the sense from talking to experts that I get is the resistance is now taking greater shape. We may start to see a more coordinated response. But in terms of President Putin and how he's been dealing with this, we see this sort of haphazard crisis management playbook that we've seen play out in the past. I want to show you an interesting split screen because we've seen him in southern Russia in the last couple of days. And on Tuesday, you see on the left of your screen, in Vladikavkaz, in the Caucasus, meeting with the Russian people, greeting them. And compare that to what's on the right in Dagestan just a few days after Prigozhin's aborted mutiny. These are relatively unusual scenes for the president, really an attempt to sort of reassert his popularity. And of course, he continues to claim and did so somewhat strangely on a visit to Beslan for the 20th anniversary of that terror attack. He continues to claim that what's happening in Kursk is in fact a terror attack. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): As for those opponents and enemies of ours that I mentioned, they continue this work of trying to destabilize our country.
