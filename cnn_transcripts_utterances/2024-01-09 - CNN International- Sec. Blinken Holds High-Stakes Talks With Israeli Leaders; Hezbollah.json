Just ahead, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in Israel in a new effort to prevent the Israel-Hamas war from spreading.Then France has a new prime minister. Why Gabriel Attal is already making history? And we'll be live in Washington, D.C., where Donald Trump is expected to appear in court if he argues that he's immune from criminal prosecution. Israel's military says Monday was one of the deadliest days for its troops since its ground operations in Gaza began. The IDF says nine soldiers lost their lives, six in central Gaza, the other three in the south. In all, 185 soldiers have been killed in the war since October the 7th. Meanwhile, the top U.S. diplomat is in Israel trying to stop the war between Israel and Hamas from becoming a regional war. Anthony Blinken met with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, for the latest stop in a whirlwind tour of the Middle East. He outlined his priorities earlier after meeting with Israel's president. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Of course, we'll have an opportunity to sit with the families of some of the hostages and discuss our relentless efforts to bring everyone home and back with their families. And there's lots to talk about, in particular, about the way forward. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Israel's foreign minister says the country is responsible for the death of a senior Hezbollah commander on Monday. A Lebanese security source says the commander was killed by an Israeli drone strike on his car in southern Lebanon. In response, Hezbollah drones attacked an IDF military base in northern Israel. The Israeli military says there were no injuries there. Nada Bashir is in Beirut with the very latest on this story, because the question is, what happens next, I guess?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Max. And there is concern, as Jeremy just mentioned, that this could trigger further escalations. We've certainly have seen those tensions ramping up over the last few days and weeks. And what we're beginning to see really on the Lebanese border is a broadening out of this conflict.This strike carried out by Hezbollah this morning on a northern military base in northern Israel is perhaps the deepest strike carried out by Hezbollah since October 8th. They are growing more strategic with their targets, and we saw over the weekend 62 rockets fired towards northern Israel, targeting a key Israeli military observation post. And we've heard those repeated warnings now from Hezbollah, including Secretary General Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah, that any action by the Israeli military on Lebanese territory will not go unpunished. The response from Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group in Lebanon, will be limitless. Now, of course, we have continued to see that exchange of fire, and this has been escalating, as you mentioned just yesterday. We saw Wissam al-Tawil, a senior Hezbollah commander, killed in southern Lebanon by an Israeli drone strike, according to a Lebanese security source that was later confirmed by the Israeli foreign ministry. That has certainly ramped up tensions on what he is the most senior Hezbollah leader to have been killed, or commander, rather, to have been killed since the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. And, of course, this comes just a week after a senior Hamas leader, Saleh al-Arouri, was killed in the southern suburbs of Beirut by an apparent Israeli drone strike. Though important to note that Israel has neither claimed responsibility nor denied responsibility for that strike, but a U.S. official has told CNN that Israel was indeed behind the strike according to a U.S. assessment. So, of course, mounting concern. We are seeing Israel in turn carrying out strikes in southern Lebanon. The Israeli officials on the military side and political front have been clear. They want to push Hezbollah back away from the border area. And officials in Israel have described what they're seeking to be a new security reality on the border. But, of course, that will not be received well by Hezbollah. It is a somewhat different story, of course, when it comes to the Lebanese government. They have been clear that while they have condemned Israel for what they say to be pulling -- seeking to pull Lebanon into a new phase of confrontation, they do not want to see a war on their southern border. They do not want to see a war with Israel. And we have seen a flurry of diplomatic activity. As Jeremy mentioned, we saw the E.U.'s Foreign Affairs Chief Josep Borrell in Beirut just over the weekend. He met with Hezbollah officials there, and we are now seeing Secretary of State Antony Blinken traveling around the Middle East, meeting with officials, but also, of course, in Israel. Crucially, Secretary Blinken has been clear, the U.S. does not believe a war would be in the interest of either Hezbollah or in the interest of Israel, but we are hearing warning signs from Israeli officials as well. They have been clear that they will continue to respond to any military threats they deem necessary along the Lebanese border. And, in fact, we have heard now from Israel's Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, who spoke to the Wall Street Journal, saying that while Israel is not necessarily seeking a war with Hezbollah. If deemed necessary, in his words, they will copy and paste their military actions in Gaza, in Beirut. Now that would, of course, certainly raise alarm bells. Those diplomatic efforts to try to defuse the situation, still, of course, ongoing. Max?",

But even here in France, he was completely unknown until 2017 when he first won his seat in Parliament, and his rise has been fairly meteoric since. He was named as a spokesman for the government, then as a minister for public works and public administration, and now, of -- and then education minister, which is what he was until this nomination.Now, it had been widely anticipated that there would be a cabinet reshuffle, as you mentioned, Elisabeth Borne arrives at the end of a very tumultuous 20-month long tenure in the post as Prime Minister. There were, of course, those -- the trouble of pension reform, those many months of dustbins not being collected from the streets, of riots down the streets of Paris. There were the riots over the killing of a young man of Algerian descent by the police. It's been a tricky time and yet she seemed to be a survivor. All of this she survived, including, by the way, also the loss of the government's majority in Parliament. Still, Emmanuel Macron had continued to back her, which seems to have been the difficulty too far was the immigration law introduced at the end of this year, of last year that has seen tremendous trouble. It's still not through. It saw one minister resign from Emmanuel Macron's own side, and there had been rumors that her time may have come. That reshuffle had been widely tipped. The question of Gabriel Attal as a replacement had been something that there had been a lot of speculation around. It is said that in the French press, Max, that there had been resistance from other of the heavy hitters within Emmanuel Macron's government, many of his ministers to that nomination. He's very young. He's seen as a staunch Macronist. There's a lot of opposition to his name also amongst the opposition benches. Still, he -- that position of powers, they call it here in France, the actual handing over the post will happen within the next half hour at Matignon, where the Prime Minister traditionally works. And Gabriel Attal takes over. He will then be heading to the north of France for his first move away from Paris, his first trip to the field. And then we expect that he will announce the rest of his cabinet as Emmanuel Macron looks ahead these next few months to European elections that are expected to be quite difficult for his side and then of course beyond to the end of his term. But yes, big news in so far as Gabriel Attal is the youngest in the fifth Republic that is since 1958 and also the first, as you said, openly gay minister. Very fresh faced young man to come into a post that has seen such difficulty these last few months. Max? [08:15:02] FOSTER: Of course. Melissa, thank you so much. Pope Francis is calling for a universal ban on surrogacy, calling the practice deplorable. At the Vatican on Monday, the pontiff described surrogate motherhood as a grave violation of the dignity of the woman and of the child. The Catholic Church has long opposed surrogacy and in vitro fertilization in part because some embryos are disposed of, but surrogacy has enabled many couples who weren't able to conceive on their own to become parents. CNN's Vatican Correspondent, Christopher Lamb, live for us in London. Hi, Christopher. Just explain the thinking that goes into decisions like this, because there are many people, as I say, who have really benefited from surrogacy.",

      "sentences": "Well, hi, Max. Yes, this is a very strong remarks from Pope Francis, particularly his call for a ban on surrogacy. But as you said, it is in line with the Catholic Church's teaching on the topic.And also Pope Francis has in the past spoken against surrogacy and raised ethical concerns. It seems that his main problem with surrogacy is that it can exploit poorer women who may feel they have to go down this path for financial reasons. And he has, you know, been very clear that the church should stand against this practice. And now he made his speech within a longer speech to ambassadors in the Vatican. And he was linking the need for peace, the path to peace, with the need to protect all human life. Now it's also interesting that his remarks on this topic come very soon after he authorized the blessings of same sex couples and a Vatican declaration that said that the children of same sex couples, including those who are from surrogacy, can receive baptism, can become members of the church. So I think what we see with Francis is a pope who, on the one hand, is very open, wants the church to be merciful, compassionate, and pastoral, but he will, and often in very vivid terms, and in strong terms, defend Catholic teaching on beginning of life matters such as abortion and surrogacy. So it's a balancing act for Francis, but he has often received opposition for his open and pastoral stances on things. He's welcome, but he is also willing to show that he upholds Catholic teaching.",

This is a very crucial hearing, not just for Donald Trump and whether his case is going to go forward, whether he will sit for trial in March as scheduled, but also for the Constitution and the presidency.There is a question being asked today the three judges on the Court of Appeals here at the D.C. Circuit. So that's the federal appeals court that is overseeing D.C. And the trial courts here below the Supreme Court. This court is going to be asking questions about presidential immunity. Is there a bubble that protects the U.S. president whenever he's in office and around the presidency generally to make it so it's very difficult or even impossible to bring criminal charges or to have a person who is a former president sit for trial? So it really is a crucial day. We're not going to be getting an opinion today. We're just going to be hearing questions from these judges and the answers from both the Justice Department and from Donald Trump's team. The judges on this panel today are going to be really fascinating to listen to. There are two female judges appointed by Joe Biden, current President Michelle Childs and Florence Pan, both very experienced experience, had served as appeals court judges on courts before coming to this particular court. And then Karen Henderson, who has been in this court for a very long time, she's a George H.W. Bush appointee. And she asks a lot of questions at arguments like this, and in past cases about the executive branch, about the American presidency and the type of protections around it that there should be. And so we are watching to see how they're going to lean based on the questions that they're asking, but it is a really crucial day. Donald Trump is not going to be asking -- it's not going to be answering any questions himself. It's just going to be his lawyers speaking, but he -- we do expect him to be here in person. Max?",
