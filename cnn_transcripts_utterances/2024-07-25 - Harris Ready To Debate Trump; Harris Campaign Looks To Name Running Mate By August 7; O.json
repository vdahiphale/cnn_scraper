How Kamala Harris, the torch now passed to her began running with it today with a little help from Beyonce.Also, new developments in the search for a running mate, which the Harris campaign wants to get done in less than two weeks. And with the governor of Pennsylvania, one of the possibilities, how does Harris play in the Commonwealth? John King is there. Good evening. Thanks for joining us. We begin tonight with breaking news at the end of what amounts the first full day of a brand new presidential campaign. A contest, which for all the momentum that Kamala Harris may now enjoy, is still according to new polling, very close and going to be very tough. And in the wake of President Biden's speech last night, it is now fully Harris' to win or lose. She met solo tonight with Israel's visiting prime minister, their conversation wrapped up just a short time ago. Afterwards, the vice president spoke briefly to reporters underscoring her support for Israel, reading each of the names of Americans held hostage in Gaza and also speaking out against the humanitarian crisis. there, calling for progress toward a ceasefire deal to end hostilities. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, (R) US VICE PRESIDENT: As I just told Prime Minister Netanyahu, it is time to get this deal done. So, to everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you. Let's get the deal done so we can get a ceasefire to end the war. Let's bring the hostages home and let's provide much needed relief to the Palestinian people. And ultimately, I remain committed to a path forward that can lead to a two-state solution. And I know right now it is hard to conceive of that prospect. But a two-state solution is the only path that ensures Israel remains a secure Jewish and democratic state and one that ensures Palestinians can finally realize the freedom, security, and prosperity that they rightly deserve.

They are going right at Donald Trump and talking about his 34 convictions, and talking about the problems he's had with being found liable for fraud, and all the other problems for the Trump campaign. Now, what is interesting to me today is we've seen, the vice president sort of get into her own lane. It's an adjacent lane to President Biden's lane, but it's her own lane. We saw an ad that had a lot more energy in it or campaign launch video with the Beyonce song. We saw her do this event with Netanyahu and right after with Netanyahu and there, she said something that was a little bit different than the president. She said that, it's important for Israel to defend itself, but it's also important how Israel defends itself, and talked about the Palestinian plight kind of at the same time, she talked about the tragedy of October 7th. A lot of people will hear that and notice that that is something that they really wanted to hear from a Democratic president. And then lastly, she's also talking about, it's not just important to get -- to do well or to get by economically, but it's important to do better than that.

Politicians make about 75 percent of the mistakes for their campaign in the first 25 percent of the race. This is why it's not bad that we have as long campaigns in America as a campaign manager. Because they screw up when they start and then they get their footing and they get better at it. Kamala Harris has been a presidential candidate this time around for 96 hours.

There's another one that surfaced today from 2021, him talking about childless people. But this time, he's saying that their votes should count less than the votes of parents. I want to play this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JD VANCE (R-OH), US VICE PRESIDENT NOMINEE: Let's give votes to all children in this country, but let's give control over those votes to the parents of those children. When you go to the polls in this country as a parent, you should have more power. You should have more of an ability to speak your voice in our Democratic Republic than people who don't have kids. People will say, and I'm sure \"The Atlantic\" and \"The Washington Post\" and all the usual suspects will criticize me about this in the coming days. Well, doesn't this mean that non-parents don't have as much of a voice as parents. Doesn't this mean that parents get a bigger say at how our democracy functions? Yes, absolutely. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

On the Democrat side, I think she's actually got some interesting choices out there. If I were in her shoes and I'm not arguing that he would necessarily automatically deliver Pennsylvania. They can't win without Pennsylvania. Shapiro seems like a talent to me. I agree with Paul conceptually that it's no guarantee, but he's talented. He's from an important state, but most importantly in my mind, you have a lot of whispering in the Democratic Party right now that she should not choose him because he's Jewish. Heck, you've got some hollering in corners of the Democratic Party that she shouldn't choose him because he's Jewish. There are people that think that, that ticket couldn't sustain putting a Jewish person on there. I think if she chose him and said to all of her people on the far progressive left flank, shut up and get in line, this is what we're doing.

She won the popular vote, but she did not. This is something we need to look at. This map's a little crude, but look, Robert Kennedy, the Libertarian Party, and the Green Party, they haven't officially chosen their candidates yet, those parties. So we just have the party label. That's on -- they're on the ballot, those three, in Michigan. At least the Libertarians and the Greens in Wisconsin. Kennedy in Minnesota. You get the picture. This is North Carolina. This is Georgia down here, out here in the western battlegrounds. The third-party candidates will be on the ballot. Why do I want to bring attention to that? Because look at 2016, right? Hillary Clinton got 48 percent of the vote nationally. She won the popular vote, but she lost in these states. She lost in Michigan, Wisconsin, elsewhere. Look, Trump's share was about the same in both elections. It was the third-party candidates that cost Hillary Clinton the election. We cannot forget them going forward.

For years, candidates used folk songs and show tunes before that gave way to the popular music of today, all of it setting the tone for a campaign.

I need everybody.(END VIDEOTAPE) KAYE (on-camera): And, Anderson, over the years, a long list of artists have sent Donald Trump cease-and-desist letters after he was using their music. The estate of Tom Petty, after the artist passed away, sent a letter to the Trump campaign saying, Tom Petty would never want a song used for a campaign of hate. The same goes for the artist Prince. He also got a letter from the estate for Prince saying, please stop using the music. And more interesting, Anderson, is what happened in 2018. Pharrell Williams sent a letter to the Trump campaign saying, stopped using the music because his hit song \"Happy\" had been used just hours at a campaign event, just hours after nearly 12 people had been gunned down at a Pittsburgh synagogue. So there's a history of this with Donald Trump, Anderson.",
