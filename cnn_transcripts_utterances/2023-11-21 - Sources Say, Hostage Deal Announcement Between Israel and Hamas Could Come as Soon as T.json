      "sentences": "Okay. Natash, M.J., Oren, thank you, incredibly significant reporting. Stay with us, we're going to continue to follow this.And it is the top of the hour. We have significant breaking news in to CNN. A hostage deal between Israel and Hamas could be imminent. It could be announced as soon as today. That is what multiple sources tell CNN. M.J. Lee is at the White House with the breaking details. And this is not just a couple of hostages. We're talking about potentially 50 here, right, M.J? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  That's right. We are talking about initially 50 hostages. That is women and children being released in exchange for four to five-day pause in fighting and also in exchange for three Palestinian prisoners for every one hostage that is released. The hostages we are told are of various nationalities and U.S. officials are hopeful that a three-year-old American toddler, who is being held hostage, would be in the mix of that initial 50 hostages that is released. It is unclear at this moment, though, whether there are going to be other Americans in the mix of the 50 hostages released. Now, importantly, during the pause of the four to five days, Hamas has agreed to or will agree to, if this agreement comes to fruition, stop flying surveillance drones over Northern Gaza. This would be at least six hours a day, we are told. We are also told that the idea is that during this pause, Hamas would use the stop in fighting, the cessation in fighting to try to gather up more hostages, more women and children. And if that were to happen, then there is the potential for this pause in fighting to be extended so that more hostages can get out. Now, another important piece of this, of course, is the idea of humanitarian aid that would go into Gaza. U.S. officials and others have been pushing for as much aid to go in as possible. Hamas has been making the point from the beginning that a pause is necessary for more aid to go in. U.S. officials, I think, would certainly agree with that. But, of course, this has been an incredibly contentious area of negotiation because one thing that Hamas is pushing for a lot of is fuel. And fuel, as many experts have said, is exactly what helps to shore up its military operations, like ventilating underground tunnels and everything else. And so we'll see when the agreement comes out. Again, sources say that this could be announced as soon as today. When that comes out, if where we land in terms of the amount, the number of trucks of aid that would go into Gaza, you know, there have been weeks and weeks of negotiations that so far have not been fruitful. It has been incredibly tenuous, incredibly complicated with multiple parties involved. But, again, right now the headline this morning is that sources are feeling optimistic that a deal could be announced as soon as today for the release of 50 hostages, women and children.",

      "sentences": "M.J., I know there is a chance that some of the Americans may be among those 50. It is again not clear. We don't have a list of who these people will be. There's a lot of hope, though, that the youngest known American hostage, three-year-old Abigail Edan, whose parents were killed, may be among those released. Is there any further guidance on whether that could happen this morning?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. Although I will say the families have heard before that a deal is imminent, even if it sounds more serious and more likely to happen now. The word imminent is something they effectively hate here and don't want to hear it anymore. They want to hear that a deal is done and that their family members are coming home today.And we could feel the frustration and the anger as we spoke with them when they finally met with the war cabinet at the defense ministry late last night. That meeting lasted several hours. We spoke with one of the family members who came out early because he was so frustrated that there was no new information. Although he was happy to finally meet the war cabinet, he felt that there was no new information provided from what they already knew. So, at that point he simply left early. Crucially, we asked him, have you been given any updated information on the time line for the release of any hostages? And he said, no, there was no such information provided, not by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and not by other members of the war cabinet. Now, the government here has been incredibly quiet and secretive about how that's going, but that would be more frustration and more anger for the families of the hostages to find out that less than 24 hours after they met with the prime minister and other members of the government that have to approve something like this, there is a hostage deal that they simply weren't told about. Another key question, of course, is who is released? Is it Israel that decides who comes out? Is it Hamas? Are full families released together? Or does Hamas not have the families held together and not know where different members of them are? So, that will be another key question here that the families will want to hear. From Israel's perspective, one of the concerns with even a short-term pause in the fighting was that Israel and particularly the government still see it as their mission to destroy Hamas, and yet restarting a campaign, certainly a campaign of this scale we have seen happening in Gaza, restarting that after a pause in fighting as international criticism mounts as the death toll there surpasses 12,000. That in and of itself could be incredibly difficult, especially if there is a longer pause in fighting for the release of not only the first 50 but more to come in more batches. It becomes incredibly difficult for Israel to continue its operation in Gaza. And that is one of the war cabinet's concerns because they still see very much -- part of their goal as to destroy Hamas. In fact, I'll make this last point. When we spoke with family members who came out of the meeting, they wanted to hear unequivocally that the number one priority was the release of the hostages. There was quite a bit of anger when they didn't hear that. The war cabinet told them rescuing the hostages and bringing them out is as important as defeating Hamas, not at all what they want to hear.",

      "sentences": "All of those points, they are important. Natasha, I want to bring you in on this. As Oren pointed out, the families have said, look, we have been told this is imminent before. We almost don't want to hear that unless we know it's actually happening. Until it happens, there are still a lot of unknowns. U.S. officials seemed optimistic yesterday when they were asked, but cautious.Looking at this, there are a number of security concerns, which Oren just laid out. What are you hearing from your sources this morning in terms of where this may stand and what it could actually look like, to Oren's point?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, I mean, I think there are just so many parties involved in this, including parties that are obviously negotiating through intermediaries. The U.S. does not communicate directly with Hamas. They're communicating with them about this entire negotiation through Qatar and Egypt, that it makes it very unpredictable.And anything on the ground could also significantly shift the dynamics in this hostage release because, of course, we have seen Hamas pull back from these negotiations in recent days in response to certain Israeli actions on the ground, in particular, that Israeli raid on Al- Shifa hospital. And so the dynamics on the ground could really impact whether or not Hamas agrees to follow through with this hostage release. And I think that the cautious optimism we are seeing, of course, has to do with the fact that they believe that there has been consistent and sustained diplomacy going on for the last couple of days that are leading to the sense that these dozens and dozens of hostages could be released soon. But, of course, it is so touch-and-go, the fact that Hamas has pulled back, has disappeared in recent days, only to re-emerge, it makes this very, very, you know, untenable to say that this is going to be a done deal until actually a deal is reached, and until you see these hostages actually exiting Gaza. And so I think one of the big questions now is this question about the drone surveillance flights over Gaza. You know, how sustainable actually is that for the Israelis to pause those flights, especially because the U.S. is also helping with those drone flights over Gaza and has been so key in monitoring Hamas, in monitoring or trying to monitor where the hostages actually are. And so there are just so many moving parts to this that it is unclear at this point what exactly it's going to look like.",

The issue with a ceasefire is complex. Israel needs to redeploy its forces and pull back. I don't believe that drones will stop floating over Gaza Strip. Israel is still collecting intelligence information. And there's no reason for Israel to believe that Hamas would implement a ceasefire when it does. So, it needs to be on guard and ready for any violation of the ceasefire which could also block the deal as well anywhere down the road.",

It is unclear if that announcement happens when the hostages would be released. But our reporting is that it would call for the release of 50 women and children being held by Hamas in exchange for a four to five-day pause in fighting.This all comes as the White House is reacting to recent polling that shows President Biden losing support other his handling of the Israel- Hamas War. Listen to this from White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  What I'll be very clear about is we're not going to govern by polls here. We're going to -- or poll numbers. We're not going to change the minds of Americans. I get that. Americans are going to feel how they feel. (END VIDEO CLIP) HILL:  In terms of those feelings, the polls show a broad lack of support among several groups. But it's especially pronounced, as you can see here, among young voters. This NBC News poll shows 70 percent of voters ages 13 to 34 disapprove of Biden's handling of the war. Joining us now is CNN Chief National Correspondent John king. So, the White House being very careful in language for obvious reasons, they respect the polls there. Americans are going to feel how they're going to feel. It's not going to sway their approach. I keep wondering, though, what are those real conversations privately? This makes sense as a public statement, but that has to be concerning.",
