New details ofthe deadly daytime rescue operation that freed four hostages in Hamas captivity. This as the U.S. Secretary of State arrives in region. He is calling for more pressure on Hamas to agree to a ceasefire deal. Plus, European Parliamentary elections lead to a major political shakeup in France. Well, we're getting new details and we are hearing new accounts from hostages freed in the daring Israeli read in Gaza. Palestinians also giving terrifying descriptions of what was one of the deadliest days of the Israel Hamas war and one of the most consequential events of this conflict. Listen firstly to the mother of freed hostage Almog Meir. Unfortunately, I don't have that at the moment. I'll come back to that. Officials in Gaza report more than 270 people killed during the operation. Israel says the number was below 100. CNN unable to verify casualty numbers from Gaza and the information released doesn't differentiate between civilians and militants. Whatever that exact number, though, is, Palestinian witnesses say the raid was brutal, and deadly.

On the question of proportionality. Without getting into the debate itself, we'll simply say that, for many who have observed this is very much black and white. For Israel, it was worth it. For the U.S., you have seen a backing of the operation, a welcoming of the release of the hostages, but also an acknowledgement that Palestinian civilians were tragically killed in this operation. And then you have seen a simple condemnation from other countries, Egypt and many others, essentially saying there were too many killed here.

He wasadamant in a press gaggle this morning in Cairo that Israel has accepted this proposal that is on the table. He said not only had they accepted it, that they were critical in putting it forward. So, he's sort of downplayed this public rhetoric we have heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu and others in the Israeli government that they have not accepted this deal that is on the table. And Blinken said that his message to all of these regional partners who he will be seeing throughout this extensive diplomatic push will be that Hamas needs to say, yes, they need to press the group to say yes. Now we should note, Becky, that this proposal has been on the table for more than a week now. And we have not heard an official response from the group. There have been statements. But the U.S. does not see these as an official response. They are waiting for indication that the group's leader Sinwar or someone who has the ability to make a decision has made a decision on this proposal that it is on the table. He said this will be a key aspect of his meetings here in the region. He just met with Egyptian leaders there in Cairo. He said that they had been in touch with Hamas within the past hours. But he did not give any indication about whether the group would say yes or when they would put forward their answer. Now, the Secretary of State noted that this deal is the best thing to stop the suffering of the Palestinians to get to a ceasefire and to secure the release of the hostages, especially the American hostages who are still being held by Hamas. Take a listen to what he said on this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The best way, the most effective way to get everyone home, including the American hostages is through this proposal, is through the ceasefire deal that's on the table right now.

And Blinken said that in the absence of any of these plans, we could see either a vacuum where Hamas and other groups would be able to take advantage or there would be possibly an Israeli occupation, or there would just be absolute chaos. So, he is really going to be pushing that all of these plans are ready to go if and when this proposal moves forward. And a ceasefire is put in place, Becky.",

You and I have spoken over the last eight months about each and every one of those trips. Antony Blinken had wanted to get conversations going, you know, months ago, about the day after as it were. Now, once the ceasefire is in place. What happens next? Is there any indication from state, from your sources at present about how optimistic or not the Secretary of State is about furthering those conversations?

But we're seeing much more reaction Becky in France, you can see that French bond yields have spiked, those are borrowing costs. And you're looking at some equity markets really read across Europe right there. But look at Paris's CAC (INAUDIBLE), which is down nearly two percent. It was down lower and some stocks being hit particularly hard like bank stocks, BNP Paribas, SOCJEN (ph) and so on. Now, this speaks to the situation in France, the uncertainty with the election, but also the fact that investors had a few question marks about France already heading into this weekend, largely because France has something of a debt problem so much so that at the end of last month, S&amp;P the credit rating agency actually downgraded France's long term credit rating. And that's because its government debt burden stands at over 110 percent of GDP, its budget deficit, Becky, is 5.5 percent of GDP. That is way above the threshold in the E.U., which is actually three percent. And what this new election means is that you could see a president with a hostile parliament, potentially a far-right prime minister, and how easy will it be them for President Macron to implement all of the reforms, the spending cuts that he's planned to do to try and bring those debts down? So, for investors at this stage, it's looking much less likely that he'll be able to do that.",

Then, you have the situation in the United States, President Biden is in a very vulnerable position with his re-election, scenes of more civilian carnage and Gaza will further strange him from members of the progressive part of the Democratic Party, which is very critical in many key states to his re-election. So, what President Biden needs for humanitarian, diplomatic and political reasons is this for this war to end soon, it looks like we're going to go through a long grinding conflict in Gaza that could well go all the way up to his reelection effort in November, and that's a very tough position for the president to be in.",

There are thousands of Arab American voters in Michigan, for example, who have already registered a protest against Biden, voting against him in the Democratic primary. There are a lot of progressive voters who have been appalled by the scenes from Gaza in Wisconsin. Biden won Wisconsin by 20,000 votes last time. He won Michigan by about 150,000. It doesn't take many votes to shift for many people not to show up for Biden, for him to be in trouble in an election in which he's already losing to Trump on key issues like immigration and the economy. Foreign policy doesn't generally decide U.S. presidential elections, but any hemorrhaging of Biden's vote at the margins makes this very difficult. We have open revolt from many on the left against the president, progressive members standing up and criticizing him over his Israel policy. We could see protests at the Democratic National Convention in August that could play into Trump's contention that cities are sort of tumbling out of control in terms of law and order. So, this is an exceedingly difficult effort. Then, we have on the right, the Republicans are trying to stoke this as much as they can to keep Biden between the left and the right, if you like. Netanyahu is coming here, principally at the invitation of Republican members of Congress to address Congress in July. That is going to exacerbate all this.
