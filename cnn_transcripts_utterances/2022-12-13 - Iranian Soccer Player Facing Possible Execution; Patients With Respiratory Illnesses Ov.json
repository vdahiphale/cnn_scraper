The final inflation report of the year arrived, and it is the coolest inflation report of the year. Why this could mean real relief just in time for the holiday shopping season. And happening right now, blizzards, tornadoes, whiteouts already leaving destruction, as 40 million people across the U.S. are still under threat of severe weather. We're tracking the major storms. Plus, it's being described as worse than Enron. This morning, the one time darling of the crypto world who was able to woo superstars hit with DOJ and SEC charges for an alleged scheme that wiped out billions. Let's start with the good economic news, inflation cooling more than expected last month. The Consumer Price Index rose 7.1 percent year to year. Now, that is the lowest that number has been since last December. Keep in mind, this doesn't mean inflation is gone. It means prices aren't rising as quickly. And here's the key. It's a trend. On the far right side of that graph, you can see that line taking a sharp dive. That is five straight months of cooling inflation, which is what you want to see, right?

But the bottom line is that we are seeing a cooling in inflation. Now, this is happening for a lot of reasons. I think I give the Fed a lot of credit here. But there's also been some slowing down of the global economy. That tends to bring down prices. That helps some as a tailwind as well. I am hopeful that, by next year, you're going to see inflation really significantly lower than it is now.",

My view is that wage inflation, when you look at all the other kinds of inflation that consumers are dealing with, is actually pretty low, if not negative in some ways, if you count in that real cost of living.

He's accused of a multibillion-dollar scheme that funneled customer funds from his FTX crypto exchange to his hedge fund. CNN's Kara Scannell and Matt Egan are tracking this.

And what prosecutors and the SEC alleged in their complaints and indictment is that this was a massive fraud that they alleged started at the very inception. There are a couple of different alleged schemes here, but one of them is that FTX is a trading platform. Well, Sam Bankman-Fried had a hedge fund. They say that they directed customer deposits and misused them by giving them to the hedge fund to cover its own loans and its expenses. And according to the SEC, Bankman-Fried had also used the money from the customer deposits to buy luxury real estate in the Bahamas for him, his family, and other executives. He also took out allegedly $1.3 billion in loans. And he also donated tens of millions of dollars to political campaigns. Now, that is also one of these criminal charges, a conspiracy to violate federal campaign laws. So, one of my colleagues has tallied the numbers. And it looks like, in this past year in this past cycle, Bankman-Fried had donated more than $900,000 to candidates and $39 million to outside groups. That's just a huge amount of money in the campaign finance world. This comes as he was supposed to be appearing before the House Financial Services Committee. Also testifying here today, though, is the person who's the new CEO of FTX, John Ray. He's an experienced turnaround, restructuring expert.

Right now, 40 million people are in the path as life-threatening blizzard warnings and tornado threats track east. First, take a look at the whiteout conditions hitting at least five states, crippling travel. More than 20 people were injured when this tour bus slid off the road, flipped onto its side. This was in Utah. And get this. The snow is so deep in Alaska right now, where they're used to snow, but for the first time ever, schools in Anchorage were closed for a fourth straight day. And where it's not snowing, possible tornadoes are now striking several homes already severely damaged in Texas. Let's get right to meteorologist Chad Myers. Chad, what is the latest? CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST:  I think, Ana, that the fact that this thing stretches all the way from the U.S.-Canadian border all the way to the Gulf Coast tells you a lot about the power of this storm. We have tornado watches down to the south, so far, no real warnings yet at this hour, but they could pop up any time. These storms have been rotating all day. The top part of the rotation is where the blizzard is happening, significant wind, significant snow coming down here, parts of South Dakota, North Dakota, parts of Nebraska, even into Colorado. And the wind speeds are in the 40s and almost to the 50s at times today. And visibility in Sidney and Akron -- that's Colorado and Nebraska -- zero, literally zero, no visibility at all with this blowing snow. So where does it go from here? Well, this part, this dangerous part with the tornado possibility moves to the east. And that will bring some chances for tornadoes again overnight in the dark. And then this part up here moves off to the northern part of Minnesota and Wisconsin. There will even be some ice on that northern part, where the snow doesn't make it all the way to the ground and then it melts and then it refreezes. And you could get some freezing rain and sleet coming in. Down to the South, thunderstorms all the way through Atlanta, by the time we work our way closer to the weekend. And then, just in case you want to try to go somewhere on Thursday afternoon, here you go for Pennsylvania, parts of Upstate New York getting in on the snow part. So we will take that when we can get it. The West really needed the rain and the snow. But this, this is not good. This is just a mess.",

This is an mRNA vaccine, the same as the Moderna and Pfizer shots that have been given out during COVID. This particular one is obviously designed differently. It's designed to fight cancer. When we hear vaccine, we usually think prevention, but vaccines are sometimes used in treatment. So, this is an mRNA vaccine against melanoma that was made by Moderna. And let's take a look at what they did in this study. So the first thing to say is that this is only 157 patients. That is quite small. This is an early stage study. They are not done yet. These are folks who had stage three or four melanoma, so they were pretty far along. And it reduced the risk of recurrence, of melanoma recurrence, or death by 44 percent compared to patients who only got immunotherapy. So, certainly, this is promising and they're going to continue to study it. And it also sort of raises an interesting question about the uses of mRNA vaccines for more things than just COVID. Could they be useful in other ways? This vaccine, what it did is, it kind of told the -- it told the immune system to trigger a response that was unique to that person's tumor.
