Paula, what are you learning about the latest discovery of these documents and the sequence of events that Arlette just spelled out?PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (via telephone): Clearly, the Biden White House has been under a lot of scrutiny for their communication around this whole issue. They have made a conscious decision not to get out in front of news reports. And most of what we've learned over the past week, except for the Attorney General's press conference, appointing a special counsel, most of what we learned has come out through news reports. So, what this appears to be is an effort by the Biden team to be more forward leaning and to reveal new details as they are made available. I agree with Arlette, though the statement is it's a little confusing. And what we really don't know is the headline. OK, how many pages do we have at this point? How many documents? At this point, we know that from our reporting that there are approximately around 20. We know they've been found in three different box at two locations. We know 10 classified documents were found at his former office -- the president's former office here in D.C. at the Penn Biden Center does included top secret information. We've also learned that fewer than 10 pages were found at his Wilmington residence. But where this gets super confusing, is those documents were found in two spots in a storage space in the garage, and what is described as, \"an adjacent room\". They previously said that with a single page, it was found in an adjacent room. Now, they are saying that there were five additional pages in that batch. What makes this sort of an ever evolving story is the fact that when these lawyers find these, some of them say, look, we're not qualified to go through this entire document, they wait for the Justice Department. And then, another official is uncovering these additional pages. So, this total number of how many classified documents, how many pages we're talking about, this is a moving target. And it's from our reporting, we understand there could potentially be additional documents found in other locations. So, it is good for everyone that the Biden White House, the Biden team is trying to provide more information and not let things drip out. But there are still a lot of questions that we have.",

Those were supposed to be transferred to the National Archives. Pat Cipollone, the president's own lawyer, said they should be transferred. But in the chaotic final days of the transition, President Trump didn't do it. The National Archives found out about this five months later and asked for them. There is no evidence that Vice President Biden had a collection of two boxes of classified material that he held on to despite being told by lawyers that he shouldn't. Why he had these materials? I have no idea. What kinds of materials they are? I also don't know. But in the case of President Trump, it looked like the president himself had been involved.
