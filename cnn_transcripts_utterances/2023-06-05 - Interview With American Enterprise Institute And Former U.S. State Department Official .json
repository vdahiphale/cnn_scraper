I'm Paula Newton in Atlanta, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Russia's defense ministry claims Ukraine's much anticipated counteroffensive has begun. In Moscow, meantime, the ministry of defense says, without evidence I'll add, that it's warded a large-scale attack by Ukrainian forces attempting to breakthrough Russian defenses in southern Donetsk. Kyiv acknowledges, in its words, switching to offensive actions in some directions, but claims Russia is spreading news of a counteroffensive to distract from military challenges elsewhere. In fact, for now, Kyiv's message is, mum's the word. Here's a video showing Ukrainian soldiers calling for operational silence around any new offensive. So, what is actually happening on the battlefield of eastern Ukraine? Defense analyst Kori Schake has worked on security policy, both inside and outside the U.S. government, including a stint (ph) as senior adviser to John McCain's presidential campaign. She joins me now from Washington, where she is director of defense policy studies at the influential conservative think tank, the American Enterprise Institute. It's good to have you on board for this, especially as you've just been on the ground in Ukraine. And let's start with that fog of war, which I'm hoping you can clear for us. It's impossible, really, for any of us to really know exactly what's going on in the battlefield and really put any kind of evidence to what Russians are claiming. They say that they thwarted a Ukrainian attack. On the other hand, we've heard now that the Ukrainians are denying it. Why has this war pivoted so much on propaganda and perception rather than what we see happening on the battlefield? KORI SCHAKE, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE, FORMER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL: Because there's some advantage in creating a sense of momentum around one side or the another. This is modern warfare. All of us are paying attention in real-time or watching videos in real-time, which means there is advantage to whichever side proves good at it. And the Ukrainians have proven incredibly good at information operations and shaping how we think about the war.",

Let's listen in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. MARK MILLEY, CHAIRMAN, U.S. JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF: So, I think it's too early to tell what outcomes are going to happen. I think the Ukrainians are very well prepared. As you know, very well, the United States and other allied countries in Europe and, really, around the world had provided training and then munition, and advice, and intelligence, et cetera to the Ukrainians. We're supporting them. They're in a war, that's an existential threat for the very survival of Ukraine.

It's hard to know -- it'sentirely possible that the Russian military has become so brittle that when hit with a hammer of an offensive, they may crack. We just don't know until it starts. But I agree that Ukraine is incredibly well-prepared for this. We have been helping other NATO countries, other western countries, including Japan, have been providing really important assistance to Ukraine. So, they will have every possible advantage and they will need it because looking out into the future, the Biden administration, the president himself, has committed that we will give Ukraine all the support they need for as long as it takes for them to reclaim their internationally recognized territory. Allowing Russia to freeze this conflict, while remaining on Ukrainian territory would be an incredible danger to the people of Ukraine.

Let's listen now to President Biden's National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan, speaking to CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: What we want to do is support Ukraine to make as much progress as possible on the battlefield so that it is in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table. And we do believe that this counteroffensive will allow Ukraine to take strategically significant territory back from Russia, areas occupied by Russia that are rightfully sovereign Ukrainian territory. Exactly how much, in what places, that will be up to developments on the ground as the Ukrainians get this counteroffensive underway.

But I want to pick up on a point Jake Sullivan said there because he sounds very conditional. You know, that the military operations are a preparation for negotiations. And I think that's a mistake in frame of reference for this conflict. No Ukrainian government could consent to leave Ukrainians or Ukrainian territory in Russian hands, given the war crimes that Russia has perpetrated there. And so, military force is going to solve this problem, one way or another. Either in Ukraine's favor or Russia's favor, because neither side is going to negotiate what they cannot hold by force of arms.",

But the policy choices he's making about that concern are actually increasingly the incentives to Russia to threaten us with nuclear blackmail. It's increasing the value of having nuclear weapons for threshold states.

We used to call this political warfare or, you know, the work of intelligence agencies. So, it's not at all surprising that Ukraine, who has been so creative, so innovative, so adaptive, to the constraints they are fighting this war under, has found a way to encourage Russians to take Ukraine's side in the war and to perpetrate acts of sabotage, that's pretty common in warfare.",

So, they talk nonsense about, you know, the state sovereignty without criticizing Russia's attacks on the sovereignty of Ukraine. So, I don't think it's likely the Chinese are going to be helpful.

DR. BARBARA VAN DAHLEN, PSYCHOLOGIST: They absolutely make a difference. We know that healthy relationships are key for our well-being, our mental health. We know that social connection, peer relations, these kinds of warmlines, hotlines, they absolutely make a difference. They give people an opportunity to share, to connect with others who have resources, but mostly who want to listen, who are there helping them in a time of crisis. What we also know is that the challenge that we have is that \"The Listener\" conveys to us, provides this window into what the reality is, which is there are so many people suffering and struggling across the country. And that what we need to do is think about, OK. The lifelines are critical, warmlines, hotlines, but beyond that, there's so much more that we need to do. We're making progress. But we need to have these conversations because there's a lot that each of us can actually do to really address this crisis, this growing crisis. So, yes, these lines are critical.

And, you know, just because she does not want to, you know, sometimes, you don't want to call a crisis hotline. So, Beth is a volunteer and she's been through it herself. And in this particular phone call, she is -- she decides to, sort of, break protocol and give information about herself that she normally wouldn't do on a call. But for Beth, this was important that she reach her and make that connection and keep her on the line to keep talking. And by the end of that call, she does make that connection. And I think provides a lot of relief to Rebecca's character. And, you know, and it just opens up this dialogue. And I think, a lot of times, people just want to be heard.

And a specific question for me is, it is difficult, obviously, for these volunteers to deal with these calls, no matter how well trained they are. I know during the pandemic, everyone was at home, whether it was a volunteer or not. But do you think it's better that we have a more traditional set up in some of these places where the people having to deal with these phone calls are not alone themselves. Can get support and can get training, and perhaps, in that way, give, you know, give some better help along the way, along the line? DR. VAN DAHLEN: Well, I do think it's a really interesting part of this story, Beth. And she lets us know at the beginning that she needs to take a break. And so, you're right. Regardless of what the setting, whether it's someone in their home or because you can also, as you can well imagine, taking on these issues, having these conversations, you can be in a room full of other operators and be alone with it. So, what's key is how those organizations and many of them do amazing work, providing support, recognizing the need to support the workers, the volunteers. You know, and we hear, in these stories, as she is taking these calls, you know, that some of the material that's coming in is graphic, it's painful, it's troubling. We know the impact that has on all of us. In fact, that in and of itself can cause trauma, you know, additional trauma from what she has already clearly experience in her life. So, it's important to have the whole spectrum of offerings, if you will, so that people find, on both sides of this equation, what works best for them when they are in need of help, calling a warmline, getting in to see a therapist, getting into a peer support group.

And in amongst all of this, you know, she had many types of chemotherapy. She had a stem cell transplant, like, all sorts of things happened. And because she was single, and because my sister has little children, and I don't have children yet, I was her primary caregiver. And you know, it just turned my life upside down. I was living just a classic young adult's life, you know, in London, out and about, building a career in something I felt really passionate about. And suddenly, it was effectively like I became a parent overnight, but apparent in a very sad situation.

Nowadays, with medicine the way it is, with longevity increasing, aging populations. It's becoming much more prevalent and indeed people are caring for sick and elderly loved ones for longer than they cared for their children now. You know, people are living with advanced dementia for 20 years or so now. So, the scales are kind of swinging in the other direction and we haven't caught up with it. We're talking about millions of people in each country. 56 million, roughly, in the USA, about 6 million in my U.K. And also, the answer to your question, \"Who Cares\", you know, who are we talking about is women, right? A friend joked I should subtitle the book, \"Women\", because it is still women all around the world who were doing the majority of this kind of care, as well as of course, often, parenting. And that's also true in countries like Sweden where they have very high rates of gender equality by other measures. So, like, in the boardroom, for example. It's still women who are doing most of this kind of care. So, it's definitely an issue that is both of, kind of, feminism and of politics more broadly. And it's very related to the childcare issues that we have, you know. That we have government policies in the U.K. as much as in many other countries, which seemed to pretend that childcare doesn't need to happen.

So, we sort of had similar paths thousands of miles apart. Ayisha (ph) had originally been midway through an environmental economics degree and had left that and had never been able to go back because of these caring responsibilities. So, you know, like many caregivers, she lost a dream that she had. And that is, you know, one of the major effects of our failure to really support caregivers. She also had had major, kind of, physical repercussions, from extreme stress she was under. So, she had a brain aneurysm a year after caring for her mom. And she was in a country where there's even less, kind of, government provided services than the U.K. or the U.S., you know. So, it really had been completely engulfing for her.
