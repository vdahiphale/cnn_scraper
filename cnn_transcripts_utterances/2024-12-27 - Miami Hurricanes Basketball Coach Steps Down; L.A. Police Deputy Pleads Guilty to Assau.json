But even with the party set to control the upcoming Senate, his path to confirmation so far appears to remain an uphill battle. His attorney, Tim Parlatore, joins us now. Tim, thank you for being here. I appreciate you coming in, especially during a week like this with the holidays.

The vast majority of women that are serving today are going to be totally unaffected by this. What he's focusing on very specifically is ground combat units, infantry units, special operations units, where his concern is, and this has particularly been played out in the Army Rangers, that the standards have been lowered to try to pursue quotas of seeing how many women we can get into the Ranger battalion, as opposed to focusing on how many qualified Rangers we can get into Ranger battalion. And if a woman happens to make it, good on her. In fact, the podcast he did with Shawn Ryan, if you listen to the entirety, as opposed to the little clip at the beginning that most people like to play, he talks about that. It's all about maintaining a standard. And he says there, hey, if a woman can actually meet this standard without lowering it to pursue incentivizing women in combat, then good on them. You can put them into that unit. And he's very specific. Women are not going to be removed from fighter jets, from ships, from submarines, anything like that.

Here, what we're learning is that this victim, Emmett Brock, was driving by. He saw a deputy that he said was gesturing aggressively towards a woman, and he flipped off the deputy and kept driving. That deputy, Joseph Benza, then runs back to his car, leaves the disturbance call that he was at, and starts following Brock turn by turn. At one point, Brock actually calls 911 and says, hey, there's this cop behind me. What do I do? And dispatcher said, well, if the lights and sirens aren't on, keep proceeding as you are. He then pulls into a convenience store parking lot. Deputy Benza pulls him behind him, and this altercation ensues. I warn our viewers what you're about to watch is quite disturbing. Now what we're learning here from this plea agreement, that Benza will plead to guilty, a federal charge, that there was apparently an intention all along from the beginning to actually follow this man in order to use excessive force. We're also learning from that plea agreement that he allegedly conspired with other deputies to alter the police report. Rather than indicating that this started because he was flipped off, he was actually coached, this deputy, by other deputies to leave that part out. What he claimed was that, on the police report, he was actually following him because of an air freshener hanging from his rearview mirror. Now, the man here, Emmett Brock, sustained serious injuries. Again, the deputy will agree to plea to one count of a federal civil rights charge. We're waiting to see what happens to those other deputies as well. There's an indication that they could possibly face some type of disciplinary action.
