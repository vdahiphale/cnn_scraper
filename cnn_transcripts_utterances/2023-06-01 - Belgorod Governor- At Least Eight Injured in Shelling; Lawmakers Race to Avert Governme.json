Coming up over the next hour, Kyiv under attack at least three people have died and more than a dozen injured after fresh Russian missile strikes overnight the worst loss of life there in weeks. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy meeting with European leaders in Moldova today he's emphasized that his country is ready to join NATO. Even the NATO Secretary General says Ukraine will be a member of course for both sides the question is when? Also one down one to go the U.S. House approving the debt ceiling bill on Wednesday now it heads to the Senate we're live in Washington for the latest on that. And on financial markets around the world U.S. stock market futures pointing to a softer open as we wait the timing of that Senate vote plus of course, tomorrow's important U.S. jobs report. And ahead of that new data showing private sector firms added a whopping 278,000 jobs net last month. Almost 100,000 more than expected confusing what slowed down. And over in Europe and inflation and jobs jumped too Eurozone inflation falling to the lowest level in more than a year unemployment also dropping to record lows. Stocks, as you can see higher over in Europe. And we have all the details on that as well. Lots to get to today, as always, but we do begin with the latest from Ukraine. And as mentioned, three people including a child and her mother lost their lives in the Capital Kyiv killed by falling debris from a missile. They were actually trying to get into a bomb shelter but found it locked in the meantime, more shelling on the Russian border region of Belgorod. The Governor there sees that at least eight people were injured in the latest strike. Sam Kiley joins us now. Sam, I know you've discussed and reported on many tragedies in Ukraine over the last 16 months but specifically this story of the family trying to get access to that bunker do we know why the door was locked and they couldn't get in?",

People were sayingeyewitnesses and indeed survivors of this crash of debris, which followed the downing of an incoming missile, or it was a consequence of the anti- missile batteries firing over Kyiv said that they would seeking out large numbers of civilians were trying to get into the Soviet -- one of the Soviet era bunkers that are all over the city and indeed all over the country from the days of the Cold War. And incredibly after 16 months of war, they found the door locked and soon after that moment when they were trying to get in banging on the door, trying to find officials with a key that was the descent of this debris and two people killed a mother and child absolutely avoidable tragedy in so many ways. And one that clearly the Ukrainians are going to be extremely upset about. But it is also upsetting the Russians that the Ukrainian new campaign is focused on. There is now according to Russian officials, cross border shelling on a pretty frequent basis of border villages close to the Ukrainian border inside Russia. There are claims coming from a Russian dissident group supported by Ukraine, those are the Russians fighting under the banner of Ukraine that they have crossed into Russia once again. The Russians claiming that they repelled two companies of these fighters we don't have independent corroboration of either claim as yet. But this is clearly part of really the beginnings of the counter offensive, I think we could be safely saying this is what is new now in terms of the tactics and the strategy of the Ukrainians is to try to take the war into the Russian landscape. The problem with that, of course, as we've seen in Russia is that they -- that means that eight people according to officials, there have been injured civilians have to evacuate their villages. And that starts to look a bit to like what the Russians have been doing inside Ukraine. And that's going to be a delicate thing for the Ukrainians to navigate in terms of their tactical approach. Now the Russian fighters going to fight inside Russia on behalf of Ukraine have been broadcasting on social media trying to get civilians out of the area telling civilians to stay in safety if they can't do that underground and in bunkers, but also insisting that they are absolutely not intent on targeting civilians, Julia.",

Now, of course, you could argue that had they been able to join earlier, this could have been a deterrent against Russian aggression, we will never know. But the frustration for Ukraine is that nothing officially really has changed in its sort of political relationship with NATO since 2008, when we got the Bucharest commitment that the alliance would support its bid for membership. The Secretary of State of the U.S. Antony Blinken saying today, we all stand by that Bucharest commitment. But that was 15 years ago. And Ukraine is now looking for some kind of interim concrete steps, something like security guarantees, as you heard Zelenskyy say. And he elaborated on this even further in Moldova. Take a listen.

The German government spokesperson saying yesterday, Germany says Ukraine has legitimate right to defend itself against Russian attacks under international law, versus the noises that we're getting from the American side, which is far more cautious, even as Ukraine denies any involvement in those attacks interesting in light of the noises that we're hearing from the NATO Secretary General and members there and the concerns, ongoing concerns of the Ukrainians.",

And of course, we know, for example, that a lot of the military aid the Western weapons that Ukraine has been given have demanded from Ukraine assurances that they will not be used on Russian territory. Now, we don't really have evidence that they've done that is as of yet, and Ukraine has not admitted to being behind any of these cross border attacks, including that drone attack on Moscow that the Russian authorities averted. But the Secretary General of NATO was actually asked about this earlier today. He was asked is this shifting your stance on Ukraine at all, and he was not particularly explicit. He said look, we still stand by Ukraine's right to defend it. This is clearly a Russian war of aggression did not go as far for example, as the German government spokesperson or even the British Foreign Secretary earlier this week, who said that Ukraine has a right to project force outside of its own borders, which sparked fury in Moscow and essentially caused the Former Prime Minister to say that the UK was in an undeclared war with Russia so a very delicate situation and Russia is very sensitive to these comments.",

According to the Federal Trade Commission, Amazon indefinitely kept Alexa voice recordings of children using the service in violation of a U.S. law on privacy for youngsters. Clare Duffy has more on this. Clare, the first thing I looked at was the annual revenues of Amazon which I believe last year were at $514 billion. So this fine is a grain of salt on a peanut in several bags but separately put that aside what laws were breached? How long were these recordings kept and now what?",

So I guess as a parent, you could go back and see what your children have been listening to. My concern today, and why I think this question needs to be asked is the ability to perhaps using artificial intelligence and tools like this going forward to manipulate voices to perhaps weaponize voices be a child or otherwise? I guess that's the danger and part of the deeper sensitivity today than ever before.",

And those parents might not realize that their children's voices are being used to train and improve Amazon's AI systems. Now, this settlement will require Amazon not to use geo-location data or recordings of children to train an AI going forward. It also will require the company to delete recordings and other personal information when users specifically request it and to go back and delete. In accordance with past requests that the FTC said Amazon had failed to honor. It's worth noting, the Amazon said that it didn't violate any laws, and that these settlements will only add to its already strong privacy practices. But this does seem like a really symbolic and important sort of gesture from the FTC in terms of holding Amazon accountable for those promises.",

Interesting comments from Amazon there too I think. Clare, great to have you thank you. OK, many Latino businesses in several U.S. states temporarily closing their doors holding a protest under the banner A Day without Immigrants. It's in response to a Florida Governor Ron DeSantis's hardline anti- immigration law that targets undocumented workers. Carlos Suarez joins us now. Carlos, give us the context on this. What was the decision in the rule change by the Florida Governor? And clearly it's having an impact on some businesses you kind of see both sides of this.",

So immigrants across the State of Florida, they're trying to highlight theeconomic impact that they have on Florida's economy by this work stoppage aware in Immokalee, Florida, that's a farming community, to the east of Fort Myers, where several businesses, restaurants, even the Catholic Church, have told us that they are going to close today, in support of immigrants across the State of Florida. There's a new law that's going to go into effect in July here in Florida that does a number of things, it is going to require that some businesses expand the use of a federal database, that's called e-verify, to make sure that all of the workers that they're hiring are in the U.S. legally. It's also going to require that some hospitals ask their patients about their immigration status. And it is going to make it a crime a third degree felony for someone to bring someone that is in the U.S. illegally into the state of Florida. Now, yesterday, we were at a restaurant in West Palm Beach on the other side of the coast of Florida, where a restaurant owner told us that a third of his staff, a third of his workers have quit. Many of them are undocumented workers. They told him look, we don't feel safe in Florida we don't want to be here anymore. And so they are moving out. He was pretty emotional in our conversation telling us the impact that this is really having on his business. Here's a bit of that conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
