      "sentences": "Look, Phil, I suppose you could just arrive at the airport just a couple days before Christmas and try to get on a flight, but good luck. You see, there will be that increase in the number of travelers that's here according to AAA.And I have to say so far, so good based on what we've been seeing, though, it is still relatively early here. We have some AAA numbers to share with you to give you an idea just of what we expect on what American Airlines is describing as the busiest day of the travel period that started just a couple of days ago. Per AAA, about 7.5 people -- 7.5 million people will be traveling this weekend through New Year's Day. A lot of people, a lot more, will actually be choosing to drive, about 104 million choosing to get in their cars to actually drive to their destination. But overall, the wider picture in terms of the number of people that will be on the move this holiday season, close to 115 million per AAA. That's up nearly 3 million just from last year. We all remember the meltdowns of years past, which is why legislators and the federal government have really been strongly urging airlines leading up to this busy holiday season to really invest in some of their infrastructure and develop plans to make sure that they can avoid some of the absolutely disastrous delays and cancellations that we experienced just a couple of years back here. And in terms of what AAA is predicting, though, compared to previous years, this will likely be one of the busiest ones travel season since before the pandemic. And finally, a couple of tips and recommendations that we're getting from travel experts. There is always that one that you hear about getting to the airport. A little bit earlier, but also reserve your parking spaces, especially if you're going to be leaving your car behind while you head out to visit with friends and loved ones for Christmas and New Years.",

The polls are suggesting that that's not necessarily going over very well with people, in part because of inflation, maybe misperceptions about some other things, maybe just an unfortunate lag. You know, yeah, sure, the economy might be getting better, but if voters don't perceive it in time, then he'll lose. So I think they've moved on to the next thing. And the polling suggests that it is. In fact, the defense of democracy is very high. There are some split decisions over what to do about it, and that's where the art of the campaign is going to start to really take the precedence.But as a starting point, it worked for him in 2020. It was his origin story, right? He said when he saw the march in Charlottesville, the hate march, and that he associated that with Donald Trump and said, we've got to do better. That was kind of, you know, his core political message. And because he won, you've got to assume that it worked. MATTINGLY: I think it's important to note that this isn't just -- these aren't separate issues, right? This isn't just Trump legal or what Trump did in 2020 versus where Democrats are or where Republicans are. Despite what I think some Republican candidates have wanted. Yesterday was a fascinating day on the Republican campaign trail. You had Ron DeSantis weighing in on how this has sucked all the auction out of the room.

Nikki Haley goes on to say something to the effect of anti-Trump Republicans, think that she's not critical enough of the former president, and pro-Trump Republicans think that she doesn't love him enough.
