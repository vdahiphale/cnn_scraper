He was once the most loyal foot soldier in the Trump organization. Now, he is the prosecution's star witness in a case that could cost the former president potentially his freedom. Donald Trump's former personal attorney and fixer-turned foe, Michael Cohen is on the stand today in a dramatic courtroom face-off with his ex boss. Cohen testified that Trump told him to quote, \"take care\" of the allegation that he had an alleged sexual encounter with adult film actress Stormy Daniels. He also quoted Trump as saying, \"make sure it doesn't get released\", end quote. In regards to \"Playboy Magazine\" model Karen McDougal's claim that she also had an extra-marital affair with Trump. CNN justice correspondent Jessica Schneider joins us now. And Jessica, it strikes me that one of the highlights today was hearing Trump's recorded voice, recorded by Michael Cohen talk about these payments.",

So, again, the prosecution here trying to show that Trump was involved in many, if not all of these decisions. Just before we went into the lunch break, and they are back now, but we're waiting for the jury to enter before we resume testimony, but we are getting into the heart of this case. It's the circumstances surrounding the Stormy Daniels hush money payment. Before the lunch break, we heard Michael Cohen really describe what was the perfect storm of bad news for Donald Trump. It was the \"Access Hollywood\" tape that came out one month before the election, and then immediately after, Stormy Daniels threatened to come out with her story about their affair. Now, Cohen testified that Daniel's story -- he called it, it would be catastrophic in his words to the campaign. And Michael Cohen also had testified about how Donald Trump was a lot more concerned with the Stormy Daniels story, affecting his standing in the polls before the election. Then he really was worried about it affecting his marriage with Melania. Trump at one point really said, you know, I'm a hot commodity, I'll find another woman, essentially if Melania left him. So, some revealing testimony about what the motivation would be behind paying Stormy Daniels, Jim, because of course, the motivation behind it and wanting to make sure that it didn't affect the election. That is part of the prosecution's case here. It's not just about the hush money payment, the cover-up about how that payment was reimbursed, but also the motivation for influencing the 2016 election.

So, now, that there is an economist in charge of the Defense Ministry, it could mean that they are trying to make that more cost-effective, if you will, for a war that seems to be dragging on. At the same time, of course, you do have that massive offensive, Isa, it's taking place right now in the northeast of Ukraine where the Russians are trying to invade that province of Kharkiv, allegedly having some success. But all of that also coming at big costs. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over): Russian jets bombing Ukrainian frontline positions.

They feel like those priorities are out of whack. And interestingly, when we heard from the Israeli Prime Minister today in delivering Memorial Day remarks, he talked about the goals of the war, and he talked about them once again, hand-in-hand destroying Hamas and also securing the release of the hostages. But increasingly, people here feel like those two goals are very much at odds with each other, that the military pressure is not the way to secure the release of the hostages. They feel that the Israeli government isn't doing enough at the negotiating table. But then I also speak with some of the families of these hostages who say that at this point, they simply do not know what to believe or who to believe.

I spoke with the daughter of another hostage who said, you know, that it's not clear to her at this point if the Israeli government is or isn't doing enough at the negotiating table. And you just have to think about the emotional roller-coaster that these last several weeks have been for those families as they have watched these reports of progress and optimism at the negotiating table, only to see that progress crumble once again. And for Israel and Hamas to be once again at a deadlock. And instead what we are seeing is ramped up Israeli military activity in Gaza, not only in the south in Rafah, where that ongoing military operation has been happening over the course of the last week.

The fact that he is involved again in the minutia of allof this and the fact that -- the downside to that tape is going to be for the defense that this was all being set up by Cohen and Weisselberg and Weisselberg is not going to testify in this case. And they're still dealing with the empty chair issue of bringing Weisselberg in and saying, I'm going to take the Fifth Amendment. The state's not going to give immunity. And now all of a sudden the defense has to say, well, we don't want to put him on either because we don't know what he's going to say either. So, at that point -- plus he's subject to some very bad cross examination. So the fact of the matter is that at this point, there's something for the defense to argue. But still, he's saying how he wants the money paid. He's backing up the idea that Cohen did not set up this shell corporation without the knowledge of Trump and how the money was going to get transferred. So it really is more corroboration of what Michael Cohen is saying. And that's kind of important. But it's coming from Trump. It's not coming from some other witness.",

Before wego, part of the defense, as I understand it, is based on intent to say that Trump's intent was not to influence the election, but primarily to protect his family. And you had an exchange with Cohen on the stand quoting Trump. And I'm paraphrasing the comment here. But Trump, in effect, saying he doesn't care about Melania, that he's focused very, very much on the effect on the election. The impact of that particular testimony for the prosecution's case, but also for the defense.",

Itwas about an illegal contribution of sorts. And so therefore, an illegal and then based upon fraudulent entries in the books of the corporation. So it's kind of important that people see that that's what it was about. That was also corroborated by Hope Hicks, who said, yes, he was worried about Melania, but he was more worried about the election. And everybody seems to say the same thing. He was worried about the election. So now, Michael, who's involved with Trump at this point, is basically saying the same thing, but directly out of Trump's mouth, saying precisely those words. This is very important. It kind of hurts the defense of what his intent was, unless they've got some other way to get around this. They're going to have to eat that kind of testimony and try to come up with, yes, he thought about it. But the real reason, the real substantial reason was Melania.

Over the weekend, Donald Trump used his downtime from his trial to get back on the campaign trail. He was met by enthusiastic crowds at a rally in the state of New Jersey. Those crowds seemed to match the voters' sentiment in some new polling from The New York Times and Siena College. These polls show Trump leading President Biden in four key battleground states, including Nevada, Georgia, Arizona and Michigan. It's a bit closer in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, with no clear leader there. But those are all states that, well, Biden did a heck of a lot better in in 2020.

The bribes are said to have included cash, gold as well as a luxury car. Menendez faces 16 charges. His wife, Nadine, has been charged as well. However, she will face a separate trial. CNN correspondent Jason Carroll joins us from outside the courthouse in New York. So Jason, just talk us through, our viewers through, what we can expect here. JASON CARROLL, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, let's talk about what's happening right now and that's jury selection, the initial phases of jury selection now underway. The judge asking a pool of potentially 100 jurors questions like would they be able to sit for a trial that's expected to last several weeks. Would that be a hardship for them, yes or no, just one of the questions that potential jurors are going to be asked here. So once a jury is set, then we're going to move on with opening statements where both sides will lay out their cases to jurors. We already know what the defense has said. They've been pretty clear about they say Menendez and his wife, Nadine, accepted bribes in exchange for favors from the senator. Bribes totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. Also, gold bars that they found at the senator's home in New Jersey when they executed a search warrant there. The senator, for his part, has maintained his innocence throughout this, Isa, saying that the government is overstepping, that they're making a target after him, that they're going after him. Senator Menendez also, we're getting a sort of a hint as to what his possible defense may be, at least part of his defense. And that came through a pretrial document. There was a very interesting passage that I want to read part of it to you. It has to go to his defense. It says, Senator Menendez intends to present a defense arguing, in part, that he lacked the requisite knowledge of much of the conduct and statements of his wife, Nadine, and did not agree to join any of the charged conspiracies. So, perhaps that means, as part of the defense, what they're going to do is lay part of the blame at Nadine Menendez, who, as you know, will be tried separately in July. But once again, right now, first steps first, and that's jury selection, which is now underway. Isa.",
