Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York city sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, got a rockstar welcome in Lithuania as he arrived for the NATO summit in Vilnius. Take a look at these pictures of his and first lady Olena Zelenska's extraordinary reception. The president has expressed frustration though about the lack of a timeline for his country's membership of the alliance, calling it absurd. Mr. Zelenskyy is set to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden tomorrow. The American leader comes to the summit with a win already in that bag as Turkey opens the way for Sweden to join the alliance. That would be the fifth largest country in Europe, and you can see it on this map, that Sweden's entry would increase NATO territory dramatically. Our Melissa Bell is in Vilnius, Lithuania for us. So, Melissa, you know, rockstar reception for the Ukrainian president, but it doesn't look like he's walking away with the one thing he really wanted, and that is some sort of timeline in terms of entry into NATO for the country.",

But first, we move to Israel, where large- scale demonstrations are once more taken over the streets as people take part in a day of disruption and resistance. They are protesting judicial reforms that some people fear will weaken the country's court and its democracy. For more on these reforms and the protests, I'm joined by Jerusalem from Correspondent Hadas Gold. So, Hadas, before we get into the protests themselves and what you've witnessed there in your reporting today, talk about what transpired last night at the Knesset?",

      "sentences": "Well, Bianna, part of the reason why these protesters have come out in such force today is because of thelegislation that was passed last night. Now, the protests have been going on for months now, but the legislation of this judicial overhaul had been essentially frozen in place since March, that was when there was massive general strikes across the country. The defense minister had come out against this overhaul, and the legislation was frozen and there were negotiations with the opposition, trying to reach some sort of compromise. But last night, the coalition government, led by Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, started the process once again. This was one vote of three for one aspect of this overall package of reforms. This specific legislation has to do with trying to remove the Supreme Court's ability to declare government actions unreasonable. Right now, the Supreme Court has rather broad ability to declare that a government action, even if it doesn't break a law, is unreasonable and cannot stand. So, this is just one of three votes to try to strip that away. But it almost doesn't matter what that specific legislation would have said. The fact that it's part of this overall, judicial overhaul package, the fact that it's back on the table, that votes are being taken, that's what prompted these protesters to come out with such force on what they called this day of disruption across the country, Bianna.",

We were just actually at Ben Gurion Airport, Israel's main airport, and it had essentially been taken over completely by protesters. There were thousands of protesters. They had essentially plugged up the entire arrivals area of the airport. I would definitely say there were at least thousands of them there, and that are -- those types of scenes are things we have not seen in some time. And the protests have been going on all day long, from the morning and they plan to continue through the evening and across the country, not just here in Jerusalem, not just in Tel Aviv, but also, in smaller places. Even as we were driving along the highway, we saw certain bridges over the highway filled with protesters, waving their flags, showing their signs off to the drivers along the way. So, definitely some of the biggest protest that we have seen, and it's been sparked by this legislation passing and the fears that this overhaul package is once again very much on the table.",

We will not continue to act this way in a country which has so many social bondage between people, so many volunteers, so many people that are doing so much for this country, to let a government, which is an extreme right-wing government, to sort of hijack the judicial system, and to try to turn it from an open democracy that Israel has been proud of, our Declaration of Independence, our founder of the country, Ben-Gurion, was so proud of the democracy that we were able to establish here, to take it to something which is a different way of governing, like you have in Poland or like you have in Hungary, that's just not going to be acceptable by the Israeli people.",

It's not just a battle within Israel, it's the battle within the nature of the Jewish people at large. Do the Jewish people want to be open? Democratic? Open to other countries? Open to the Muslim world around us? Open to some other countries around the world? And technology for JVP, for many of us has been the bridge to a lot of cooperation, not only with the U.S and in with Europe and with Asia but also newly so the Middle East, with UAE, with Saudi Arabia, with Jordan, with Egypt. And for us, democracy and the openness of our society is the very fundamental condition of innovation, of creativity, of being able to live here in a way that we choose freely, and nobody is going to give that up. And what Netanyahu will find many of us it's just like we've been warriors on the front line. We're also going to be warriors in the battle for democracy. It's a battle that is worth fighting for.

And so, the ability -- I'm from Jerusalem, we have innovation in Jerusalem not only as creating get great companies, and JVP had 40 of Israel's largest exists, but it's also a way for coexistence. In our technology companies, we have aired entrepreneurs, we have ultra- orthodox Jewish entrepreneurs. We have people from all parts of society. And for us, the democratic process, the openness, the pluralism has been so crucial to the ability, not only to invent companies. But also, if you remember, in Jerusalem, it was very tense 15 years ago. We've been able to open society up through innovation and through cooperation. And what Netanyahu and his government are trying to do right now is to take us back 70 or 80 years, and nobody in their right mind would want democracy which raises their kids on the values of democracy are going to agree to that.",

And right now, he's acting to save his own skin, not just ruling the country. And I have to say that in Israel, we have a complicated reality. On one hand, we need to be very strong. We're fighting against people who are attacking us, whether it's from Iran, whether it's from Hezbollah, whether it's from Hamas, whether it's from other terrorist organization, and we need to be -- to have a very firm hand. I myself was part of a -- you know, a special forces unit. And as much as we're -- you know, we're doing things in light of the economy, we're also -- we need to be tough in Israel to survive. On the other hand, Israel has been part of the region. Many of our companies have been operating in the UAE, in Abu Dhabi, in Dubai, in Bahrain, in Riyadh and Saudi Arabia, cooperating more so with Egypt, with Morocco, with Jordan. And what we want is to treat the Palestinians and to treat the moderate Palestinians with respect. And some of the people in the right-wing government of Netanyahu, by having gestures which somehow symbolically do things against Islam and an act disrespectful to some of the other religions in the region, that's really bad. Jerusalem is a city which many religions love, but one thing that we have learned, living in Jerusalem and creating companies in Jerusalem, that you need to have respect for the other. You need to have respect for the Muslims, for the Christians, the Jews, you need to work together because Jerusalem is a city, just like Tel Aviv, is the exciting City of Israel, Jerusalem can become the exciting city of the Middle East, but the only way to do that is to work with respect, act against those that are terrorists or trying to create harm --",

We are allowing people that are from the Arab sector to join us, the Jews. People that are from the right-wing party of Netanyahu are joining us. And the reason that they're joining us is we are creating a common denominator of democracy. So, we're not necessarily going into all of the intricacies of Israel's problems, including the ones with the Palestinians. Many people think that it should be about -- also about the coexistence with the Palestinians. But we -- what we are saying, let's find the common denominator, democracy, a way to go forward, a way for Israel to be part of the region, not against the region, a way for Israel to be part of the nations and not against the nations, a way for Israel to have the next generation of entrepreneurs, of innovation, of people that can participate from all parts of this country, because that's what we need. But in order to do that, sometimes you need to not only build things, you need to fight for what is right. And fighting against dictatorship and for democracy is what we're doing.

Really appreciate the time. So, the NATO communique is out. And in it, members are prepared for Ukraine to ultimately join the alliance and pledged to \"extend an invitation for Ukraine to join when allies agree and conditions are met.\" We know that also in this communique the process has been expedited for when those conditions finally are agreed upon. But you know that this drew a sharp rebuke from President Zelenskyy who said that he wants a timeline. How does this communique and what members have agreed to differ from the much criticized read out in 2008, which opened the door and said, Ukraine would become a member, but never laid out a timeline for when? JULIANNE SMITH, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO:  Right. So, in 2008, the allies agreed that Ukraine and Georgia will become members of the alliance, and they said at that moment that what would be required is something called the Membership Action Plan. And what we did, today is we actually told Ukraine, thanks to all of the good progress that they've made, we no longer need the Membership Action Plan, and that has been removed from the table. So, that is a major step forward for Ukraine and for the alliance. In terms of a timeline, it's very tough to try and agree to some sort of timeline while there is a war raging on Ukrainian territory. In addition, even the Ukrainians themselves will tell you that they need to make further reforms. They've made good progress on a variety of democratic and security sector reforms, but they will have to continue working and that direction.",

But when we see people dying, 300 people from Pakistan drowning last month off the coast of Greece, three boats missing off the Canary Islands coming from Senegal, this needs to be addressed. And it needs political leadership and political will from European leaders. What they're failing to do is put on the table realistic solutions, concrete proposals, and agree on them. The European Union, for a long time, has been divided about updating its current European asylum system. And around the world, leaders are really burying their heads in the sand about new drivers of displacement. How, in the future, are we going to draw the line about who has a human rights- based entitlement to cross an international border? It's not just about the refugee definition, it's about people feeling climate change, the people leaving Pakistan were fleeing hyperinflation, serious economic impacts on the availability of basic food items. There are vulnerable people in desperate situations coming to Europe, and European leaders are failing to address the issue.",

And that's because more and more countries in Europe and around the world are making seeking asylum, seeking sanctuary effectuate illegal. For instance, in my country, the United Kingdom, this legislation, the so- called Illegal Migration Bill, which is effectively proposing to make it illegal to come into Britain as an asylum seeker, as a refugee, and say, I want to seek sanctuary in this country, because it's suggesting that unless you have a visa, you can't come to the country and claim asylum. Now, people who flee war and persecution don't always have access to the means to get a visa or adequate paperwork. The idea in traditional refugee law is you should be allowed to flee for your life across the border if you're in very desperate circumstances and at least make a claim to a country.

But because her mom was actually paying me, I was actually being taught -- like hired to get whatever the mother wanted while making the bride think it didn't cost anything and it wasn't going to be out of hand. And it was a funny story about class, because the bride's mother also had been raised with not a lot of money, and it kind of married into a situation where their wealth increased as their years went on. And the bride had always been raised in money. And so, it was almost as though the mother of the bride was like, why do you shun this thing that I wanted my whole life?
