The IDF has now closed three Israeli towns on its northern border, declaring a closed military zone there. According to U.S. officials, Israeli Special Forces have already carried out what they describe as very small raids inside Lebanese territory, as the Israeli air force keeps up relentless airstrikes. The defense minister, Yoav Gallant, told troops in northern Israel today. This next stage will begin soon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Israel's military campaign into Lebanon has now displaced an estimated one million people or more.CNN senior international correspondent Ben Wedeman is in Beirut. Chief national security correspondent Alex Marquardt is in Washington. Ben, I want to begin with you. First, Hezbollah and it sounds like, oh, no, I thought that was going to be an air siren, might just be a motorcycle in the background, Hezbollah says it will name a leader soon, a new leader soon given that so many of their senior leaders have been killed in recent airstrikes. Do we know -- will they announce that new leader? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  I wouldn't hold my breath, Jim, waiting for that announcement. Keep in mind, not only have they not yet announced a successor to Hassan Nasrallah, we still don't even know where, when, if Hassan Nasrallah will have a public funeral. Clearly, the organization is in a state of flux to say the least. I mean, if you'd go back to 1992 when the best Abbas al-Musawi, the predecessor of Hassan Nasrallah, was killed, immediately, Nasrallah was appointed. There was no delay, but clearly given that if you look at all the names of senior people, particularly on the military side, who have been killed in the last two weeks, there aren't a lot of people left. One is obviously Naim Qassim who came out and made his speech today, saying that they would assign -- they would appoint somebody as soon as possible. The other is Hashem Safieddine, another individual in the leadership council. But at this point I think given the situation they're in, and now were looking at it possible Israeli incursion or perhaps invasion into southern Lebanon, their priority might be simply just to deal with things as they happen as opposed to go through the formalities and appointing a successor, Jim.",

But in reality nothing could be farther from the truth. It doesn't seem that the Americans are willing to use their diplomatic muscle to try to bring the situation under control in a sense, sort of throughout the region. There's a general impression that the United States just hasn't tried very hard to stop the war in Gaza, let alone to prevent the war from spreading into Lebanon, which it now has.At this point, the Americans have been very good at providing Israel with weapons. They've been very good at reassuring the Israelis time and time again about their support for Israel's right to self-defense but they've done very little terms of actual concrete action to bring the situation under control. Secretary Antony Blinken has come to the region, I believe 10 times, perhaps 11, but has nothing to show for it. And therefore, there's very little faith in the Americans, the French foreign minister is in Beirut today. But we're not seeing any American diplomats going anywhere at this point. So, the feeling is the Americans are either uninterested or unwilling, or unable to actually do something to and these wars, the war in Lebanon and the war in Gaza.",

And that's in fact exactly what they're doing, they're planning a ground incursion. We saw that Nasrallah and many of the people who were eliminated were in fact planning exactly take over the Galilee, which was the exact same game book as what happened on October 7 in the south. So, one thing is to eliminate the Hezbollah operations, their missile and silos that are pointed at Israel. In fact, were fired not that long ago and had been firing maybe not to the capacity they were before, but are firing towards Israel, along with their command leadership so they can not just rebuild this terror entity and resurface and threatened the people of Israel.",

They hope Ben, I know he's over there right now, can show your viewers that in fact, they're celebrating. Why? Because Nasrallah was a horrible terrorist mostly to other Muslims. Israel is kind of a side factor. And so therefore, we call the Lebanese government once again and the international community, this is not something we want to be doing.

We know that Hezbollah itself fired thousand kilogram weapons towards visible but can wipe out 13 square blocks.

So, therefore, this is a time as I hear Ben and your other colleagues speak about the U.S. support, we're calling in the international community. You see what the Israel has done.

However, what we're witnessing is something much broader than that. It is an attempt to perhaps redraw the balance of power, not only in Lebanon, but more broadly in the Levant and even perhaps in the region as it relates to Iran. And we've heard time and again that this might now very much include a ground component. And in the Lebanese psyche in particular, but others have been region to they remember that past Israeli land incursion and invasions into Lebanon were also dubbed as being limited before. In 1982, it ended being all the way to Beirut. So, there's a lot of question marks and certainly a lack of trust as to how far this operation will go. Is it in fact something that is meant to be limited and that unlocks a diplomatic process that allows a return to ceasefire and then 1701, a new security arrangements for south Lebanon? By the way, the Lebanese government has already signed up for that.

Let's start with a death toll, you know, the loss of human life. We know that, that death toll is increasing and is expected affected to increase. Over a third of those deaths are right here in the state of North Carolina. We also know that on a level of just destruction of their communities, it's evidenced as you can see around me, the roads of this historic town are now turned into sludge, mud, making them impassable. Not only to people, residents trying to get out, but also for those emergency and urgent supplies to get in. People here this morning where we are in Asheville waking up to the devastation workers coming into their jobs, to their employers, walking into these buildings and just seeing the devastation that happen happened overnight. One specific places this dairy production company that you see behind me, its a small business and we spoke to some of those workers who went in this morning and said, we don't know if this is going to take weeks or even years to rebuild adding that they don't even know if they have a job to go back to. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Have a listen to his words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Kamala is mentally impaired. Joe Biden became mentally impaired said, but lying, Kamala Harris honestly, I believe she was born that way. The people walk in, they just take everything they want. They walk out of the store. What the hell is going on? She -- we have to let the police do their job. And if they have to be extraordinarily rough. One rough hour and I mean real rough, the word will get out and it will end immediately. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Vance with his kids in tow, left Cincinnati for New York today, ahead of debate night as the Trump campaign seeks to raise expectations for their opponent. This is typical gamesmanship, framing Walz as a wildly political veteran season debater on a call with reporters. That comes amid reports that Walz deep into debate prep. He's fighting some pre- debate jitters. CNN's Eva McKend brings us behind the curtain on that prep. So, tell us how is Walz preparing to face Vance here I wonder.",

The pressure is high this week for the campaign, this is likely the last marquee event before election day. He's worried about letting Harris down. He so badly, doesn't want Trump to become president again. And he doesn't want Harris to think that she made the wrong choice in selecting him. He's also clear-eyed that Senator Vance holds an advantage is someone who is Ivy League law school trained. But we do know that like Harris, Governor Walz has engaged in these long prep sessions with Secretary Buttigieg, for instance, standing in for Vance, we know that Harris prepared very strenuously and it appears that Walz is doing so as well. And the campaign views this as a platform to appeal to undecided voters. He's going to continue to be his relatable self and maintain that sense of hope and optimism and joy that has been so central to his posture on the campaign trail.",
