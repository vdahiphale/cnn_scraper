Is it because you have more experience now when you've learned more about the information? Is it because you are running for president in a Democratic primary? And should they feel comfortable and confident that what you're saying now is going to be your policy moving forward? KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Dana, I think the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed. You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed and I've worked on it that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time. We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for the United States of America, and by extension, the globe around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. As an example, that value has not changed. My value around what we need to do to secure our border. That value has not changed. I spent two terms as the attorney general of California prosecuting transnational criminal organization, violations of American laws regarding the passage -- illegal passage of guns, drugs, and human beings across our border. My values have not changed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, there was plenty that didn't like him in '16 and in '20 and I am sure there will be some that don't like him and don't vote for him this year. I mean, look, they have Republicans on the stage at the Democratic convention that spoke on behalf of Harris. So she could find somebody. The question is though, are they influential?

Scott, with you first that dynamic, which is what Dana was talking about because it is, pardon the phrase, it is the touchy-feely, it is how viewers -- how voters feel, do you think Trump-Vance can create that, same, not obviously, same dynamic, but a similar, you're on our side view?",

And I think what Trump and Vance are running on are policy basicallysaying if you don't like the policies of the last four years, you can't leave the same people in charge. So it is a much more straight forward political argument. I do think Harris and Walz are trying to create something around the concept of vibes because they don't want to defend the last four years. They don't want to talk about why Harris was for the Green New Deal, now, she is against it or why she was against fracking and now, she is for it, now she is against. So if you can create a vibe campaign to try to combat where you're deficient on policy, I guess if I were in their shoes, I would do the same thing.

Go back to the image there for a second because that really just shows the human impact and the actual input that needs to take place when they put up the departure board, the time there. They are also even handwriting out on these whiteboards, the workers there from the airport in green vests where the location of baggage claim is for some of these flights that are coming in and the timing is especially bad here because the Labor Day weekend is anticipated to be especially busy here in the United States, 2.8 million people anticipated by TSA at airports across the country tomorrow. But at SEA-TAC, they are anticipating about 200,000 people each day. Today is a big day, 179,000 people; tomorrow, 187,000 people.

I've talked, Richard, to a number of people who are familiar with airports and aviation systems, and they just say, think about it. You've got to have somewhere, a central database of all the passengers, all the flights. Every time they have a drink, you have to reconcile that against the boarding pass -- their boarding pass and the passport to make sure that somebody isn't going to be getting drinks on behalf of somebody else and all in all, who is going to pay for how is it going to work?
