Meantime, the former president is also trying to get his New York criminal case moved into federal courtroom. His sentencing in that case is set for next month. Joining us now to discuss Trump's legal strategy is former Trump attorney, Bill Brennan. He represented Trump in the second impeachment trial, and also represented the Trump Payroll Corporation before New York Judge Juan Merchan. Bill, thank you so much for being with us. Do you think former President Trump is going to be sentenced in that hush money case on September 18th or do you think his team will be successful in their attempts to delay?",

      "sentences": "Good afternoon, Boris. Thanks for having me.I don't think that he'll be sentenced on the 18th for a couple of reasons. The Manhattan district attorney's office apparently has indicated that they would not be opposed to a continuance until a date after the presidential election. And I understand that the former president's attorneys have filed a motion to remove the case to federal court. And whether or not that happens I can't predict. But it seems to me, if you take the order that Judge Merchan signed in July continuing the sentencing until September, and in that order, I believe he used verbiage akin to the sentencing, if necessary, will occur in September. If you take that combined with the Bragg office directive that they're not opposed to continuing it, I think the tea leaves would point to a continuance.",

Certainly they have complete immunity for anything they do in their official capacity. They have presumptive immunity for any other official acts.So it could be a very unusual move to move the case to federal court, but that Supreme Court decision is a very unusual decision. So it could happen. (CROSSTALK)",

And on the 5th, I think there's a hearing to set dates.But what Jack Smith did is he took out the counts and verbiage that he believes are affected by the United States Supreme Court decision on presidential immunity. It basically excised or removed from the indictment all of the allegations that purport that the former president used the Department of Justice, basically weaponized the Department of Justice. That's gone. Just in terms of volume, the indictment went from 45 pages to 36 pages. I mean, that's a lot of -- that's a lot of meat to cut off the bone. So he apparently thinks he can survive this way. And I guess he really had no other move. And, frankly, it's a slick move on his part. But we'll see if there's enough left to proceed. And if what's left to proceed does or doesn't affect presidential immunity issues.",

And it clocked in at just a rise of 2.5 percent over the last year ending in July. That's seen as a win in the fight against inflation.Let's join CNN's Matt Egan now to break down these numbers.

It doesn't mean that prices are plunging across the economy. They're not.But it does show the prices are going up at a more gradual pace and that is exactly what we want to see. And 2.5 percent year over year. Some context, that is slightly better than expected. And it's tied with last month for the lowest rate since February 2021, the first full month of the Biden administration. And when you look at the trend here from that chart, you can see that even though inflation is not quite back to that 2 percent goal that the Fed has, it is moving in the right direction, making a massive improvement from two years ago when this metric was above 7 percent. I mean, that was alarming. That's why the Fed had to step in with these massive interest rate hikes. Interest rate hikes that we're still feeling the effects of. So the fact that this is all cooling off suggests that all that tough medicine from the Fed is working. And importantly, paychecks. Paychecks are now consistently growing faster than prices. And that is another positive -- Boris?",

The line might look long, but it moves efficiently.In fact, I just checked the wait times ear for the north checkpoint here at terminal two at DCA, 11 to 14 in minutes for general TSA checkpoint, five to eight minutes for TSA pre-check. In fact, I just talked to the local head of TSA here at the airport. He said there are anticipating 40,000 passengers passing through the TSA checkpoint here today, a number unheard of since even before the pandemic, even bigger than before the pandemic. The big thing here is that airlines are really in recovery mode after a lot of bad weather passed through here in the mid-Atlantic yesterday. About one in five flights canceled at Washington Dulles, just around the corner here. About one-third of all flights delayed here at DCA. Also about a third of all flights delayed out of Philadelphia just up the way. Although I want you to listen now to passengers who are really trying to take this all in stride for what could be a record-breaking Labor Day weekend for travel. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
