Just ahead, a deadlocked race in key battleground states with just three weeks to go before election day in the U.S. Will anything move the needle?A deadly Hezbollah drone strike targets an Israeli army base in one of the bloodiest attacks on Israel since last October. And the race to prevent a polio resurgence in the war-stricken Gaza Strip as the U.N. begins a second round of its vaccination campaign. Good to have you with us. Well, the race for the White House enters its final weeks and the stakes could not be higher with no clear front runner. CNN's latest poll of polls shows an average of 50 percent of likely voters' support Vice President Kamala Harris, while 47 percent back former President Donald Trump. Key states in the Democrats' so-called blue wall are still up for grabs as well. And you can see it's even closer in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin than in the nation at-large. The candidates are set to make crucial stops in those battleground states this week. What is clear is the role Hispanic voters could play. The latest New York Times- Sienna College poll, shows Vice President Harris leading Trump with 54 percent of the Hispanic vote. But that's an erosion in support for the Democrats compared to the last three elections. Well, as the election draws closer, Donald Trump is doubling down on his false narrative that the Biden-Harris administration has opened the floodgates to a wave of violent immigrants who threaten to destroy the United States.

But the problem is those things never last forever, and she had agreat convention and then she won the debate with Trump, but nothing really moved the needle very much.

It comes on the heels of a speech from Taiwan's president last week asserting China has no right to represent the island. Taiwan has condemned the new exercises, calling them an unreasonable provocation. CNN senior international correspondent Will Ripley joins me now from Taipei. Good to see you, Will. So what more can you tell us about this story? WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Hi, Rosemary. We know that these drills which are called Joint Sword 2024B. The drills back in May around the time of Taiwan's inauguration were 2024A. So, A, now B, who knows, maybe there'll be a C. They involve the army, the navy, the air force, the rocket force in China. They've even deployed their aircraft carrier to the east of Taiwan to participate, the Liaoning. You can see on the map, the six red blocks, those are supposed to be potential blockade locations what China is saying is that they're practicing what could be a precursor to an invasion of Taiwan, which is to try to choke off the islands supplies to prevent anything on a ship or a plane from reaching this island, which of course we are an island that relies very heavily on imports, a blockade could make life very uncomfortable, very, very quickly. China's coast guard also conducting patrols near the outlying Matsu islands. China says that this is in response to a speech as you mentioned, Rosemary, last week by Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te, where he essentially rejected Beijing's long-standing territorial claims over this self-governing democracy, the communist party Beijing has never controlled Taiwan, even though they've always claimed as their own and they basically insist that the rest of the world acknowledged their claim over Taiwan. The United States which tries to be kind of strategically ambiguous in all of this, they sell Taiwan defensive weapons. They won't say whether or not they would come to Taiwan's defense if China were to unilaterally try to attack Taiwan, but they are warning that this sort of drill could really escalate tensions in this region. And, you know, these drills are certainly not spontaneous. Rosemary, this is something you got to require a lot of planning and cost. That it is the drills earlier this year, the ones in May that I mentioned a moment ago, they cost millions of dollars. The navy had to pay 13 million, Chinese air force paid it almost $48 for dozens of warships, sailings, and flights and if you look at the total combined costs of all of China's military drills during the last year, 2023, from January to December, you're looking at almost 71,000 naval warship sailings costing the navy in China around $13 billion. The air force spent almost three-and-a-half billion dollars to fly 9,200 flights. So that is a pretty significant expenditure -- yes, there's a lot of propaganda value that goes into this, but clearly they're also out there rehearsing real life maneuvers and scenarios that could someday go from being drills to the real thing, Rosemary, that's certainly the message that Beijing wants to project, wants to intimidate. They would say here in Taiwan, but they're deploying their own fighters and ships in response and even their own propaganda videos in response, asking the world, Rosemary, happening on the Taiwan Strait, because even though China has done this, a lot many times since Nancy Pelosi's visit back in 2022, here in Taipei, they say this sort of behavior shouldn't be normalized. This bullying shouldn't be normalized because what Chinas doing is actually very serious, even if they do it quite a lot these days.",
