This is basic but this is important to remember. And you'd never guess this looking at the way Washington works but that's a fundamental truth. Now, if you take a look at millennial voters, it even gets more so. Take -- check this out. If you -- if you look at the next slide you're going to see that a majority of millennials actually vote. Fifty-two percent identify as Independent, right? So as the younger you get, the more independent you get. Folks saying I don't want to have to choose between the Republican and the Democratic Party. And here's what's even -- there you go -- the stat right there.

Democrats take the House. Independent voters pushing back against the Republican Party under George W. Bush by a pretty decisive margin, right -- nearly 60 percent. Then in midterm elections under Barack Obama when Democrats had control, this is -- for president -- Democrats had control and they -- the Republicans go in the midterms for -- Independents go for Republicans. Then, at the end, they go back in 2018 heavily for Democrats. Presidentially, you see the same swing -- more subtle, though, right? In 2008, Independents go for Barack Obama. In 2012, they start moving right. This is interesting. This is an outlier -- Mitt Romney. In 2016, narrowly for Donald Trump. Twenty-twenty, decisively for Joe Biden. So in both cases, you see the swing vote in American politics is disproportionately Independents. You want to find out how the election is going to go, look at where Independents are going.

On the other hand, take a look at what's happening in Utah where Independent conservative Evan McMullen has provided the first competitive general election for Senate in Utah in almost 50 years. Because Democrats said you know what, we're going to sit this one out. We're not going to win it. Instead, McMullen is trying to throw a coalition campaign. That's one to watch. That's been surprisingly close. And in North Dakota, you've got Independent congressional candidate Cara Mund, former Miss America and Harvard Law School graduate.

One area is, of course, on the legislative area -- an agenda. It is going to be very difficult for Democrats to get through any bills. We know that Republicans have already talked about rolling back some of their accomplishments so far, and we know that the president could start exercising his veto power. Now, the second area that we've been talking about a lot is Republican investigations. Republicans have made it no secret that they want to flood the president and this White House with oversight probes on everything from his son, Hunter Biden, to the origins of COVID, various theories that are out there about the FBI and DOJ. And we also have heard of plenty of impeachment talks. So the White House has been preparing for his possibility for a number of months now. They've beefed up their operations and they will say that they are ready to push back on all of this as politically motivated.

One is the Donald Trump factor, as in does he run? When does he announce? You know, Biden advisers always say they are very eager and ready for a Biden versus Trump matchup, part two. And then, second, I think we are going to have to watch sort of the mood among Democrats. I'm going to leave you with something that Democratic Congressman Dean Phillips of Minnesota told me yesterday. Remember, he's a lawmaker who said over the summer that he doesn't think the president should seek a second term. This is what he told me yesterday. He said, \"Regardless of tomorrow's results, I believe Democrats must rebuild our brand and repopulate our bench of future leaders for both Congress and the White House. President Biden has fulfilled his promise to serve as a stabilizing 'bridge' to the future, and I expect a majority of Democrats will be seeking a next-generation candidate to take the baton in 2024.\" So, he's basically telling me that he thinks most of his colleagues will join him in wanting somebody else -- somebody that is not Joe Biden -- to run in 2024.
