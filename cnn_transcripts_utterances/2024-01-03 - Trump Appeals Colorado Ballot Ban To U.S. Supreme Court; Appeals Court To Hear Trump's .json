This hour, the White House is lambasting members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet it specifically to right wing extremists to whom critics say are calling for the ethnic cleansing of Gaza. With U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Israel now, some in the Biden administration wonder if Netanyahu is going to have to soon choose between Biden or the extremists in his government.Plus, a federal appeals court is coming down on the Biden administration for trying to protect emergency abortions ahead. A closer look at abortion in America since Roe v. Wade was overturned. But leading this hour we have some breaking news for you, a brand new court filing from Donald Trump. This time, he is going to the U.S. Supreme Court to try to appeal the decision made by the Colorado Supreme Court to remove him from its 2024 ballot for engaging in insurrection. Let's get right to CNN's Paula Reid who is here with me. Paula, I know you got a big stack of papers that you just printed out a second ago.",

They've passed 18 USC 2383, which is the insurrection ban.That specific statute does provide for a prison sentence. It also provides for permanent baring from public office, it actually expands on who it applies to beyond what the 14th Amendment has, but it requires a federal criminal proceeding. The other thing that Congress can do and that they have done in this case is they can imply -- they can apply impeachment proceedings. You know, President Trump was impeached for insurrection. And in fact, Nancy Pelosi was very open at the time that the reason why he needed to be impeached and tried after leaving office was to keep them off the ballot in 2024. He was acquitted.

This follows new research published yesterday by the Journal of the American Medical Association or JAMA that uncertainty over access to abortion care has led to 1000s of women who are not pregnant requesting abortion medications such as mifepristone in case they need it in the future. This also includes efforts from a number of Democratic led states, including New York and California and Massachusetts that are trying to stockpile the abortion medications. CNN's Jessica Schneider examines now how the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade continues to impact and complicate abortion policies across the United States.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JESSICA SCHNEIDER, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Anger fear and confusion have gripped parts of the country in the 18 months since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. SANDY SENN, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA STATE SENATE: A woman who was hell bent to have an abortion is going to have an abortion despite what this legislature says. SCHNEIDER (voice-over): While state lawmakers are passing a patchwork of anti-abortion laws that are often difficult to decipher, women and doctors are caught in the crosshairs. DR. CAITLIN BERNARD, OB/GYN: It's very scary for physicians to have a patient in front of you that you know exactly what they need, you know how to treat them, and yet you're wondering, well, who's going to -- who do I have to check with? Who's going to second guess me ? SCHNEIDER (voice-over): Dr. Caitlin Barnard performed an abortion for a 10 year old rape victim who traveled from Ohio to Indiana for the procedure just days after Roe was overturned. At the time, Indiana allowed abortions up to 22 weeks, now the state has nearly banned them completely. Barnard was not criminally charged, but she sat at the center of a firestorm for performing the abortion and then talking to reporters about it.",

You know, I would have thought that ESPN would have said, hey, this has gone too far. We're going to get sued. You know, no more Aaron Rodgers. But you know, Pat McAfee and his apology today, basically said, I can't wait to hear what Aaron has to say about it, which leads me to believe that he's going to be on again next week. So while things may have taken place, behind the scenes, I really think it's important for ESPN to come out and say, look, this is without basis. It's not true. We apologize for having us on our airwaves. ESPN is refusal to do that, frankly, is what has surprised me because if I were ESPN, I would not want this associated with my brand.",
