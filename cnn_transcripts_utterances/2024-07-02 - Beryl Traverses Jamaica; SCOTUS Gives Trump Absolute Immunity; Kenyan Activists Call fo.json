You might know or your audience might know there was a huge cricketing tournament here in Barbados on Saturday, the finals of the cricket T20 World Cup played between India and South Africa.So Barbados was already just teeming with tourists, primarily from India and South Africa in time to watch that World Cup game. So I think the authorities were kind of ready to welcome a lot of tourists. The resorts were all full, the airport was very busy. And Sunday morning is when the hurricane watch was issued. And it was, I would say from our experience, it was really a calm sense of preparation. The government issued strict orders to all the hotels and resorts to essentially shut down by 8 p.m. Sunday night. And our hotel and I understand other resorts really heeded that call. We were all given takeout containers for dinner. We're okay with that. We're in the middle of a hurricane. And we all ate our dinners inside our rooms. And same thing for this morning. To be honest, things really got bad late last night, so just about 24 hours ago when the first outer bands of hurricane barrels started to lash the southern coast of Barbados. I think Barbados got luckier than Grenada in the sense that the eye of the storm did not make landfall. It passed by us at sunrise this morning, or Sunday morning, and I think that really helped ensure that the power was not lost on the island. The water supply was not cut. There's no reports of major damage or accidents or death on Barbados. So it did, and I think a lot of people heeded the call to stay indoors. So all of those factors combined together I think really made this not as bad as it could have been or as bad as it probably is in Grenada.",

And we really saw that I think, at least from a Barbadian perspective, this is really a way of life. People expect during the summer months to have to prepare at very short notice for major storms. So we had to stop at a petrol station or a gas station. It was busy, but again, nothing crazy. We stopped at a grocery store, busy, but again, organized, busy. The tap water in Barbados is actually safe to drink, so you don't see tourists or locals buying a lot of plastic bottles, because it is safe to drink. But again, yesterday we saw some people carrying water bottles out with them in case the water supply got cut. So I think my advice is listen to what the authorities are saying. Stay indoors if there's an evacuation order, follow that as well. Our experience in Barbados, it wasn't a very wet, soaking kind of a storm. There was a lot of wind, a very high wind. And we actually are staying in an oceanfront room, so we had front row seats to the storm. The storm surge was really dangerous.

The Supreme Court, with its conservative majority, did not dismiss the trial entirely, but guaranteed it won't happen before the November election. It was supposed to start in March.Trump wrote on Truth Social that the decision is a big win for our constitution and democracy and that he's proud to be an American. Trump also said the ruling should, quote, \"end all of crooked Joe Biden's witch hunts against me. There is zero evidence, of course, that President Biden is behind Trump's legal problems.\" CNN's Katelyn Polantz has more details on this historic decision. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SR. CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: The U.S. Supreme Court, in a split 6-3 decision, decided that there is some ability for the president of the United States to have immunity for what he does when he's serving in that office. Now, it doesn't expand over everything that happens while someone is serving as president. And specifically, in the case against Donald Trump, the Supreme Court does not sign off on what Trump wanted, which was to toss the entire criminal prosecution against him in federal court. Instead, what the Supreme Court says is there are official core duties under the constitution, things like working with or delegating or giving direction to people underneath the president in the executive branch. That's all protected. But what's not protected is things that are in what the court calls a twilight zone or the unofficial actions of someone serving in the office, someone as a campaigner or someone doing things outside of the presidency. What that means for Trump is that there is a possible path for the Justice Department still to take him to trial, but there's going to have to be a lot of determinations on exactly what Donald Trump faces in his allegations with fake electors, with his communications with Vice President Mike Pence after the 2020 election, what he was saying publicly on the campaign trail. All of that is going to have to be looked at now by a trial judge with the possibility of further appeals delaying any trial that still has no date on the calendar.

And Donald Trump's communications with individuals out in the states, such as the infamous call to Brad Raffensperger in Georgia, just fined 11,780 votes, his communications with private individuals, his fabrication of these phony electoral certificates.

      "sentences": "Well, the youth expect to occupy literally everywhere, Rosemary. They moved from their targets of last week, which were State House and Parliament, to literally major roads across the country.And what they're protesting is the biggest, having the president step down to essentially resign. They're also calling for dealing with corruption in the country, as well as hiring of doctors and teachers, bringing down the high cost of living. Those are just a few of the issues that will bring them to the streets today. Right now, it's relatively quiet, though. We're seeing a police presence across town. But what we expect to be a bit different from the protests today, Rosemary, will be the use of excessive force by police. By that, we mean last week, the high court had banned police from using tear gas, water cannons and live ammunition against the protesters. The president also committed to not having a military presence in the streets. That is unless things escalated and that would be a last resort. So we'll be monitoring to see if police show some level of restraint today.",

I Appreciate it.Well, it is the end of the road for Team USA and the Copa America after losing to Uruguay on Monday. Members say they didn't play well enough to win and their fighting spirit was visibly crushed after Uruguay scored in the second half. The loss raises questions about Coach Greg Berhalter's position. He remains deeply unpopular with some American fans who could push for him to be replaced ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Portugal is now set to face off against France at Euro 2024 after both teams advanced to the quarterfinals on Monday.

      "sentences": "Yeah, just an absolutely remarkable sequence of events in Frankfurt on Monday night between Portugal and Slovenia. This was a game that had to be decided on penalties, but it was actually a penalty in extra time of this game that made all the headlines.It finished goalless after 90 minutes. Cristiano Ronaldo had that penalty saved towards the end of the first period of extra time, and he was just a mess afterwards. Look at that. He was absolutely distraught. Had to be consoled by his teammate. The game went to penalties. Portugal saved the first one. Then Ronaldo was up and he made it much to his relief. Portugal scored all of their penalties. Slovenia only got to take three. And the Portuguese goalie Diego Costa saved all of them. Absolutely remarkable drama in Frankfurt. It is Portugal and Cristiano Ronaldo who progressed to the quarterfinals. The other game on Monday was a game that had the potential to be a blockbuster clash between France and Belgium in Dusseldorf. Unfortunately, it didn't at all live up to the hype, but it might at least have served as a bit of a distraction for any French fans who are concerned about the political situation back home right now. This was a largely uneventful game. It seemed to be heading for extra time until the 85th minute when the French went in front with an own goal. Substitute Colomwane's shot was turned in by the very unfortunate Belgian defender Jan Vertonghen. And that was the difference in the end. Les Bleus edging it by a goal to nil. France have yet to inspire at the Euros this summer, but they are at least into the quarterfinals on Friday when they will face Portugal. It's going to be Ronaldo versus Mbappe. That is a pretty epic showdown. Can't wait. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
