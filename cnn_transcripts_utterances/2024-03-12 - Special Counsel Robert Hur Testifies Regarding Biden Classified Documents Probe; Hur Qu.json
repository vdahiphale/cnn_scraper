And the irony is that as president, Trump had full discretion over handling classified material and full discretion in deciding which records to retain. As a senator or vice president, Joe Biden didn't have that. So, now we get to this glaring double standard. I think it would be toxic to the rule of law on its face if it was just two ordinary citizens.

And thank you, Mr. Hur, for being here today. I found your report very interesting, and I learned some things about it, the law and the precedence. There are clear differences between the cases of -- and precedence set by Presidents Reagan, Trump, and Biden. Now, it was widely known that President Reagan kept diaries from his presidency that included classified information. What I didn't know and learned in your report was that the Department of Justice, \"Repeatedly described the diaries in public court filings as Mr. Reagan's personal records\", and that no agency ever attempted to remove his diaries. That's on page 195 of your report. Very interesting. So, the investigation found that President Biden believed that his notebooks were his personal property, including work and political notes, reflections, to do lists, and more, that he was entitled to take home. You found that on page 232. So, while much of his notebook was work related, he still had some purely personal subjects like, again, I quote, \"Gut-wrenching\", entities about the illness and death of his son, Beau, and that's on page 82 and 253 of your report. So, it's clear, based on the Reagan precedent that no criminal charges were warranted in this matter, relative to personal notebooks. Now, I want to be clear that although the notebooks contain some very personal information, and President Biden considered them his personal property, the President allowed your team to seize and review all of the notebooks you found.
