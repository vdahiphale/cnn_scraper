He will also meet with local officials about reopening the Baltimore port as fast as possible. Biden has said the federal government will pay to rebuild the bridge.The mayor of Uvalde, Texas, has resigned effective immediately. Yesterday, Cody Smith announced he's stepping down to focus on his health. Smith did not reveal the nature of his medical condition. Smith was elected to office following the 2022 mass shooting at Robb Elementary School, where 19 students and two teachers were killed. He left office just days before the Uvalde police chief is set to leave office. The chief announce his resignation last month. And the Powerball jackpot has risen to a $1 billion, $1 billion.

Of course, we're all trying to figure out that exact bit of information because you see how well that security system worked there at the FBI headquarters just outside of Atlanta. That barricade can stop powerful vehicles from moving forward. You can see the damage to the front of the vehicle. A lot of folks talking about how he tried to tailgate someone going yet and then at some point two other agents who were in that parking lot were able to apprehend the man.Now, we know he was taken to a downtown hospital. That's where he was going to get an evaluation. He has not popped up in the jail records so far. So, that evaluation can take anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. We then believe the local police, the DeKalb County Police, will take him into custody and then move him to the sheriff's office. What we know. Yesterday, around 12:30, that's when he tried to tailgate someone. Popped out of that small car. The bomb squad responded, looked inside that vehicle and found no weapons. And there was no weapons on the man according to the FBI. So, at this point, it's really trying to figure out, what was the motivation? Have there been any online postings toward the FBI? Was he trying to get some sort of attention? These are all questions we want to ask. I've already talked to the FBI about whether or not they'd released the video from that security camera that's just above that opening. They said they would probably do that. And this will probably move to not only state and federal charges, but that newer FBI building is fortified in a way that a lot of other buildings around the area or not. So, you can see all that came into place yesterday, stopping this man from gaining entry and following the other employee in. Sara.",

And in another ruling released the same time, the judges allowed Florida voters to decide this fall whether to expand abortion access.CNN's Carlos Suarez is joining us now from Miami its morning.

The justices, yesterday, also approved the wording of a state constitutional amendment that would protect the right to an abortion in Florida. The ballot amendment would prohibit the restriction of an abortion before viability, which is around the 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. It is important to note here that 60 percent of voters would have to approve it in November in order for it to pass.Now, in a statement on both of these decisions, Planned Parenthood yesterday said in part, quote, \"our health centers will continue to provide the high-quality, expert sexual and reproductive health care Floridians have come to know and depend on and look forward to the day when access to abortion care isn't determined by where you live.\" You can expect the issue to come up later this morning when Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra takes part in a visit to south Florida. Again, both of these decisions no doubt will impact the presidential race in November. Of course, Florida historically has been on the Republican side of things.

Rubio, DeSantis, Rick Scott. So, if past is prologue, it's hard to see how that's going to change.You also have to look at the past of Florida and the present. And the past, in 2008, the registered Florida Democrats outnumbered registered Republicans in Florida by about 655,000. 2008. Now, Republicans outnumber registered Democrats in the state by 850,000. The state has become much more Republican. There's also a small, potential problem for the abortion rights supporters. In order for this to pass, as we've said before, it takes 60 percent. That means they not only want a majority of - a super majority of Democrats, a super majority of independents, they're going to need at least a majority of Republicans. If the race becomes too partisan, they run the risk of turning off Republican voters and having them vote no if they think it's a stalking horse for Joe Biden.

We do not expect that this sale will be expedited is what a U.S. official told me. So, Israel wouldn't get these jets for about five years. But, still, the timing is very significant and likely to cause a lot of debate in Congress. We have seen more and more Democratic lawmakers call on the Biden administration to enact restrictions or conditions on the military aid as the toll in Gaza continues to grow. We have not seen the Biden administration signal that they are willing to put any conditions on at this point, though, of course, that could change if Israel goes into Rafah. But at this point we are hearing from administration officials that they are standing by their longstanding commitment to Israel's security and what they say is Israel's need for self-defense among a number of what they say are enemies and opponents that surround them. Now, another key aspect of this sale, Kate, is we know they are about to give it the approval because they have taken the first step in this process. They have let both the top Democrat and Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee know about this sale. We know that the top Republicans on both of those committees have given their go ahead to this sale, but the Democrats on both of those committees could put a hold on this.
