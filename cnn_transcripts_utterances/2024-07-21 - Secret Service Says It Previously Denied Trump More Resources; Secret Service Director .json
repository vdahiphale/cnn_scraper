Operating in that, you know, persistent threat environment for the -- for the former president every resource that is potentially available that the Secret Service has should have been applied to the former president.

It slammed into a building about 100 yards away from the U.S. consulate killing one man and injuring several others.Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that the reason why Israel struck the Houthi targets at Hodeidah port on Saturday and hasn't struck over the past few months when more than 200 projectiles, drones, missiles, and the like have been fired towards Israel is because they killed an Israeli citizen. Now, as you mentioned the Houthis have fired more missiles towards Israel. Israel said that it intercepted with its Arrow 3 aerial defense system, a surface-to-surface missile earlier today, and that it didn't enter Israeli airspace. But I suppose the big question now is -- perhaps we could see an increase in the tempo and the number of launches by the Houthis towards Israel. The question is, was the drone attack that was successful from the Houthis on Friday night was that a fluke? Or does that point to further perhaps weaknesses in Israel -- in Israel's missile defense system, which thus far has prevented any of those 200 projectiles from hitting Israeli territory? And of course, all of this comes just on the eve of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu leaving for Washington. He's due to speak with President Biden at the White House on Tuesday, and then Congress on Wednesday. And if anything, these attacks by the Houthis, and he mentioned this in a statement, will bolster his case to say that not only is Israel fighting these proxies of Iran, but it's fighting against Iranian-backed proxies. And that therefore, Israel and the U.S. are on the same page and that is its why the U.S. and all of the other allies of Israel should remain steadfast in its support -- in their support for Israel.

Apparently, this is the first time Israel has struck the Houthis. This is according to Israeli officials. How significant is this confrontation between the Houthi rebels and Israeli forces? And what will this strike mean for the Houthis because Prime Minister Netanyahu said that this port was an entry point for deadly weapons for Houthis? KIM DOZIER, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST: It's significant because the Yemenis managed to get or the Houthis, in particular, managed to get a drone into Israeli airspace and kill at least one Israeli in Tel Aviv. Now, the IDF is saying that's because they did see the drone, but it was misidentified, not called a threat due to human error. It flew over Egyptian airspace and that's how it went an unusual route and circumvented the normal system. But you see there's a pattern. Houthis are backed by Iran. Hezbollah is backed by Iran. Whenever Israel seems to get a sort of -- a bit of breathing room with Hezbollah, for instance, in the north you see now the Houthis stepping up in the south so that the Israeli Defense Forces are always engaged, being exhausted at one point or another as they try to complete their operations inside Gaza. Now, if you talk to Israeli officials, they believe this is part of an Iranian ploy to wear them out and to always keep them on their toes and to keep testing Israeli's defenses. And that's one of the reasons that Israeli official say they struck the Hodeidah port because it is a place that U.S. officials have also said the Houthis get constant supplies, military supplies from Iran to keep up their fight on Israel and other parts of -- other western targets.",

That said, Netanyahu has almost made no secret that he'd like to see Trump back in office because the last Trump administration was much more permissive of whatever Netanyahu thought needed to be done.The last Trump administration endorsed making Jerusalem the capital of Israel. Something that multiple Democratic, multiple administrations had refused to do, holding that out for ultimate peace talks. So, what you have is a weakened president in Biden who is being beaten up by his own Democratic Party now meeting with Netanyahu just after the U.N.'s highest court has condemned Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, and that Biden is going to try to take him to task over continuing to prosecute a bloody war in Gaza. And from all public opinion it has no effect. So, it's going to make Biden look even weaker at a time when he's already getting beaten up in the polls and by his own party. WALKER: When Netanyahu addresses this joint session of Congress on Wednesday, what do you expect to hear from Netanyahu? I mean, might he highlight any of these policy differences that he has had with Biden?

But some of these areas, you're talking 15 to 20 degrees above what they would even normally see in summer, so it's just extremely rare situation for a lot of these areas.So, let's take a look. Look at all of these locations. You're talking states like California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, all setting record temperatures yesterday and all reaching into the triple digits, places you would normally think of for triple-digit temperatures like say areas of Idaho Washington, and Oregon, all getting up to that high up around 105. Keep in mind that's the normal high temperature you would see in a desert city like Phoenix. not Spokane or Boise but that's what we're going to see today. 107 for the high today in Boise, still 105 Tuesday. But at least the northern cities start to get a brief reprieve by the middle of the week. It's the southern areas it's going to linger for a few more days. Another growing concern is the fire threat. And we've got over 50 active wildfires right now in the West. This particular is an area of concern. This is where we have the critical risk for today. Yes, it's the extremely hot temperatures but also the gusty winds and the potential for some dry thunderstorms. We also have thunderstorms in the southwest, really much of the southern tier as a whole.
