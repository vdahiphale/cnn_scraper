It was obviously kept secret until President Biden was on the ground. Poppy and Sara, he was actually on the ground for some time before we had the White House confirm that he was there. But we're learning that it was months of planning that actually went into this. Only a handful of aides from different agencies that were involved in this. Obviously, they wanted to keep it an incredibly close hold because it is such a sensitive visit.And what we're learning from the White House is that it was last Friday when President Biden made the final decision that, yes, he was going to be going into this active war zone right around the anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That's when he decided to go. He went in with an incredibly small contingent. Typically, the president can take over a dozen staffers with him somewhere, a huge security contingent. But we are now learning that he went with a small medical staff, a photographer, only a handful of staffers were there with him as the president was going in, meeting with President Zelenskyy. And that's a meeting that involved a briefing from President Zelenskyy's team on what they believe they're going to need in the coming months, what that is going to look like, and what they'll need with that expected Russian offensive that's supposed to happen this spring. We're covering all angles of this morning. Clarissa Ward is live in Kyiv. Phil Mattingly is here in Warsaw with me. Chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto is standing by in Washington. Clarissa, I want to start with you, because you're on the ground here. You're on the ground in Kyiv, adds the president was making that visit there. He got that briefing from Zelenskyy's team. What is the message he's hearing from them? What are they saying that they need and that they need now?",

That was quite a moment this weekend, because for a year, we're nearly a year into this war now, just a few days shy, China has not provided that support, and the U.S. has been watching very closely. And to hear from the U.S. secretary of state that they now believe China is considering providing lethal support to Russia would be a marked qualitative change for that, well, growing alliance, frankly, between Russia and China, and quite an aggressive move by China given how badly the war is going for Russia, but one that would certainly, it would seem, lengthen the war, right.Folks are looking for a light at the end of the tunnel here. The Ukrainians, as Clarissa was noting, they feel that they're just shy of being able to win this, that they just need a few more weapons, a few more categories of weapons, longer-range rockets and missiles, fighter jets, et cetera, they're getting tanks. They feel that they're just shy of winning this thing and bringing it to a close. For China to come in might very well lengthen it. Now, President Biden did come to Kyiv with something, as you will often see on visits like this, and that is an aid package that includes Javelin missiles, more ammunition. Ukraine has been burning through that very fast, but not the fighter jets, this sort of next category of weapons that Ukrainians are asking for now. But the finer point I would just make is that, is that this is a visit to a war zone by a U.S. president unlike one we've seen really for decades. I mean, to go to Iraq and Afghanistan, those were significant moments for Bush and Obama, but those were war zones with the U.S. military in action and at least in the field they were going, exercising some sort of control. This is Kyiv. The U.S. military is not active there. It is an active war zone. It was quite a decision by this president to go to Kyiv in wartime.",

      "sentences": "First of all, Poppy, it's all over Russian media, this visit by U.S. President Biden to Ukraine. The way the Russians have been trying to frame this is essentially they are saying that they're in a war not with Ukraine, but against the west and specifically against the United States. And there certainly are some commentators out there who are saying exactly that right now, saying, look, President Biden on the ground there shows that this is a war between Russia and the west, Russia and the United States, rather than just Russia and Ukraine.So this is certainly something that feeds into their narrative. And of course, also very important with the fact that President Vladimir Putin of Russia is set to give a giant speech here tomorrow which everybody here in Moscow sees as absolutely key. We're certain that he is going to try and rally the Russian Navy behind what he calls the special military operation. And this visit certainly is something that could play into that as well. Now, as far as Jake Sullivan saying that they informed the Russians before coming here, that is actually also something that I've been monitoring over the past hour-and-a-half or so, because Russian media is playing that up as well. They are talking about that. We don't have anything from the Kremlin specifically, but there certainly are some hardline Russian military journalists out there who are absolutely angry about this and said Vladimir Putin should never have allowed President Biden to come to Moscow. And there's one who even said that he believes that President Biden could probably go all the way to Bakhmut without seeing any trouble from the Russian military. So there is some criticism of Vladimir Putin. But if you look at some of these hardline reporters, hardline commentators, a lot of them feel that Vladimir Putin needs to be even tougher, even more brutal than he has been so far. But I do think, guys, that it is absolutely key to point out to our viewers that right now, from the perspective that we're getting here in Moscow, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that Vladimir Putin is anywhere near backing down. In fact, it seems to us as though the Russians are doubling down. And certainly what we expect here this entire week is a lot of patriotic narratives coming from the Russian president, and certainly him trying to rally the Russian nation. And they believe that in the long run, they will be able to overpower the Ukrainians, and they also believe that they'll be able to outlast the United States and European allies. So that's something that's really important, I think, to keep in perspective, that right now the Russians nowhere near backing down at this point, guys.",

This was a prop that was part of Carter's 1976 presidential campaign, and he told me, he has been meaning to get out here for weeks to touch up this statue, but felt a real sense of urgency in the wake of learning about Carter in hospice care to get this done, out of tribute and honor to him.That is how this town is responding. Carter, just an immense sense of pride in this community for him. We are within spitting distance of where he went to school, or very close to a train depot that was actually also the site of his campaign headquarters. And we're not far from his family home, a home that he built in the 1960s and continues to live in today. So a lot of pride here that the 39th President is from this town, but also many folks here are really just praying for their neighbor. Take a listen. Okay, so that was -- okay, so we don't have that soundbite there, but we did speak to Michael Dominic, who recalled that the former President was a frequent staple at community events, and was a deep man of faith, and it is that faith, Sara that the Carter family and the residents here are leaning on during this difficult time -- Sara.",
