The longtime President Erdogan, who has been in power for 20 years, is now finding himself in a fight for his political life. With 99 percent of the votes counted so far, neither President Erdogan nor his rival Kemal Kilicdaroglu have secured a majority of the vote, so it would be about 50 percent that is needed to win.Of course, Turkey is a key ally of the military alliance known as NATO. They have the second-biggest military in NATO. But Erdogan has come under scrutiny as he has maintained close ties with Russia despite its brutal invasion of Ukraine. It wasn't that long ago that Turkey was buying weapons from Russia against the objections of the United States. Erdogan has also continued to block Sweden from joining NATO so far. If Sweden does join that alliance, of course, that would amount to a major blow to President Vladimir Putin. Joining us now with his thoughts on the election that is happening in his home country is Turkish-American professional basketball player Enes Kanter Freedom, an outspoken critic of President Erdogan, I should note. Enes, thank you so much for joining us this morning as we are watching what is playing out. This is something that officials in Washington were also keeping a close eye on yesterday. What does it say to you that -- about Erdogan's ruling and what voters think of it now that it is going to a runoff? ENES KANTER FREEDOM, TURKISH-AMERICAN BASKETBALL PLAYER, FORMER NBA PLAYER:  Thank you for having me, Kaitlan. I mean, the situation is getting worse and worse every day. I mean, if you look at Turkey right now, it is the number one country in the world that put the most journalists in jail, and Erdogan pretty much controls the media. And there is going to be a runoff on the elections on May 28, I believe, and right now, all the opposition leaders came together to just go against one guy because the whole country is saying enough is enough because we want to go back to democracy and freedom again.",
