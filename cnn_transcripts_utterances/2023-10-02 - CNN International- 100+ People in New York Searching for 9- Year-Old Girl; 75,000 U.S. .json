Now there are semi-autonomous regions in northern Iraq. There's a semi- autonomous region in Syria.But they continue again, this Kurdish militant group, the PKK, to carry out these attacks against Turkey, which have been very deadly in recent years. The latest, of course, is this one Sunday that happened outside the Interior Ministry, broad daylight hours. We're talking 9:30 in the morning. Two assailants detonating an explosive, killing a civilian, stealing a car. I mean, a clear message to lawmakers in Ankara and the capital because they were returning from their summer. They were -- this was the first session. President Erdogan was set to speak just hours later. And in that statement, President Erdogan again vowed that this would not backtrack Turkey's fight against terrorism domestically and internationally. He said in his state. And called it the last flutters of terrorism. Just hours later, Turkey carried out these air strikes in northern Iraq on 20 targets, as you mentioned, including warehouses, caves, weapons depots. They say -- Turkey's defense ministry says it neutralized many terrorists without providing a death toll specifically. But again, as we mentioned in the beginning here, this is not over. It's not a simple tip for tat and it's done. This is an on-going insurgency that Turkey continues to fight. And important to note, that it's not only Turkey that designates the PKK as a terrorist group. It is also the U.S. It is also the EU.

And it comes as the French capital is preparing to host next year's Summer Olympics. CNN's Melissa Bell reports.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A nasty commute and not just for the passengers you can see. French officials say that bedbugs have infested Paris's transport networks and the wider city. The race is now on to exterminate the bugs with less than a year to go until the Olympics. From metros to high-speed trains, videos have shown them taking over some cinemas and even Charles de Gaulle Airport, which is making for an itchy situation, as France prepares to host the rest of the world next summer. French officials are preparing to take measures to contain the scourge, with transport operators gathering this week to try to find ways of getting rid of the pests. But that's not enough for some, who say the thought of sitting on a bus or a train next to the uninvited seatmates makes their skin crawl. LAURA MMADI, TRAIN PASSENGER (through translator): That really traumatized me. I'll keep my luggage closed to prevent them from getting to my home. Also, I'm not from here, so once I get home, I'll have to wash all my clothes. LUC VILLETTE, TRAIN PASSENGER (through translator): I mean, the fact that we can actually see them means there are a lot of them. And in addition, they're being seen in the day when they usually come out at night, so there is a big problem somewhere. BELL (voice-over): Paris deputy mayor Emmanuel Gregoire says that no one is safe from the problem, because the bugs can be picked up anywhere. A recent government report estimated that about one in 10 French households had had bedbug infestations between 2017 and last year. There's some fumigation companies say business is higher than usual and more urgent. SACHA KRIEF, PEST CONTROL STORE MANAGER (through translator): We've had customers calling us up crying, desperate for a solution. And it's very, very costly when you have to throw away all of your bedding, when you have to undergo works in your apartment. And so, you get into a sort of a paranoia. BELL (voice-over): And whilst bedbugs may be a growing nuisance in Paris, health experts say that they're not considered dangerous, causing merely itching and rashes. And their numbers are increasing, not just in the French capital but around the world, as people travel more, and the bugs become more resistant to pesticides. An irritating problem, but not one, say French officials, that should pose a threat to the upcoming Olympics. Their plan, to stop the bedbugs biting as soon as they can. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris.
