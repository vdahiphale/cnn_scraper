That crucial question now in the hands of three judges on the DC Court of Appeals. Trump says he cannot be prosecuted for trying to overturn the election because they were quote, official actions he took while President. Moments ago, we heard from Trump himself.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD J. TRUMP, 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it's very unfair when an opponent, a political opponent is prosecuted by the DOJ, by Biden's DOJ. So they're losing in every poll. They're losing in almost every demographic. Numbers came out today that are really very mind boggling if you happen to be Joe Biden. And I think they feel this is the way they're going to try and win. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That inevitably dampens the ability of the President. JAMES PEARCE, ASSISTANT SPECIAL COUNSEL, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE: Never in our nation's history until this case has a president claimed that immunity and criminal prosecution extends beyond his time in office. The President has a unique constitutional role, but he is not above the law. (END VIDEO CLIP) RAJU: Now a ruling could come quickly and will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court.

Here's Judge Florence Pan sort of tried to stretch out some of the stress test this argument that the former president's legal team is making. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JUDGE FLORENCE Y.

      "sentences": "So this is what we call the parade of horribles. This is when the lawyers say, if you find in this way, here's how horrible things can get under your interpretation. And the use of hypotheticals is very common by judges, and also by counsel to try to say, if you do this, here's what it means. So that's why you have those contrasting views.Trump's lawyers saying, you know, no presidents will be able to do anything because there'll be so scared of what might happen to them. And you have the Special Counsel's lawyers say, presidents can do anything, including kill their political rivals with no consequences whatsoever. And then you have the court kind of chiming in with their own hypotheticals to kind of test the boundary. So that's a very common argument method. And I think it's very effective here, when you think about a president who might order the assassination of a political rival. So think about how that would be obviously a terrible thing. Although honestly, the truth is, you don't have to go too far from the facts of this particular case, to have a parade of horribles, right? The notion of a president doing what this former president did. Influencing an election, trying to steal an election. So you know, in some ways, the parade of horribles, you know, plays out with the facts of this case, but that's what they're doing there. And it's an effective tool. And I think that it helps to educate the public as well about what the stakes are here.",

I mean, either there is presidential immunity or not.That does not depend upon public polling. And to Jennifer's point here, the parade of horribles or the Pandora's Box argument here, that's absolutely true, except it's flipped, the Pandora's box would be opened is if the court - any court would define that you can't prosecute a president for doing anything. That's the Pandora's box, and Trump is showing us exactly what's in it. He talks about it all the time, what he's going to do.",

You know, it's not so much about whether Donald Trump through his agents conceded before that he could be prosecuted later. I mean, the judges can think about that, but they really do have to analyze this on its own merits. But the issue is, this is a political process. Impeachment is a political process. It has legal trappings.But it doesn't have anything to do with whether, you know, these legal proceedings going on now, it's separate. So you can't expect that someone will be impeached and convicted in the Senate on the legal merits, right? It's a political thing. So that really, to me, is what the court is thinking about. They're just thinking that's a separate thing. Double Jeopardy is a legal issue, not a political issue.

They thought that the fundraising, his rise in the polls, all of that would be short lived, but it's actually been extended. And I think it's - that's something that they're also looking at very closely. Obviously, maybe not doing as well with independents, but it's something that they've seen has really lasted beyond the immediate impact of the indictments and has continued.
