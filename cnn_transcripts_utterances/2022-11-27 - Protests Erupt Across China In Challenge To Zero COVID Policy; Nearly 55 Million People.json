Thanks for joining me, I'm Paula Reid in today for Fredricka Whitfield.We begin this hour with unprecedented acts of defiance in cities and university campuses across China. Anger and frustration boiling over against the government's strict Zero COVID lockdowns. Protesters in Shanghai chanting \"step down\" aimed at China's leader Xi Jinping and his ruling Communist Party. But also this, videos from Shanghai earlier today showing protesters being roughed up and dragged away by police. People can be heard yelling release them. CNN's Steven Jiang has more.

      "sentences": "It was just extraordinary to hear the protesters in Shanghai chant the slogans directly targeting Chinese leader Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party because up to that point even the most vehement opponents of the Zero COVID policy have been dancing around this issue and saying how the top leadership had its heart in the right place, but instead blaming local law enforcement, pointing finger at overzealous or incompetent local officials.But those protesters in downtown Shanghai really directly challenging the legitimacy of the party and its strongman leader, and saying the problem really lies with the system. That's obviously somebody not tolerated in this one-party dictatorship. So there was growing worry and concern about the fate of some of the protesters who got taken away by the police. So on Sunday, there was another crowd gathering on the same spot in Shanghai, demanding those protesters' release. But now we understand there's a heavy police presence on location with the authorities sealing off a larger area around this protester site but also clearing everyone from this location. So there's obviously a lot of fear on the part of the authorities that this kind of messaging could inspire others across the country. But this latest wave of protests really triggered by a deadly apartment fire in Xinjiang and how the authorities there handled the aftermath. Remember, on one hand officials there insisted that the COVID measures they put in place had nothing to do with the firefighter's delay in reaching the fire to put it out, but on the other hand, after insisting for weeks that lockdowns must be maintained because of the outbreak, they all of a sudden announced they phased reopening after the fire. So all of that really serving as the latest and loudest wake-up call to a lot of people here in terms of how increasingly unscientific and ineffective as well as potentially dangerous this policy has become. Not to mention all the absurdities surrounding its enforcement. That's why across the country we are seeing people trying to take matters into their own hands, taking to the streets, demanding their freedoms and also tearing down metal fences or barriers set up by local officials to seal them inside their residential compounds. And also, of course multiple vigils and protests spearheaded by university students on campuses across the nation. Because, remember, for many of these young people, they have lived their entire college life in the past three years under some forms of lockdown. Just imagine all of that pent-up anger and frustration. Steven Jiang, CNN, Beijing, (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I am surrounded by police, they're telling me to shift in a little bit, and if we just turn the camera around you'll see there is a row of police. There is -- mostly young people who have gathered here. And many people are also holding white papers in their hands which is a sign of solidarity against censorship. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

So this is when you've got more status and you still have to wait in a line here just to get your bags tagged and on their way.And so even if you have status, you've got more miles, you're a special card member, you have a special credit card, you're still going to be waiting in line because this is supposed to be the busiest travel day following the Thanksgiving holiday. So this is something that we're seeing really all across the airport on the Delta side here in the Atlanta, on the north terminal side where you have all the other airports. But take a look at the line here. This is the general TSA boarding area. So this isn't precheck, this isn't clear, these are folks who are just trying to make their way in. Some of them have clear, so special access to get in through faster, and through screening. Other people are just going to general boarding. And you've got lines here, but it could be worse. You see, these are the rows that were filled when we got here a couple of hours ago. So you could have started here. So it's not as bad as we've seen it. And really last year we were dealing with a trifecta of issues. We had bad weather around the Thanksgiving holiday. We had COVID sickouts for those airline workers, and we had people who were just not used to traveling, who had that travel delay from not traveling because of the pandemic, and that really slowed down a lot of the lines like getting through general screening.

And that what I think -- that's what I think is so extraordinary is that he's hiding behind a small unrepresentative poll to do what he wanted. It's kind of pathetic, really.If he had the guts, he'd just say I don't actually care about racism, I don't care about bigotry, I don't care about fake accounts. I just need to have as much content as possible because that's ultimately what a platform like Twitter needs is monetizable assets and that's content, really.",

To be clear, though, it is not an episode about sex dolls. It is an episode about how we all have become reliant, attached, sometimes even addicted to nonhuman entities. Most of us are not in a relationship with a life-sized doll but we are in a relationship with our devices, and what you can experience, what you can do on them.These apps that we have on our devices, they are powered by very powerful AI. And so these algorithms, they know more about us than we know ourselves. They know what makes us happy, what makes us sad, the things that we like to buy. In some cases, they are even thinking for us and we're not thinking for ourselves, and because there is this trend toward personalization, what we are interested in, you know, we follow the people who espouse what we do, all of this information is being essentially served to us on a silver platter based on all of the data that has been collected on our habits. And let's face it, we do, most of us, spend more time on our devices with these algorithms or on these algorithms than we do with human beings. I mean, ask kids these days or watch kids these days, they would rather forego playdates or doing sports to be on their devices because that is how much control they have over us.",
