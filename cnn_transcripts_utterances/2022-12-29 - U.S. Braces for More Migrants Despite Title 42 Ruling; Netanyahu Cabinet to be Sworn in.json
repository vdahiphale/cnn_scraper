And Ukrainian officials say Russia hit multiple cities with more than 120 missiles. At least three people were wounded in Kyiv including a 14-year-old child. The U.S. is bracing for more migrants coming from Mexico despite a court ruling that makes it easy to turn them away. Officials are putting up 10 new temporary processing facilities in anticipation of the arrival of more migrants. That's despite the U.S. Supreme Court ruling to temporarily keep a policy called Title 42 under which many of them can be expelled without an immigration hearing. As Leyla Santiago reports from El Paso, Texas, many migrants don't plan on going back. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

That's according to a rescue worker who spoke to CNN after flames engulfed the structure on Wednesday night. He says he saw two people die when they jumped from the building while other people suffered broken legs.The fire tore through the building which contains a hotel located near the border with Thailand. The death toll is expected to rise as emergency crews search hotel rooms for more victims. For more now let's bring in journalist Manisha Tank and she's joining us from Singapore.

I have been looking at a number of videos that have been coming from the scene. These started coming out overnight and into the morning and as the day has gone on and you can clearly see this blaze in what looks like a restaurant area. And on one side of it actually slot machines. I'm mentioning that because I want to give a little context around this place. It's a town call Poi Pet where the Grand Diamond hotel and casino is located. This is where the blaze broke out overnight. It's really popular with large groups of Thai tourists who are enthusiastic about gambling. So, they crossed the border. It's very close to the Thai border and go over for these activities. It's also stop off point for people who are venturing further into Cambodia to visit the temples. So, it's popular with tourists. It's popular with gamblers. We do know in terms of numbers of the people that might have been there -- we're still waiting for confirmation of numbers -- but I can tell you that rescue team said about 700 Thais were rescued. But what we are learning is that the death toll has been creeping up. We now know that 16 people have lost their lives and we are tracking all of the feeds and all the information from the rescue teams to keep a check on that number. These rescue teams, as you mentioned, they saw people jump for their lives. Watched two people die on the spot. In fact, I just want to quote you what one of those rescue workers said to our CNN team. I was shouting and trying to stop them from jumping off the building. I shouted in Thai because most of them are Thai. I saw people who died immediately after jumping off the building. You can imagine how harrowing those sorts of scenes are. We've also learned that some of those who have died, have died as a result of smoke inhalation. The fire didn't reach them, the smoke did.",

There's no direct evidence tying their deaths to Moscow. But observers say the string of accidents seems more than just coincidental. CNN's Melissa Bell reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): They were part of the Russian elite, some at one point critical of the war in Ukraine. Several died after falling through windows, at least 13 dead in suspicious circumstances this year. The latest Russian tycoon to plunge to his death Pavel Antov who died on Saturday in India. Over the summer, Antov denied criticizing the war in a WhatsApp message. His death and that of a friend he was vacationing with now under investigation by Indian authorities. Another tycoon to fall from a window this time in Moscow was Ravil Maganov, the head of Russia's oil giant. In March, LUKOIL released a statement calling for the soonest termination of the armed conflict. Maganov was just one of several Russian energy executives whose deaths have raised questions. Some of the insiders who've died have done so alongside their families like Sergei Protosenya and Vladislav Avayev, both of whom were said to have murdered relatives before killing themselves. The Kremlin has remained tight lipped, but Vladimir Putin's message has been chillingly clear. VLADIMIR PUTIN, RUSSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): It's safer at home. Those who decided to ignore this obvious call lost hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars in the West. This is how much of a so called safe haven for fortune as it turned out to be. BELL (voice-over): Some of those who've stayed at home like oligarch Oleg Deripaska have been more fortunate without mincing their words about Ukraine. OLEG DERIPASKA, RUSSIAN OLIGARCH (through translator): We have abandoned what was achieved in the 2000s. And now we're waiting for victory, winning what? This is, of course, a colossal mistake. BELL (voice-over): The outspokenness of some of those closest to the regime, a measure of what they stood to lose. And while no ties between the Kremlin and these deaths have been proven in court, for many, they stir fears of Russia's reach. Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And they said, no, you need to go down to baggage. So, we got in that que which was over an hour, well over an hour. And my husband Carl was standing in that line and I was like, we don't need both of us to stand here. So, I started walking around thinking maybe I would find our luggage. Maybe it was already in the pile. I have never seen anything like this. Just hundreds and hundreds of bags getting pulled off the carrousels and placed in the space between carrousels. People were having to climb on carrousels to like get through the aisleways of bags and look for their own luggage.
