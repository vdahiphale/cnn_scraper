The easier of these charges for prosecutors to prove is the one related to Alex Baldwin's role as producer, and why do I say that? They are saying that Alec Baldwin departed from the standard of care and that his actions rose to criminal negligence in that he was in charge, or that he had the responsibility, to make sure that that films that was safe and particularly so, that the firearms on set were being maintained safe, as his role as a producer, sort of overseeing the production on that set. The harder of those charges is related to Alec Baldwin's relation as an actor. The involuntary manslaughter charge there is related to him being an actor or that he should have known or should have checked whether that gun was loaded before he pulled the trigger.
