      "sentences": "Russia's strange obsession with capturing what's left of the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut may soon be here.For months, Moscow has sent a staggering and ever-increasing number of troops into this battle. Ukrainian fighters have managed to hold their lines, but military leaders say that's becoming increasingly difficult, and a tactical retreat is on the table. On the Russian side, much of the fighting in recent weeks has been done by mercenaries with the notorious Wagner Group. On Thursday, they released this video, reportedly from Bakhmut, raising their banner on top of a heavily-damaged building. Alongside the mercenaries, Ukrainian troops tell CNN they're facing at least two Russian paratrooper battalions. A CNN team reporting from a neighboring town heard the constant sound of artillery fire throughout the day. Ukrainian troops are now building new defensive lines West of Bakhmut. And in the coming hours, the White House plans to announce further military aid to Ukraine, mostly much-needed ammunition. Ukraine is denying any involvement with an alleged raid in Southern Russia, which Moscow says resulted in civilian deaths. Russian officials claim a small Ukraine armed group crossed into the Bryansk region. But a Ukrainian presidential adviser dismissed the allegations as either classic deliberate provocation by the Kremlin or the work of Russian partisans taking a stand against Vladimir Putin. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has more now from Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Breaking news on Kremlin-controlled media. A violent attack by Ukraine into Russian territory, they claim. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): According to updated information, as a result of the actions of the infiltration in the village of Lyubechane, Klimovsky district. The number of dead civilians increased to two. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Soon, this video emerged of a group calling themselves the Russian Volunteer Corps, standing in front of a Russian government building.",

Similar disagreements over Russia's invasion of Ukraine played out in the Southern Indian city of Bangalore last month, when G-20 finance ministers failed to agree on a statement after their meeting. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who attended the meeting, said that it had been marred by Russia's unprovoked and unjustified war against Ukraine and called on the Kremlin to end its war of aggression. His Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, accused Western colleagues of focusing on the Ukrainian situation and using mostly foul (ph) means to pass the conflict as Russian aggression. Lavrov and Blinken had an unexpected meeting on the sidelines of the G-20 meeting. The first between the two leaders since the war in Ukraine began more than a year ago. At a time when the world is grappling with soaring food and energy costs, India has been keen to position itself as a leader of the developing nations, often referred to as the global South. And this was central to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's opening remarks at the G-20 meet, when he appealed to the leaders to not allow issues that cannot be resolved together to come in the way of those that can.

There was also the hoodie of the Snapchat video that Paul Murdaugh sent to friends on Snapchat at 7:56 p.m., and that showed him wearing -- showed Alex Murdaugh wearing long pants and a blue shirt. Later when he saw investigators, he was wearing shorts and a white T- shirt. So of course the state said that he had washed up and changed clothes after allegedly killing his family at the time.

Because of his testimony, a lot of things could be harmless error. So it really boxed him in in terms of appellate issues. But I think one grounds that his team can pursue is the idea of the admissibility. Anything and everything that had to do with him stealing from clients and friends.

Crews continue sifting through the wreckage in the city of Larissa,but hopes of finding survivors are fading. Some families are still waiting for news of their loved ones as authorities try to identify victims at a local hospital. And the anger continues to build, as well. Peaceful protests were held in Thessaloniki, where the passengers' ill-fated journey was meant to end, as well as in Athens, where the journey began. The Greek Federation of Rail Workers announced a 24-hour strike, saying government disrespect for their industry is what caused the crash. The federation says requests for more staff, better training, modern security systems, were thrown in the bin. Earlier this week, the prime minister blamed the disaster on tragic human error. And the Larissa station manager was arrested. An audio recording of him speaking to one of the train drivers was released on Thursday. And CNN's Nada Bashir has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Mangled metal, charred debris, the remnants of a disaster that could have been avoided. And now, this.

Now in the past, what we've heard from many experts is this unofficial trade that used to happen across the border between China and South Korea, smuggling in goods that were then sold at unofficial markets, which is where many North Koreans would be able to afford to shop. That simply doesn't exist anymore, because the borders are so tightly shut.
