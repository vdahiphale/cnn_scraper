Israeli President Isaac Herzog meeting with Qatar's Emir here in Dubai earlier emphasizing the, quote, \"humanitarian duty to release Israeli hostages.\" Qatar of course has played a key role in the negotiations about exchanging hostages for Palestinian detainees. Well, the leader of the UAE, Mohamed bin Zayed, also present for these discussions. And America's top diplomat, Secretary of State Antony Blinken landed in Dubai today, fresh off his trip to Israel and the occupied West Bank. He's affirming Washington's commitment to mitigating the climate crisis. And King Abdullah of Jordan, the country's population is 50 percent Palestinian or of Palestinian descent, making a compelling statement earlier today emphasizing the interconnectedness of climate change and humanitarian challenges.

Well, negotiators are scrambling to try to restore the pause in fighting and allow more hostages and Palestinian prisoners to be released. That is according to Qatar, which has been mediating the talks. In the last hour I spoke with the director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross. And I started by asking him what he knew about these negotiations.

It was difficult to get an exact location. But we haven't seen interceptions in this area since before the truce. Probably not in a couple of weeks at this point. And certainly not in the volumes we have just seen. As we stood here over my left shoulder here, we saw Iron Dome Interceptor after Iron Dome interceptor launching one after another, and then of course, a few seconds later the actual interception of the missiles and then the explosions you hear as it takes down a rocket. That is simply a grave reminder of the resumption in fighting we have seen since 7:00 this morning. None of the rockets this long range of course. Most of the rockets targeted the Gaza periphery until this point. But we are now in a resumption of fighting and both Israel and Hamas have promised they're ready if the fighting starts again, which very much has. Israel has carried out punishing strikes across Gaza, including in Khan Younis and southern Gaza which is where they told Palestinians in northern Gaza to evacuate to during the weeks of this war. They also carried out strikes in Rafah against what they say was terrorist infrastructure in the area. They did or rather I should day Secretary of State Antony Blinken did demand of Israel concrete steps to avoid civilian casualties if and when the war resumes again. Israel did drop leaflets that had a QR code on them that if you clicked on it would lead to a picture of Gaza broken down in a very tiny parcel. So it seems to be an attempt by the IDF to be able to say we are targeting these parcels, get out, evacuate along established evacuation routes for your own safety. Of course it requires internet connectivity to be able to look at these maps to know where to go. And that, in and of itself, has been a question multiple times over the past several weeks here. So we'll have to see if this is effective at all in reducing the number of civilian casualties which has been a grave concern of course of the international community but also of the United States. Meanwhile, the U.S. also calling on continued humanitarian aid going into Gaza. But according to an eyewitness we have on the ground in Rafah, there are trucks there that have been inspected by the IDF but have not yet been gone in. So we'll see if that situation changes, as the fighting has very much picked up, resumed both in its intensity and its scope and scale.",

We have also been very clear about the imperative of doing that in a way that puts a premium on protecting civilians, and making sure that humanitarian assistance gets to those who need it. So that's what we're focused on and we're doing both at the same time. At the same time, in the conversations that we had today, it is important for us to be talking about and thinking about every aspect of this challenge, not only today but also what happens the day after the conflict in Gaza is over. How are we thinking about what happens in Gaza, how is it governed, where does the security come from, how do we begin to rebuild, and critically, how we get on a path to a just and lasting peace.
