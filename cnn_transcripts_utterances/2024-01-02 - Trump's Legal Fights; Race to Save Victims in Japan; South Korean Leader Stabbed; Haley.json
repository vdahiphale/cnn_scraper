But again, every -- the large expectation here is that the U.S. Supreme Court will ultimately have to be the one with the final say to determine, can states take Donald Trump off the ballot under the 14th Amendment, this insurrection ban, this Section 3 that's been cited by both of these cases.",

However, the problem is, the way this is being interpreted and applied across the states has varied tremendously. Let's take a quick look at the landscape here.

The Colorado case will be appealed. The next step is the U.S. Supreme Court. The Maine case still hasn't gone through the Maine court system. That decision was by the state secretary of state. So, when Trump's team appeals this, they'll be appealing into the Maine court system.

Again, always worth noting, we don't know a lot of these answers, but let me try to break down the main questions into three categories.First, who decides -- who decides whether there's been insurrection and who gets the power to do that? Now, the Constitution, the 14 Amendment, tells us Congress, U.S. Congress, shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this act. Donald Trump's team is going to say, that means Congress has to tell us how it works. And if they haven't done it, then everyone's out of luck. A challenger, however, will say, but the states can also do it. Which leads us to the second question. If the states have the power, what process do they have to follow? How much due process does Donald Trump get? Now, you don't have to give anyone the full criminal level of due process, criminal trial, but Colorado gave him about a five-day mini trial with some live witnesses and some documents that would be admitted in court and some that probably wouldn't. Maine gave less due process. That was about a one-day hearing with no live first-hand fact witnesses. But Trump's going to argue, I wasn't given enough. And the states will say, no, this is adequate for this purpose. And the third question, this is really lawyerly and technical, but does the president count as an, quote, officer of the United States? Of course, I think a normal person would go, how could it not?",

So, the Japanese self-defense forces are just outside this building handing out water to locals.Now, we know that in Ishikawa prefecture, which is very close to the epicenter, and which is where we are now, at least 48 people have died. The Japanese prime minister has also said that 120 people are still stuck underneath their homes. Now, the prime minister has said that they have dispatched as many forces as possible to get to these survivors, to help them out from under their homes, but it's been a very difficult. A, because we're on a peninsula. There are only so many ways to get here. But also, B, but the main road leading into the peninsula has collapsed because of that very powerful earthquake. Now, people here in the shelter have told us that they're still feeling a lot of aftershocks from that initial, very powerful earthquake.

And he was giving comments to reporters on camera. And at that point, an individual, police say a man in his 60s, stepped forward and asked for his autograph. He then lunged at him, attacked him with the knife and caused that damage to his neck. Lee Jae-myung then fell backwards, collapsed before the individual was wrestled to the ground and arrested. Now, at this point, police say that they don't have a motive. They don't know exactly why he did this. But he is in custody and the investigation is ongoing. Now, it was a braise attack. It was really in the middle of the day, in broad daylight. And coming just a few months before local elections here.

And that is because these candidates exit 2023 having failed to solidify themselves as the alternative to Donald Trump. And so now they are focused on pushing out each other and making themselves -- making this a two-person race going into the caucuses in New Hampshire and all these early nominating states.For DeSantis the focus has been on Iowa. His campaign has put a lot of time, effort and energy into this state. Anything less than a close second place finish will be very difficult for him to continue this campaign and make a case for himself going into these other nominating contests. For Haley, however, she is more focused on New Hampshire. That is where she is today and will be spending the next couple days going into our town hall on Thursday.
