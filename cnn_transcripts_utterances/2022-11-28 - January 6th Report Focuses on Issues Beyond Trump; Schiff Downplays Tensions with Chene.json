You may remember that earlier this year the committee took an extraordinary step of sending subpoenas to the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and four other Republicans after they refused to cooperate voluntarily. Now, investigators never got to talk to them. But the committee did include some evidence about those lawmakers in the public hearings.Now, these unprecedented moves will likely reverberate as Republicans take over the House shortly. And asked whether he would comply with a GOP subpoena in the new Congress, Schiff said he will have to consider the validity of that subpoena. Validity doing a lot of work in that sentence. Don.",

This is what Schiff told our colleague Dana Bash yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA): I would like to see our report be as broad and inclusive as possible. We are discussing, as a committee, among the members what belongs in the body of the report, what belongs in the appendices of the report, what is beyond the scope of our investigation And we'll reach those decisions, you know, in a collaborative manner. I think her role on the committee has been indispensable. I have tremendous respect for her and for Adam Kinzinger. They've shown a lot of courage and backbone.

But it's about whether Democrats are concerned that a January 6th report will be too focused on Donald Trump. I mean that just kind of gives you a sense of where this committee is, particularly when it comes to the two -- the only two Republicans on the committee, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger.And - and what it says is that this is not something we've seen from this committee. Usually when there are committees investigating, or even frankly commissions, they are done in an evenly balanced bipartisan way, or at least close to it. That's not the case for various reasons, the most important reason is that Kevin McCarthy didn't want to put more Republicans on this - on this -- actually any Republicans on this committee. But because of that, what we have seen throughout the public hearings and even beforehand in the investigation is a pretty united front. Now that they're getting towards the end and they want the report to be sort of reflective and fulsome, at least a lot of committee staffers, that's why you're seeing the tensions play out.

You asked Governor Hutchinson about it. This is what he said. Let's play it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ASA HUTCHINSON (R-AR): But, no, I don't think it's a good idea for a leader that's setting an example for the country or the party to meet with an avowed racist or anti-Semite.

And the fact that this is unique - I mean we saw -- you heard Asa Hutchinson, he was very strong yesterday. Chris Christie, another potential 2024 contender and a couple of others. The governor of the state of Florida, who is probably the most talked about for president in 2024, he's not said anything. Florida is where Mar-a-Lago is. And so the sound of silence, it largely is deafening, which was why it was remarkable and it shouldn't have been remarkable to hear Asa Hutchinson lean into the fact that this was absolutely wrong, absolutely wrong and kind of noting the fact that it's unfortunate that it has to be commented on, but yet he wanted to comment on it because it is important to tamp down on meeting with anybody and empowering people who are so vehemently full of hate, anti-Semitic, and also full of conspiracy theories in the fact that they were meeting with a former president and a contender for the next time is -- it's pretty unfortunate.

      "sentences": "I do think it's partially about being lonely. So, you know, if essentially we look at the data, what do we see at this particular point? So, let's take a look at one- person households. This is a newly released Census Bureau report and it finds that 29 percent of households are now one-person households in 2022. Look how much higher that is from 1960 when it was just 13 percent.Now, the question is, are there any bad side effects from that potentially? And I think that we can get an idea from this. You know, you mentioned, Poppy, loneliness. Always or often lonely in the last year. I've broken this down by age and by whether you live alone or with somebody. Because it turns out that both of these factors play a role in loneliness. When you live alone and you're younger, under the age of 50, look at this, 39 percent of those had a feeling of feeling lonely, either always or often last year. Compare that to living with somebody, it was just 25 percent. Now, look at age 50 and older. If you live alone, 21 percent of those folks either always or often felt lonely. Living with someone, it was 11 percent. So, look, living alone doesn't necessarily mean you're more lonely, it just exacerbates the risk. If you live alone, you're more likely to feel lonely. Now, here's another key factor, you know, as we're talking about age and we're obviously an aging society, with gen-xers and boomers aging up into senior citizenship. What do we find? Older Americans by their living pattern. When they live alone, they're less likely to feel financially comfortable. When they live alone, they're less likely to do community work. When they live alone, they're less likely to talk with grandkids weekly. So, as we're an aging society and more and more of us are living alone, these risks, they tend to go up when you do, in fact, live alone.",

But how many close friends do you have, not including relatives? In 2021, zero, 12 percent. That's way up from 3 percent in 1990. Five or more, look at this, now it's just 38 percent in 2021. Look at 1990, it was 63 percent. So, we're not only living alone in larger numbers, in fact, we have fewer friends, perhaps because we're all looking down at our phones more often instead of actually, you know, talking with people.",

What do their brains look like? Can we measure their biological age from different perspectives in addition to already knowing their chronologic age. And, in general, we see that the superagers tend to be more youthful. They look younger. Their brains look a little bit more like 50 to 60-year-olds than they do like their 80-plus-year-old peers.",
