      "sentences": "All right, just before 5We're just a few hours from Donald Trump's hush money trial resuming in Lower Manhattan. The day will begin with former Trump aide Madeleine Westerhout back on the stand. She testified Thursday about working at the White House detailing the checks that she'd received from the Trump Organization for the president to sign around the time that Michael Cohen was getting his hush money reimbursements. But the main event yesterday, of course, was in the morning when Stormy Daniels finished her testimony. Trump's lawyers went on the attack trying to accuse the adult film star of making up the story of having sex with Trump. Defense attorney Susan Necheles saying, \"So, you have a lot of experience in making phony stories about sex appear to be real, right?\" She's talking about, of course, her pornographic movies. Daniels pushed back. \"The sex in the films, it is very much real. Just like what happened to me in that room.\" Daniels followed a similar line of questioning with this response. \"If that story was untrue, I would have written it to be a lot better.\" Later adding, \"I am a good screenwriter.\" After Daniels was off the stand, Trump's lawyers asked Judge Juan Merchan to declare a mistrial and modify the gag order against Trump. The judge rejected both requests. Joining me now to discuss, former U.S. attorney, Michael Moore. Michael, good morning. MICHAEL MOORE, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY, PARTNER, MOORE HALL:  Good morning. Glad to be with you.",

But we've covered president -- we've covered Donald Trump for many, many, many years and one of the things we've written about a lot at Axios and many other people have written about is does he listen to his advisers? Does he do what his advisers think are a good idea? Does he think he's the right person to figure all of this kind of stuff? That, I'm sure, Donald Trump is thinking right here looking at those tweets. I mean, like, I want to get on the stand and defend myself. I don't know if his lawyer is looking forward to that.",

Thank you for being here.What do you make of this apparent discrepancy that Johnson is talking about? He is claiming that he's hearing something about policy that's different from what the president said in the interview on CNN. MARIANA ALFARO, NATIONAL POLITICS BREAKING NEWS REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST (via Webex by Cisco):  Um-hum. I think everything moved really fast and it kind of just took Republicans by surprise if it happens. (INAUDIBLE) Johnson in this interview where he said this was kind of a -- you know, it was political, right, after he survived that attempt by Marjorie Taylor Greene to be removed from office. So he was kind of in very buoyant spirits. But this is not new for Republicans who kind of tackle Biden's policies, especially when it shifts so quickly over his age. But I think the part specifically here that drew my attention is that it's not like the Biden administration didn't have warning signs. Lloyd Austin, the Defense secretary, did say that -- in a Senate panel that the bomb shipment was being withheld because Israel hadn't produced a plan to protect Palestinians in Rafah. So I think that there's been a little bit of not being able to keep track of everything that's going on. But it's not super shocking that Johnson would say that. It's more shocking that they're not in kind of an unseen place when it comes to this policy right now.",
