Tennis star, Novak Djokovic was hit in the head with a water bottle after his winning match in Italy on Friday.According to the event organizers, the Serbian player was signing autographs as you're about to see when a water bottle, now we know, apparently fell out of spectator's backpack. Officials say his condition is no cause for concern. But Djokovic, well, he's got a sense of humor. He jokes that he has now prepare. See him there, wearing a biking helmet as he showed up for the Italian open today to the cheering crowds, who were all like right in front of him as opposed to being overhead. The world number one player is scheduled for his next match on Sunday against Chile's Alejandro Tabilo. Good luck. All right. Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. All right. We're monitoring several new developments in the war in Gaza. Israel's military is ordering immediate evacuations in parts of eastern Rafah in Gaza south. The IDF says about 300,000 people have already fled. The evacuations happening following deadly overnight airstrikes in northern and central Gaza. Hospitals in the area say the strikes killed at least 47 people, while another 15 were killed in separate strikes in Rafah earlier today. The IDF seemingly intensifying operations despite this warning from President Biden earlier in the week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I made it clear that if they go into Rafah -- they haven't gotten on Rafah yet. If they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the city, to deal with that problem. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So the U.S. announced another $400 million in military aid for Ukraine just yesterday.

And it's been expected for a long time that Russia was going to launch a major, major offensive sometime in the late spring, early summer, which is basically very soon. But the approval of this new aid is giving new urgency to the Russian advances. And Russia has been making progress. You know, we had the six-month period where Republicans in the U.S. Congress were blocking the aid package that the Biden administration was -- was trying to implement. And only one in April -- it was initially proposed in October, and only in April, just a couple of weeks ago, it was approved. During that time, the disadvantage that the disparity in military supplies between Russia and Ukraine became really, really dramatic. And in some cases, Ukrainian soldiers were saying that they were -- they had a 20-to-1 disadvantage in shells and ammunition supplies. So Russia really, really took advantage of that time. And now that window is actually closing. So it's a critical time for Russia and for Ukraine.",

GHITISus and what Ukrainian military personnel say is that, this year, this entire 2024 is going to have Ukraine on the defensive, that the most they can hope for is to hold the line. This is not a year when they -- they think they will make -- they will be able to retake much territory. And, you know, when we think about this war, this war has really confounded the experts. Remember that when it started, the top military experts said that Russia was going to win in a matter of a few days and that did not happen. Then, suddenly, you crank, turn the tables, and it was pushing the Russians out. As recently as last summer, Russia was in so much trouble that Putin was facing a potential coup, as you remember. So things change very fast. But the Ukrainians have had the -- the emotional intensity. I mean, Ukraine is defending its sovereignty. It's defending its land. The Russians are playing in this geopolitical game that President Putin came up with. But it's not their land. So they have less of an incentive to fight than the Ukrainian do. But the Russians do have a huge advantage in manpower. The Ukrainians have very short of manpower right now. Russia has a huge advantage in industrial capacity. They have stepped up their production of weaponry. They're also getting -- getting weapons from Iran, that's giving them all these deadly, deadly drones that have become such a big part of this war. North Korea is helping Russia. So there's a huge imbalance. And this six-month period, when the United States, which is the pipeline of military supplies, when that pipeline was stopped up, it was -- it was really devastating for Ukraine. And you know, I have a feeling that part of their manpower problems had to do with that demoralizing effect of falling so far behind in ammunition that must have been really so difficult for Ukrainian soldiers to fight. So some things are going to change. Sometime this summer, Ukraine is going to start receiving, in addition to this aid from the United States, they're going to start receiving F-16 fighter jets from European countries. They're going to be a lot of really important technical pieces, not armaments pieces in this war. It's going to be -- the coming months are going to be really, really crucial. And the whole outcome of the war is not going to be seen for a while. [13:35:10] And one more important point. We have elections in the United States. And former President Donald Trump has made it very clear that his approach to this war is going to be very different from Joe Biden. So this is something that obviously President Putin knows. And so he's going to try to have a strong a hand as he can ahead of the November elections, hoping that there will be a new president in Washington and that the diplomatic and political reality will change in Russia's favor.",
