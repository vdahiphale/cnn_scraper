Let's get straight to CNN's Jeremy Diamond. He is joining us from Sderot in Israel, not far from the Gaza border.Jeremy, we just learned from the Israel National Security Council that no hostages will be released before Friday. What else are you learning? CNN's Jeremy Diamond: Yes. That's right, Wolf. Israel's national security adviser saying that the release of the hostages, which was expected to take place tomorrow, will now be delayed until Friday. He says in a statement that that is the original agreement between both sides and not providing a reason for the delay. I mean, just hours ago we've been speaking with Israeli officials who were indicating you were -- who were telling us the logistics effectively of exactly when and how these hostage releases were expected to take place. But now, Wolf, I'm also now told by an Israeli official that not only will the release of the hostages be delayed until Friday but that pause in fighting, that truce that was expected to take place over the course of four days to allow for the release of those hostages. That will also be delayed until Friday, which means that the fighting that we have been hearing all throughout the day here with the Gaza Strip right behind me will likely continue tomorrow as well. That Truce had been expected to take -- to go into effect in the next -- in about 10 hours from now, Wolf. And that will also now be delayed until Friday. This is obviously a significant change. It's not clear exactly what motivated this change at this point. But what is clear, Wolf, is that this simply adds to the emotional roller coaster and the anxiety that so many of these families have these nearly 240 hostages have been dealing with for weeks now as they have been watching reports of these negotiations. They have watched as these talks have broken down. And now, yesterday, they saw in the early hours of this morning, actually they saw as this deal was approved by the Israeli government only for now to see yet another delay. And so, obviously that just adds a whole new layer for those families who are just waiting. Wolf?",

They haven't told me how many people are on the list but it's understood to be between 10 and 12 people. And they're not going to be telling the family members about the names on that list because they've actually got them identified.

So that does very important information she's putting out there as that was a lot of the questions that were out there at the time. We also know, Wolf, that one of the crossings that was immediately shut down in the aftermath of this explosion, it is now open to traffic both ways between the US and Canada. So, we're starting to see some of the security precautions that were taken immediately afterwards, somewhat being lifted.But let me get through exactly what we understand happened as of now. What we are hearing is that there was a car that was actually traveling on a local road in Niagara Falls at a high rate of speed. It hit a curb causing this vehicle to actually go airborne and then collide on the side of where a security checkpoint was happening at Rainbow Bridge. So it wasn't even trying to enter the checkpoint at that Rainbow Bridge site. So that is what we are learning right now, the very latest of from the investigators that are still working this investigation there on the ground. We've also learned that there were, according to the governor, two people inside the car. I will tell you that some of our sources are still trying to determine exactly if there was one or if there was two only because of the debris field in that area. You can see the fiery explosion. We understand that there was only an engine left of this car. There is debris all around that area. And investigators are sort of trying to piece together exactly what happened based on the size of what they're dealing with and, of course, because of that explosion. So that is the latest that we are hearing. The big thing, though, Wolf, this does not seem to be a terrorist attack. It does seem to be somewhat of an accident. Still, the FBI there on the ground, the ATF, other federal agents trying to answer some of these questions, and there are still precaution safety measures that have been taken in response. We're seeing the airports, flights that have been sort of put at a ground halt right now while they try to answer some of these questions. And we're seeing more security measures being taken at the airports because of the busy holiday today, travel season. So we're starting to see some of that being lifted but not quite yet. But again, we're getting more answers as we had so many questions as to exactly what happened there at the border crossing.",

They'd be able to prove that maybe they have no background on any of these people or whatever.So they, honestly, will they probably already have a narrative of what in fact happened, and whether there was any motive involved with the speed by which this car was going. Was there other nefarious activities we were talking about earlier. Obviously, look, it's a holiday weekend, the threat environment is high. It's a major crossing between Canada and the United States. And it appear that someone was trying to go through it very quickly. So, of course, you're going to ratchet up and now we ratchet down and that's the nature of, of what a response mechanism looks like. And so, you can say it's not terrorism.",

What it tells me is, these are not people or this was not a situation that wanted or was targeting the crossing.And I want to just pick up on what Donell said, which I thought was really important, which is it's not simply that these are heavily, you know, cameraed areas, this is the lifeline of Canada and US crossings. And for a brief while we closed four major crossings because we didn't know what it was. So one of the reasons, Wolf, to your question, how would they know so fastest they had to know fast. Because you got to get these crossings back open. You can't leave them close, especially this weekend. And so, there was a high incentive to say, OK, this was not -- this was a bad situation but we got it. We got to get people moving again. And that's an important priority.

And these cases can take some time to confirm the identity of the individuals.Why they were traveling at such high rates of speed, how they were able to get that close actually, is another question. I think the bigger takeaway, though, if you kind of kind of pan out, Wolf, and look at what we've been talking about for the last couple of weeks, and Juliette alluded to this, is the threat environment. The threat environment has everyone pretty edgy. I would say that the American public should look at this incident at the bridge and see that their government, local, state and federal, at all levels, are really taking that threat environment seriously. Director Wray came on the Hill several times this month, as well as Secretary Mayorkas and said that the federal government was doing everything they could to protect us and to engage the public to do so. And I think you see that playing out right now. I know everyone's a little jumpity, it's a holiday season, but I think the process only played out as it should have from an investigative standpoint and we'll continue to see information that comes out but also with rapid speed unlike anything I've ever seen before.",

But he said his work is not done. Qatar as a state has been very vocal about the fact that he wants to see a ceasefire, a permanent ceasefire, and that is not what we have here. But this humanitarian pause is a first step and will be a huge relief to many of those families of hostages, who may get the chance to see their loved ones over the next four days. And provide an opportunity for those who are unlikely to see the soldiers, the men coming out anytime soon. It provides them at least some sense that there is still a system in place that is working towards a solution. Wolf?",
