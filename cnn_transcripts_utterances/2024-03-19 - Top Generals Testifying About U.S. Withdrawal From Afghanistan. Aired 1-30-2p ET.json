And you did it's selflessly with professionalism, courage, compassion and with great sacrifice. And finally, to the Gold Star families that are here with us today and those that could make it, there's nothing that I can say or do that's going to fill that gaping hole in your heart. But as I've told you before, I'm committed and I will honor that commitment to get you the answers, to get you to the truth.

Yet, that warning was ignored. He never heard back. I and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, after that testimony, sent a letter to the Department of Defense requesting that these documents and sniper photos be delivered to the Congress, produced to the Congress by this document, this letter request. To date, that has been ignored. The Department of Defense has refused. We've also requested the testimonies of General Chris Donahue and Admiral Peter Vasely, who were the commanding officers on the ground during the Abbey Gate disaster. To both of you, to General Milley, do you think that these documents should be turned over to the United States Congress?

You know, should we have gone after bin Laden in 2001 in the winter when we had -- we had him, more or less from an intel standpoint, we thought we him located. Should we? Could we have? Yes. Should we have? I think yes. In hindsight, that would change the trajectory of the whole war. And there's a whole series of lessons along the way. Specific to this hearing and to help these families, I think the focus is more recent, relative to the withdrawal itself and the Abbey Gate and the NEO. But you're correct.
