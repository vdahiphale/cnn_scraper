Kara, you've been there all day with this back and forth. First, talk to us about the demeanor of Hunter Biden when he walked in versus when all of this was happening and then when he walked out of court.

You know, and then they'll have to present this to the judge. And then, you know, she will probably have them -- both sides come back in for another hearing on this if she has other questions or could move to then a guilty plea if she is satisfied by this agreement.

The Fed's saying the U.S. economy is growing at a moderate pace, the job market is robust, but inflation is still too high. The Fed would like to get inflation -- consumer inflation to about two percent. It's sitting at three percent right now. So the Fed doing more work here. This is, again, something that will affect how much interest you're getting in your bank account for savers out there, but also will definitely make it more expensive to borrow money here.

Mitch McConnell, this is every week they -- he gives a weekly press conference. Talks to reporters about the issues of the day. And he began his remarks -- his opening remarks talking about the legislative business that is happening in the United States Senate. Then he abruptly froze causing some questions, some alarm among some of his colleagues, and the suggestion that perhaps they should end the press conference hastily. And he later went back to his office for some time, then returned to answer some questions. Ultimately said he was fine. But this is the moment in which he froze in the middle of his opening remarks.

Earlier this year, he suffered a fall, hit his head while at an event in a Washington hotel. He was later hospitalized for some time. He was diagnosed with a concussion as well as some broken ribs. He's had some walking issues for much of his life, given that he had polio as a child that he later recovered from. And then has -- had some incidents as of in recent years of tripping and falling, including earlier this year, in that one incident. So, I asked the leader whether or not this was related to the concussion that he suffered over this year. He said, no. I am fine. He did not elaborate at all. But he did continue the press conference, did answer some questions, including about impeachment that talks about potentially impeaching Joe Biden in the U.S. House as well as the plea deal with Hunter Biden that collapsed, as well as some other discussions -- questions about the appropriations process and spending legislation that's happening.
