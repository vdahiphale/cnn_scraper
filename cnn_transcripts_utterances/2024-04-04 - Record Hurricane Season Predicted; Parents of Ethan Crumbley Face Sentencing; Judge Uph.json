A judge has upheld the criminal indictment against former President Donald Trump in Georgia,the judge there rejecting the argument that Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election were protected under the First Amendment. CNN's Zachary Cohen is part of the team that broke this story. Zach, walk us through this decision by Judge Scott McAfee.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, you will remember that we heard and we watched a hearing in Fulton County, Georgia, just about a week ago.And Trump's lawyers argued strenuously that this entire case should be thrown out, because, in his argument, that the political speech and that the claims about voter fraud that Trump was pushing after the 2020 election are protected by the First Amendment. Now, the judge today roundly rejecting that argument, as we have seen him do multiple other times in this case for other defendants in Georgia, saying, look -- quote -- \"The defense has not presented, nor is the court able to find any authority that the speech and conduct alleged is protected political speech.\" He goes on to say that this argument is one that should be heard by a jury, not one that should be decided during pretrial motions. That was the argument that prosecutors in Georgia made about a week ago in court before Judge McAfee. So, this is just an example of this case in Georgia inching towards a potential trial. We know that the DA there has asked for a trial to start on August 5. But Judge McAfee has not put a start date on the calendar yet. That really is the big thing we're looking for, but, again, the judge continuing to work through these pretrial motions in Georgia, continuing to work toward and address these issues that have to be addressed before a trial can take place. SANCHEZ:  And, Zach, Judge McAfee is not the first judge to make a ruling like this related to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election being related to the First Amendment. Judge Tanya Chutkan also rejected that argument from Trump's attorneys in the federal case against him for election subversion. I'm wondering, have you heard anything from Trump's Georgia attorneys about this decision, how they plan to proceed?",

I'm sure we will hear from him eventually, because he did push and he was the main person, the main defense attorney arguing this in court when we saw this hearing take place just about a week ago.And, look, Steve Sadow has filed several similar motions to try to get this case thrown out before a trial even happens. Obviously, Trump is fighting multiple front -- legal fronts. As you mentioned, he tried the same argument in his federal case with Judge Tanya Chutkan, who similarly rejected the First Amendment arguments. And when we saw the hearing take place in Georgia, prosecutors referenced Chutkan's ruling on this First Amendment issue too. And like I mentioned earlier, this is a similar argument that some of Trump's co-defendants in Georgia have also tried to make and was also rejected by Scott McAfee. So we're going to have to see. There's other attempts and unaddressed attempts and motions on the table still to try to get this case dismissed. But, for now, the case and the indictment against Trump in Georgia remains intact.",

The Israeli military, for its part, said that these systems are merely tools for analysts to use, that it is used in conjunction with human personnel, who verify the information that this A.I. system is giving. But one source told \"+972\" that military personnel effectively served as a rubber stamp and that this system actually had a 10 percent error rate, so very significant and very troubling information revealed by this magazine.",

      "sentences": "I mean, one call is not going to make or break this relationship between the two countries.And I think, Boris, the overall point, six months into this war, almost six months into this war, is that the administration has been pursuing what I call a passive-aggressive policy toward the Israelis, tremendous anger, tremendous frustration, tremendous desire to change Israeli practices on the ground and minimize the exponential rise of Palestinian deaths and the humanitarian catastrophe, but unwilling, it seems to me, still to impose a single cost or consequence that you and I would consider significant on Israel. And I think the reasons are clear. The president, alone among his predecessors, has this unique emotional bond with the people of Israel, the security of Israel, the idea of Israel, obviously not so much with the most extreme right-wing government in the history of the state. And, second, if Biden wants to change the pictures in Gaza, de- escalate free hostages, surge humanitarian assistance, avoid a disaster in Rafah, I think he really has no choice. And I think this is the way they're reasoning it out, but to cooperate not just with Netanyahu, but to read the mood of the Israeli public and also Benny Gantz, Boris, who sits in that war cabinet, endorsing the Rafah operation. So it can't be Netanyahu against Biden. It would be -- it ended up, would be Biden against most of -- most of the Israeli public, and I don't think the administration wants to put itself in that position.",

One, as you pointed out, condition, restrict or end munitions deliveries to Israel. Not going to do that, seems to me. Number two, introduce their own U.N. Security Council resolution or abstain or vote for someone else's that is highly critical of Israel. Seems to me not going to do that. And then the third issue is, forget the Israeli-Hamas negotiations and join the international community in calling for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and we will deal with hostages later. And, frankly, Israel's not at war with Switzerland. I think the president understands that. Israel's fighting a vicious terror organization which holds and abuses hostages. I don't think that president's going to do that. So I think Biden's in a box, Boris. That's the real problem here. He's in an investment trap.

He referred to the -- quote -- \"black hole of loss\" -- unquote. And he may even conflate it with the own -- with the personal tragedies in his own life, genuine emotional man. The way it's conveyed, however, I think, is different. And I have gotten a lot of pushback for that comment, but I think it's true. It's not that Joe Biden doesn't care about the deaths of Palestinian innocents and the exponential rise of casualties, deaths, humanitarian catastrophe that exists in Gaza. It just seems to me that, when he conveys it, he does not convey it with the same power of emotion and feeling and resonance. And I think that's something that could easily be corrected, because it's genuine. This is a caring, feeling human.",

The point about electoral consequences, \"The Wall Street Journal\" had a poll recently that showed that those asked prefer former President Donald Trump to Joe Biden on a theoretical handling of the war in Gaza by 14 percentage points.

There's freedom for hostages in large part because of U.S. intercession. There was the intercession in the second or third day of the war to prevent a preemptive Israeli strike against Hezbollah, which could have morphed into a regional war. I think, with Donald Trump, you're going to get a hands-off, \"What's in it for me?\" policy. And I think that would be a fundamental disaster. And those uncommitted who somehow believe that not voting for Joe Biden because of their anger, understandable, in the wake of Palestinian deaths, are courting catastrophe, it seems to me, not just in the Middle East, but for this republic of ours, by not turning out. I have voted Republicans and Democrats. I have worked for Republicans and Democrats. It's a matter of the national interest at this point, Boris.
