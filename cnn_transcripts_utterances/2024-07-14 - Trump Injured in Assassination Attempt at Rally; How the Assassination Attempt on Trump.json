I'm Fareed Zakaria coming to you live from New York.Today's show, of course, is on the assassination attempt on former president Donald Trump. We will bring you the latest from the investigation, we'll talk about the political implications of the shooting, and we will dig into the sad history of political violence in America. For now, let's get started with the key facts about what happened. Shortly after 6:00 p.m. last evening at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump had been on the podium just a few moments when loud bangs were heard coming from his right. The former president ducked behind the lectern, was swarmed by Secret Service, and when he reappeared was bleeding from his ear. The shooter was believed to have been stationed on a roof outside the rally security perimeter. He was shot dead by the Secret Service. The assailant was 20 years old. What we know of his politics are these facts. He was a registered Republican who had made a $15 donation to a Democratic political action committee. There are many aspects about this that I want to talk about with today's panel. With me here at the set are Tim Naftali and Ian Bremmer. Tim is a CNN presidential historian and the former director of the Nixon Presidential Library. Ian is the president of the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. Joining us from Sun Valley, Idaho, this morning is the \"New Yorker's\" Evan Osnos, who has written a book on Joe Biden. Tim, let me ask you, when you first saw this, given all the history that you know, what was your thought?",

Adversaries or enemies. People who didn't share your views were vermin. The outcome of the election would be the end of democracy. These are apocalyptic terms and in a social media drenched environment there are so many tortured souls who are willing and prepared to act on this kind of language.

This one is unusual.This set against everything that Tim just said. All of the political polarization, all of the violence in imagery and language that has been -- that has made, created more extremism. When you feel like your enemy is a domestic enemy who is trying to destroy your system and the values you have. We also have by far more guns in this country than in any other advanced industrial democracy. We have an enormous mental illness problem. So you put those things together. I mean, if anything, you're surprised that you've had so little political violence actually in the United States thus far. But this is a really big deal. It would have been vastly worse. I mean, we were this close to the president being assassinated, and I shudder to think about the violence that we'd be seeing in the country if that would have occurred.

And there has been ever since this seesawing fight. And it's been at times we talk about the paranoid style, what Richard Hofstadter talked about in American history.

I'll leave it to sociologists to explain why.Because we identify our hopes and dreams with individuals because of the importance of the presidency those who would want a dash our hopes, those who would want to change history, focus on a man, and they point that anger and hatred towards that man, and then they use guns to do the most undemocratic of things, which is to deny a choice to the people. And we've seen this over and over again in our history. And it happens in those moments of political ferment when our world, whatever that world was, seems to be coming to an end. In the '60s it was because of Vietnam. It was because thankfully we had this civil rights revolution that was going to break apart the apartheid system in the south but for some that produce an apocalyptic vision. It's these moments of great, huge social change by which Richard Hofstadter wrote, that we see some search for a way out and they opt for violence to take that way out.",

We are not always mortal, political combatants here.I think that in some ways as Tim rightly put it, the focus of what has been the last three weeks on Biden now shifts to Donald Trump, not only because of the events of last night, but also because of the convention and it really will be a moment of showcasing a conception of leadership, a conception of what it means to be a presidential candidate for all Americans. I think for Biden right now, this is a moment when he can put to the test, frankly, his capacity to talk to Americans in a language of decency, of civility, of calm. It will shift the focus away for the moment from this question of age and acuity. And I think that he went into this presidential period in 2020 because of political violence, the threat that he saw showcased in Charlottesville, Virginia.

It's everything about, every sinew of this man is he is going to fight against his enemies. And yes, his enemy is the dead man, the 20-year-old, the tried to assassinate him.

So there wasn't really any high ground and that is obviously something that they're going to have to rethink. On the other hand, there were four countersniper teams working this event as far as I understand it from my sources. Two from the county sheriff's department, two from the Secret Service. That is an uncommon level of security for someone who is not currently the president, but I think the Secret Service assessment here has been that this is a high threat political environment and a high threat candidate.",

We don't know what was coming through this earpiece. We fill find that out later.We don't know what he saw through that scope from the top of that red barn but what it appears happened is that this individual had been observed. This is Tom Crooks, the now deceased alleged shooter, had been observed acting suspiciously by the magnetometers outside the event by local law enforcement. And they had put that over the air to their partners and that information had been made its way onto the Secret Service frequencies and people had this description and were looking around for him. He left the magnetometer area and then at some point people start to point out, there's a guy who is climbing down that roof and he has a rifle. And police are putting that over the radio. Our timeline is uncertain there, but that countersniper appears to be looking through his scope as if he's scanning for something. He comes back from the scope to look up as if he's like looking at what did I just see? And then when the shots are fired takes out the shooter from his position almost immediately. So, we have to fill in those gaps. What happened during those seconds? What were the communications? What did he see through the scope? And did he act at his first opportunity? And we'll learn that later. But the main job of the countersniper team is to scan for that threat. And if the threat emerges or -- especially if shots are fired to eliminate that threat as quickly as possible. That part worked.

Individually, he has such strong charisma with the MAGA faithful that is going to get far stronger on the back of this. And if he is changing his mind or rethinking it all, and Lord knows I don't have any intelligence on that, I would say he's more likely to pick someone who is really aligned with that message. The single person I've seen that has most strongly resonated with that since the assassination attempt would be J.D. Vance.",

And I think that countries around the world now recognize the Trump is the likely next president.Most American allies are deeply discomforted about that, and they are preparing for it. Most American adversaries see great opportunity in that but there's a bigger point. And the bigger point is that the United States no longer has a political system that any country around the world admires. They admire the dollar. They admire the U.S. economy. They admire U.S. innovation and entrepreneurship. No one admirers America's political system. That is a deep concern. A generational concern for leaders around the world that rely on the United States. Where the global order requires a strong and stable U.S. Even the Chinese don't want the Americans falling apart. They need the political system to be stable in the Middle East and Russia, Ukraine, and all of that. This is a very, very worrying time for all the leaders that you and I talk to.",
