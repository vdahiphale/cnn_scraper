The leader of the world's most populous nation and U.S. President Joe Biden will announce a defense partnership, including India's approaches (ph) of American drones. Modi's visit comes with both countries wary over China's growing global influence, along with some questions over President Biden's decision to invite a leader once shunned by the United States, whose critics say increasingly clamps down on human rights at home. CNN's Vedika Sud is in New Delhi for us. Much discussion here about what President Biden wants to get out of the state visit. How is the visit being perceived back home in India?",

      "sentences": "I'm going to break that into two, Julia. First I'll talk about how the Indian media and the people here areperceiving this. And then we will very quickly talk about what this means for India and U.S. relations. For Modi per se, like \"The New York Times\" put it, it is a big diplomatic win for him because this is one man who was denied a visa, you know, more than a decade ago, to enter the U.S., because of his alleged role in (INAUDIBLE) in his home state. The Supreme Court later gave him a clean chit. But today, look at the state visit that he is getting to witness in the U.S., in Washington, D.C. Now let's go to the bigger picture here, which is, what does this mean for India, for the Narendra Modi government and for India-U.S. relations. This clearly means that India is advising as an economic and diplomatic nation. (MUSIC PLAYING) SUD (voice-over):  The powers that it really has and that is something that the U.S. President, of course, he knows. It has been a trade-off of many sorts here. Like you said, back home, internationally, there is criticism. There are alleged human rights violations that Narendra Modi's government has been accused of. Of course, there is democratic backsliding that people talk of, shrinking press freedom. The criticism, of course, also being of some of the controversial laws that could impact more than 200 million Muslims here in India. Biden knows all of that. But the bigger picture for him really is that India is the only counterbalance to China in Asia. That is the reason the trade-off is really happening. He might just give the geopolitical powers reasonings and significance more priority. Then talking about human rights while Modi is there. That's what we're going to see today. We'll wait for the joint statement. Very quickly, another very rare moment that we will see in less than three hours from now. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi taking a question from the media. It's very rare for me, as an Indian journalist, who has seen that in the last nine years while he's been in power. We do know from (INAUDIBLE) team in D.C. that it took lengthy and delicate negotiations to get the Indian side to agree to have the prime minister take a question after the joint statement with the U.S. President. So all eyes will be on that and I think that is potentially one of the headlines that you will see back here in India after the prime minister speaks to whichever channel or media outlet he does.

      "sentences": "Oh, we're going to witnessing the national anthem, too. Just wondering if either gentleman was going to say something. We will pause fora moment just to listen to the national anthem as they stand by. It's actually difficult to hear. Vedika, I want to bring it back in, as you said, this is an important moment as we watch, to go back to your point about the delicacy surrounding the negotiations of that press conference amid and at a time, where the government in India is known to suppress the views and comments and questions from media. (MUSIC PLAYING) CHANCE (voice-over):  How closely will that be watched? SUD (voice-over):  Very closely. It will be watched very closely simply for one reason, that is that we rarely hear from the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, especially back home in India. Like I said, in the last nine years, we have barely heard him speak to the media when there's been a press conference set up. What you can hear in the backdrop right now is the Indian national anthem. That is being -- yes that's what you hear in the background. Coming back to your question now, I think this is a relationship of giving as much as you want to get from India. That is what even Joe Biden sees in terms of India for the simple reason that India is not an ally of the U.S.; it is a partner. And they have made that (INAUDIBLE) over and over again, Julia. And Biden wants them as an ally, not just as a partner. But that is something that India has very strongly denied to do at this point in time. They are very close to Russia, as you know. And the adversary is China in the region. For India, another worry, Julia, is that if they do upset Russia, it would bring Russia and China closer. So they are very (INAUDIBLE) these factors, these geopolitical factors. But they do also realize at this point in time, that the imports and dependence on Russia for weapons is extremely high. And Joe Biden is aware of that. So he has got to take this opportunity today during the bilateral talks with Narendra Modi to try and push that agenda, to say, hey, you know what, we can give you the weapons you're not getting from Russia right now because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We can provide you with the weapons you need and perhaps we try and draw India (INAUDIBLE) to the U.S. at this point in time. So that is going to be one of the top priorities of the U.S. President while he has that bilat with Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, defense being on the agenda. Cooperation in terms of economic talks is on the agenda. Of course the other reasons also for him to be here today, which is cultural ties between the two. Both nations have always and constantly said that they have a deep partnership, which they want to take forward. Space exploration is another. Investments of course. You have seen Modi talk to Musk yesterday and other top CEOs and industrialists. He wants to bring in more investment into India. And he wants core production of goods in India along with the U.S. So he is there with his agenda. Like I said, Biden has his. Biden's eyes clearly are on (INAUDIBLE) really well that China, that the only counterbalance to China in the region is India. And of course, in the last few decades -- rather, the recent years, the only country in Asia that has militarily taken on China is India. And the White House is absolutely aware of that.",

And itmight just achieve that deal today, while Modi and Biden talk. That deal is very significant in India, militarily, because it could help India on the border with China. Ever since the (INAUDIBLE) clash where India lost about 20 soldiers and China four, the tensions have been very high. And the tensions between the U.S. and China have been high as well. So this is a time when they can talk about their common adversary. But the White House has said that this visit is not about China. Yes, it could be related to China's economy and other factors. But this isn't about China. Russia is another issue that will be on the agenda. But like I said, the non-alignment that India has always been very firm about, it could be a challenge for the Biden administration. He will try to draw India closer. But Modi is aware of their ties, the traditional tries, the ties that go back decades with Russia. And that will be something that will be very difficult for Biden to navigate at this point in time. But India does need the weapons, Julia, and it is aware of that. Like I said, the bilateral talk today is going to be high on defense deals, on economy, on tech and on -- (CROSSTALK)",

It is just this week that you had 70 congressional Democrats writing to Joe Biden, asking him to bring up human rights issues and concerns with Narendra Modi. The White House had said that they are not here to lecture Narendra Modi and the Indian government on this but the president would be talking about this both in public spaces and privately as well. I would call that my reference to it. But we will have to wait and watch what comes out of the joint statement. That is where we will get to know what really happens. Like Modi said, he is looking forward to the U.S. Congress address. This is going to be a moment that will be watched closely. You had three members of the Congress that will be boycotting this event because they claim there has been persecution of Muslims back home here in New Delhi by the Modi government.
