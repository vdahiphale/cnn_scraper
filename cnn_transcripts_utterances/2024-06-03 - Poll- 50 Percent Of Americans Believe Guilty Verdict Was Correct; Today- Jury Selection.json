Now, I just want to emphasize a lot of these numbers we're getting in are pretty preliminary. But they did ask how the conviction would impact votes, pre- versus post- verdict. Now, pre-trial, 49 percent said they would vote -- this is, again, among Republican voters. Pre-trial, they would vote, 49 percent. Post-conviction, 66 percent. I mean, that does seem to underscore this point. And Mitt Romney has this great quote, too. He told his biographer in The Atlantic that, \"Democrats think they can put out the Trump fire with oxygen.

His father, the President of the United States, plans to spend most of the day in Wilmington where jury selection will get underway. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has more for us this morning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER (voice-over): The son of the sitting president on trial in another criminal case with big political implications. HUNTER BIDEN, PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN'S SON:  They have ridiculed my struggle with addiction. POLANTZ (voice-over):  Hunter Biden's addiction and purchase of a gun in October 2018 is at the heart of this case. The Justice Department accusing him of lying on gun purchasing forms that required him to attest he wasn't addicted to drugs. A special counsel brought the case last year after a prior deal fell apart in dramatic fashion at his plea hearing. MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  I'm here today to announce the appointment of David Weiss as a special counsel. POLANTZ (voice-over):  On Monday, jury selection begins -- potentially, a challenging task -- in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. Federal prosecutors plan to highly a part of his memoir where he writes about struggling with drug addiction around the time he bought the gun. H. BIDEN:  I had returned that fall of 2018 after my most recent relapse in California, with the hope of getting clean through a new therapy and reconciling with Hallie. Neither happened. POLANTZ (voice-over):  And they have evidence from the week of the gun purchase. Hunter Biden texting he was \"waiting for a dealer\" and \"sleeping on a car smoking crack.\" The trial also may feature testimony from the women in Hunter Biden's life -- his ex-wife, his brother's widow, and a woman he pays child support to. Prosecutors say the women witnessed his drug addiction. While Joe Biden continues to seek reelection, the president has avoided commenting directly on the prosecution of his son.",

But the legal argument for making the selective prosecution claim is that he's not being treated the same as other people similarly situated.So what you're looking at is not so much that the Republicans are calling for his head; it's that an addict who had a gun for 11 days didn't do anything bad with it. Didn't hurt anybody. Didn't threaten anybody. And a person who is no longer an addict -- the public policy suggests that person should be diverted, right? Should not be charged with a felony offense. And so you will not find other pieces on these facts where someone has to go to trial on this. So that's really the legal argument, but that argument has been excluded, so it's a legal argument, right? So it's for pretrial and it's for appeal. I do not expect the judge will allow them to argue that he has been selected out, if you will, for prosecution here. That will be something that the judge will exclude. They'll still try to get it in and the jury will -- you know, they'll understand what the argument is and if they want to nullify it, they can, of course.
