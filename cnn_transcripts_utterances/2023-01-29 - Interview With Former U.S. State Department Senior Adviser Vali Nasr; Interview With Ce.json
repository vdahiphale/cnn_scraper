They gathered to condemn the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini who died while in custody of the country's morality police. The protests were met with a brutal regime crackdown. One human rights organization estimates that more than 500 people including children have been killed in clashes with government forces. Protesters are also being sentenced to death and at least four have already been hanged. Today, the protests appear to have mostly died down.And there was another big Iran story in the news this week. The IAEA declared that Iran has stockpiled enough fissile material to build several nuclear weapons. I want to talk about all of this with my guest Vali Nasr, professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Welcome, Vali. First explain to us this issue of what has happened to these protests. They captured the world's attention. What has happened? VALI NASR, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT: Well, I think the protests have entered a new phase. It was -- it was people expecting that they would just continue as they did. But they have -- they have lost some of their intensity. It is in large measure due to regime crackdown but also there are other things. For instance, the weather is very cold and most of Iran has been very snowy. There has been enormous amount of air pollution that shut down entire cities for periods of time and this sort of disrupted the flow of the protests. But it is important to say that the anger that prompted these protests is very much there and the situation is still very froth. In fact, Iran's economy has actually gotten much worse place than it was before and there is also public anger at the way in which the government has reacted to these protests and particularly to the executions that you mentioned.",

I think it is safe to bet that there could be outrage and massive protests. After all it would violate the system of checks and balances that form the bedrock of the American political system. Well, the Israeli government though different is also based on checks and balances. And Benjamin Netanyahu's new justice minister has proposed just such reforms and more.

It is one thing to have the political opposition oppose this, which of course they are in very extreme terms. Some of them have called it a pogrom against the Israeli judiciary. But we're also seeing mass protests for three weeks straight. Over the last two weeks those protests were over 80,000. And last week it was over 130,000 which is very big in a society of -- you know, we have 9 million people in Israel.
