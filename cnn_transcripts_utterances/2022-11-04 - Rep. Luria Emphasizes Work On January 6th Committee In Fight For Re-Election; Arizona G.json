I've voted during the Trump administration and the Biden administration to continue to improve security at the border. And I think that there's other resources. I mean, when someone presents themselves, legally, seeking asylum, or as a refugee, that needs to be handled, expeditiously, properly, and with dignity, for that person or that family. Because, I think about the situation of how bad can someone's life be that they would literally, put their child, in a baby stroller, and walk across an entire continent, to try to come and live and have a better future in the U.S.? So, we need to - there's a lot of work that needs to be done. And I look forward to working on that, when I come back to Congress.",

The State has, already seen 18 cases of alleged voter intimidation, at drop boxes, referred to the Department of Justice, based on those lies.And even in a year, with hundreds of election liars, and deniers, on ballots, across the country, Arizona is really on quite another level. It's the only state, where all of the major Republican candidates, for U.S. Senate, for Governor, for attorney general, and for Secretary of State, all of them deny the truth, the fact that Joe Biden legitimately won the 2020 election, that there was no widespread election fraud. In the Secretary of State race, the Republican candidate, Mark Finchem was actually in the crowd, on January 6. We invited Finchem, on the show, tonight, again, but have not heard back from his campaign. I'm joined by the Democrat, who is running to keep Finchem, from that office, which controls elections, in Arizona, Adrian Fontes. He's a former U.S. Marine and former Maricopa County Recorder. Thanks so much for joining us. Really appreciate it. You've called your state a, quote, \"Powder keg.\" How real is the risk that somebody will get hurt, next week, either trying to vote, or during the counting of ballots, or in any related way? ADRIAN FONTES, (D) ARIZONA SECRETARY OF STATE NOMINEE, (D) FORMER MARICOPA COUNTY RECORDER: Well, Jake, thanks for having me. The risk is real. And that's the problem. We are finally, at a weird place, in the United States of America, an uncomfortable place, where we're actually talking about the possibility, of violence, in what ought to be the most civil and civilian activity that we have in the United States of America, which is elections and voting. This is what they have devolved us into. The election liars, the election deniers, the Oath Keepers, the insurrectionists, they have brought us here, because of one person's loss. And that is the true disgrace that we are facing. And we've got to have a comeuppance about this.",

Kerry has also been crisscrossing the United States, and campaigning, in other battleground States, such as Nevada, and Pennsylvania, and most recently, Michigan, where she pleaded with voters, at a rally, for Governor Gretchen Whitmer, to protect democracy.

You have my vote, by the way, if you ever choose to decide to do that. But let me ask you, why did you decide to campaign, in Arizona, this weekend? And why is this so important to you to get out the vote? KERRY WASHINGTON, ACTRESS &amp; ACTIVIST: I'm calling this my SOS tour. It's - we are in an emergency moment. But really, I'm calling it SOS, because I'm focusing on secretaries of state. Because I think we're in a moment where our democracy is on the ballot. And our secretaries of state are the people, who really defend our right to a free and fair election. So, I'm trying to give as much support, to those races, as possible. Also, because, you know, the presidential elections always get a lot of attention. They're splashy elections. But midterm elections, that's where we really impact our local and state governments, as you know. And secretaries of state, that's one of the many roles that are offices that we're electing this time.
