Storm in very warm water here off the southwest coast of Baja California, this to the west really, of Cabo San Lucas but in very, very hot water. Gaining strength rapidly on Thursday. But it's going to try to squeeze its way between a low to the west and a high to the east and that's where things really get interesting. This rarely happens. And so we rarely get tropical systems into Southern California or Arizona because of the perturbation that this is. A very, very difficult pattern to get but with the storm we actually do have it. And eventually, we know it'll be somewhere in Southern California, possibly into southern Arizona. I'll show you the different models here in a second.But we're dealing with down here now. Temperatures in the water are well into the 80s and even upper 80s in some spots. But by the time we get closer to San Diego, we're only in the 60s. Hurricanes and tropical storms don't like 60s. The storm will rapidly die off when it gets into that colder water. How quickly will it die off? That we don't yet. The water is still warmer by a degree or two than normal. But it is significantly colder than any type of tropical storm system will live in or certainly would grow in. So here are the models taking up into southern California. Some a little bit farther to the east, some a little bit farther to the west. This thing is still four days away. So where it's going to take a couple of days for the computer to figure out what's going on? I do think will probably gobble in quite a bit of dry air off of Mexico proper. That will begin to loosen the spin of the storm itself. Making it less of a tight little system right there in the middle and then eventually, even though there are going to be some very gusty winds maybe 60 miles per hour, for parts of the Southwest. I think that's when we're really going to see the threat of it being a rain event. The rain will be very heavy with the system, possibly 4 to 6 inches of rainfall. Especially in these higher elevations and possibly washing down the hills. And obviously the flash flood potential here with this is still going to be very strong even as a dying tropical system.

He said that this meeting would give the three heads of state a chance to talk about concrete steps towards maintaining peace and stability. You know, at its core, Bianca, this summit is about dealing with an erratic and a missile threatening North Korea -- as we saw from the package. But more importantly how to deal with a rising and aggressive China. You know, Beijing is making its military presence felt in the region. Look at Taiwan, the territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the dispute over the Senkaku Islands with Japan. And we heard from the U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, a few days ago he spoke with the Brookings institute. And he said that China assumed that South Korean Japan would never, in fact resolve their differences or get on the same page. And the fact that they seem to be doing that, and that perhaps this embedding of this cooperation in the DNA of the three governments to create a new norm, will present a major deterrent China. Take a listen.

They say their air defenses were able to down this drone before it reached its target, with debris, as you mentioned, has struck the Moscow Expo and causing, according to the Russian authorities, minor damage.

Those operations are back up and running according to Russian state media. But of course, we are seeing that uptick.
