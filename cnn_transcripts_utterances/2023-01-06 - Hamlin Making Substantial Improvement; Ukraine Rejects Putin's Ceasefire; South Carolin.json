SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, what he's describing, if you had to put a tone on it, is being cautiously optimistic. He's still critically ill. And sometimes the recovery can be a little bit of a roller coaster. So you can have good days and bad days and these things do play out over days and even weeks as opposed to hours and days. So, you've got to sort of widen the aperture of time here. But the other sorts of tests, I mean one of the important ones that he talked about was assessing his neurological function. Someone goes without oxygenated blood for a period of time, how did that affect the brain? Was there an injury to the spinal cord? And, thankfully, it sounds like that the answer to both those questions is no. Those -- he's able to communicate, as you say. He's moving his hands and his feet. That's a great sign. Impact on other organs, the kidneys, you know, the liver, things like that, that will be assessed over time. I think what he was responding to there specifically was about a concussion. And I think the point the doctors were making were -- was that, you know, he's still sedated because he's still on a breathing tube. And to assess for more specific things like concussion, that can take a while. But, look, two and a half days after the injury is when that press conference took place. And that was -- it was a significantly optimistic look at things. I mean, you know, it -- just the day before he was still lying on his chest because he had -- they were having trouble actually oxygenating him. So, he's - that-- it was - it was good news, as you point out, all around yesterday.",

And so it is, for all intents and purposes, business as usual on the front lines in Ukraine and, frankly, in the rest of the country as well.President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that this was just Russians taking advantage of a potential ceasefire to get troops closer to the front lines, to resupply the front lines, perhaps get better positioning along the front lines, and they weren't going to allow that to happen. And the Russians also made abundantly clear that this was not a free pass for the Ukrainians either. They said that if they were fired on, they would fire back. And they also said that Ukrainians wouldn't be allowed to simply improve their position on the battlefield, that they would also strike in that case as well. So, given that the Ukrainians were treating this as any other day, it was doomed to fail from the get-go. And that is what we're seeing on the front lines. And even a couple of hours into the ceasefire supposedly beginning, the air raid sirens, as you mentioned, went off in Kyiv and across the country. That doesn't necessarily mean there was a missile incoming, but certainly a lot of Ukrainians here rolled their eyes and thought, I told you so. In fact, I was at a church service earlier today for soldiers led by the head of the orthodox church of Ukraine, and I interviewed him briefly afterwards. And after hearing the sirens, he said, look, we don't trust what the Russians said. Just look at the air raid sirens coming in. They say that there can only be -- he said that there can only be peace in this country if the Russians get out of Ukraine. Jim. Erica.",
