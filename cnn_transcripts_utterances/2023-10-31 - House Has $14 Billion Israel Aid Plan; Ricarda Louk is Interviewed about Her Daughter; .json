      "sentences": "But here's where the reality sets in. Under the new speaker, Mike Johnson, the House has released its proposal for an Israel funding bill, does not have Ukraine funding. No path or bill for Ukraine funding. That Israel funding bill already facing an uphill battle in the House. Some Republicans already opposed. Democrats as well. And it would absolutely be dead in the Democrat-led Senate. It includes $14 billion in aid to Israel but it offsets that money by cutting the exact same amount from the IRS. No money, of course, is allocated for Ukraine.Now despite Republican hand-wringing about ballooning deficits, the spending offset would actually add to the deficits at the tune of about $30 billion. That's according to the Nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Budget. The reason is, well, math. When you cut funding to the agency in charge of collecting revenue, you tend to bring in less revenue. Joining us now, Josh Barro, writer of the \"Very Serious\" newsletter, and Akayla Gardner, White House correspondent for \"Bloomberg News.\" And, Akayla, very proud of myself for the math that I was doing. But this is clearly a negotiating strategy by House Republicans, but I'm wondering what the end game here is at this point? AKAYLA GARDNER, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, \"BLOOMBERG NEWS\": I think for Johnson, he really knows that he has to please the most conservative members of his caucus if he wants to keep his position. We know this vote or the ability to vote a speaker out is still on the table for him and so he wants to signal to them that he's prioritizing spending cuts, which has been a huge priority of the caucus after Democrats were in control of the House for those first two years. And so he's definitely wanting to deliver that. But as you mentioned, this bill is very unlikely to pass. As soon as it hits the Senate, or if it even gets there, it's very unlikely to actually get over the finish line.",

There are things they're doing that are legally dubious that were also legally dubious that - when Trump did them that they could legalize if they were going to do some border policy changes.But the Biden administration doesn't really like to talk about what its border policy actually is and they would be sort of admitting the extent to which that they have continuity or trying to have continuity with Trump era policies. So, that feels like it should be an area of possible bipartisan agreement because it implicitly is. But the two sides in Congress clearly are not there at all on reaching that deal and immigration policy is complicated, trying to paper that within a matter of weeks when you need to do the supplemental would be challenging.
