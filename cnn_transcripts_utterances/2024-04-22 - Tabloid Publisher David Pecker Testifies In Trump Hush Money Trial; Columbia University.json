I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington, and Erin Burnett is just outside the courthouse in New York.Last hour, a court wrapped up for the day after some truncated testimony from the first witness, David Pecker. He's the publisher of the National Enquirer and a longtime friend of Trump's who helped orchestrate several catch and kill deals to bury damaging stories about Trump during the 2016 campaign. Erin.",

And I want to make something abundantly clear that we all know, butmaybe isn't as obvious to others, payment for journalism, whether for stories or to kill stories, is not how we operate, is not how kind of usually media operates. It's how they operated. And why he has become so central in his relationship with the former president is so central in this case. And I think what you saw in these initial stages, you made clear there will be much more testimony to come from David Pecker. His relationship with the former president and his role in this as alleged criminal conspiracy is that they're trying to set the stage for the critical moments to come. And Pecker's role in actual meetings, actual conversations at the center of this case.",

These are the standard questions you'd ask anybody. But they also talked a little bit about how business went down at the National Enquirer. That's really interesting. Right? How did you find stories? How did you investigate stories? Hey, how much did you spend?So they're just now getting to these basic questions, but it's so important to the prosecution's case because David Packer helped set the stage for this argument. This was all part of an effort to suppress negative stories about candidate Trump to help his chances in the 2016 election. And they're going to go back to a 2015 meeting between Trump, Packer and Cohen, where he talks about how he's going to help him suppress these stories. I'll be your eyes and ears. And then we know that David Packer was helpful in suppressing other stories, not Stormy Daniels. Karen McDougal, another woman who says she had an affair, a doorman who said falsely that Trump had fathered a child out of wedlock. David Packer helped secure those two stories and then suppress them, make sure they never saw the light of day. He is important. Even though he didn't pay Stormy Daniels, he just tipped them that she was telling her story. He's important to set the framework. The prosecutors are trying to tell the story with it.",

The 34 charges are based on 34 pieces of paper. I'm paraphrasing a little bit. There was how they framed things, which goes against, they're telling a similar story but just have very different conclusions as to what it actually means.And what's interesting, when you listen to or when we read through what Blanche was saying in the opening statement and how he framed how the former president did business, who he was and his role in New York in society, when you contrast that with how the prosecution was trying to lay out what was actually happening in this moment, laying out the Access Hollywood tape, laying out the kind of urgent need to try and kill this story and why. People don't remember what was happening in this week when this information first became apparent to Trump and his team. This was a very political and electoral strategy related type of operation which runs counter to what we heard from Blanche, who's saying, look, this is protect the family. This is how the business operates said nothing to do. But hey, if it does, you know, this is, we always try and persuade when it comes to an election.",

      "sentences": "Welcome back to our special coverage. The judge at Donald Trump's hush money trial gave jurors extensive instructions before the opening statement started. Among them that there is no formula for judging the accuracy of a witness, that they should use their, quote, varied life experiences in evaluating if a witness is credible, and that they can take brief notes. But the note taking should not distract them from watching the proceeding.Joining us now is Alan Turkheimer. He's a jury consultant with some 20 years of experience doing juror research, focus groups, mock trials and more to help legal teams prepare for trial. Alan, put these instructions into perspective for us. Is this typical or is this something unique to this historic trial?",

So commitments that were made and the case narratives that were pointed out and presented, the jurors will remember that impressions of the parties and the case story start to form very early on in a case.And then as time goes by, as the evidence comes in and there are more witnesses, the preformed ideas that jurors have from opening statements then are interpreted and assimilated in their minds as the trial progresses. So it's really important that initial formation of the impression and the initial case story, the jurors start to see. And that's why when you looked at the opening statements, clearly different case perspectives and case narratives, you want to have facts, you want to have arguments, but also, jurors want a story. They want to know what really happened and what they're supposed to look for as the witnesses continue on with the cases, as they unfold.",

He wants, probably the defense wants jurors to put themselves in the shoes of the president, if they could possibly do that at that point in time, and then make decisions based on the best interests of their family.Now, whether or not it'll work, that's up for the jury. New Yorkers tend to have what I call good BS detectors. So whether it's the opening statement or the cascade of witnesses that are going to -- that are going to be testifying in court, it'll be up to the jury to decide whether or not the witnesses are truthful and are persuasive. BLITZER: Todd Blanche also said this, and I'm quoting him now, he said none of this is a crime, and that there is nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy, close quote. Two lawyers are empaneled on the jury. Why do you think both sides allowed attorneys to sit on the jury?",

But I think the defense wants to shake things up in the deliberation. And it's certainly a wild card to have lawyers sitting as jurors on a case. They tend to argue and tend to take different perspectives.Lawyers are certainly good at taking two different sides of an argument. So maybe the defense thought that would be helpful. But at the end of the day, yes, they have law degrees. They're lawyers. And I think it's going to be a fascinating deliberation. A lot of times lawyers take a backseat and try to let the others speak in the deliberation. So I'm not convinced that they're going to dominate the deliberation, but they will certainly be a force when it comes time to decide whether or not the state proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.",
