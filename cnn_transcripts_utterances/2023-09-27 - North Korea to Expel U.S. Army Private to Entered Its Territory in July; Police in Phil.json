If you look at where Target closed nine stores yesterday, four stores in San Francisco, stores in Seattle, stores in Portland, stores in New York, these are places where bail reform laws, criminal justice reforms have taken the inside of a jail cell out of the equation. So shoplifting is a crime where a judge can't set bail.Think about this. In New York City there are just over 300 people who have between them 4,000 arrests, 70 percent of them are not in jail, and they account for 30 percent of all shoplifting in New York. This is actually their job. They go out to steal every day, and that has gone up significantly because they know getting put in jail is not in the equation any longer because of the laws that say it's a no bail offense and D.A.'s policies are they don't want people in custody for what they call nonviolent crimes.",

The problem with that strategy and the gamble for the speaker is the reality that there are a number of hardliners who say they will never get to yes on a short-term spending bill, arguing it just kicks the can down the road. Then the question becomes, what happens if the Senate has sent him something? Does he amend it? Does he change it?

But to start there, that has been the concern, and it is a valid concern that the administration has tried to do things to the Treasury Department to backstop a little bit.

I saw how the past generation of union auto jobs helped build the middle class and build communities like the one that I grew up in. I also saw what happened when those factories closed.What the UAW is trying to do right now is to make sure that this next chapter of the auto industry, which let's be very clear, these cars are going electric with or without us. The question is whether the US is going to lead or whether China's going to lead. And we want to make sure that it's not just a US led EV revolution, but one where the jobs that come with it are good paying jobs and have that same quality that we had generations ago of being jobs that you can build a family and even build a community around.",
