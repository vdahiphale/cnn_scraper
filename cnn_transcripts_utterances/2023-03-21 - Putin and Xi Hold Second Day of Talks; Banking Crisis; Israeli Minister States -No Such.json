And that's exactly what Vladimir Putin is giving Xi Jinping right now in Moscow. At the Kremlin. In these larger than life spaces that are so typical of these Socialist nations. I've seen similar spaces in North Korea and Putin will certainly see a lavish welcome when he decides to visit Beijing, which is a sign that these hours of talks, 4.5 hours yesterday, more official talks and then eventually document signings happening both today and tomorrow. But at the end of the day, what connects these two men -- remember, Putin has been under fire with war crimes charges. He's a global pariah, his country is so heavily sanctioned by the West. But the person and the country protecting Putin's Russia from instability economically, certainly, is China. In terms of helping to support the Russian economy by buying oil, by possibly selling Russia these high tech microchips that the West won't sell because there are fears that they could be put to military use. And if China, even just Xi showing up, by the way, is a sign of support after this unprecedented third presidential term, the Chinese leader, the most powerful since Mao, choosing to spend his first foreign trip with Vladimir Putin. It shows that what Xi wants from Putin is a stable Russia that can be used to counterbalance the United States and also support from Russia down the road if and when Xi decides to fulfill his own ambitions for Taiwan. This could (ph) democracy where I am right now. So we have these two authoritarian strongmen, one waging a war against democracy as we speak, getting support from China, while China claims to be neutral, offering a peace plan that would have Ukraine, not only give up the territory that Russia stole but also potentially, pull back NATO from the eastern borders and bringing in contractors from China potentially to do the reconstruction. That's the option that Ukraine has from Xi Jinping; whereas Xi Jinping is giving Vladimir Putin basically praise, validation and legitimacy at a time that he needs it.",

She's talking as we speak to aroomful of bankers -- but really she's talking to depositors to say, look, this is as close as I'm going to give you to an explicit guarantee. Even if you have more than $250,000 in a bank in the United States -- and it's a little bank, let's be clear -- your money is safe. They're sending this message of confidence and, as you can see, it's working. The weakest link is First Republic Bank and even that share price is rising today. Those talks now, rather than just dumping deposits into this bank to shore it up, there could be a capital injection which just means again providing them more support to keep them viable as a bank. So she's going to say today, look, we've done a lot of steps; we've acted forcefully and fast. And she's quite right. The timing is also important, as you said, because this is the first day of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting. And the Federal Reserve now has to decide what to do about continuing to push and fight and bring down inflation or perhaps taking a pause and just seeing how things land. And hopefully, we see some of this calm that we've seen return to financial markets and to stock markets in particular, continue. I was thinking about it in movie terms actually. I think not cutting rates tomorrow is a case of \"What Lies Beneath\" and perhaps could make people fearful. Half a percentage point could err on the side of perhaps \"Clueless\" or \"Looney Tunes\" and the market saying a quarter of a percentage point hike - - and I'd agree with them -- \"Sense and Sensibility.\" How about that?",

Now for ordinary defendants -- and the DA's office has said if there is an indictment, they want to treat the former president the same way they treat anyone else. An indictment is voted out of a grand jury; it's put under seal and then defense attorneys are notified that an indictment has been filed. And the prosecutors and defense attorneys work out a self surrender and an initial appearance. I've learned in speaking with sources and the former president's team that he would surrender if he is charged. But at this point, they don't expect any arrest or initial appearance to happen until next week. That's a big \"if\" there is even an indictment this week. The former president was speculating that he would be arrested today, even though his own team said they had no reason to believe that. They hadn't received any information that would support that. But in the same post, he was also calling on his supporters to protest and in between Truth Social posts, he was fundraising. So he really believes that all of this will help him politically.",

But it can often be tense. The Jordanian kingdom is the traditional custodian of the holy sites in Jerusalem, which is often the site of clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police.

Since the first 19 days of this month alone, at least 113 civilians killed and 356 injured. The U.N. estimates that number is actually probably much higher. We got a rare look at one of these incidents in which a civilian was terribly injured by this Russian invasion. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WATSON (voice-over):  From a battlefield in eastern Ukraine, a desperate call for help as a Ukrainian woman pleads for her wounded husband's. Footage from last June shows the moment when a Ukrainian couple took a wrong turn toward an active front line. Their car came under fire from nearby Russian forces, badly wounding the driver, Valeria Ponomarova's husband. VALERIA PONOMAROVA, ANDRII'S WIFE (through translator):  I saw his head was injured and immediately began to bandage his head. WATSON (voice-over):  The incident captured on video by a drone piloted by Ukrainian soldiers and later compiled into a documentary by the Ukrainian director Lyubomyr Levytsky. PONOMAROVA (through translator):  I turned it fell on my knees and just screamed with the most agonizing cry. I didn't know whose drone it was, our forces or the enemy. WATSON (voice-over):  The pilot taped a sign saying, follow me on his drone and directed Ponomarova to safety. She made the agonizing decision to leave her wounded husband behind. As she followed the drone, Russian soldiers emerged to approach her car. They took her husband, Andrii, and dumped him in a ditch. (on-camera):  This is the intersection where that terrible shooting took place in June. The Ukrainian military subsequently liberated the area, allowing Ukrainian police to come in and launch an investigation into an alleged Russian war crime. (voice-over):  Ukrainian police investigator Serhii Bolvinov says he has gathered evidence to accuse a 26-year-old Russian army officer of the war crime of attempted murder of a civilian. SERHII BOLVINOV, KHARKIV POLICE (through translator):  He is a company commander of the Second Motorized Rifle Division, First Tank Army, Western Military District. We established his identity. WATSON (voice-over):  For police to work here, sappers first had to clear the area of landmines. Then police conducted forensic and ballistic analysis of the crime scene. (on-camera):  Ukrainian police say the Russian troops were stationed here on this side of this wall and it's from here that they opened fire on the car. (voice-over):  Inspector Bolvinov shows me what he says are incriminating telephone intercepts of their chief suspect calling his wife.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The woman survived and the fucking man didn't. WATSON (voice-over):  Ukrainian police say the weapon was a 30 millimeter cannon aboard this type of infantry fighting vehicle. Police say they've also tracked down photos of the officer and his wife from their social media accounts. On that dark day, Valeria Ponomarova followed the drone to safety, stepping around deadly landmines until a Ukrainian soldier met her. It was too dangerous for troops to retrieve Andrii Bohomaz.

Xi has said that he chose Russia as his first international visit after he first became president. This is a visit now after his third reelection to president. So I think where this leads us -- but the point to where Xi Jinping's intervention leads us -- right now, as I said, Putin is going to be increasingly dependent on China economically. Right now, Ukraine is very dependent on its Western allies; in particular, the United States; in particular, over weapons but also economic support. Where this leads us, perhaps in a couple years' time, is China having the principal threads of control over Russia. And the United States and its allies, that backed Ukraine having the principal threads of control over Ukraine. It's been said so many times:  Ukraine will negotiate at the table for Ukraine. But the reality is, the global realities are, that they need weapons and they need the economy. So this is how it's going to work in the future.
