There are, quote, multiple casualties, according to police, as they respond to an active aggressor. Officials, including the ATF, are telling everyone to stay away from the area of 300 Block of East Main Street, the mayor also urging the public to stay away from the area. We have now learned that this is a shooting, that there are multiple people who are down, including a police officer.CNN Correspondent Omar Jimenez is following these developments as we watch them there live from our affiliate, WAVE. We are seeing a lot of police down there, and we're hearing that the governor may be on his way. What can you tell us, Omar?",

The Louisville Police is trying to get under control an active aggressor situation, in which there were multiple casualties. And we are learning right now that there are six victims, including one police officer, in this incident, according to preliminary information from a source with direct knowledge of the scene on the ground.There were apparently shots exchanged between the shooter and police during this incident, and according to this source, the gunman is down and the incident is over. So, there's good news there, that this is not currently an active, ongoing situation, but it's for what actually transpired in the amount of people that, you know, maybe hurt or potentially even worse here is a major question as this unfolds. As you hinted at as well, there are multiple officials that are trying to get out information as quickly as they can. The mayor saying and urging people to stay away from downtown, it's similar calls we've heard and seen from local law enforcement, but also some of those on the federal side as well, Sara.",

And it is unclear if the shooter is listed as among one of those victims.But as I talked about some of those officials heading to the scene to try and get more information, we do know that Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has confirmed that he is heading to the scene. He was one of the first to confirm that this was actually a shooting that we were dealing with here. But, of course, this is in the middle of the major metro city. We can imagine there were a lot of witnesses, potentially at least people who heard the gunshots were at the very least saw the amount of law enforcement and/or first aid personnel that actually responded to the scene, as we see some of the images on the screen. But it's six victims in total. And, again, as we're learning from a source with direct knowledge of the scene, one of them appears to be a police officer, as officials of multiple jurisdictions try to get a handle on obviously what happened who this suspect or gunman may have been. But also when you talk about those that are responding, the ATF, that the FBI is also acknowledged that they are helping with this as well, likely trying to trace the origins of this weapon. A lot of things begin going into effect with the scene like this. But a lot of details that are still coming in, even at the very least, again, just two conditions of these six victims, again, as far as we know, so far.",

So, there could have been several different areas where some of this shooting happened. I want to get straight to Juliette Kayyem. She is here live with us to give us some insight into this. She is on the phone, excuse me, not in the studio. Can you give us some sense of what happens next when you have this mass casualty event that we have seen so many times in this country, including, of course, this year, and we're just in April? JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST (voice over):  Right. So, each state is going to be slightly different, and, you know, just to be clinical about it because we are in an ongoing mass casualty event, local Louisville Police are clearly taking lead right now. They need to account for individuals, for bodies and also for more victims who may not be close to that area. You are also going to get what we generally see as a lot of concerned citizens who don't know where family members are. We don't know the conditions of who we're reporting has been injured. But we certainly know just from experience that the governor's announcement and his presence there suggest that this is an event that everyone is taking notice of until we figure out what the motive might be or what the ongoing investigation is, depending on mode of -- Louisville Police, a sophisticated police department, I have worked with them in the past. I know Kentucky very well, a very sophisticated police department, will take the lead. If there's a federal nexus, the FBI will come in. I should say, Kentucky has been no stranger to a lot of disasters lately. Governor Beshear, weather-related disasters in particular, is known in my field as someone who has their head on straight, will not make this political, wants to protect the citizens of Kentucky, as well as the mayor. So, you have a serious people now taking this very seriously. And so we'll just continue to wait to get verified information from our reporters or the police department on what, in fact, the motive may be.",

What you are seeing is the helicopter above the scene, there are lots of different scenes that appears to be where this shooting apparently took place. You can see blood on the steps of a building, but you also saw someone taking pictures and being very interested in a particular car. It was a gray car, so lots going on in the scene right now.I'm going to toss it over to John who is there with Mr. Miller, who's got a lot of details.",

But the sense we're getting is that somewhere around 8 30, an individual walks into the Old National Bank and the 300 Block of East Main Street with a weapon and opens fire.Bank employees fled to the vault and secured themselves inside. Police get there. The doors are locked. They're able to gain entry. There's a confrontation with the shooter. Shots are fired by the shooter. Shots are fired by the Louisville Metropolitan Police. Six people were taken to a university hospital with gunshot wounds. One of them, we understand at this point, is a police officer. The gunman, we understand, is down. They have been able to identify him. So, what you see now is the clearing of the building. They've got to go up through that building to all the floors, find people who are hiding, people who might be in closets. The building at this point seems to be clear. And now, they're going through the crime scene inside the bank looking for the car that's connected to the shooter. FBI is on the scene assisting for a couple of reasons. One, it's a bank, which makes a crime inside a bank or even entering a bank with the intent to commit a felony, a federal crime, but they're there primarily to see whatever Louisville P.D. needs, victim witness assistance, forensics um anything like that. We've got ATF on the scene. They're going to be looking at the gunman's weapon, doing those traces to figure out where it was purchased and when and what other guns there might be, that they might need to roll back on a location, a house, do a search warrant and so on, so a lot of moving parts right now.",

Is there any other threat in the building?So, at this point, Louisville is coming back to something close to normal, meaning police are back to responding to calls in other districts and other part of the city. They're working on the scene to determine, okay, how many people do we still need here, how many people can we put back on patrol? The key point is that the threat is over. The gunman is down.
