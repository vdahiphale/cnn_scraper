There's still a war in Gaza, although it's somewhat subdued, but nonetheless just the other day, Israel conducted a ferocious attack in Jabalya refugee camp. There's a war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, which we just discussed, and there's a war or a confrontation or another theatre that's going on between Israel and Iran where Israel is expected to strike Iran in the next few days in retaliation for an Iranian strike a few days ago.You take -- you combine all three and the one thing they have in common that they actually are three fronts of the same war. And the three fronts of the same war threaten to (INAUDIBLE) and escalate beyond those three. The West Bank, you have the Houthis in south Yemen and southwest Yemen and so on. Now the second common denominator that they have is that in none of these wars, however just, however justified they may be, however justifiable, anyone could make the case about the fighting, Israel has no coherent and clear political goals. It's not clear what Israel wants to do with Gaza. It's not clear exactly what Israel seeks to do with Lebanon, and it's not at all clear what's this for tit-for-tat or ping-ponging of missile salvo between Israel and Iran is going to achieve. Enter the U.S. The U.S.'s policy in the last year was all about averting or preventing escalation. That failed. It wasn't Americas fault 100 percent, but nonetheless if that was the paramount interest that was defined, the Americans did not succeed in achieving it. Now I think that, you know, you have 22 days before the election in the U.S. and then the 99 days, as you mentioned, between today and the 20th of January 2025, Biden has announced to put forth a plan to pull for an immediate ceasefire, simultaneous on all three fronts, and not play a game. Anyone not interested, take it or leave it. That plan is not going to be a piece of paper that's going to be sent to someone's e-mail and forgotten. That's going to be submitted to the U.N. Security Council. And everyone should heed the advice to accept it. Anyone has reservations, stipulations, conditions, changes, that it wants to introduce, that's fine. That's what the negotiation process is about. But before negotiating -- negotiations, I'm sorry, you need to accept the plan. That's the gist of it.",

That's the acronym, you have all these acronyms in the Pentagon.If we add this layer then that makes Israel less vulnerable. So it's less vulnerable, maybe the incentive to strike Iran is going to diminish somewhat. If Iran sees that Israel is well-defended, maybe it'll have a disincentive to further attack Israel after Israel retaliates. What the Americans are afraid here, Lynda, is that this is -- that escalation, there's an immutable law in escalation and that is that when people think they control it, they don't. And it always spins or spirals out of control. And this is what's happening. Now, because Iran can block the Straits of Hormuz, because Iran theoretically, hypothetically in some bad, worst-case scenario but actually retaliate by bombing oil terminals in Saudi Arabia, in Bahrain, in Kuwait, in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, that would pull the U.S. into this war. If, on the other hand, Israel goes as far as attacking Iran's nuclear infrastructure, which doesn't seem the case, but you never know, it's kind of a rolling escalation, that will drag the U.S. And the last thing the U.S. needs, whether before the election or during a transition period, is to be sucked again into a Middle East war when the U.S. was thinking just two years ago that the main focus was Ukraine and the main challenge in the world for the U.S. is high enough, and all of a sudden look at us, America, here we are back in one of those forever war in the Middle East in which and with which we have nothing to do.",
