At the very same time, President Biden is getting set to meet with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to show his support on the sidelines of the G7 Summit in Italy.Biden and Zelenskyy expected to speak to reporters this morning as the world leaders gathered there are getting ready to announce a $50 billion loan for Ukraine that Biden is now hoping sends a message to Russia. I'm going to show you some live pictures. We've seen live pictures of the Ukrainian President meeting with some of the world leaders gathered there. And now split screen to Donald Trump. He's sitting down with Republican lawmakers, friend and some reluctant allies behind closed doors. CNN's Nic Robertson is in Italy, Kristen Holmes in Washington. Kristen, I want to start with you. You've been talking to Trump's team and lawmakers. What -- what are you expecting to happen today?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Kate. Well, look, this is the first time the former president has had this kind of meeting with Republican lawmakers since, one, becoming the presumptive nominee and, two, since becoming a convicted felon. And on the Trump side, they're really saying that they want this to be about, quote, unquote, \"unity,\" rallying the troops behind the former president, getting their messaging in sync ahead of what is likely to be a very contentious several months leading up to November.Now, we are told that he is expected to talk about, one, how he plans to win, how to beat Biden in November. But two, what a 2025 agenda would possibly look like. Talking about his policies, his proposals, immigration, the border economy, all the things that we hear him talk about regularly on the campaign trail. On the lawmaker side, it sounds as though they are in line with what Donald Trump is going to say. They want some kind of conversation around unity, bringing the party together. That's been very fractured in recent months, particularly on the House side over Speaker Johnson. Before that, of course, Speaker McCarthy. But they're also looking for some kind of insight into what they can be doing to lay the groundwork on the Hill, on the legislative side ahead of November if Donald Trump is going to win to kind of prep for that kind of thing, to pass those laws or at least get the ball rolling on that. Now, he is meeting with the House Republicans and Senate Republicans separately. We expect a very different vibe, so to speak. House Republicans have described this as likely to be more of a pep rally. People were talking about wearing their Donald Trump clothing. On the Senate side, he's going to be greeted by some of his biggest skeptics, including Senator Mitch McConnell. The two of them have not spoken since January 6, since the election was certified for Biden. They have had no love lost between them. President Donald Trump is routinely insulting McConnell. Now, McConnell has endorsed Donald Trump, but again, the two have not spoken. That's going to be balanced out, though, by the fact, as you mentioned, some of those potential VP contenders will be in the room to provide him that kind of pep talk like atmosphere. Kate?",

There's this security agreement between the United States and Ukraine now, a 10-year security agreement. But to what extent is this a 10-year contract with a huge opt-out clause in January of 2025 if Donald Trump is elected? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Oh, it's got several opt-out clauses, John, and the possibility of President Trump's election is just one of them. So this is basically an executive agreement. It's made between President Zelensky and President Biden, and the U.S. hopes that there will be similar agreements with each of the other G7 members. And right now, President Zelenskyy is sitting with, of course, those leaders, and he's going to be hearing about this. The problem is this. An executive agreement can be undone by another president, the next president. Think of the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, which was then undone by President Trump in 2018. The second problem is that there is no dollar amount attached to this agreement, and there won't be for the rest of the year because Congress has, after a long debate, already given $61 billion. So they'd be up for more money next year. And so what he's getting is basically an agreement in principle with no amount of cash and no particular commitment about what kind of response the U.S. would bring if there was a second large invasion.",

It's on your border. You've long wanted to reassert power there.

One of them you're likely to see later on today, which is going to be resolving the issue of what to do with the $300 billion in Russian assets that the Russians somewhat inexplicably, John, left in Western institutions, financial institutions, before they did the invasion. And so the formula that they seem likely to come up with is that the U.S. and some of its allies will issue a $50 billion loan immediately to the Ukrainians. So they'll get the money right away and it would be repaid from the interest on that those frozen assets.They basically put that into some interest-bearing accounts that would go repay the loan. That would be a difficult thing for President Trump to undo later on. But the big initiative, I think, that everyone worries about the most, John, is simply this, that when Biden first showed up at a G7 meeting when he was newly elected, it was in Britain, he basically said, we're back and alliances are back. And today, I think, as everyone sits around that table, they are wondering, will these three or four years of the Biden presidency be the blip in which alliances came back for a little while, or did they come back on a sustained basis? And that's really the major foreign policy division between President Trump and -- former President Trump and President Biden.",

She's speaking at this church behind me to thousands of congregants, faith leaders from across the state. And last time she had a similar speech like this, the speech got politicized, and she was accused by Trump's attorney here in Georgia, Steve Sadow, of prejudicing potential jurors in this trial by what he called bringing up the race card, alleging that she was being attacked for her relationship with Nathan Wade because she was a black woman and he is a black man. I talked to a source in her inner circle, and they tell me that Fani Willis is not expected to touch really any of these national issues or talk about the case. She's going to instead focus on criminal justice policy. Remember, she's up for a reelection this year for that seat in Fulton County. So that speech is expected to happen here in the coming hours.
