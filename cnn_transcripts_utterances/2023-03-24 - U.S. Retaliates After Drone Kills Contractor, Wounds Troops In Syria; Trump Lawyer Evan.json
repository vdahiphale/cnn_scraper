You're looking at pictures there in Ottawa. We're going to bring you that when it begins. And there is also other major news that is demanding attention from the President and his team today, retaliatory strike by the United States in Syria.The Pentagon says President Biden authorized the strike after an American contractor was killed and five U.S. service members injured in Syria. The administration says the Americans were attacked by a drone, officials say came from Iran. Let's begin at the Pentagon with CNN's Oren Liebermann or and what are you learning about the U.S. personnel involved here and how frequently attacks like this happen?",

Two of them were treated at the scene. Three of them had to be taken to coalition medical facilities in Iraq. There was also one other U.S. contractor injured that in addition, according to the Pentagon to the one U.S. contractor who was killed in this one way UAV attack or suicide drone attack.The Pentagon says the drone was of Iranian origin, likely indicating that this was carried out by Iranian proxies, Shia militias in the area that work or are affiliated with Iran. In response, the U.S. carried out what it called a proportionate, deliberate action in response targeting facilities belonging to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. So facilities not directly linked with the strike itself. But the organization that works with these Iranian militias. In terms of how often these happen, that number quite surprising. General Erik Kurilla said yesterday that there have been 78 drone or rocket attacks against U.S. personnel in the Middle East since the beginning of 2021. That averages out to about one every 10 days or so. So these attacks happen. Of course, it's not often you see this sort of tragic end to these attacks, whether it's a rocket attack, or a drone attack. In terms of Iran's drone program, in general, the Pentagon views that as very advanced. And we've seen evidence of how advanced Iranian drones can be in terms of Russia employing those in Ukraine. So Iran has this capability. And its proxies use these capabilities to attack and harass U.S. forces in the Middle East. There are approximately 900 troops in Syria at a few different bases there. And they're there as part of the ongoing campaign to defeat ISIS. Kate?",

Spider, what do you see in this attack and then the U.S. response?MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, the attack as Oren described as not unprecedented. The Iranians, the IRGC are the Revolutionary Guard Corps, which really permeates all aspects of the Iranian government, you know, from the markets, to the education system, to the mosques, et cetera. This is an ongoing effort to really try to wear down the U.S. will. When you take it in context, look the Iranians think that maybe the United States is distracted in Ukraine and trying to get its arms around this challenged and emerging relationship with China and on the heels of Xi's visit with Putin in Moscow. But look, the United States has been conducting these operations in northeastern Syria for the last many, many years. This retaliatory strike, as described was proportional. And it was a lot of consideration for collateral damage. It was done at a time to minimize civilian casualties. But let there be no doubt it was very small. And it was very precise in terms of trying to print a very simple message, which is don't mess with United States. We've been a presence. We've been trying to get our arms around this challenge. And we're going to be there for a while. This will not alleviate or mid or reduce U.S. presence.",

Well, many people and much resources are kind of focused elsewhere, why is this happening in Syria and Iraq?[11:05:02] MARKS: Well clearly what Iran wants to try to do is really extend its influence operations I mean that's what it's all about. And General Kurilla has just laid it out very, very pointedly and the magnitude of this challenge, we shouldn't find it surprising that with the United States in Syria, and we've been there a while. Iran is looking to try to push us out and give us every reason to depart. But the United States is not going to do that. This is a counter ISIS mission that we are conducting. That's ungoverned space in Syria, totally ungoverned. And we know what happens when there's ungoverned space in the world. A lot of bad things can start to be ginned up and then operations can be planned. And then we end up with a potential 9/11 again. Well, we're not going to let that happen, not at all. So this is ungoverned. There's a lot of Turkish presence. There's a lot of U.S. presence. There's a lot of Kurdish presence. So it's a real mixed bag of influences, and fault lines that can really cause some significant problems. United States will be there, and we'll work very, very diligently to try to reduce the ISIS threat. That's what it's all about, getting rid of the ISIS threat that gets a ton of support from the IRGC.",

Escalation is always a concern. And the old expression, you know, if it feels good, don't do it. But the United States could be tempted to just try to whack the hell out of the IRGC as, you know, as aggressively as we can. But there's no benefit to that.What we want to be able to do is say, look, we're not going anywhere, this attack by Iran, although persistent, and they're probably going to attack again, we're going to remain, we're going to continue our mission. This is a burden that we agree to accept. But when you mess with us, when you strike against us, let there be no doubt we will respond. And we will do it very precisely and very quickly. If we have to do it again, we will, but we want to try to keep escalation down.",

Trump's attorney Evan Corcoran is being forced to testify to a grand jury today. This has to do with communications that he had with Trump in the lead up to the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago. Now Corcoran is only speaking to the grand jury because a judge ruled that his testimony goes beyond the protections of attorney-client privilege, which is how we got where we are At This Hour. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is live outside the courthouse in Washington for us with much more. Katelyn, what does today mean?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, this is a pretty notable day in this investigation and also for the presidency of Donald Trump and what happens to him after he has left the White House and as a presidential candidate. Evan Corcoran was his primary defense attorney responding to the federal government as they were seeking the classified records that might be kept at Mar-a-Lago.In fact, there were many records kept at Mar-a-Lago after the presidency. And Corcoran was part of the legal team that responded to the federal government saying that they had done a diligent search and had turned over any and all that they had found. Then the FBI came in and found many more classified records. So what's happening today, and the reason this is so notable is that the Justice Department believes what Corcoran will be telling the grand jury today is what Donald Trump was saying to him, the sort of thing where the Justice Department believes Donald Trump himself was trying to advance a crime potentially obstruct their federal investigation. So it really is a make or break day in that the Justice Department does not know or they may know now, but they didn't know going into this exactly what Corcoran would say. It's also quite an unusual day in that this doesn't happen very often. There have been many witnesses called to this grand jury before. But it's very, very unusual to have a defense attorney for the former President or anyone being forced to testify again to a federal grand jury and answer questions. Kate?",

Yet another place where a criminal investigation is advancing to a stage that is very dangerous for Donald Trump. The reason for that, the key part of any criminal case is proving a defendants intent.And it seems like from CNN's reporting on what Corcoran is going to be talking about today, the government's honing in on a series of events from May to June, having to do with a Donald Trump's conversation with Corcoran possibly misleading Corcoran, possibly moving these classified documents in response to the government's subpoena during that period, all of which prove that Donald Trump was acting intentionally.

The federal government can only go so far in meddling in state business.It would force Bragg to violate state law, if he were to turn this over. It's just naked partisan interference of a kind I have never seen in my over three decades of doing this work with a pending criminal matter. When we were doing the impeachment, Bill Barr wouldn't even come talk to us in the judiciary committee about the Mueller investigation after it was over, Kate. So this is outrageous. If they subpoena they will lose if it tracks the broad scope of their letter. Bragg was right to slam them and slam them hard.

I've talked to him about the core elements of what happened with Donald Trump and these allegedly false books and record entries that were alleged campaign finance violations that Michael pled to.So I think he's a strong witness. He's a colorful individual. It'll be an exciting cross examination. I don't get any pause from the ups and downs of the New York grand jury over the past days. Kate, New York has one of the broadest legal structures, allowing defendants in the last stage of a grand jury to put information before that body. It's not unusual to have these stops and starts and delays at the end of the case, that letter that Alvin Bragg sent yesterday to Congress, that was not the writing of a man who is blinking or wobbling or hesitating.
