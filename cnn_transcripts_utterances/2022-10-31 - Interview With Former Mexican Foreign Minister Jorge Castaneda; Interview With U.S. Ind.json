I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And today, we look at the struggle to protect democracy around the world. In a moment, the truly terrifying political violence boiling over in the United States as midterm elections approach. But the first, to the world's fourth largest democracy, Brazil. And a stunning comeback for the man who goes simply by his nom de gare, Lula. From Vladimir Putin to Joe Biden, world leaders have been sending him their congratulations. Now, in his first two terms, Lula da Silva lifted more than 20 million Brazilians out of extreme poverty. In 2019, out of office, he was imprisoned for corruption. Now, with his convictions annulled by Brazil's Supreme Court, Lula is president-elect. It was a tight one. Lula won a 50.9 percent of the vote, his opponent, Jair Bolsonaro, 49.1 percent. And now, Brazil transitions from Bolsonaro's far-right authoritarianism back to Lula's work-up party socialism. But Bolsonaro has yet to concede defeat. So, what does all this mean for the Americas and for the world? Jorge Castaneda was Mexico's foreign minister, and he now teaches Latin American studies at NYU. And he's joining me from there, from New York City. Welcome back to our program, Mr. Castaneda.",

And it was a very tight race till the very, very end for part of the evening last night, at least until around 60 percent of the votes having been counted, Bolsonaro was leading by a whisker, as you say, but leading nonetheless.

I doubt he will concede. I doubt he will agree that he lost, but he may not dispute the results himself. The problem is that he's been saying this for so many months, this way. And even last night, one of his allies in the United States, former Trump advisor Steve Bannon, was insisting that the election was rigged. That Lula did not win. That Bolsonaro won and should not accept defeat. So, there is a lot of pressure on him, probably from his advisers and from some of his supporters to dispute the elections.

Can I ask you, on the world stage a little bit? And, of course, we all are confronting Putin's war in Ukraine, none more so than Ukrainians themselves. But are you satisfied with Lula's -- the -- pretty much the only public, sort of, position he's taken? If you look at \"Time Magazine\" you know, in May of this, he was on the cover. And he said -- he did an interview, he said, this guy -- he meant Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is as responsible as Putin for the war. Because in the war, there's not just one person guilty. Saddam Hussein was as guilty as Bush for the outbreak of the 2003 Iraq war. He basically says Zelenskyy should not have asked for NATO E.U. membership, and the west should have made it clear from the start, and that would have saved all of this. What do you make of that?

I don't think that he will be willing to openly and clearly condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine without any whataboutism (ph), so to speak. I think that he will maintain this policy of a certain neutrality. Nonintervention, which the Brazilians love a great deal. But -- which at this stage in world history, perhaps it seems a bit anachronistic. Unfortunate, Lula is a man of his time. He is 77 years old. He did come of age in the 1960s when the Non-Aligned Movement was very powerful, was very strong in Latin America, in Africa, in Asia. And I think that he -- he's -- in general, his foreign policy will be of that nature.

Jorge Castaneda, thank you so much for joining us tonight. Now, in the United States, the shock is palpable after a brutal attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband at their home in San Francisco. The attacker seemed clearly intent on killing the second in line to the presidency, shouting, where is Nancy? He was wielding a hammer and struck Paul Pelosi in the head. He also carried a bag of zip ties, an echo of the violent political attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th. After surgery, the hospital says that Pelosi is expected to make a full recovery, but just over a week before the midterm elections, in Americas toxic political climate, threats to lawmakers, election officials, and even voters are on the rise. My next guest, Evan McMillan -- McMullin, a former Republican is standing up against extremism by running for Senate as an independent against Utah's ultra conservative Senator Mike Lee.

I'm encouraged to hear that doctors believe that he will make a full recovery. But the reality is now that political violence in our country is increasing, certainly people have died already, in political attacks whether they're shopping at schools or worshiping in their religious institutions. But now, we have elected leaders increasingly at risk. And that's something that you experience even as a candidate now. It's something we've experienced on the campaign trail.

But when Trump came along, I knew that I could not go along with the direction of the party under his leadership. So, I'm running as an independent here in Utah because Senator Lee has gone so far to the right in trying to overturn our last election in his divisive politics, in general, that most Utahns want to replace him. But the challenge is that that majority is divided between Democrats, Republicans, and independents. And so, I'm running as an independent in this election to build a cross partisan coalition. To reject the politics of division and extremism and bring people together for this electoral purpose to defeat Mike Lee. But also, to reject the politics of division and extremism at large in our country. And we've got to have leaders who take this new approach. Too often are leaders now are embodying the politics of division and extremism and it puts our nation at risk. It's clearly putting our democracy at risk. We're failing to overcome major challenges in the country, whether it's inflation or the high cost of health care or environmental issues. We need leaders who are going to bring people together, find common ground, and solve problems. And that's what we're committed to doing here with this campaign and that's why our coalition is growing. And why here in Utah, we have the first competitive Senate race in about 50 years. It's because we're rejecting those broken politics of division, and instead offering a healthier way forward for the country and our state.",

We know that earlier this year, a man was charged with attempting to murder the Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, who's a conservative. The FBI warning that there is potential for political violence around the midterms. So, what I'm saying, setting that all up, because I wonder, it's not just crazies who are -- it's not just fringe who are in possession of these crazy thoughts that lead them to take a hammer to the head of Paul Pelosi. It is also the mainstream Republicans who are election deniers. It's also those who, you know, who fuel these conspiracy theories. You know, the majority of Republicans running right now in the midterms, happened to question the legitimacy of the 2020 election.

And in which our votes are counted and the results of those elections are respected and there are peaceful transfers of power. And we don't turn to violence or lies to reverse them. But we're headed toward a crisis in our country if we continue on this path where we do use violence, and lies, and disinformation, conspiracism in order to overturn the will of the people. And that's where we're headed right now. That's why I'm running against Senator Lee. He's someone who knew what the results of the election were. He still cast doubts on the legitimacy of the 2020 election. He believes the other side is the enemy. He has one of the most divisive members in the Senate. And as a result, gets nothing done other than further dividing the country. But, again, it's all part of this broken rhetoric and broken politics in our country that is dehumanizing the other side. And yes, there's been violence on both sides, it's true. You reminded us of the attack a few years ago on a Republican congressional baseball practice and where the Whip was killed and almost -- almost killed during that attack, badly, badly wounded. And others were as well. And that's, you know, that's where we're headed. I only see it getting worse. But we need leaders who will model another way forward. Who will start talking about the other side in different terms. Who will bring us together.

So, when we spoke to election officials in these battleground states, some of them were really receiving horrific threats. I recall speaking to the wife of Georgia's Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, months after the election. She, as the wife, even though she wasn't the elected official. She, as the wife, was receiving harrowing threats. You know, people would text her and tell her that they were praying that she and her family would die. Just horrific threats. And I remember her getting particularly emotional when she recounted an incident that involved her widowed daughter-in-law. After the election, after the 2020 election, someone had broken into her widowed daughter-in- law's home and turned on all the lights, moved items around the home, opened all the doors, and they didn't take anything.
