In the state visit, we'll have a state dinner later, but there's no question. The central focus of this will be an agreement that's known -- become known as the Washington Declaration. It's essentially an agreement both designed to address the very acute, real and persistent threat that North Korea has posed over the course of the last two years with their repeated missile launches and tests, but also very real concern inside South Korea about not just North Korea, but also the U.S. commitment to the country. Now, as you noted as part of that, U.S. military assets will be moving in a more fulsome manner into the region including that nuclear submarine, but note the South Korean government will also have a seat at the table in terms of consultations related to any nuclear activities between the United States and the region. That's a critical component of this and this underscores what the president said in their meeting in the Oval Office. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, (D) 46TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I think that our partnership is ready to take on any challenges we may face. We're doubling down on our cooperation as allies, even as the DPRK ramps up its challenges. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Alright, guess what, friends occasionally have disagreements.There's tension at the moment because in those documents leaked from the Pentagon, there were conversations about efforts -- apparent efforts by the United States to get South Korea to help Ukraine with munitions. And South Korea has a public policy of not supplying any other nations with arms. President Yoon, listen to this in an NBC interview, saying don't worry, all is good here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There is the Oval Office meeting, then they come out and do the press conferences. This today, we are in the Rose Garden because it is a beautiful day, sometimes in the East Room. So some people say, ho-hum, right, it's just an ally. We're friends, ho-hum.David Ignatius from The Washington Post makes I think a very important point. White House meeting with allies like Yoon might seem like the elevator music of foreign policy, predictable and pre-programmed. But these relationships are the essence of the West's power. Not just as a message to North Korea, but China is watching right now. And it lives in the neighborhood. Putin is watching right now in the middle of the Ukraine war. Can President Biden continue to manage these important relationships? ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: That's been one of the accomplishments that the White House has kind of touted for the past two years, more than anything, the ability of their team to basically go out and unite the West, whether it be China, reaching out to allies in the South China sea, whether it's North Korea, or whether it's Putin as well, and the war in Ukraine. And not just how they talk and kind of showing that friendly relationship, but also how they can overcome some issues, right? And points of tension between the relationship is key for these western allies. This -- the leak of these documents and South Korea's role in Ukraine isn't the only point of tension between these two. You know, in the past year, we have also seen that the Yoon Administration has also basically criticized the Biden Administration for the Inflation Reduction Act and tax credits that would encourage American consumers to buy electric vehicles in the nation. This is coming after President Biden went to South Korea and basically celebrated Samsung investing in the United States. So there was concern amongst allies around a signature piece of domestic legislation, whether that would undermine the globalism as well when it comes to some of those partnerships.",

The Chief declined but the Chief as he declined yesterday, included with it a list of the kind of guidance that the justices already use and it was signed by the nine justices.What I have to say, the subtext of the whole thing was, we've got this. We are also being wrongly criticized was sort of another thing that came in -- came throughout the message. And then I do want to mention, at the end, the Chief Justice added a paragraph about security and -- so it was not just we've been wrongly criticized, we have this, but we are under threat also. And I don't want to minimize the threat to them, but lots of people in Washington have faced threats and the point is there are some serious ethical concerns that need to be addressed.
