      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Phil Mattingly in Washington. Jim has the morning off.And we begin this morning with swing state gains and battleground blitzes. Today, Vice President Harris and Governor Tim Walz are back on the road again, likely with a little more pep in their step. That it's because new polls show Harris gaining on former President Trump in four critical battleground states. And while there is no clear leader in these polls, President Biden was down in all of these states by at least five points just a few months ago. Harris and Walz will get back on that campaign bus in Southeastern Georgia ahead of their interview later this afternoon with CNN. The vice president will round out the day with a rally in Savannah. On the GOP side, former President Trump heads to Michigan and Wisconsin today to hammer his economic message, an issue where he is still enjoying a solid polling lead. Senator J.D. Vance will be in Boston to appeal to the firefighters union. We begin now in Southeastern Georgia, where Vice President Kamala Harris is on her campaign bus tour. CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is there. Priscilla, where is Harris headed today?",

She is, of course, hitting the southeast part of the state. It's a battleground state, but it's where she's going is those rural counties that typically lean Republican. And that has given us a window into the type of aggressive strategy that this campaign is trying to run in this state. Now, of course, the strategy here really boils down to peeling off those Republican votes from these Republican-leaning counties, and especially so when they know it's going to be such a tight race. You were mentioning those polls. Campaign officials I've talked to are keenly aware it's going to be a close race, that there is no leader in this battleground like others, but that if they can start the work of trying to peel away these Republican voters, that may help them and give them a path to victory in Georgia. Now, yesterday, she was visiting with high school students. She also met with voters in a barbecue joint alongside Tim Walz. There was also the Walz factor in all of this. How will he resonate with voters given his rural upbringing and his roots with football and his military background? So, a lot of open ended questions coming into this tour, but what is clear is that the campaign sees an opportunity here and is going to target those areas that really do lean Republican with hopes of taking some of those away.",

And up until this point, it's been a quite scripted and choreographed campaign that's helped them build momentum and enthusiasm, raking in about half a billion dollars into the campaign. But now come some of the harder, more challenging moments.And in this interview, they hope that her along with the vice presidential nominee can lay out the contrast with former President Donald Trump, go deeper into where she stands on policy.

Guys, thanks so much. I expect definitive answers. No hedging. No ambiguity, which is impossible in this moment, given what we're looking at right now.Maria, I want to start with you. The new polling, the extremely tight races across the Sun Belt, not just in those blue wall battleground states, in Georgia in particular, Joe Biden flipped it by just shy of 12,000 votes in 2020. The Democrats feel like that is in play right now with Harris and Walz down there.",

      "sentences": "You know, Brian, what I think is most interesting right now, look, there is understandable focus on a very different race in the Democratic side, a very different candidate, a very different campaign, a very different moment. And yet, if you look at all these numbers, the Trump team's pathways, and there are very many, to 270 electoral votes are pretty much static. They're the same as they've been, which means they have a lot of options right now.As you look at the campaign and what they've been doing over the course of the last several weeks, should they be changing anything? Does their strategy need to shift at all? BRYAN LANZA, FORMER DEPUTY COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR, TRUMP 2016 CAMPAIGN:  You know, first of all, thank you for having me. You're absolutely right. I think for the past two months, if you look at two months ago, President Trump was playing in these blue states. It was offense. The map has expanded a little bit, but we're still playing offense in blue states. I think Pennsylvania is going to be the state that matters the most. We all expect Georgia to fall back into place to what it normally does. You know, the San Francisco values towards this taking place in rural Georgia is just not going to sell. I mean, at the end of the day, when you drive through rural Georgia, you know, what the voters there, what the taxpayers see there is they see the inflation mobile. You know, Harris brought this inflation to their communities, wiped it out, extended their credit, causing them to lose their farms. That's what they see with this Harris tour through rural America and through these swing states. So, I think Georgia's going to fall back into place. But as long as we continue to play offense, it's going to be good. You have to remember, you know, Trump's support has stayed stagnant. That's where he needs to remain. And as policy gets rolled out, as Harris makes these policy announcements, these policy decisions, it's not going to be a game of addition for her. It's going to be a game of subtraction. Because as more and more people learn about her policies, the more and more she becomes less of this sort of inspirational figure, and the more and more she falls back into this partisan figure.",

The interview tonight, it has been 40-some odd days. Republicans have been very critical of the fact there hasn't been one yet. Democrats have said, guys, we had to stand up a campaign in 40 days. But this is an important moment, and there's going to be a ton of eyes on it. And it's unscripted, and we know Dana is pretty darn good at her job. What do you think the campaign wants out of this?",

This issue that she hasn't done interviews, they have nothing else to fall back on. She has been talking to the press, but more importantly, Phil, she's been talking to voters. And that is why you see the enthusiasm across the board, across this country, even in the polls. That's why Republicans are so concerned. Tonight is another opportunity for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz to show and to talk to and tell the American people about what they would do to lower their cost of living, about what they would do to expand access to health care, to lower prescription drugs the way that they have been doing, to help American families deal with crushing student debt, with which Republicans don't want to do, frankly. And so there's so much of a contrast that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz can show tonight. They will show how they wake up every single day focused on helping the American people. Contrast that with a 34 times convicted felon in Donald Trump, who only focuses on what he can get out of this for himself. He's never done anything in his life that doesn't have anything to do with what benefit he can get out of it. He's only in this to stay out of prison. And you can tell he can never stay on message. Bryan, I know is blue in the face talking about how Donald Trump should continue to talk about the economy and inflation and immigration, but he doesn't do that. He is on social media. He is reposting sexual slurs and, you know, horrific content. That's the contrast.",

They need a green light from the White House to be able to do that. And that's their goal here.So far, the Biden administration hasn't changed its position. In fact, U.S. weapons can only be used inside of Russia in a very small area north of Ukraine inside of Russia, and they have used those weapons to that effect. The Kursk offensive has been carried out effectively within that restriction from the U.S. But they say they need to be able to target military assets and high value targets deeper inside of Russia to change the course of the war.

So, now we're just going to do it live on television because I want to get your perspective on it. Obviously, the election, everything that's going on right now, looming large in U.S.-China relations. Today, Chinese President Xi Jinping met with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan in Beijing, very rare visit to Beijing for the president's top national security official. Now, it comes as both countries are trying to repair strained relations. How much will the outcome of the U.S. election impact the future of this bilateral relationship?",

We know that the Iranians would do anything to defeat Trump. We don't really understand where the Chinese are in this election. They have many reasons to dislike Donald Trump, particularly after he blamed them for COVID and much else, but they also think that he's susceptible to any kind of trade deal. They don't like Vice President Harris because it's the Biden administration that has put into effect the most effective export controls on China that we've ever seen, mostly on advanced semiconductors and the equipment to make them. But that's only been a piece of it.So, the interesting issue is, first of all, why did Xi Jinping decide he really wanted to see Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser? It's not a given thing that the president of China would see a visiting national security adviser. And second, is Xi, at this point, hoping to strike one last agreement, one last moment of reconciliation with President Biden at the one moment they might see each other at the G20 summit later this fall, or at this point, is he just riding it out to the election?",

You always thought, well, if I just call and work it out with the top guy, rarely a top woman, but with the top guy, we'll make this, you know, all happen.

We've seen other presidents who believe that it was all about them, but he really thinks it's all about them and all about the United States. And you know what, Phil?
