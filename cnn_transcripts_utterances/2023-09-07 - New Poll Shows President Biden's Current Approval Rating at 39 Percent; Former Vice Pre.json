In my view, even though Donald Trump's never been charged with insurrection, I think he did commit insurrection. Therefore, he's off the ballot and the American voters can't choose for or against him.That is anti-democratic, and that is also a made-up process. That's not in the Constitution. That's not in any law. Congress is at 150 years. They haven't passed the law. The problem with this whole provision is nobody's told us how it works. You can't make it up now and apply it three years in the past, because you know what? That would violate a different portion of the 14th Amendment due process. I'm not buying this argument.
