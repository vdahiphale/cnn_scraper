One is, of course, that former President Donald Trump supports extremist policies. We've been talking about that a lot.The other one is this idea that Donald Trump poses an existential threat to democracy. That should come as no surprise to anyone that has paid any attention to President Biden and his campaign recently. The idea that Trump is an existential threat to the country and its democratic institutions is one of the reasons, one of the core reasons that President Biden says that he ran back in '20 and it has been so central to his re-election message as well. And sources have said that the president is expected to point back to the January 6th insurrection as having been this seismic and watershed moment for the country and that Donald Trump is really the embodiment of that threat to the country. Now, it was interesting earlier today, the campaign released a short video on social media that strings together words from different people that have worked previously for Donald Trump, basically describing him as being unfit for the presidency. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We worked with him. We knew him. This man is unfit to be president. A second term would be more dangerous than a first.",

The references to Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un was really interesting because we have reported that there's a good chance that President Biden could reference the recent comments from Donald Trump that he would be a dictator on day one.It's just a good reminder that the Biden campaign would very much like to focus as much as they can on domestic issues, but on foreign policy too.

This is fresh off several days of intense prep at Camp David. President Biden now on the ground in Metro Atlanta.We want to discuss debate prep and more with Illinois governor, J. B. Pritzker. He's a member of the Biden Campaign National Advisory Board. Governor, it's great to be with you, and as we look at these live images of Air Force One, let's talk about expectations, because there's a new poll from The New York Times and it found more than half of voters polled expect President Biden is going to perform poorly tonight. Why do you think expectations are so low for the president's performance? GOV. J. B. PRITZKER (D-IL): Well, look, let's be clear. Donald Trump's been out there actively attacking for days and days, weeks, in fact, and I think people expect him to come in on the attack. I think that he also, you know, frankly, is, you know, in contrast to President Biden, Donald Trump has been, you know, showing himself out as if he is going to win the debate. So, you know, President Biden isn't a braggart. He's somebody who's, you know, who's genuinely humble and who cares about people, and you can feel his empathy when you talk to him, when you listen to him. And I think that people just think a debate is sort of an attack session, and so they don't expect the guy, the nice guy, the good guy, to win a debate.",

He proposed a bipartisan solution. And by the way, Republicans came to the table to work with Joe Biden, as has happened so many times during his term. And it was the Republicans listening to Donald Trump telling them, walk away, we can make this an issue in this campaign. We don't care about the negative impact on the American people. Let's just have an issue for 2024 and so the Republicans walked away. So this is the kind of person that Donald Trump is. This is the kind of policy that he would pursue.

I've had that experience myself in my reelection where your opponent is lying while you're trying to get your message out. I can say that Joe Biden should stick to policy. I think that's what the American people wants to - want to hear rather than try to reply to the lies that are being put forward.It's disconcerting, frankly, I think, as a voter to see somebody who wants to be president who's just consistently not telling the truth. A congenital liar is someone - and a narcissist, by the way, is someone who just can't bring themselves to talk about other people and what's best for them and rather just wants to be on the attack. So I think Joe Biden should try to ignore all of that and focus on the fact that he has made life better for so many Americans. We've passed numerous bipartisan bills that have resulted in the rebuilding of roads and bridges and airports and broadband all over the United States that were bringing factories, manufacturing, back to the United States. That didn't happen under Donald Trump. People are getting good-paying jobs in those businesses because Joe Biden is the one who worked across the aisle to get those things done.",

Joe Biden presents as somebody who's older.And I think that when - as Jamal pointed out, older voters like Joe Biden more and his numbers among older voters are increasing. Maybe they're insulted that people think older voters - older people can't handle the job. But those numbers are going up.

In the first few polls, people go, well, that can't be right there's something wrong with this poll.But after it shows up in 20, 30, a hundred polls, you have to say, okay, something is happening here. And even if those voters are inclined to vote for the liberal candidate and are maybe going to come home, it tells you that at least that they're not committed. They're not firmly committed and they're definitely not committed to turning out. And I think what I learned spending time with these younger voters is college students today were in middle school when Trump was elected. And they were in high school during 2020, the protests, the COVID shutdowns. They have no memory of a politics that wasn't like this. And a lot of them remember the Trump presidency as a better time in their lives. And they do not remember these, quote unquote, \"norms\" that we love to talk about that Trump violating. They didn't experience those. And so I think that is, the Biden campaign certainly feels like it's incumbent on them to try to paint a picture and remind people what it was like when Trump was president and before Trump was president because so many people don't remember that.",

Younger voters are getting a lot of their news from social media. This is one of the things when I was at the White House, we saw this very clearly, which is one of the reasons you see the President and then the Vice President starting to spend more time with TikTok creators and Instagram creators because that's how people are getting their information. So the kind of general news story might not be showing up in the news feed because of the algorithms, but the fees that are coming from some of these celebrities are showing up for young people. So this gets to the Obama - I'm sorry, I'm sorry, the Biden point about this debate tonight. They've got to find a way to get people to focus on Donald Trump, not just in the snippets of things they may be getting online, but in a bigger, broader, more holistic way that reminds them of how bad Donald Trump might have been in the past.",
