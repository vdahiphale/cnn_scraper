It is the first in person winter with since the pandemic began three long years ago. And I've got to say perhaps I've forgotten slightly, just how cold it can get here in the Swiss Alps in January. But I am glad to be back and I'm reminded too, of how crucial this conference can be in defrosting key dialogue. On so many of the important issues we need to talk about, call it the miracle of meeting today's main events in Davos include a strong show of solidarity for the people of Ukraine amid the unspeakable suffering, they've endured during the Russian invasion. We're delivering a powerful warning here to delegates earlier today saying, \"We are facing the collapse of the world as we know it\". The Ukraine war at the root of much of what we're discussing at Davos this year, of course, too from Europe's energy crisis the world's energy crisis to worsening food insecurity, and fears of a global recession that permeate many of the conversations on panels and of course, behind the scenes too. The theme is cooperation in a fragmented world and we have to overcome underlying tensions in sectors like trade and technology in order to tackle ethics potential crises like climate change. The head of the IMF warning here today to that fragmented trade, including protectionism could cost up to 7 percent of global GDP. We'll discuss all these critical issues coming up on the show today with a number of really important guests. Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger will be joining along with us to talk recession risks, semiconductor demand and the U.S. move of course to subsidize domestic chip production and Europe don't forget. Plus, recession fears in the corporate sector Robin Vince, the CEO of being why Mellon discusses the mood among executives during this time of slowing growth and rising interest rates. Also, some applause please actor and producer Idris Elba and his activist and conservationist wife Sabrina two of this year's recipients of the West crystal awards will join us. Later to discuss their work helping to alleviate food insecurity and with war and of course, worsening climate change all of us here at Davos, also keeping one eye across the action on global markets. U.S. stocks set to open lower on this holiday shortened trading week Europe softer too after a mostly lower Asian handover. The key data during the session, China reporting today that its economy grew 3 percent in 2022 a huge drop from the 8.4 percent the year before is COVID lockdowns weighed, and for the first time in more than 60 years, China's population declined last year. Just one more factor in the slower growth narrative here at Davos more coming up on China too in just a moment. But hey, second applause please. Larry Madowo joins us now.",

And I think if we're talking about cooperation in a fragmented world, the worlds second largest economy is very much a central player in this globe. And she talked about other countries are doing a lot more investment, especially in clean tech and China leading that and instead of trying to completely decoupled from China, for the EU, there has to be a level playing field. But China could teach the rest of the world a lot about in clean tech, such as solar panels and electric vehicles. And she also complained a little bit quibbled that China is attracting a lot of energy intensive companies by giving them subsidies, promising low labor costs, very lacks regulation.

So first lady there speaking because we can see so much of that on the ground here she was talking about that very powerful missile that hit this building. In fact, when you get out of your way, so you can actually see what that translates into, you can see that there is that gaping hole there now where that residential building used to stand. And again, what you're seeing there is the damage that was brought on the Ukrainian say, by one single missile that was designed to destroy aircraft carriers, with about 2000 pound warheads. So that's a lot of ordinance there and we've been seeing over the past couple of days, the carnage that was caused by that missile. The Ukrainians now say that the search and rescue operation has ended here on site to the death toll, as you mentioned, stands at around 44. There were four bodies that were pulled from the rubble earlier today, including the body of a child. So there are now four children that have been confirmed to have been killed. And the Ukrainians now packing up but some of the numbers that they've been giving us have been simply staggering. Considering that this was the work they say of just one missile, they said that they've cleared around 8500 tons of debris from here, just in the last 72 hours. They had a little bit of ceremony earlier to mark the end of the search and rescue operations where the rescuers themselves were honored. And they themselves then also paid respects to the many victims to the many folks who were killed here. And of course, also to the many people who were injured and who still remained in hospital. And one thing we have to point out as well, Julia is that there are still a lot of people who are also missing. So certainly that anger is very palpable in the grief, as well as we still now see people coming here with flowers, laying down flowers weeping and just simply still, you know, trying to come to terms with what transcended here? What happened here? Only three days ago, Julia.",

China has beenunder lockdown for a good two years, people did not move to or from China, we saw the impact of COVID on ports. So for all of those reasons, combined, we saw a decline in GDP, no surprise and now, this big call to open things up again. You know, some economists are actually very optimistic that a more open China now will help revive things, despite maybe what we have been hearing from the central government. Another thing though, I do want to touch on that was discussed earlier today was also the issue of China's aging population. People are choosing not to have children in China. Some families are getting married later that impacts fertility. And this all has an economic side to things because having a child in China right now is very expensive. So when you have a society that has been basically under lockdown, you have a population that is getting older, with no necessarily no next generation workforce in the pipeline for all of those reasons. There's reason why China wants to have people do commerce open up his border, so to speak, because the challenges are just that significant right now.",

We're expanding here with our German project, and our Israel and Ireland facilities, hey, I have huge business in China and we have positions in Vietnam, Malaysia, and China for manufacturing. And of course, you know, we're a U.S. company with the heart of our R&amp;D manufacturing there. We're a global company and we need to have global dialogue. And that's the right way to attack the biggest problems that we have, you know, whether it's climate change, whether it's energy issues, whether it's the globalization of the most critical resource to the future of the world, where the oil reserves are defined geopolitics for the last five decades, where the technology supply chains are and where semiconductors are built, is more important for the next five decades.
