Tom, what's going on?TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes, happy Friday. Good news, happy Friday. This is an extraordinary phenomenon that NASA scientists say they've never seen before. And, of course, everyone's very excited about this. What you're looking at right here is an artist's depiction of what's happening. To the left, the thing down there in the corner, that's this giant supermassive black hole that is blasting through space at an extraordinary speed. What you see on the far right, the little light space up there is sort of a coalescence of light that seems to be related to what you see in the middle, which is stars that are being created by the compression of gas in front of this black hole because it's moving so fast. And then as the gas comes around the backside and it's been heated, it forms stars. Normally, it would just gobble them all up. But it -- to put it in sort of simple physics terms, which will be completely incorrect, but I'll give you an idea. If you were taken a vacuum and run it over a really dirty carpet, it'll suck everything up. If you do it really fast, it'll suck some things up. It'll also just create chaos with everything else.

Distance to the moon is around a quarter million miles, so that's well above the speed limit.And the really interesting thing about this, they found it by accident, John. They were looking at images from the Hubble Space Telescope. And when they were looking at it, they noticed this little weird streak out in space there.
