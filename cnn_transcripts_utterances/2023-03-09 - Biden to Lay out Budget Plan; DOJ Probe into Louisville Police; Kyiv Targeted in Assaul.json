      "sentences": "Yes, Jim and Erica, we do expect the full details of this budget to come out in a matter of hours, but there are major components of this budget that we already know about. We know, for example, that the president is going to propose cutting the deficit down by some $3 trillion. This is in part notable because in recent weeks, remember, he has been talking about that figure being more like 2 trillion. So this is more aggressive than what we have heard him talk about recently. We also know that he wants those cuts to the deficit coming in part from taxing high earners and large corporations. He has said, though, that he doesn't want to put extra taxes on people learning less than $400,000.We are also talking about things like allowing Medicare to negotiate more on drug prices and that the savings for that would go directly back into the program. He also is going to focus on boosting federal fund for early education and child care, including making free preschool for all four-year-olds across the country and expanding tax credits for businesses that do provide child care for their workers. Now, these ideas are probably all going to sound pretty familiar if you have followed the president and some of the priorities that he has worked on over the last two years. And that really is exactly what a president's budget usually is. Make no mistake, this has no chance, really, of passing on Capitol Hill. It is not going to go anywhere on Capitol Hill, especially given that the House is now controlled by Republicans. But what we are seeing here is sort of a political blueprint that the president and Democrats are now going to use to try to set up some of those key political contrasts on some of the domestic priorities that we talked about, that they want to continue making heading into 2024 against House Republicans. Of course, we also have that battle that is looming between the president and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in the coming months on the issue of raising the debt ceiling. So, a lot more details that we do expect, again, in the coming hours, but a lot that we already know so far as well.",

You know, as MJ points out, there's a fair amount that we do know this morning. There will be some more details ahead. It's also interesting, while this budget is a little bit late, we should point out, a little bit later than was anticipated, Elana, when we look at this in terms of how this is setting up the fight for Congress with the president coming out with these very specific narratives, specifically when we're talking about entitlements, does that give Democrats the narrative at this point? ELANA SCHOR, DEPUTY MANAGING EDITOR FOR CONGRESS, \"POLITICO\": Well, they certainly hope it does, particularly with Donald Trump out there in the presidential primary slamming Nikki Haley, slamming any Republican who would consider touching entitlements. Democrats do see an advantage in terms of how this budget treats Social Security and Medicare. But, of course, Republicans would rather make this conversation about overall debt cutting and avoiding the types of tax increases that the president is floating.

I know we're talking a lot, as Heather correctly pointed out, about these factious conservatives in McCarthy's conference who are going to be insistent on these spending cuttings. But to me you're going to have to get like that handful eight to 11 Republicans in the Senate maybe to go along with some kind of deal to save the nation from hitting the debt limit deadline.And, frankly, we could see the debt limit deadline and the government spending deadline kind of fuse in the summer because, as Heather rightly pointed out, right, we kicked this can on the budget to May and we could easily see September featuring a last minute debt limit deadline fight, (INAUDIBLE) extraordinary measures to extend the deadline, and a funding fight. So, you know, to me I'm going to -- it's sort of a hot take here, but I think the middle is most important for both parties because it's the only way this gets solved in the end.",

People want something done. But how do you treat people with respect?Let's not forget here, in this, officers were videotaping themselves as they were abusing people, laughing about it.
