And while there, he will view firsthand the destruction caused by the massive wildfires that have killed at least 106 people. But first, today, a momentous occasion for the White House as President Biden takes a victory lap, celebrating the one-year anniversary of the $750 billion Inflation Reduction Act, president hoping to convince voters that the so-called Bidenomics is working for them. But it's been a hard sell. We're going to go CNN White House Correspondent Arlette Saenz. Arlette, what's the messaging strategy here from the White House?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jessica, White House is hoping to use this first anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act to not only celebrate that moment, but also to educate voters on the benefits of it. But it comes at a time when many Americans voters are either skeptical or simply unaware of some of the benefits of that historic Climate Tax and Health Care Legislation that Biden signed into law one year ago.Now, recent polling showed that 7 in 10 Americans had heard little or nothing at all about what exactly that piece of legislation entailed. And that is why you have seen the White House really engage in this sales pitch over the past few weeks. The president traveling the country to tout not just the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, but pieces of legislation like the Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act as well, as they are trying to show Americans that the steps that the president has taken are trying to -- starting to pay off a bit economically for them. But it does come at a time when the president's approval rating of handling of the economy sits around 37 percent. But the White House has seen some signs of some positive indicators, things like consumer sentiment are up, wages are increasing. You'll see right there, the inflation numbers, while they are significantly down from last year, they slightly did tick up in July. But this really presents one of the challenges for President Biden heading into this campaign. Kitchen table issues, the economy, are still top of mind for so many voters. And now, he has the task of trying to sell this to people as 2024 quickly approaches.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's very tough and part of it goes back to when they were initially trying to sell the Inflation Reduction Act. There was a worry that pumping $750 billion into the economy would make inflation even worse. And at that time, the White House and its economists said, \"No, no, this is going to be money that's spent over the course of ten years. So it's going to trickle into the economy. It's not going to rush in all at once.\"But, that fact alone means that a lot of Americans won't see the benefits of this immediately. They won't see it in their hometowns before it's time to go to the polls. And so, that's going to be a problem for the White House. I do hear from private sector executives that it has caused this boom in private investment, but sowing the seeds of that investment is very different from having the projects finished where voters can see them. And so, this is going to be a really long time coming.",

He said, \"One thing I know for sure is you can't pee on people's backs and convince them that it's raining. They are living whatever it is they are living and telling them something different than that generally doesn't work.\"Now, I will buttress that with some information from Bank of America that shows kind of some of the top lines, the good positive top lines from the Inflation Reduction Act. There are 270-plus clean energy projects announced, $132 billion in private investments, 86,000 jobs created. But Toluse, the fact what Kayla was just saying is true, like what people are living and seeing right in front of them here and now is what matters to people.",

You have new job creation, you have low jobless claims, all the numbers which show in sort of a normal environment that things are going well.But when you actually look at what people are experiencing, especially the fact that they have been experiencing inflation at a high rate over the past year plus, it does show that people are feeling something different from what the statistics are showing. And inflation is such a personal thing for families and such a personal thing that people see at the gas pump, at the grocery store, that even as the numbers come down, even as inflation is not as big of a problem as it was a year ago, people are still struggling to make ends meet. And as much as the Biden Administration wants to show that people are doing well and the economy is doing well under his watch, people are feeling a different experience than that. And it's hard for him to sell his bills as a result of that.",

Like naming, sort of branding the economy -- a year from now, will that be a good idea? I think at the end of the day, you own it regardless. The president cannot control all of the economy, cannot control gas prices, but they are blamed for it and they take credit for it. So, all of that is fair regardless of who is in office.But I do think that inflation is cooling. There's no doubt about it. But, gas prices now are ticking up a bit. All that matters is next summer, the economy next summer, what are voters going to see. But as you travel around there, people do not know the benefits of the Infrastructure Act or the Inflation Reduction Act.

And funnily enough, even people that don't explicitly support him, so someone who said that they were a Democrat, another person who said that they were a Trump supporter, him having some warm moments with them as well.He also campaigned in Cambridge, Iowa, about 45 minutes outside of Des Moines. This beautiful place surrounded by corn fields and he was reciting parts of his campaign ads to this largely conservative audience. And they parroted back lines from his ads to him. So that's how well that they know him here and have seen those television ads. He joked with them that the money is being well spent here, upwards of $5 million on ads. Listen, Senator Scott is a disciplined campaigner. You hear him talking to these conservatives in this state about backing the blue, a very pro-law enforcement message. We don't hear him so much talk about his criminal justice reform with this crowd. He also is reticent to go after Former President Trump directly or any of the other Republican hopefuls. We don't see him sort of getting in the mud here. Next week presents a huge opportunity for him on that debate stage because he will have the chance to introduce himself to more conservatives across the country.

That's one of his advantages. He has a lot of money in his campaign accounts, leftover from his race in the senate last year in South Carolina. And look, he is sunny side up. There's a sense of optimism that he projects. Any grievances towards President Biden, any grievances towards the Democrats, and he's talking about drawing distinctions. He also has the stage to himself.He is at the fair, he was going around yesterday with Senator Joni Ernst, very popular in Iowa. Of course, the governor, very popular in Iowa. Whenever I look at polls like that, I'm reminded of what Governor Reynolds told me just last week. She said, \"Look, it's very early. Do not trust polls now. Surprises happen in Iowa.\" And I think this is his opportunity to introduce himself. I'm not surprised he's not going negative on Former President Donald Trump.

I thought it was interesting that he did break with the governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, over the teaching of slavery in Florida schools.He used that as an opportunity to create a little bit of earned media, a little bit of tension there. But for the most part, he's had a positive message, talking about his own personal story, his family story in this country.
