I was pleased to see he reached a firm conclusion that no charges should be brought, against me, in this case. This was an exhaustive investigation going back more than 40 years, even into the 1970s, when I was still a new United States senator. And the Special Counsel acknowledged I cooperated completely. I did not throw up any roadblocks. I sought no delays. In fact, I was so determined to give the Special Counsel what he needed, I went forward with a five-hour in-person -- five-hour in- person interview, over two days, on October the 8th and 9th of last year, even though Israel had just been attacked, by Hamas, on the 7th, and I was very occupied. Was in the middle of handling an international crisis. I was especially pleased to see Special Counsel make clear, the stark distinction and difference between this case, and Mr. Trump's case. The Special Counsel wrote, and I quote, \"Several material distinctions between Mr. Trump's case and Mr. Biden's are clear,\" continuing to quote, \"Most notably,\" after given \"multiple chances to return classified documents\" to \"avoid prosecution, Mr. Trump allegedly did the opposite. According to the indictment, he not only refused to return the documents for many months... he also obstructed justice by enlisting others to destroy evidence and then to lie about it.\" \"In contrast,\" he went on to say \"Mr. Biden turned in classified documents to the National Archives and the Department of Justice, consented to the search of multiple locations including his\" home, \"sat for a voluntary interview and in other ways cooperated with the investigation.\" End of quote.

Very early, in the count, right now. But you see this 26 delegates at stake, tonight, in Nevada, Trump is expected to get all of them. So, he will add that to his thing. You mentioned Tuesday night. Let's just go back and look at it. There were no delegates at stake here. Donald Trump was not on the ballot. It was Nikki Haley versus none of the above, none of these candidates. She says it was meaningless. And it was, in terms of the math. In terms of that other thing, I was talking about, momentum, she hope to just see this fill in yellow, so she could say there are voters out there, who want me to be President of the United States. So this, no, it doesn't affect any delegate math. But it did not help. So again, if you come back to where we are now, one, two and three, if Donald Trump wins, the first three, wins the first three, then we go to South Carolina. And then what does Nikki Haley do from there? A flipside from 2020. Remember, Joe Biden lost the first three, and then he won South Carolina. Republican races are different. The times are different.
