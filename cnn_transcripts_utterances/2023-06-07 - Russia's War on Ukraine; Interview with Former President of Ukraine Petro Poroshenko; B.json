Both Ukraine and Russia continue blaming each other for destroying the dam. It has created yet another dangerous and deadly emergency in Ukraine. Rescue operations are continuing right now in the Kherson region.More than 15,000 people have been forced to evacuate their homes when Ukrainian-controlled portions of the region flooded. One Ukrainian officer told CNN exclusively, his troops witnessed Russian soldiers being swept up by rising waters on the eastern bank of the river. He said many Russian troops were killed or wounded in the chaos after the breach. Joining me now for some perspective on this and the very latest from Ukraine is the Former President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko. Mr. President, thank you for coming in. The images of the dam breach are startling. Thousands of people continue to be at risk as we speak. From your perspective, what does this particular disaster mean for the Ukrainian people and how does it impact the war effort?",

Ukraine live now with this catastrophe, and I just want to tell you that this is not only a manmade catastrophe. This is one man made catastrophe which was organized by Putin. And I see your words, Ukraine blame Russia. Russia blame Ukraine. No. The Russia is exactly like Nazi's Germany who blamed Poland for aggression.I just want to deliver you the message. Please, do not trust Putin and do not trust Russia. This is our soil. This is our people. This is our style of life. And everything which we're talking about starting from the animals which were killed in the Kakhovka Zoo and finishing with dozens of Ukrainians which is missed. [10:35:00] And with this situation, this is completely unacceptable. We are hit in the heart and this is the biggest manmade catastrophe in the 21st century. This is comparable with the Chernobyl Nuclear Power station catastrophe. And with that situation we -- everybody do our best now to support the people in Kherson region. We just want to -- we go organize the convoy humanitarian, send it to Kherson with a fresh, with a motor pump, with a generator, with the distillation for the water and we do it within a few hours and send it to Kherson. The same like we sent it to the armed forces of Ukraine to support the launch and counteroffensive operation. And behind me, this is the artillery truck which was bought by the -- my charity organization and with my own money and send it now to the south for the brigade which is now in the process for finishing preparation for the counteroffensive operation.

And that start to be possible because of the enormous assistance of our partners including the United States with the equipped armed personal carrier, with the tank coalition, with the air defense coalition.And I am absolutely confident that Ukrainian troops is prepared for the counteroffensive and nothing can stop us. Seriously, this is not the way how Ukraine plan to advance through the dam, on contrary. And we do not give Russia any tiny chance to know where they should wait Ukrainian troops, but we are ready.

President Poroshenko, thank you very much for coming on. You heard it here.Sara. SARA SIDNER, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  Yes. All right. A new study claims that a move to electric cars is not only good for the environment, it's also good for our health. The American Lung Association says that if everyone were to switch to zero emissions vehicles here in the United States, the nation would see nearly 90,000 fewer premature deaths by 2050. CNN's Bill Weir is joining us now. How did the American Lung Association actually come up with the 90,000 people number?",

That was the deal for the speaker to become the speaker of the house on January on the 15th bout. Recall as part of his efforts to actually get the gavel and run the chamber. He essentially had to cut a whole wide range of deals, ranging from spending cuts and how to run the chamber.
