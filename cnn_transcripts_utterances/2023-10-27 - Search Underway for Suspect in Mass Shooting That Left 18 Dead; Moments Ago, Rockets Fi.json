This is where police say 40-year-old Robert Card first began shooting Wednesday night before making his way minutes later over to your location, John, where that bar and grill is. But when you talk to folks in the area, but also when you look at their cell phones, which is where they've been getting a lot of these emergency alerts, the shelter-in-place order is going to continue today. Schools are going to continue to be closed, all out of an abundance of caution, but also to make sure law enforcement can do what they need to do. And when you drive around town, even just last night, especially last night, places you think would be packed and open on a Thursday night, restaurants, convenience stores, all closed or at the very least empty. So, people are taking the shelter and place orders very seriously. And we are at the beginning of what is going to be a long recovery process for this community.

The reality of it is, is that when you're talking about moving out into the woods, this manpower, can you get enough people into areas that you think this man might be?So, it's, they've got a real arduous task here, because the fact that, I mean, they're talking about he had a boat, maybe he did get that boat, maybe he was able to go to another location in the woods. I think somebody like this one, an expert that he was, when it came down to the military and so forth, that he kind of knew what he was going to do once he went in there and killed these folks. Because even if you look at the type of weapon he used and shooting those two, two, three rounds that really is round, that is very small, it can go through people just like a butter going through the knife and it's not a high recoil on it. So the bottom line is you could tell this man knew what he was doing. So, I'm saying from that, authorities have to know that he had a plan. He had a plan that after he went and did what he did, he was going to go somewhere and maybe hunker down.

So, it was near here. We could actually see there were about five rockets that came in from Gaza. Obviously, they come from the south to Tel Aviv. And there was at least either a rocket or part of a rocket that did break through. So, we could see -- I don't know if we have the video for you, but we could see some smoke not far away from that impact site. And, obviously, you don't have an Iron Dome in Gaza. It's very different there. You know, you've got hundreds of Israeli strikes a day. But, nonetheless, it is still the complete randomness that causes the broader fear. I was speaking with someone that I see here every day, and the apartment building next to them was hit by one of those rocket attacks from Al-Qassam Brigades that actually came through. So, the apartment building next door was hit. Everything shakes, glass breaks, children are terrified. And that is the reality of daily life.
