The former president and more than a dozen others have been accused of racketeering and conspiracy in an attempt to overthrow Joe Biden's 2020 victory in Georgia. CNN's Nick Valencia is outside of the Fulton County courthouse in Atlanta. And, Nick, the judge said the prosecutors made a -- quote -- \"fatal mistake\" here in these charges. What did he mean?",

They failed the required detail about what underlying crime these defendants were allegedly trying to solicit from public officials. These charges have to do with that infamous phone call that Trump madeto Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, where he said, \"Find more votes,\" as well as the fake electors scheme, that scheme by Trump and his allies to subvert the Electoral College and try to claim that he rightfully won the 2020 election here in Georgia, when he lost. The judge saying that these charges should not stick because basically the DA's office failed to include the appropriate details. And this is already, in the meantime, being celebrated by the defendants and defense attorneys, especially the defense attorney for the former president, Steve Sadow. This is what he's saying to us in part of a statement, saying -- quote -- \"The ruling is a correct application of the law, as the prosecution failed to make specific allegations of any alleged wrongdoing on those counts. The entire prosecution of President Trump is political, constitutes election interference, and should be dismissed.\" Now, this ruling, it comes with a caveat, though. The judge has left the door open for the DA to re-indict on these charges if they fill in those details. So this is far from over, but, in the meantime, as I mentioned, it is being celebrated. And we're hearing this as we wait for this consequential decision as to whether Fani Willis will remain as the prosecutor on this case. Just a short time ago, supervising producer Jason Morris ran into Scott McAfee on the steps of the courthouse here, and he did say that he's planning to stick to that timeline that he gave himself, so we should expect a decision by the end of the week -- Brianna.",

Remember, it wouldn't just be Fani Willis who would have to step aside if disqualified. The entire team would. A prosecuting council and Georgia would then step in and assign or figure out who would be the next team to actually prosecute. And that next team would not be beholden to the choices that the grand jury prior established. Also, the big question, I think is, the issue here, whether it is an actual conflict or the appearance of a conflict that will govern this judge's ruling. That was a very big issue at the end of the last hearing, whether an appearance of so-called impropriety was enough or an actual conflict, as provided by the evidence by those moving for her to be disqualified.

But you have got to -- as a prosecution team, you have got to give the requisite amount of notice in this. And, of course, this, the judge said, was not throwing out the entire indictment, that there could be an opportunity if they give more information. And what they said was, as written, these six counts contain all the essential elements of the crimes, but fail to allege sufficient detail regarding the nature of their commission and does not give enough information. And so, as you look at it right now, this does not mean he said the entire indictment is dismissed, but they're going to have to cross every T, dot every I, because the team of lawyers behind the over a dozen defendants are looking for any exit ramp out of this indictment, in addition to trying to undermine the credibility and put into question the ability of this prosecution team through the prior disqualification motion.

That was, of course, rejected, but the idea of still having this count does rely on the conspiracy, on the interaction between the other co- defendants. Now, you need not necessarily have the communication that was explicit between each and every defendant in a RICO action, but the idea of trying to prove that everyone was part of a common scheme or plan does require a level of evidentiary support that, if you can't provide in other details on the actual pleading,might be lacking in the facts. Now, we have a long way to go here, Brianna, before you're talking about a jury being impaneled, motion practice being concluded, and ultimately the presentation of evidence.

Also, small businesses use TikTok to create content, to promote their stores and other things with TikTok. So its impact on the American population is enormous. Now, when you talk about the security concerns specifically, security analysts and some members of Congress are concerned that, because TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, that the Chinese communist government could lean on the company to basically download software, Chinese malware, that they can use Chinese malware to put it on your phone when you download TikTok or download some content on TikTok that could steal your personal data from your phone.

You said in an interview in January that TikTok should be forced to sell to an American company. Isn't that what this bill does? Why did you vote against it? REP. RO KHANNA (D-CA):  No, it doesn't. I would support a bill like this. This is blatantly unconstitutional, and I don't think the courts would uphold it. And the reason is, if the sale didn't happen, it goes to a ban. The Supreme Court has said it has to be the least restrictive alternative when you look at a free speech, which 170 million Americans' free speech is at impact. And we could have said that there should have been financial penalties if there isn't a divestiture. We should have said that we need a strong data privacy bill.

But now investigators have this new question to ask:  Would this scheduled maintenance check the night of the blowout have caught that omission and would previous pressurization system warning lights in the cockpit have led to a check on the door plug? The NTSB has said those warnings were unrelated to the blowout, but it's something that the NTSB will no doubt dig into. They have the maintenance records on this plane, and they have really laid this out in a timeline in its preliminary report. This plane was delivered to a public hearing Alaska Airlines on Halloween 2023. On December 7, that is when pilots saw the first pressurization warning in the cockpit. And then the day before the incident and two days before the incident, these pressurization warnings cropped up again, followed by the door plug blowout on January 5 of this year. Alaska Airlines is disclosing this for the first time after the reporting by \"The New York Times.\" And in a statement, Alaska Airlines says: \"We remain confident in our maintenance and safety actions leading up to the incident. We look forward to continuing our participation in a robust investigation led by the NTSB to ensure something like this never happens again.\" This is only the start of what will be a huge probe by the NTSB. Just yesterday, it announced what it's called an investigative hearing. That will be held publicly in August. That means the NTSB can subpoena parties to testify. That could include officials from Boeing. Very rare, typically reserved for the biggest incidents in the public eye, the East Palestine rail disaster, the Miracle on the Hudson. No doubt a lot of interest in this, and amid all of this, there are a lot of new questions here about whether or not Boeing had this paperwork that needed to be submitted to the NTSB. The NTSB has wanted it. And now NTSB chair, Jennifer Homendy, just put Boeing on blast once again, saying that they should have submitted this paperwork and they needed to give it to them.
