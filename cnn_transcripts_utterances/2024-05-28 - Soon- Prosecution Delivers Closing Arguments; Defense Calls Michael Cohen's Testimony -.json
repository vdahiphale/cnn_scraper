So that's our kind of defense for it. It is surprising to see Tiffany Trump, who usually tries to stay away from this stuff there with her husband. But notably, as you said, no imagery, nothing from Jared and Ivanka. Now, this is not that surprising given the fact that Ivanka said, in 2022, right before Donald Trump announced that he will be running again, essentially, said that she was not going to be involved. She cited her children. She said that this was not something that she wanted to be a part of. And they have really stuck with that. Now behind the scenes, Jared Kushner has done some stuff with the Trump campaign. But I'm told that, one, she is really focusing on her children. And, two, she and Jared were really ostracized from their social life after she left the White House, something that matters them. Remember, they moved down to Florida. They don't really want to relive that at this point.",

I would argue this was the weakest moment for Todd Blanche today. This is where he's talking about the impact of the \"National Enquirer\" and what a bad story or good story might do for Donald Trump is it showed up in that paper. Here's what he says. \"The idea, even if there was something wrong with it, the idea that sophisticated if people like President Trump and David Pecker believed that positive stories in the \"National Enquirer\" could influence the 2016 election is preposterous.\" I mean, frankly, it's preposterous to think that just the idea that a \"National Enquirer\" story in and of itself is about how many people are picking up the \"National Enquirer.\" This is the age of the Internet.",

And I would -- would've said this is why, at each -- at each word or each sentence, why you have to say not guilty. But I do think that the Michael Cohen trashing was what they had to do, and I think they did that.

Whether he is able to carry the story, whether he's punctuating certain things that he wants to stick in their mind, and whether part of it is a very typical Trump aura defense of all things, which is to kind of flood the zone with information and try to make the things you want to stick, stick.",
