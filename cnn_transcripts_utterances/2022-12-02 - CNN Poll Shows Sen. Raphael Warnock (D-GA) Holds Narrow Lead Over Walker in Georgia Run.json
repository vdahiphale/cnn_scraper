It is extremely tight with just four days to go until voters have actually Election Day. We talked about the early voting numbers. But look at these new CNN numbers, because Georgia's incumbent Democratic senator, Raphael Warnock, who is trying to hold onto his seat there in Georgia, has a slim four point lead over the Republican challenger, Herschel Walker, within the margin of error, I should note. Former President Obama once again campaigning with Warnock, telling supporters he thinks it's critical they go and vote for Tuesday's runoff. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Some folks are asking, well, if Democrats already have control of the Senate, why does this matter? What's the difference between 50 and 51?

They are starting to let those voters in, so they can cast their ballots. More than a million Georgians already done that. And they anticipate today to be very busy, long lines likely across the state.You mentioned that CNN poll of likely voters where Raphael Warnock getting 52 percent, Herschel Walker, 48 percent. As you said, still within the margin of error but that is a slightly more comfortable lead than Warnock had over Walker in the general election. Of course, neither got 50 percent, and that's why we're here today for this runoff. But there were other aspects of that poll that were very interesting, including asking those likely voters if the candidate was well qualified. And remember, 48 percent of voters said that they would vote for Herschel Walker but only 27 percent said they considered him well qualified and 33 percent that he had good judgment. Now, in the run up to election day on Tuesday, and trying to get all of the voters out today on this final day of early voting, both campaigns have employed very different strategies. It appears Raphael Warnock, as you know, the incumbent Democrat, bringing in those heavy- hitting surrogates, like former President Obama, a very aggressive campaign schedule. Herschel Walker, a little bit more relaxed schedule. He was with Lindsey Graham last night trying to talk to his supporters, also talking about ad spending, Kaitlan, Don, Poppy, astronomical numbers, more than $77 million for this four-week runoff. But Democrats outspending Republicans 2 to 1 and, look, Raphael Warnock has outspent all the GOP spending combined just as a candidate.",

So, under House rules, if no candidate secures a majority of the vote on the first round, then the House just keeps voting until somebody does. The last time it went to multiple ballots was in 1923. And the anti- McCarthy group is hoping that if McCarthy can't get it on the first round, that he'll drop out and then they can rally around an alternative. Congressman Bob Good, a member of the Freedom Caucus, told us that there are quiet talks going on to recruit a candidate for that exact scenario. But Kevin McCarthy is signaling he's not going to go down that easily and that he's prepared to go through as many rounds voting as it takes. He also has its allies promising to keep voting for McCarthy on multiple rounds of voting. And so we could potentially see a very messy and chaotic process on the House floor, which is not what Republicans want heading into their new majority.

Until now, police have only released information about five of the roommates, three of the victims and two other roommates who were not harmed. A fourth victim, Ethan Chapin, did not live at the home. A spokesperson for the Moscow Police Department tells CNN investigators are aware of a sixth person who could have potentially lived at the residence. That person was not at the residence on the night of the murders. An employee with the property management company for the home tells CNN that six people are listed on the lease but they would not release the names. It remains unclear if that sixth person lived at the property at any point. We asked police if they have found the potential sixth roommate, questioned them and cleared them as a suspect. All they can tell us is that they continue to investigate anyone who potentially has information about this case. Kaylee Goncalves' mother tells CNN, quote, Kaylee never mentioned that they were looking for a sixth roommate. If there was a sixth person on that lease, I didn't know about it.

The Ukrainians are saying they want a complete withdrawal of all occupied territory by Russian forces, including the strategic Crimean Peninsula as well.And so at the moment, very little sign despite the words of President Biden that there's any prospect of peace talks, unfortunately, because that means the war will continue and it is getting increasingly bloody.

You didn't see an increase in what are known as externalizing symptoms. Those are rule-breaking, aggressiveness, violence, things like that. So, that was something.
