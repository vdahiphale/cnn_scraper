      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to the Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, worry and concern for 24-year-old NFL star Damar Hamlin, who collapsed on the field. The latest on his condition.The final goodbye for football icon Pele. His public wake is just finishing with his funeral happening later today. And a rare admission as Russia acknowledges dozens of its troops have been killed in an attack in Ukraine. But now one Russian blogger is suggesting the death toll may be even higher than Moscow claims. Prayers and well wishes are pouring in for Damar Hamlin, the American pro-football player collapsed on the field in the middle of Monday night's game. At last check, doctors listed the Buffalo Bills player in critical condition after he suffered cardiac arrest. Here you can see Hamlin making a hard tackle in the game against the Cincinnati Bengal. He stood up, then he collapsed. Medical personnel gave him CPR on the field, then he was rushed to hospital. The NFL suspended the game in light of the incident. You can see the impact on the other players there. CNN Sports Coy Wire joins us now with the very latest and used to play for this team. This hits hard for anyone involved in the sport.",

Really appreciate it.We're going to go to Brazil now, where the Santos Football Club says more than 150,000 people attended the 24-hour wake for the soccer legend Pele, including new Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who arrived last hour to pay his respects at the stadium where Pele played with his former football club, Santos. Now, the wake ended just moments ago. Now a funeral possession is set to get underway. It'll pass through the streets of Santos City, even driving past the neighborhood where his 100-year-old mother still lives. Family members will then hold a private funeral ceremony. Julia Vargas joins us live from Santos, Brazil. Poignant moment, because this is the end of the very public part of this final farewell.",

We just had a drum line pass right behind my live shot here, because right behind me, there is a fire truck that's going to serve as the horse that would carry Pele through that procession you mentioned through the streets of Santos.But this is the true Brazilian spirit, right? It's a celebration. We're talking about a man who meant so much for so many here. It's a moment to celebrate his legacy. I'm sure this is what he would have wanted. As someone who was used to that kind of energy from playing in the pitch and being surrounded by fans, this is what the standoff that he deserves truly. 150,000 people have come through here. I just spoke to the Santos FC people here at the gates, they just closed. Thousands were turned away. The lines were going more than 2 kilometers around various blocks here in Santos. And people are just lining up the streets now. You can't get out of here because they just want to catch a glimpse, they just want to participate in this historical moment before Pele goes on to his final resting place. By the way, the tallest cemetery in the world. That's where he will be laid to rest. In the 9th floor mausoleum, overlooking the stadium where he built his legacy, where he became the famous, the goat, right? The greatest of all time. That is going to be. It's so significant for this town. And it might even become the hope, his family hopes, a point of -- to attract to tourism, to get people to come and visit Pele's resting place, overlooking Santos FC stadium. Like you said, the family will then hold a private memorial service, the funeral, and I believe this is -- this might be happening right now behind me. The casket is going to be raised from the pitch into this fire truck and then it's going to pass right behind me here and go through the canals. Santos has various system of canals. They're going to go alongside these canals and turnaround the beach and then turn back and pass right in front of his mother's house. You mentioned she is still with us at 100 years old. After that, he will be taken to the cemetery. All of this is quite close. It might happen solely, but it will be in the next few minutes that we will see Pele's casket get onto the fire truck and be moved through the streets of the town that loves him so much.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, the estimates given by both sides in this case, Max, are really miles apart. What we know, and what there doesn't seem to be any dispute about is the fact that on Sunday, just after midnight, there was a large concentration of Russian troops, equipment, weaponry, at a vocational school in Makiivka, which is in the Donetsk region.How many Russian troops were there? Precisely how many were killed, that is what is still very unclear at this stage of the game. As you said, the Ukrainians initially said 400 killed, 300 wounded. The Russians said just 63. But in reality, that number is likely much, much higher. And there is even starting to be some Russian officials, pro- Russian bloggers that are conceding as much. One of the most prominent is a guy named Semyon Pegov. This is a guy who was given an award for courage by President Putin himself just a few weeks ago, just before Christmas time. And he says that, look, to the extent that you can trust our own sources, they are still digging through the rubble. Another blogger says that, look, the true number may be more than 100. And even the former defense chief of the occupied Donetsk region said something similar. That look, the 63 number is probably not the final number because there are still soldiers who are missing, soldiers who are unaccounted for, soldiers who haven't been added to that official death toll. And as a result of all of these, there is criticism within Russia to people who normally wouldn't be having a lot of criticism for the Russian military. One pro-Russian blogger said that, look, the Russian command had been sloppy. Another said that even more than 10 months into the war, incompetence continues to be a big problem within the Russian ranks. And how on earth you could have so many Russian troops concentrated in such a small area, dispersing troops along the front lines, especially when they're quartered, when they're in their bunks, sleeping. That should be pretty elementary. That should be pretty basic by this stage of the game. And -- so one Russian lawmaker says that, look, there ought to be criminal liability for all of this. Not for the Ukrainians, but for the Russian military and intelligence leaders who really failed on this one and who allowed this to happen and allowed these troops to really be sitting ducks.",

      "sentences": "Just how critical are Damar Hamlin's injuries? That's the question on so many people's minds right now as he lies in hospital. We have to warn you that the video of the incident is disturbing, but let me take you through it.So Hamlin made a tackle. He appeared to be fine, getting up and then, of course, collapsing, which is the really hard bit to watch. He remained on the field for several minutes as CPR was administered. It was key that CPR was administered so quickly. These are the other key timings. 8:55, the injury occurred. 9:00, the ambulance arrived. 9:18, the game was suspended. 9:25, the ambulance actually leaves the stadium with him on the way to the hospital. At 10:01, the game was finally postponed. Let's bring in CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, because it is difficult to watch. But from a medical perspective, what do you see when you look at that video? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know, you laid it out pretty well there, Max. I mean, he was obviously in the middle of this play. Seems to take a blow to the chest, it appears on that play from the opposing player's shoulder. Shoulder pad, perhaps. Stands up for a few seconds, which is critically important because I think, you know, you always wonder, is there an injury to the spinal cord, to the brain? The fact that he stands up was an important clue there. And then a few seconds later, he then falls to the ground. That significantly suggested cardiac arrest at the time that his heart either stopped beating or stopped beating efficiently. His heart went into an abnormal rhythm. That's what people thought overnight, and that was confirmed this morning. The Buffalo Bills confirming that in a statement. Also saying that he was able to have his heart restarted there on the field, which was really important as well. A lot we couldn't see, Max, you know, in that video. There was players, obviously, surrounding him. We were told that he underwent CPR, but the critical component is CPR is to basically move oxygenated blood through the body. You're doing this manually with your hands. Restarting the heart is the key, and the quicker you can do that, the better the outcome, the better the prognosis. And again, that's what we learned here just a short time ago that, in fact, that was able to be done before he left the field. So, we don't know much more than that at this point. But that seems to be how the sequence of events unfolded there. FOSTER: A lots of people talking, of course, about the violence of the game and whether we should be concerned about that. Is that a legitimate concern, or is this just a freak accident?",

      "sentences": "That was critically important. And again, we didn't have all those details last night. We couldn't see much. But, yes, when you start to look at someone who's in this abnormal heart rhythm, which basically means the chambers of the heart, instead of pumping blood efficiently, are sort of quivering like this, fibrillating like this.Every minute that passes, the risk of death, the risk of mortality, goes up by about 10 percent per minute. So speed is absolutely the key there. And some people may have been wondering why was he on the field for so long? Why did it take as much time to get him into the ambulance? The key is to do as much as you can there in the moment. And you have tremendous medical resources there on the field, including defibrillators, which are present in all large venues. Obviously, the ambulance would have one as well. But I think it's also a reminder for everyone to learn CPR. I mean, anyone can learn CPR, which basically allows anyone to pump that oxidated blood through the heart, through the heart and into the body. You do that until you can restart the heart, and that's something anybody can do. So those two things, the CPR as well as defibrillation are very key. And the quicker they are performed, the better the chances are the outcome.",

So far, five Republicans have publicly said they'd vote against him, nine more pending a letter warning his attempts to win them over, have been too little, too late. Still, allies say McCarthy isn't going to bow out of the race. WARREN DAVIDSON, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: He's worked very hard to get the votes. He's worked very hard to earn the job as speaker. And we'll see whether this is placated the people that put out a list of demands. He's gone really right up to the line. He's conceded on virtually everything that was on that two-page document. FOX (voice-over): McCarthy is determined to win, even if that means multiple rounds of balloting on the House floor, something that hasn't happened for a century. Behind the scenes, McCarthy's still scrambling for support, making key concessions to conservatives. One of them, a rules change that would weaken the power of the very job he's vying for and lower the threshold it takes to call for a vote to oust the speaker from a majority to just five members. BOB GOOD, U.S. HOUSE REPUBLICAN: And there's nothing he's done to earn my vote. I suspect 10 to 15 members will vote against him on the first ballot. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
