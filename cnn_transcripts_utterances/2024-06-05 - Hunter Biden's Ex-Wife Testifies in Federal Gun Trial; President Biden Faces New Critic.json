Now, his ex-wife was only on the stand briefly. She talked about the first time that she found a crack pipe in their family home back in 2015. She also talked about how she would search his car for any drugs or drug paraphernalia before their children would use it. But on cross- examination, she also said, look, she wasn't sure what he was doing with his life in 2018. By that point, they were divorced.And, of course, 2018, that's the year that he bought this firearm at the center of this case. Abby Lowell, the defense attorney, also got her to concede that she never actually saw Hunter Biden using drugs. She was only on the stand for a short period of time. And then after her was a young woman that Hunter Biden met in late 2017 at a gentleman's club and then subsequently spent long spans of time with at various hotels on the East and West Coast. And she testified how often she would see him smoking crack. She said he was doing that about every 20 minutes. Now, her testimony is not done. She's still being questioned by prosecutors. But Boris, she was a very compelling witness, very articulate, clearly had a lot of warm feelings for Hunter Biden. Talked about how charismatic he was, how much people liked him and how his demeanor did not change even after he smoked crack. So she will continue her appearance on the stand. Unclear how long she's going to go, but definitely some captivating witnesses for the jury.",

Back at home, the White House has a new fight on its hands, pushing back on a story just published in the Wall Street Journal. The title of this piece says it all, quote, behind closed doors, Biden shows signs of slipping. Polls have shown that at 81 years old, the president's age has been a persistent concern with voters anxious about having the oldest president in U.S. history serve another four years. The journal says the article is based on interviews with more than 45 people, both Republicans, and Democrats, over several months.

Now, in 2024, House Republicans are making false claims as a political tactic that flatly contradict previous statements made by themselves and their colleagues.

And when we talked to administration officials, frequently there was not a difference over what was happening. There was a difference in cast. If Biden had a loose command of detail, well, that was because the principal is supposed to be above the fray. He's not supposed to be engaged. If in the January 17th meeting, the president, for example, is standing back, letting lawmakers do the talking, well, that's just because that's an appropriate way to run a meeting to give somebody else a chance to have their say.
