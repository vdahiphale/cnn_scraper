      "sentences": "Good morning. You are live in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Right now in Delaware, Hunter Biden's fate is in the hands of a jury. The president's son arrived in court this morning as jurors resumed deliberations in his federal gun trial. And just about a half hour later, he left the courthouse in Wilmington. Hunter Biden is accused of lying about his illegal drug use when he bought a handgun back in 2018. If convicted of all three charges, he could face 25 years in prison. CNN's Evan Perez joins us from outside the courthouse in Delaware. Evan, was it expected that Hunter Biden would only make a short visit there as the jury deliberates? What's the latest?",

      "sentences": "No, Jim. I think we didn't anticipate that he would be able to leave during the time that the jury is deliberating. Typically, defendants have to sit here, like the rest of us, as we wait for the jury to complete its work. But, look, I'm not every defendant has a secret service detail on a whole security operation in order to get him and out of -- inside and outside of the courtroom.And, you know, we know that the Biden family has a little base of operations at a hotel nearby. We expect that once they know there's a jury, of course, Hunter Biden will come back. Perhaps the first lady will also be here. She's been here supporting him throughout this entire trial. And, look, the jury has now been inside for just -- they've been deliberating for just over two hours. They did a little bit yesterday and then they've been back today. And the last thing they heard was obviously the closings from both sides. Prosecutors had some really tough words to push back on the prosecution, which is really -- doesn't have a lot to work with, right? There's overwhelming evidence that Hunter Biden bought this firearm in October of 2018. We know from all the text messages, from videos, from photos that they've shown in court and from his own words, in his own, in his own memoir, that he was using, crack cocaine around the time of this incident. So, what Abbe Lowell, his defense attorney, focused on was that the prosecution didn't have direct evidence that Hunter Biden was using drugs in October of 2018, and that he said to the jurors, was reason for there to be reasonable doubt that he knew he was lying on that form when he filled it out to get the background check and buy that firearm. In response to that, we heard from Derek Hines, one of the prosecutors, who said, look, there's no doubt that anyone who puts a crack pipe to their mouth every 15 minutes knows he's an addict. And so he pushed back on some of the accusations from the defense. And that's sort of the last thing that the jurors heard before they retired to the jury room to start the deliberations, Jim.",

Joining me now, CNN Political Commentator, Republican Strategist Shermichael Singleton and CNN Legal Commentator and a former attorney for Donald Trump, Tim Parlatore, and CNN Special Correspondent Jamie Gangel. Tim, let me start with you first. I mean, obviously we can't predict what the jury is going to do here. But what do you think? Do you think the prosecution has made the case or might there be a chance here that Hunter Biden might be acquitted?",

And I read through the jury instructions specifically on the issue of addiction and use. And they do have to show that it's during the time period that he owned the gun.And a lot of what they had was before it was after. And they didn't really target in on the specific time period until the rebuttal case, which, you know, you would have hoped they would have done in their case in chief. But once you got those text messages from the day of the purchase, I think that that really strengthened the prosecutor's case.",

I will say, to be transparent, I own a firearms company.I want to be transparent for our audience, so this is an arena I spend a lot of time in. And the Bruen vs. New York case really does change the dynamic, I would argue, Tim, in favor of Hunter Biden. Even if he's found guilty, I would argue he would be successful on appeal because the Fifth Circuit last year stated that you cannot ban someone who may use an illegal substance from being able to possess a firearm. I think that certainly benefits the Second Amendment, absolutely. So, what's fascinating about this dichotomy, Jim, is that conservatives who may despise President Biden may look to Hunter Biden who may bring this all the way up to the Supreme Court to have further changes to the Second Amendment that a lot of two-way advocates have been advocating for, for two or three decades now.",

Do we hear it in his own words when they play the audio recording of his book? Absolutely. Is there this vague period of time when he buys the gun that maybe casts a little doubt on it? Yes.

If this were not Hunter Biden, if it were not for the document or the laptop, there would be no clue if he would have utilized drugs or not. So, he would have been able to lawfully hold that gun without anyone knowing.So, this is a bogus case to me. I have my differences with his father, but in terms of being a firearms owner and someone who owns a firearms company, you don't want individuals who may have an addiction problem to not be able to defend themselves, particularly when it's the son of a president who knows how many threats he's getting on a daily basis.",

It comes just after the secretary of state met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu just last night in Israel. And the secretary told us, traveling with him, we're now in Jordan, but we were in Israel this morning, he said that the prime minister, very clearly to him, said that he would be on board for this proposal if Hamas agrees to it, indicating that there is an ironclad commitment on behalf of Israel to push forward a ceasefire, a hostage release deal and then, of course, move towards what could potentially be a more permanent, lasting ceasefire. But the questions there over permanent ceasefire or a specific amount of time for a ceasefire still remain. But we should also note, Jim, that this comes as the secretary of state has been pushing all parties in the region to try and continue putting pressure on Hamas to accept the deal on the table that the Israelis put forth for them. And he also came out this morning speaking with reporters partially in response to The Wall Street Journal's new reporting today on messages that the political -- excuse me, the military leader of Hamas, who is believed to be somewhere hiding in the tunnels underneath Gaza, has been sending to the political folks of Hamas in Doha. And these are incredibly detailed messages indicating that Sinwar, Yahya Sinwar, who's that military leader, believes that the Hamas has an edge up on Israel right now. And what the secretary of state says is it's very clear to the United States that when it comes to decision-making on behalf of Hamas, it is Sinwar who's going to be making those decisions.

JAMES SPIDER MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, I think, as Kim indicated, this is great news, if there could be some exchange of some of the hostages and start making progress in that regard. The challenge truly is if it is a phased withdrawal, and there is a period, an interregnum between here's the start and here's the next phase, and what are the conditions that must be met, the IDF is going to continue to conduct operations during that period, even if there is an initial return of some of those hostages. Look, in their mind, the job is not done. There is still infrastructure that needs to be reduced. There are still key personnel that need to be killed or captured. And we saw the raid that took place just three or four days ago. I mean, this was an incredibly precise operation, but it turned into a massive gunfight, which means Hamas has immense capacity not only to engage but also to sacrifice greatly. So, you could see where the IDF might say, or Israel might say, yes, we're good with this ceasefire, but there's a period where we want to be able to conduct operations and we will conduct operations until certain conditions are met. And if there is a period of time, then within that period of time, the IDF will be very busy marching through a target list before they'll depart.",
