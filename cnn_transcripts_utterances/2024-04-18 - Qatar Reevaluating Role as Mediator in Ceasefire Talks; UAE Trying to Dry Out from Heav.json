The Israel Defense Forces say eight WFP trucks carrying flour were inspected at Ashdod entered via the Kerem Shalom crossing now.

Kaag is on her fourth trip to the enclave and if you listen carefully during what is this exclusive interview, you can hear the buzzing of drones and that is because she is in Rafah, a city in Southern Gaza bracing itself for Israel's long threatened incursion.

And now they're also talking about sanctions as sort of targeted sanctions they need to focus on with regard to Iran. But at the end of the day, one of the biggest conversations we've had today, certainly in Capri is what about Ukraine, you know, this has become sort of the forgotten war. And one that's so very important, especially here in Europe, the Secretary of State, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister who was an invited guest there. And he had a couple of words to say at the end of that meeting, let's listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: But in this moment, it is urgent that all of the friends and supporters of Ukraine maximize their efforts to provide with Ukraine with what it needs to continue to effectively defend itself against the Russian aggression.

And then here next to me, you've got recovery efforts, these pumps have been put in place that eventually divert the water to the sea as well as to the desert and into drains. Now in terms of what we're seeing at the airport I spoke to the CEO of DXB Dubai International Airport Paul Griffiths a short time ago, and he said this. He said logistics are incredibly intense and getting aircraft into position for takeoff has of course been one of the biggest issues and then you had over 1000 flights that canceled and if you take the numbers into consideration around 300 people in one aircraft 1000 flights canceled. We're talking about hundreds and thousands of people that were left stranded not only at the airport, but also people trying to get out of Dubai. Now in terms of the slow recovery process that Paul Griffiths was telling me about. He's saying over the next 24 hours, they will be returned to normal operations. It is a slow recovery. It is a huge effort. Part of the problem is getting people to the airport. You know moving through floodwaters like this, we were on this road at this spot yesterday -- it was touch and go. The water level was so much higher and incredibly dangerous. The water levels have receded. As you can see it's a sunny day. This is the weather that we used to and definitely not the record rainfall that we saw on Tuesday that brought Dubai to a standstill and horrific images of cars submerged underwater. And in this specific road, people that we spoke to were stuck for eight hours on Tuesday. So things are clearing up, cars on the road, people trying to get to the destination.",

Now we're saying they're going to back him. This just shows the plus side of Trump's strength and sway over the Republican Party. I think I'm analyzing this and projecting that the Biden team has got to be disappointed that these Republicans at the least won't choose to remain silent or tried to just take an invisible stand.

Five more and as many as six alternates are still needed. The judge has said at this pace opening statements could start Monday though that might be optimistic. We will see. CNN's U.S. National Correspondent Brynn Gingras is also outside court here in Manhattan. Alright Brynn, so walk us through what happens next now the court is in session. BRYNN GINGRAS, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yeah Omar, well you know, we're getting real time updates from our colleagues inside the courtroom. As you said, court is now in session. And what we're learning from our colleagues is there's actually one impaneled juror who has now expressed some concern about being fair and impartial and is having those discussions now with the judge. So we'll see as this kind of continues, will we now have six jurors? And will she be dismissed? So we'll have to wait and find that out. But as of now, you said it, there are seven impanel jurors on this jury four men three women and so they are looking and trying to get down seven more and as many as six other alternates. So it's going to be the same process that we saw happen on Monday and Tuesday, 96 already sworn in prospective jurors are going to come into the courtroom, and the judge is going to flat out ask can you be fair and impartial. And that number is going to be whittled down. Remember, on Monday, it was more than half of the people are about 50 -- more than 50 rather, people said that they couldn't and they were immediately dismissed. So we'll see what those numbers look like from 96 to what? Well after that, and then it gets to those 42 questions that are going to be answered by each person from the judge. You know, where do they get their news? Have they been to a Trump rally? What are their opinions about the former president? And then again, that numbers going to go down. And from there, that's when both have defense and the prosecution can ask those more pointed questions. They have 30 minutes to ask a group of those prospective jurors. And we saw from Tuesday the questions really were talking about -- you know are from the prosecution, are they able to follow the judge's instructions? Do they have any strong opinions about the fact that there is a tabloid publisher of adult film star a former attorney who's admitted to federal crimes? Can they -- you know be impartial about those people being witnesses? And from the defense, we saw them really scrub through people's social media trying to see their opinions about the former president, who was the defendant in this case, of course. So it's another busy day inside that courtroom. And again, the latest update that we are getting is trying to see if now this seventh person wants to stay on the jury and what the judge will say about that. So we'll keep you posted Omar.",
