And the latest from Haiti, my conversation with Sean Penn about what his relief organization CORE is facing on the ground there as gangs remain in control of much of the capital. Good evening. We begin tonight with the breaking news on the former president. It happened just hours after he walked into the federal courtroom with the judge he himself appointed, Aileen Cannon. Sitting opposite her, he watched as his attorneys argued the Jack Smith's classified documents case should be dismissed. The lawyers defended two of their nine motions to dismiss today, including the one arguing that the Presidential Records Act allowed him to designate the classified documents he took as personal, even though his own words suggest he knew otherwise.

Judge Aileen Cannon, she didn't buy it. She made that clear in court. And then shortly after the hearing, she issued her order and said, I'm not going to dismiss the case on this argument that you made today.She said that this could be something that could come up where Trump may want to argue this to a jury or that they could discuss a little bit closer to trial, heading into that trial, setting the parameters for how the trial will go, the presentation to the jury. But that's how that particular argument went. There was another argument today as well, it didn't go that great either for the former president. Judge Aileen Cannon was quite skeptical about arguments his team was making that these presidential records were personal because Trump said so, because he wanted to take them from the White House and keep them at Mar-a-Lago after the presidency. Judge Cannon made pretty clear that she wasn't really on board with that argument and seemed to articulate herself in the same view as the federal government, the Justice Department in this, saying that presidential records are presidential records. Not everything can be a personal record just because someone says so, but she hasn't ruled on that particularly yet.",

Even some of the members of Jack Smith's team, and Jack Smith was in the courtroom today, they react too when people stand up and make different points before the judge.Now the thing about Judge Cannon, though, is she's very hard to read and she doesn't often tip her hand.

Now in May, you see the classified documents trial is there. Look, that's just in pencil. We were in court two weeks ago where the Judge, Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, she heard arguments about when she could push that back. Based on what we heard while I was down in Florida, Anderson, I think she would probably put that on August at the earliest. Now, you also have the Georgia case that Fani Willis said she wanted to bring in August. Currently, there is, of course, an open question of whether she will still oversee that case.

This theory that there's a problem with our paper, so it was a solution in search of a problem because we've never had a problem with our ballot paper. There are all kinds of safeguards and on top of other safeguards to make sure that the wrong ballot paper doesn't cause any problems.

Its co-founder is actor Sean Penn, who's been working in Haiti since the earthquake in 2010. They do work in the capital, Port-au-Prince, as well as other locations throughout the country. Sean Penn joins me now. Sean, what's the situation for your team on the ground in Haiti? SEAN PENN, CO-FOUNDER OF CORE: Well, since, you know, it got increasingly worse following the assassination of President Moise and the gang violence really rose up and the gangs that, as you know, had long themselves been exploited the opportunity to kind of carry this for themselves rather than being the arm of others. And then the coalition that was put together by Barbecue, the gang leader. And it got to the point where most of our work in Port-au- Prince was having to beat up. People were working essentially from home. It was -- the threat level was that high. In the South, in particular, and in some of the rural areas, we were able to continue pretty much as normal.",

And some of the people, people who, you know, certainly oppose the gangs, are giving credit now to the fact that it was the gangs that were able to do this thing that so many wanted to have done.
