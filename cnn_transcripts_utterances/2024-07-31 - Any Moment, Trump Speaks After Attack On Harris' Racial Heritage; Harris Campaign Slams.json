Plus, Iran is vowing revenge against Israel after an airstrike in Tehran killed the political leader of Hamas. CNN is live in the region as fears of a wider war are growing and hopes for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal may be fading. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer is off today. I'm Pamela Brown and you're in The Situation Room.

Michael Tyler, the campaign's communications director, said in a statement, quote, Trump lobbed personal attacks and insults at black journalists the same way he did throughout his presidency while he failed black families and left the entire country digging out of the ditch he left us in. He added, Donald Trump has already proven he cannot unite America, so he attempts to divide us. Now, this statement did not explicitly reference Trump's comments questioning Harris identity as a black woman. Instead, so far, the pushback has fallen to Harris' allies. White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked to about Trump's comments in real time today in the White House press briefing. Here is how she responded to those comments from Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: As a person of color, as a black woman who is in this position that is standing before you at this podium behind this lectern, what he just said, what you just read out to me is repulsive, it's insulting, and no one has any right to tell someone who they are, how they identify.

She's working to protect a woman's right to make her own health care choices. She's protecting our freedom to learn and the freedom for black-owned businesses to thrive.

This trial, everything that could go wrong with this trial did go wrong. KSM was waterboarded 183 times. He was subjected to various other forms of coercive interrogation. That greatly clouded the case against him. The fact that we were still in pre-trial hearings more than two decades after he was captured I think speaks for itself.So, this plea deal is probably the least bad thing that -- you know, the least bad case for the prosecution. Some of the families, I'm sure, wanted the death penalty. But at the end of the day, plea deals happen and the side, KSM's side, I think they were very concerned about being put in super max, which is like being buried alive in Florence, Colorado. In fact, KSM's nephew, Ramzi Youssef, who bombed the Trade Center in '93, is there. And we still don't -- as Oren said, we don't know the details of what the life sentence incarceration will be, but it seems from New York Times reporting that they are very keen not to have solitary confinement. This is the photograph of KSM when he was arrested. The CIA released it. It was a very unflattering picture, intentionally so. But that was back in 2003 in Pakistan. So, it's been a very long time coming. Hopefully, this will provide some measure of justice to the families and the victims.",

He's responsible for the death of nearly 3,000 people. That's what he's charged with.Now, from the prosecutor's perspective, the benefit of a deal like this, number one, is you get certainty. You lock in a conviction. You ensure that KSM, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and the two other individuals here will spend the rest of their life behind bars. You spare yourself the need, the resources, perhaps the uncertainty of a trial. But there's also risk and downside involved. On the one hand, is it true justice to allow somebody who was responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans to avoid the death penalty himself? And, second of all, I anticipate that the victims here, the surviving family members of the people who were killed, I imagine, there's going to be some resistance, some rejection, some pushback on this. Ultimately, though, it is the prosecutor's call and the prosecutor will have to face judgment from the families for this decision.",

I got a shout out Rachel Scott at ABC News who held her own and asked the tough questions, which is why there were so many black journalists frustrated with the decision for him to come because of his disrespect for a lot of black journalists, including the one on this network, Abby Phillip, right?

There's also we have better diagnostic tools today to diagnose cancer as compared with previous generations.But what really stood out to me in this study, Pamela, 10 out of those 17 cancers are obesity-related. And that could be a sign of how the obesity epidemic may be playing a role here as well. And what the researchers did, they looked at 34 different types of cancer from people born in the 1920s all the way through people born in 1990. And that's where they identified 17 cancers that appear to be more common among Gen-Xers and millennials, among those younger generations. The cancer risks: small intestine, kidney and pancreatic cancers, as well as liver cancer in women, those incidents rates for those cancers were like two to three times higher among people born in 1990 compared with people born in 1955. So the takeaway here, researchers say is for doctors to be aware of this, and for Gen-Xers and millennials to be aware of cancer risk factors, cancer symptoms, and to do better at just eating healthy, limiting alcohol and not smoking, Pamela.",
