And really, this is a very important moment, really a flashpoint of sorts in their relationship. It came just days after Donald Trump had issued that threat to impose massive tariffs on both Canada as well as Mexico if the countries did not do enough to crack down on drugs and migrants coming over both the northern and southern borders, respectively.Now, we actually did hear Justin Trudeau address that threat Friday morning, hours before he flew to Florida to meet with Donald Trump. And he said that if Donald Trump were to carry out that threat, that it would be hurting Americans and American businesses. I'm going to read for you some of what he said. Trudeau said, quote, it is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There's no question about it. He continued, our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for American citizens as well and hurting American industry and business. Now, again, Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau do know each other quite well. They work together during Donald Trump's first term. And Trudeau's team was really a key factor in negotiating the North America Free Trade Agreement, more commonly known as NAFTA, during Donald Trump's first administration as well. Now, we also know that shortly after Donald Trump had first issued that threat earlier this week, Trudeau and Donald Trump got on the phone. This is what the Canadian prime minister said about his relationship with Trump. He said, quote, this is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on and that's what we'll do. Now, I'm sure that conversation around how to have this negotiation and how this will be carried out moving forward was brought up at that dinner. But we're still waiting to learn more details of exactly what was discussed in the specific nature of some of those conversations. Victor, MJ. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But I'm not sure if this overture is necessarily going to work right away. What Trudeau was saying about tariffs is what most economists do believe is that this may raise prices for Americans here at home.But Donald Trump, throughout the entire 2024 campaign, said tariff was one of his favorite words in the English dictionary. He's obsessed with this plan. This is a plan that he thinks won him the election. And when Trump deals with foreign leaders, he always deals, as he says in public, America first. And that doesn't go down well with leaders like Trudeau or Claudia Sheinbaum in Mexico. But that's what Trump has said he's going to do. So it's definitely notable that Trudeau made the journey to physically see Trump, but I'm not sure if it will be effective.",

And foreign leaders, as we just talked about, are already scrambling to try to avoid the fallout of what that could be.And I think it's just remarkable.

Because it will allow Donald Trump and his new Cabinet either not a lot of time to deal with legislative priorities. Because if you have to deal with a coming government funding deadlinein, let's say March 2025 or February. That's a big issue in my opinion, for how they're going to deal with their aggressive agenda of securing the border, energy production, et cetera. So that's what I'm looking out for.

So that is the ultimate price.When you start looking at, you know, the volume at which we're seeing this, law enforcement is challenged because they have to respond, as I said before, with the intensity that they would on any other type of event. You're drawing and pulling in specialized resources such as bomb technicians, canine resources, you know, if it is, you know, something, a specific threat that they have to address.

Federal officials, specifically the TSA, confirming that this stowaway passenger was in her mid to late 50s, she had no boarding pass for this flight this past Tuesday that originated at JFK headed to Paris, had cleared one security checkpoint, but then bypassed two subsequent ID verification stations. The TSA saying that she was a Russian passport holder and also held a U.S. green card, that she also failed to secure asylum in France after she applied for that several years ago, which may potentially speak to a possible motive in terms of why she wanted to head to Paris in the first place. The TSA conducting its own investigation right now along with Delta Airlines. In a statement to CNN, a spokesperson said \"nothing is of greater importance than matters of safety and security, that's why Delta is conducting an exhaustive investigation of what may have occurred, and will work collaboratively with other aviation stakeholders and law enforcement to that end.\" Rob Jackson, who was a passenger aboard that flight, telling CNN that there were no empty seats aboard that flight, that he overheard the crew discussing how the stowaway was able to hide in one lavatory board and then moved to others during that flight, before she was ultimately caught by the crew.
