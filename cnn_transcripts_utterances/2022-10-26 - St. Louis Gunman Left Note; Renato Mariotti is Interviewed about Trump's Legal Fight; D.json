Some of what was written in that notebook was shared with us, and now I want to share it with you. It said, the note, I don't have any friends. I don't have any family. I never had a girlfriend. I never had a social life. I've been an isolated loner my entire life. This was the perfect storm for a mass shooting. Those words giving investigating insight into what that 19-year-old who graduated from this high school last year may have been thinking. Investigators are saying there were some prevention methods already in place that slowed the shooter down. First and foremost, locked doors and a quick response from members of law enforcement. But as we know, it did not stop him from getting inside, injuring 15 and 16 year olds, killing another 15-year-old who would have turned 16 next month, and a beloved physical education teacher, Erica.",

Sources telling CNN the DOJ now wants a federal judge to force two former Trump White House lawyers, Pat Cipollone and Patrick Philbin, to testify. That move to compel their testimony about conversations they had with the former president is part of a set of secret court proceedings. The former president, of course, has been fighting to keep former advisers from testifying before a criminal grand jury about certain conversations. So, what could this change? Former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti is with us now. So, Renato, if Cipollone and Philbin are, in fact, compelled to testify here, do you think this grand jury will actually get answers from them or could they plead the Fifth?",

I think that actually Mr. Cipollone, for example, provided a lot of sound legal advice to the former president based upon the testimony that he provided to the January 6th committee. Obviously, Erica, in his testimony to that committee, there are certain questions he wasn't able to answer. And under existing law, I expect that the government is going to be able to -- the Justice Department will be able to get that testimony pursuant to a grand jury subpoena.",

In addition to that, it appears that Mr. Cipollone was very skeptical of John Eastman and Jeffrey Clark's attempts to, you know, make false statements and try to push forward the fake elector's scheme or, in the case of Jeff Clark, have the Justice Department make false statements. So, I really think particularly regarding the fake electors scheme, for example, Mr. Cipollone's testimony could be very important in terms of proving the former president's knowledge and intent.",

Imagine if most of Philadelphia was under water. That's the reality here. This is one of the major streets in the capital and this is what they've had to live with for at least three weeks. Across Nigeria, 33 out of 36 states are affected by flooding, more than 600 people have died, nearly 1.5 million people have been displaced. And the warning from UNICEF and the International Rescue Committee (ph) is that people are at a high risk of cholera and other preventable diseases, also a really big risk of food insecurity because they are displaced from what they used to know, they're displaced from their jobs, they can't -- most of the businesses on this street are closed because that's just the reality.

Everybody who's living is on the second floor. We met many people who have had to leave their ground floor of their buildings, of their houses, and live on the stairs because they're trying to protect their property, but it's really a devastating situation blamed on poor infrastructure, a dam that's overflowing in neighboring Cameroon, but especially climate change.
