      "sentences": "Which will Trump face first, the jury of his peers or the electorate? I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia. The briefs have been submitted, and on Tuesday lawyers for former President Donald Trump and those of the DOJ reporting to the Special Counsel Jack Smith will square off in front of a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit at issue whether Trump has immunity for conduct he undertook as president and or cannot otherwise face prosecution because it would represent double jeopardy. That's the legal issue. But what's most important here is the timing.Trial Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, has determined that she can't move forward until this issue is resolved. She entered an order on December 13 saying that Trump's appeal automatically stays any further proceedings that would otherwise move the case toward trial. But that stay could be lifted after the outcome of Tuesday's argument. For sure, the losing side is going to appeal to the Supreme Court after perhaps first asking for the full court of the Appellate Court to hear the matter on bonk. The losing party in the Court of Appeals has 90 days to ask for certiorari or Supreme Court review. As I've detailed here before, Smith is eager to get Trump tried before the election. Trump, on the other hand, wants to run out the clock. He hopes to win the presidency and use his power to end his own prosecution. So, how likely is it that Trump is tried before the election? If in the unlikely scenario, he wins his immunity or double jeopardy argument this prosecution will end, obviously Jack Smith would fight that outcome. But what if Trump loses in the court of appeals and that decision is promptly announced? It means he can wait three months, think the month of May, before even asking the Supreme Court to hear his appeal. By then the Republican nomination fight will likely be long over and it would conceivably take the Supreme Court weeks if not months to resolve the matter. Only then could the case be returned to Judge Chutkan for trial, making it highly unlikely that Trump will be tried before Election Day. But it's all rather uncertain. And now there's a relatively new wrinkle. The Court of Appeals accepted an amicus or friend of the court brief from a group called American Oversight. Lawyers from the white-shoe firm of Arnold and Porter argue that the Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction at this time to hear the appeal. And they cite a 1989 Supreme Court case in which Justice Scalia wrote for a unanimous court. If this argument sways the panel next week, it could immediately return the case to trial before Judge Chutkan and Trump would face a jury of his peers before he faces the electorate. Joining me now is Elie Honig, CNN Senior Legal Analyst, former federal prosecutor, author most recently of \"Untouchable, How Powerful People Get Away With It.\" Elie, nice to see you again. Big picture, how many trials might Trump realistically face before the election?",

Probably one, maybe two, could be zero, but that chance is low but increasing, definitely not three or four. And let me break that down quickly. We can write off the Fulton County DA's case. That one is not going to be tried before the election.The DA has asked for an August 20224 trial date. Conceding that would go into 2025, not going to happen. Now, up until recently, it looked like the one that was going to go first was the case you were just talking about, Jack Smith's D.C. federal election subversion case scheduled for March 4 of this year, 60 or 55 days from now, but that one has major questions about timing now. Then you have Manhattan DA's hush money case scheduled for late March. And then you have Jack Smith's other case, the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case scheduled for May. So, I don't know if Domino's or chess or musical chairs is the best analogy here, but it's got elements of all three.",

      "sentences": "I agree with you. First of all, I think Donald Trump will lose his immunity argument. But let's play out the timing here now, the argument in the Court of Appeals is set for Tuesday, this coming Tuesday, January 9, the Court of Appeals in D.C. has made pretty clear they're going to rule quickly. So let's assume they rule by February 1. If that happens and they rule against Trump, he then has 45 days, ordinarily it's 15 days but because the United States, the government is a party, he then has 45 days to ask for what we call on bonk review, meaning the entire Court of Appeals.[09:05:15] That brings us into mid-March or so. Let's say it takes them a couple of weeks, whether they do it or don't. Now we're into April. And from that point, Michael, Donald Trump as the losing party, let's assume, has 90 days to ask for certiorari, to ask the Supreme Court to take the case. So that takes us into May, June, now we're into July. And then if the Supreme Court takes the case, forget it, that's going to take a couple of months, that puts us way too late into the summer. Even if they don't, though, even if it goes back in July, you can't just start the trial the next day. This case was stayed, was put on pause with about four months to go before trial. So Trump's going to say, I'm entitled to at least a few months from when it comes back. So, there are real questions now about the timing.",

And again, remember, we expect a ruling late January or so. If the Court of Appeals does that, if they issue the mandate, that means the case goes back down to Judge Chutkan, which theoretically would free her up to begin carrying on with pretrial proceedings again. The however is, first of all, will the Court of Appeals, in fact, issue a mandate back down to Judge Chutkan.And second of all, if they do Donald Trump's going to fight that. He's going to say no, no, no, I get a chance to go up to the Supreme Court. Everything should remain stayed, everything should remain on hold, pending the outcome of my final appeal potentially up to the Supreme Court.

Let's say for example, you tried to start a trial of Donald Trump in August, are you really going to have him on trial physically removed from the campaign trail throughout the entire general election campaign, September, October, potentially on and through Election Day? So I see a sort of drop dead date of July, mid to late July.If they don't start by then, I think everyone involved is going to agree it has to go till after the election.

But the point is that the Supreme Court in section 2 has made quite clear that it's not going to interpret section 2 without congressional authorization through some statute. And I think the same reasoning applies to section 3, because it's not appropriate for the court to make up the rules that it's going to apply to determine whether insurrection has been committed, how exactly you prove such a fact. And so therefore I think that the question is, whether the Constitution authorizes the exclusion.The question is whether it authorizes the exclusion by a state court, without any statute from Congress that says this is how you go through the procedure to exclude someone.",

And what we know is that means in some cases, we need Congress to pass a law before judges can step in and enforce the provisions of the amendment. So again, I'm happy to say with Judge Luttig, that there could be a law that says, here's how you exclude a president. But I don't think without a law, a judge, especially a state court judge, can exclude him. And never before have we seen state court judges excluding even state officers without some authorizing legislation from the state. So this is a principle about limiting the scope of judicial power.

So I would disagree with the decision to remove Donald Trump.

And the same thing the other way around, if they decide to remove him, I hope that -- I mean, keep him on the ballot, I hope that all nine justices would say the same thing so that we can move beyond the question of whether this is a judgment by Republican justices or conservative justices to a judgment about whether this is a judgment by justices who are applying the law, including the law about limiting their own authority, absent congressional authorization through a statute.",

RON DESANTIS (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Those polls have never predicted the caucus because it's hard to determine who is actually going to show up. And so that's why I don't think we put any stock in that. The people that just swoop in and do a rally here or there, people that just spend gobs of money on television, that typically doesn't work.

In your experience, has any candidate for either party ever been in the position that Trump finds himself today and lost Iowa? J. ANN SELZER, PRESIDENT, SELZER AND CO. POLLING: Yes, but, so it never at this stage of the cycle has anyone cracked the 50 percent mark. Bob Dole many, many years ago polled at 50 percent, but that was early on. And then the competition heated up and he didn't end up where he started out. So, this is late in the cycle for someone to be above 50 percent.",

And one was that people thought as candidates were not named Trump dropped out, that that would mean that the non- Trump candidates who remained would do better. The only candidate who did better was Ron DeSantis, and it was just by three percentage points.In fact, Donald Trump's standing improved by eight percentage points. So, the idea that fewer candidates would hurt Trump, our poll would defy that. SMERCONISH: I think to many of us who watch the Trump rallies, we think that it's just an opportunity for him to come out and deliver one-liners and enthuse his base, but I know from reading of some of your analysis, there's much more going on at those rallies from an organizational standpoint than meets the eye.

He comes out at a net negative 30 percent. And yet when Donald Trump is referenced -- quote -- \"thinking back to when he was president, generally speaking, would you say that Donald Trump's policies helped or hurt you personally?\" He's at plus 12 percent.

What has come in? From X. Let the people decide if Trump should be president. I dislike him, but I dislike Biden's policies more. Partisan state hacks should not remove candidates from the ballot. I come to the same conclusion, but not through the same logic. That's not the way that I would phrase it. I'm in the same category as Professor Lessig from Harvard, and hence today's poll question at Smerconish.com. I don't think the way for those who want to defeat Trump is to defeat him through the secretary of state of Colorado and then the Colorado Supreme Court saying, well, we're going to disqualify him from the ballot. In fact -- can I put the 14th Amendment back up on the screen real quick? Do you have that handy, Catherine? I mean, it's ambiguous at best. No person shall be a senator or representative in Congress, or elector of president and vice president. Leave it up there for a second. So, they articulate senator, they articulate representative, they articulate elector, but they don't say president. And now you can say, well, wait a minute, Michael. Did the president take an oath? Yes, he did. Is he an officer of the United States? I would think so. So, it's ambiguous at best but I just don't think that's the way in which -- you can remove it now. I just don't think that that's the way in which you want to defeat Donald Trump for those of you who want to defeat Donald Trump. Not through, you know, that mechanism. And, by the way, it's not the same for the four indictments. Like the four indictments are not going to remove him from the ballot. The four indictments are going to provide you, if there's a trial, with information that perhaps you need to go make a decision before you cast a ballot. But it shouldn't be through the 14th Amendment application, I think. What else social media during the course of this program? Trump is running out the clock with his judges on SCOTUS, we're screwed. I don't think that's necessarily the case. I would be disappointed if it breaks 6-3 in terms of how this turns out. Is he running out the clock? He absolutely is. And by the way, many people criticized me before the break and they said, why are you critical of Jack Smith? Because I have been critical of Jack Smith in not flat out saying that he wants to try Trump before the election. He doesn't say that, but that's the basis for trying to get expedited review of the cases that I'm discussing here. And then people have said to me, well, why don't you criticize Trump because Trump is trying to run out the clock? And he is trying to run out the clock, for sure. [09:50:00] And my answer is to say, because the case against Donald Trump is United States versus Donald Trump, right? It's like all of us. And I -- you know, we can't speak for Trump, but we can speak for our government. And I don't think that the government should hide the ball in that regard. Just flat out tell people, hey, we want the case tried because we think the American voters need to know this information before they cast a ballot as between these two candidates. Still to come, the final results of the poll question from Smerconish.com. Lawrence Lessig inspired it. I would be very curious to see the result. Where -- where is Donald Trump more vulnerable? Is it in these legal challenges that we've been discussing? Or is it, you know, when he stands before the electorate?
