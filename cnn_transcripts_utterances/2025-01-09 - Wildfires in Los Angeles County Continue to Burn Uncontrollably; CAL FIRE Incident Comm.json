I wanted to come back here today because I wanted to see what had happened.This is -- it's not just the one street that we were on. On every street, and you can see in the background here, there's still some hotspots. This is what -- please be careful here. We're still seeing hotspots burning in the distance. And look, firefighters are doing what they can and making really tough choices on when to leave a scene and move on to the next thing, to the next hotspot that needs their attention. They've been working 36, 48 hour shifts trying to fight this. But another thing that's been going on, Sara, is that we're seeing residents helping each other. And we saw this all through yesterday, and we're seeing the results of that today. Yesterday, let's go over here. Yesterday I saw -- as I saw this house on fire, I saw volunteers doing everything they could to try to help save this house. I spoke to that and I played that soundbite just about an hour ago with the resident of this house, Gail (ph). Three or four volunteers, she said, had just showed up at her house, and the garden hose is still here. Theres still wet spots. This is the impact that these people had. They helped save this one woman's house. Her entire life, she said she's been living here for more than 10 years. Everything is inside this house. And it is heartwarming to see how people have been coming together. But also the desperation, Sara, as they're coming and pleading with authorities. Some people say, look, I've called, I've told the fire department that my house is on fire. There's not that much that they can do for me at this point.

It did relax from yesterday's torrent of wind that brought the hurricane force gusts. You can see this morning it will be a lot calmer than what it was 24 hours ago. But I want to advance this by six hours because we do anticipate the winds to pick up once again today, the typical vulnerable areas to Santa Ana winds. We'll see the ridge top, 60 mile per hour plus, down to the valleys and coastline below, perhaps 30 to 45 miles per hour. So the potential for further ignition certainly exists before Friday's relaxation of the winds, and we get an improvement in the fire conditions. It is bone dry. Relative humidity levels between five and 15 percent. Still a critical fire danger today. That becomes an elevated fire danger tomorrow. So that's a lesser scale. And of course, we're breathing in all this toxic air from the wildfire smoke, not to mention the urban interface here that is interacting with, so all the chemicals that are being released into the atmosphere making Pasadena and surrounding locations in western L.A.
