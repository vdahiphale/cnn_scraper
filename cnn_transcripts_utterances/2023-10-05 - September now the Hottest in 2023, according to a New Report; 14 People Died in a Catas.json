So that's how far now we are above where we should be when it comes to pre-industrial levels.

And the Biden administration is already exploring other options. It has started transferring thousands of seized Iranian weapons to Ukraine. The munitions were being sent illegally from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to Houthi rebels in Yemen.And the U.S. has for months been weighing how to legally send the weapons to the Ukrainians. They include more than a million rounds of ammunition, assault rifles, anti-tank missiles, and propellant and fuses for rocket-propelled grenades. Ukrainian soldiers on the front lines are anxious to get their hands on whatever weapons they can to fight off the Russians. CNN's senior international correspondent Fred Pleitgen reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The artillery troops need to move fast. Russian drones might be in the air. Line up, calibrate, fire. Three rockets, that's it, even though this Grad launcher would be more effective firing large salvos. It's not very precise, the soldier named Alex says. It also depends on the weather and the range. It would be good to have more precise rockets or guided ones. But the Ukrainians are running short on even these unguided Soviet-era rockets, and ammo shortages are a problem across the battlefield here in eastern Ukraine. Soldiers from the 80th Airborne Assault Brigade have a quick snack, then get ready to fire their Western-donated howitzer. The American 105-millimeter shells, a valuable but increasingly scarce commodity. (on-camera): The Ukrainians call this the sniper rifle of their artillery because it's so accurate, but it also illustrates one of the big problems they have. They have plenty of barrels to fire from, but not enough ammunition to fire. (voice-over): Battery commander Miron telling me the lack of shells means his forces are badly outgunned here. It's hard to give precise numbers, he says, but I think they fire 10 times for every round we fire. Sometimes it's one to 100. The Russians are constantly taking aim at this area, though the Ukrainians say they're making gains pushing Vladimir Putin's army back, even using combat helicopters close to the front line. Kyiv says it needs more ammo to sustain its offensives both here in the East and in the South. But the U.S. budget impasse could mean further delays. On top of that, NATO is warning its members are running dangerously low themselves. ADM. ROB BAUER, NATO MILITARY COMMITTEE CHIEF: We started to give away from half full or lower warehouses in Europe and therefore the bottom of the barrel is now visible. PLEITGEN (voice-over): For the Ukrainian artillery troops, that means rationing will probably continue, all while trying to support their advancing soldiers on the ground.

As you heard, the U.S. officials believe that this is totally legal.And as you saw in Fred's reporting, there has been a real sense of concern around the waning supplies of NATO weapons to Ukraine. We've heard from NATO officials warning that these supplies are beginning to look a bit thin on the ground. In fact, the U.S. Pentagon issued its own warning on Tuesday saying that while there are funds in the U.S. at this current point in time to fulfill Ukraine's battlefield needs, those funds could begin to run out unless urgent action is taken by the U.S. Congress with regards to the U.S. budget. So that's certainly is a priority for the US and other NATO allies. And we've heard from experts, they say, that while, of course, this won't fulfill all of Ukraine's battlefield needs, particularly as this counteroffensive continues to grind on, this will be a boost for troops on the front line.

Behind the scenes, his successors are trying to see if they can unite a badly-divided House Republican conference, one in which there are raw emotions, feelings, bad will, mostly directed towards Congressman Matt Gaetz, someone who led the charge to oust Speaker McCarthy and got the support of seven other Republicans, eight in total, voting with Democrats to push McCarthy out of the speakership, something that has never been done before in American history.But now where does the House go from here? It is unclear. The House is in a state of paralysis. It cannot move forward until a speaker is named, meaning no legislative action at all. The House is out of session until next week. In the meantime, behind the scenes, two candidates have emerged. Two speaker candidates, one of them, the House Majority Leader, Steve Scalise, along with the House Judiciary Committee Chairman, Jim Jordan, both of whom are trying to secure enough support to become the conference's nominee to be elected speaker. Once they have a majority of votes next week, we expect that vote to happen, then there'll be vote on the House floor. But that is the tricky part, getting 218 votes in the House. More than four Republicans could be enough to scuttle that entire effort. That is the problem that Kevin McCarthy ran into time and time again in the narrowly divided House. But no question about it, many members pointing fingers at those eight Republicans for a state of chaos that they warned could come back to haunt them in November 2024. REP. KEVIN CRAMER (R-ND): I think it makes the House Republican rebels look foolish. They look unserious. I think they look like they're more interested in fighting than governing. REP. MAX MILLER (R-OH): Mr. Gaetz is only doing this for himself, and I believe that he should be looked at for an expulsion. I have not made up my mind on if I would vote to expel him. This guy doesn't have his ducks in a row, and that's what you see with people who lie. They can never keep their story straight. And that's what Matt is doing right now.

The other big issue, a policy issue, Ukraine aid. Jim Jordan told me that he does not support more funding for Ukraine. A big question mark for Ukraine, especially if Jordan becomes elected Speaker, made the divisions among House Republicans about how to move forward and whether to provide aid to Ukraine in its war against Russia, all showing how much concern there is and how many to divide there is within the GOP about simply how to govern at this time when there is no speaker, the House is in a state of paralysis and Republicans are badly-divided about how to move forward from here.

Now at the heart of far less tasteful allegations, centered on transactions between the French billionaire and Russian oligarch, Nikolai Sarkisov. A Russian and Armenian citizen who's reported to be worth 850 million dollars, which makes him one of the richest people in Russia. He's the co-founder of a Russian insurance company, but not subject to European sanctions. The story was first reported by the French daily \"Le Monde,\" citing a memo allegedly drafted by the French agency responsible for combating money laundering. At the heart of the preliminary investigation, 14 properties in Courchevel bought by Sarkisov and a loan, allegedly made by Bernard Arnault, according to the memo. Allegations described as absurd and unfounded by Arnault's lawyer who in a statement goes on to ask who can seriously imagine that Bernard Arnault who has built over 40 years the leading French and European company would engage in money laundering to expand a hotel. In France, Arnault's name and his estimated $164 billion fortune go far beyond the ephemera fashion. In building his group, he's cultivated relationships with the powerful, acquiring a fast media empire. ARNAULT (through translator): The Galerie des Glaces is incredible, of course. Hosting the King of England in the Galerie des Glaces is fantastic. BELL (voice-over): But beneath the powerful connections and the glamorous brands, the allegation lingers. How far was the world's second richest man prepared to go to make his Courchevel resort bigger and himself even richer? Melissa Bell, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Now this marks the largest healthcare workers strike in U.S. history and mostly affects Western states. Phase one will last until Saturday.Kaiser Permanente says a number of tentative agreements have been reached during the negotiations. But a union spokesperson says workers are still waiting for meaningful action from executives. Those picketing include nurses, optometrists and pharmacists. They are demanding higher salaries and improved staffing levels, saying shortages have left them burnt out. Well, two new reports show that women in the U.S. are paying more than men for health care through what's called a pink tax and it may be impacting their health. The first report from a financial services firm found that women with health insurance through their jobs are paying more out-of-pocket costs than men with similar insurance. For example, breast cancer screenings often cost more than many other cancer screenings. The second report by the non-profit Susan G. Komen organization finds the high cost of breast cancer treatment is a significant financial burden for patients, and it may be hindering the success of their treatment. Joining me now is Dr. Ann Hester, a board-certified physician and the author of Patient Empowerment 101. Thank you so much for joining us during this Breast Cancer Awareness Month. DR. ANN HESTER, BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN AND AUTHOR, PATIENT EMPOWERMENT 101: Oh, it's my pleasure.",

So a lot of people, they just think they have to wait for the diagnosis, but there are things that everybody can do to decrease the risk of breast cancer, and they're very simple.Number one, alcohol intake. Limited or don't drink it at all. No more than one drink per day for a woman and preferably none, and also studies are showing that smoking can increase your risk. The next thing is to exercise regularly. If you get out five times a week and you walk 30 minutes, that can not only decrease your risk of breast cancer, it can decrease your risk of heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and so forth. And also your weight matters. Ladies who lose excess weight after menopause can decrease the breast cancer risk. So there are things that we can do to decrease our risk. And even with those things, we can look for early detection because cancer caught very early has close to a 99 percent cure rate. And so be proactive and don't just wait for it to come knocking on your door.",

It may be as low as $150 or even less than that.And so if you look at something that has the potential to take your life or something that could cost you $150, $200 if you don't get any assistance, over time, it is certainly worthwhile to save up and make sure you get that done.
