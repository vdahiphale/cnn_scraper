At least 150,000 customers are currently without power. More than 6,000 flights have been delayed, more than 1500 flights have been outright canceled. Look at this. Feet of snow in Kansas forcing people to stay inside. And the full impact of this storm is yet to be seen. As the system continues moving east throughout the evening.

And I hear you on that last part talking about the tax piece of all of this because some of this would be extending the tax cuts that were put in place in 2017 when President Trump was in office and those got passed. But as you noted, there could be additional tax features built into that legislation.

      "sentences": "Well, look, we're focused on pro-growth, pro-jobs policies. You know, the last round of these tax cuts actually brought in about $1.5 million more in revenue that was actually projected -- $1.5 trillion in revenue that was projected by the Congressional Budget Office. And so we're looking to see how can we repatriate manufacturing in this country, what kind of incentives need to be provided to make sure we're producing our pharmaceuticals here and not relying on Communist China and foreign nations, where currently 80 percent of our active pharmaceutical ingredients come from. That is one of my big priorities for this package.The state and local tax relief. It's going to have to be limited. We're not going to be able to just completely lift that cap. And I think there's a consensus there that we're not looking to provide more tax relief for the richest Americans, but really focus on the middle class. So what kind of increase in the deduction can we give that will really help people like the ones I represent in Staten Island, Brooklyn, working middle class families. So I think that there also has to be some offsets, absolutely. And if we change some regulations that have been costly and burdensome, we can save a lot of money there. We can save money by making government more efficient, reducing bureaucracy, and making sure these programs that are administered are being done in the right way, meaning you don't have a big, bloated bureaucracy behind it, but that the money is actually going toward the benefits for people. One of the other big issues that we've talked about is lowering the tax burden that seniors pay right now when they receive their Social Security checks. We want them to keep more of their money because they're suffering and really struggling, living paycheck to paycheck. So reducing that tax burden on seniors is another big issue that's come up and is a priority of mine.",

What needs to be changed? What needs to be tweaked? What can we eliminate? And then figure out how we will make those adjustments to pay for the things that we do want at the end of the day.So it is a little bit of a shifting, but I also do believe that we can find a significant savings by just looking at what's being done right now in terms of burdensome regulations that are costly, looking to right size government so it is efficient and effective, and then taking the bloat and the fraud and the abuse out of some of these programs and making sure that the benefits are actually getting to the American citizens who are entitled to it.

Normal battalion size in the Russian military is somewhere between 600 and 800 soldiers, depending on the type of battalion. So let's cut it in half and say about 500 were lost. That's still somewhat significant in a specific operation. Now it's not going to change the course of the war by itself. It's also not going to change exactly, you know, what the Russian goals are.

Now, whether or not Russia plays ball is another question. If Russia does not agree to some kind of a ceasefire, or at least a cessation of hostilities, then I could see the potential for the Trump administration to actually ramp up aid to the Ukrainians.In fact, Lieutenant General Kellogg, the special representative for Ukraine, has made such a statement. So if that does in fact happen, it could actually put more pressure on the Russians to end the war, or at least end their participation at the level that they're currently at. So if that happens, that could potentially end things where they are. I don't think Ukraine will be able to regain the territory that it has lost about 20 percent or so of its country to the Russians since, you know, since the February 2022 invasion. But if that is in fact, you know, the course of events where there is a bit of a ceasefire, we may see a situation kind of like what we're seeing in -- on the Korean Peninsula, where there is a de facto peace but it is in fact still a state of war. That could be one possible outcome of this. There's a type of ceasefire or at least an armistice, but no real resolution to the issue and no movement of troops beyond what we see today.",
