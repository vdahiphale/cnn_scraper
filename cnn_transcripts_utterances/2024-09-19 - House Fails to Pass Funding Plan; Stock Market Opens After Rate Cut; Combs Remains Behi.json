And even Republicans are admitting they don't know what Johnson wants to do next.Add to this now, Donald Trump now saying that if House Republicans don't get their way, they should shut the government down. Here's the tweet or the, whatever, the social media. \"If Republicans don't get the Save Act, they should not agree to a continuing resolution in any way, shape, or form.\" The House soundly voted down that proposed Republican led bill yesterday. The vote was 202-220. Joining us now is congressional reporter for \"Politico,\" Olivia Beavers. Olivia, the thing that I - also stuck out hearing from Mike Johnson was, now we go back to the playbook and draw up another play. Is it clear what that is? OLIVIA BEAVERS, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, \"POLITICO\": No, it's not. And I think, Kate, it's actually frustrated senior Republicans who say they've been left in the dark. They've been asking him for a while what the plan b is. And the pushback that he's sort of - they sort of got was, why would we telegraph what plan b is when we're trying to stick to plan a. But when I talked to Republican, they say that this vote yesterday was basically a kabuki dance. The numbers weren't there. It was clear it was going to fail. But Mike Johnson wanted to show that he was fighting for this legislation with the Save Act for Donald Trump and his right-wing. The trouble now is, if he goes with a clean CR, which a lot of Republicans think it will ultimately be that, whether it's his plan b or whether the Senate sends him that after they - they tried to pass another bill, whether he gets Democratic or Republican support, he's going to have to answer to Donald Trump and the right flank.",

That doesn't look good for them heading into an election. Some of these vulnerable Republicans have warned that if they do shut down they might not win reelection.But the conservatives have, at the same time, told me that Mike Johnson has promised to fight, fight, fight in terms of trying to get the Save Act through. And in that - in their mind, and in Donald Trump's mind, that is pushing the party and pushing the Senate into a shutdown. So, you have two sides with very different expectations of how this is going to go in the next week. And we're only just a couple of days before a shutdown.",

I think it's much more likely what - no, we know because Powell told us yesterday, the economy is slowing. Unemployment and employment growth is the key issue now for the Fed, more so than in inflation. They have this jewel (ph) mandate that they're constantly balancing one way and the other.So, overall, the Fed is now saying, employment is our focus, the inflation job is nearly done. And as for Donald Trump, well, he has a point. Half a percentage cut does suggest things are maybe weaker than he'd like to admit, Jay Powell. But it, by no means, when Donald Trump said the other week at the economic club in New York that the economy, the U.S. economy, was a catastrophe and a disaster, I do not know one serious senior economist on Wall Street that would agree with that assessment",

That did not happen. So, once that happened, Cassie filed a state case. Immediately, the next day, remember, that Sean Combs settled, which to most of us look like some admission of guilt. However, they said that there was no admission of guilt and the evidence and all of what had happened between them was sealed. However, that opened the door for other people to come forward. So, it looked a lot less like a spat between lovers, a spat between ex's that had occurred, and really demonstrated that Diddy had a pattern of behavior that really perpetuated for long periods of time. So with that - with Cassie's case, although it's not directly related, because it is a state case and this is a federal case, there was a nexus between the two because of the fact that other people came forward and then they started to say, hmm, there's probably some meat on the bones here.
