And you had these series of hearings one after another, each one focused in a very careful and thorough way on aspects of this effort, essentially, to overthrow our democratic system.And what we saw, I think, was news to pretty much everybody in the sense that what it showed was that Donald Trump was at the center of the whole process. He was the driving force behind it. He was the one who, in each instance, for example, the phone call to Brad Raffensperger, the intervention in trying to get the Justice Department to do things, the phone calls to other state officials, one thing after another involved Donald Trump taking action on his own. And even more, it involved him doing it over the objections of his own handpicked people, people who saw what he was doing and said in various ways at different times that he shouldn't do it. So, what you have here is a wonderful presentation staggered over time, so people could absorb it and people who watched it I think did absorb it. And I think it's changed the way people who are paying attention in this country think about the entire situation of what should be done with Donald Trump. So, I think we've reoriented the country in terms of thinking about it, obviously, he still has his supporters, they don't agree. I'm not trying to say everyone is convinced, nut many people who would have said before, if asked should Donald Trump be prosecuted, would have said, we can't do that. You can't go after. It's like a banana republic. You can't go after a former president. Well, now we know, because of the committee, what he did, and that he was at the hub of just about the worst thing that anyone could do if you want to attack the country, to destroy the democratic process of the United States of America. He was at the center of it. And so now I think many people who would have said no, I don't really think it's -- even though I may not like him, and I don't think it's -- I think now people are adjusted to it. And I think that's not only significant for public opinion but I think it's very significant in terms of framing the decision for the folks at the Justice Department who now have to go forward.",
