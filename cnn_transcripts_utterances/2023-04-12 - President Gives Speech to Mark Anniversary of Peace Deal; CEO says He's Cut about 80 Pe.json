Elon Musk saying in a rare interview that there is a brand new CEO of Twitter, his dog, or Elon might be an improvement at times. Musk also claiming Twitter is close to break-even with 6000 fewer workers plus he said major advertisers are now returning. Does Moscow finally have the terminal at Twitter licked? We will discuss. Plus, Biden in Belfast, the U.S. President delivering a keynote speech at Ulster University to mark the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement saying the U.S. is committed to keeping the peace in Northern Ireland. Biden also had coffee with U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, a live report and all the details just ahead. Also Taiwan tensions Taiwan's Foreign Minister saying in an exclusive interview with CNN, that China appears to be preparing for war following three days of military drills around Taiwan. Fresh comments too, from Chinese President Xi Jinping today, not helping quell concerns more on that shortly, but first important new economic numbers just out from the United States. U.S. consumer prices up 5 percent year over year, the ninth straight monthly drop in that headline number the month over month data coming in slightly below expectations up just 1/10 of a percent. The main problem and it's been this way for a while remains core inflation, which strips out food and energy costs. Those numbers remain sticky that speaker as you can see in front of you up 5.6 percent year over year. Still the bottom line is this is well above Federal Reserve targets. That said, here's the market reaction and it's positive the major U.S. averages which had been trading in a pretty narrow range all week in anticipation of this data are all solidly higher Europe on the advanced to a bit of catch up going on here ahead of this data too. We were pricing around a 75 percent chance of another quarter point hike from the Federal Reserve in May. That said Fed members do seem split on what to do next, given the recent turmoil in the financial sector. And of course, the International Monetary Fund's saying just yesterday that financial system strains have contributed to a \"fog\" around the World Economic Outlook. Well, the fog does seem to lift a little on inflation in the United States. Clare Sebastian joins us now with the details. Clare it's a bit of a head scratcher or at least a head turner when you get a core inflation rate. So after stripping out food and energy that's actually higher than the headline number here but the bottom line isn't? I think I've made it; it's still too high for comfort.",

The number did re accelerate this month to 5.6 percent year on year. Shelter is the key contributor we're talking rents housing cost that is the thought really in the Fed side as it continues to fight inflation. The other contributors to the increase motor vehicle insurance, airline fares, household furnishings, things like that. Well, food, the index for food remained unchanged and energy was down 3.5 percent. So the energy driven shock to inflation seems to be in reverse. Now as we see the overall number come down what this means I think for the Fed Julia, certainly if you look at the Fed Funds Futures, they've come down in the last half hour from pricing, about a 75 percent chance of a quarter point rate hike at the next meeting down to about 66 percent about two thirds. I think this means the next meeting is possibly in play, although perhaps not enough to spark a pause. If you talk to experts, because of course of that very sticky core inflation but certainly it does add to the debate around that next Fed meeting.",

But he talks about the importance of that huge achievement of the Good Friday Agreement, which was the power sharing government and the importance of keeping that up and running as a way of ensuring the peace here. But we've heard or its being certainly reported that the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, Jeffrey Donaldson is saying that, what President Biden has said doesn't change the political dynamic here that they still want to see more concessions, essentially, from the European Union. But I think in broad terms, President Biden's speech, laying out how to try and lay to rest some of the perceptions here that he might be pro, the nationalist pro, the United Ireland parties here in Northern Ireland, he tried to lay that to rest talking about his English ancestry and Captain George Biden and our captain in the English army back in 1828. And he said, or 1842, he couldn't remember the precise date.

Consumer prices rising in March by 5 percentyear over year, the ninth straight month of slowing inflation the rate of price rises easing ever since it hit a four-decade high last summer. But of course the challenges it remains a long way away from the Federal Reserve's target. And it's not only these data points that matter though. Consumers' expectations of where prices are headed are also a crucial part of what the Federal Reserve watches. And my next guest also tracks data like this very closely. And as this chart shows, the data does suggest Americans do see inflation continuing to ease and dramatically. Joining us now is Torsten Slok Chief Economist at Apollo Global Management. Torsten, it's always brilliant to have your wisdom on the show.

We peaked last summer at 9 percent and as you said, went out down to 5 percent. So that's the good news. The bad news is that the Federal Reserve has a target that inflation should be 2. So from that perspective, 5 is just still too high. And if look in the details of the report, as you're highlighting, there's a lot of things that are hitting consumers that are still showing very elevated level of inflation. For example, if you look at cost of transportation that went up, if you also look at airline ticket prices also went up, if you look at the cost of housing, still very elevated. So from a consumer perspective, we have probably picked the lowest hanging fruit now that inflation came from 9 to 5. But we got to get all the way down to 2 and this is the difficult part for the Federal Reserve and for markets that getting from 5 to 2 is probably going to be a good deal harder than it was to get from 9 to 5.",

The main issue is that the small banks and here remember, the Fed data bank number 1 to 25 is defined as a large bank and number 26 to 5000 is a small bank. And those banks number 26 or 5000, they account for 40 percent, of all lending in the U.S. economy to consumers, to companies and to real estate. So that means that the small banks do play a quite significant role. And if the regional banks now are going through a process of repairing their balance sheets, because they are facing higher cost of borrowing, they're facing also asset price declines and them also facing more regulatory scrutiny. That does mean that the risks looking ahead that credit, meaning borrowing in the economy is simply going to get more difficult. In other words, think about the simplest example. You and I walk into a bank, we would like to borrow $30,000 to buy a car, and the bank needs to turn around and find that $30,000 somewhere. Do they want to take that money from deposits? Well deposits, there's some uncertainty about now the duration of deposits and the stickiness of deposits. So maybe they will not be willing to take it from there. Maybe borrowing in the money market, maybe borrow from the Fed, maybe the Federal Home Loan banking system. There's just a lot of uncertainty is about how are the banks not going to provide the credit, provide the loans in the economy. And that's the risk that we add on to the economy already slowing as a result of the Fed hiking rates. And that's why; as you said that the uncertainty is still significant. But the data coming in is pointing more and more towards some downside risks, at least over the next several months in terms of credit conditions tightening.",

The Fed had to raise interest rates, and therefore growth is at risk of beginning to slow down. That's what the Fed is saying and they don't forecast. That's what I would expect.

In this fiercely competitive marketplace Connor, who we've spoken to many times, is now incorporating ChatGPT functionality to improve the shopping experience. The company which offers both pay now and pay later options is building an AI plug-in from its website, which allows a conversational style searches. Here to discuss our Sebastian Siemiatkowski he is Klarna's CEO. Sebastian, always great to have you on the show! We obviously have to talk about AI. But I do want to talk about the business just tied to the conversation before that I was having. I think the beauty of the product that you offer was we've discussed in the past is that you can calibrate dynamically for credit conditions as they change. The U.S. is also your biggest market, I believe now. Talk me through what you're seeing and how you're adjusting.",

The fact that we underwrite every transaction, as opposed to kind of extend the credit limit, and then let people max out on it. The fact that we have short period of people pay back basically in only 60 days, and that it's fixed installments. We are seeing losses going down, you know, a lot compared to where they were a year ago. So it's really working out as expected. And you know the strength of the model, when we change our underwriting model, after just 60 days, 50 percent of our balance sheet is underwritten according to a new model. That's agility that none of the large banks have. So that obviously is extremely helpful in an environment like this.",

If you provide a form of credit that is much healthier, I always advise people go and watch Netflix credit cards, explain 20 minutes, you see all the bad practices that banks have applied in the last 20 years to make people, you know, borrow too much, right? Because they wanted to max out their credit card maximum on interest rates and if you don't apply that if you have a better, healthier credit, you'll have better and healthier losses.

This is Art week in Hong Kong, the biggest event on the city's cultural calendar at its heart, Art Basel Hong Kong, Asia's largest art fair. Here, every March, scores of the world's top galleries descend on the city to showcase and disown. Hong Kong has long been considered Asia's leading art marketplace. But after years of pandemic restrictions, and the rise of other regional art centers, where does the city stand now?

Auction House continues to make incredible results. And now with the border reopening we will see a much stronger sales coming up. STOUT (voice over): Mainland China's border reopening in January was welcome news for Hong Kong. The city is a gateway to greater China's art market. In 2021, Chinese art collectors accounted for the world's highest share of spending at the $1 billion level according to Art Basel's Art Market Report. STOUT (on camera): Asia is big and you have these emerging art hubs, like Tokyo like Seoul, do you think they are turning into formidable challengers to Hong Kong? SIYANG-LE: We actually think that is a great thing for Asia, because we now show to the rest of the world that Asia is big enough to have like multiple international art platforms. STOUT (voice over): Hong Kong's global art reputation is thanks to its long history of art trading, its access to Chinese Collectors, and most importantly, its favorable tax laws which make it cheaper to buy and sell art.
