We're following breaking news.Right now, the prosecution in Donald Trump's criminal trial is getting the last word before the judge sends the case to jurors who will decide the former president's fate. Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass pressing on with his marathon closing arguments, trying to counter attacks on his star witness, Michael Cohen, made during the Trump team's summation earlier today. CNN's Kara Scannell has been inside the courtroom all day. She's joining us now. She's outside. Kara, bring us up to speed on this climactic moment in this truly historic trial.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass is now entering his third hour of these closing arguments and his focus right now is on the payments. This is the heart of the case, the repayment to Michael Cohen and how it was booked in Donald Trump's company's books and records. So, this goes to the actual allegations of falsifying business records that Trump is charged with.So, Steinglass is going through methodically all the catch and kill deals leading up to this moment. And this is where he is now turning to these repayments, saying that Cohen was paid in 2017. Those payments ended that year. And so it did not get paid in 2018 saying that this was not a retainer that Cohen was working for Trump as his lawyer when Trump was in the White House. Steinglass even telling the jury that Michael Cohen spent more time in cross examination in this trial than he did actually working for Donald Trump in 2017, so really trying to knock down on the defense's contention today that this was a retainer agreement. And that matters because Trump is charged with falsifying these business records because the invoices Cohen sent, the vouchers from the company's books, and the checks, all said the word retainer on them. That is why they're arguing over this point. And so Steinglass is pointing out various reasons to the jury why they should reject the defense's argument that this was a retainer agreement, and that it was pure and simple a reimbursement, pointing to the note that says that were taken by Allen Weisselberg, calculating the repayment to Michael Cohen, and also notes taken by Jeff McConney, who Weisselberg instructed to handle the checks and the monies going back to Michael Cohen. So, trying to focus on those two documents, calling them the smoking guns in this case that he is asking the jury to focus on. Now he did spend a lot of time going into great detail about the catch and kill deals, the one involving the doorman at Trump Tower, Karen McDougal, the former Playboy model, and Stormy Daniels, saying that Michael Cohen, you know, was involved in all these steps, but the jury doesn't have to rely on Cohen alone You know, also pointing to the phone the recording that Cohen made with his phone of him speaking with Donald Trump about the Karen McDougal repayment, trying to direct the jury in different directions of where they could look at some of this evidence that isn't Michael Cohen. And that's because Trump's team spent a good portion of their two and a half hours focusing on Michael Cohen, saying that he is the greatest liar of all time, pointing out different ways that they say that he has lied. The prosecutor is saying that the reason why Michael Cohen was of such use to Donald Trump is because he was willing to lie for him. So, really a battle both over Michael Cohen in this case and what the jury should believe or not believe from him and also this issue of the retainer agreement that Trump's team says was in place. But the prosecution saying was false and that this was all about the reimbursement to Michael Cohen. So, the judge saying that, you know, the jury they're alert. I've been watching them all day. They've given equal devoted attention to both Todd Blanche, Trump's attorney, and Joshua Steinglass for the prosecution, eyes mainly locked on him, looking down at the monitors before them to hone in on some of the evidence that's been pulled up, excerpts of transcripts, text messages that are in a tiny font really seem to be very focused and alert. And that's something that the judge commented on, which is why he said that he spoke with the jury, they're willing to go tonight to finish this so they can hear the full closing arguments today. So, the courthouse behind me usually closes at 5:00 P.M., it is still going strong as the closing arguments, you know, are continuing with the prosecutors, Steinglass still addressing the jury now in this third hour.

Early this morning, Todd Blanche, the defense attorney, came out with a pretty strong attack on Michael Cohen's character, saying, you can't convict the defendant on the basis of Michael Cohen's testimony. And I think many people would say, I think that's absolutely true, you can't. Now, you can convict a defendant on the basis of Michael Cohen's testimony and documents with the signatures and handwriting of Jeff McConney and Allen Weisselberg and the testimony of Stormy Daniels and other witnesses that have come in.The idea that Michael Cohen's testimony is critical and it's important, however, it's not the entire case. And just look at the fact that the judge, if he hasn't yet, will almost certainly deny a motion from the defense to end the case right here because of the fact that a jury could plausibly convict the defendant here. Now, that's not to say he will, but there's plenty of evidence in the record, even in spite of some of the credibility issues that some of the witnesses have. And I think the defense, yes, they're taking their time at -- the prosecution is taking their time at doing it, but they are noting that even in spite of some of these credibility issues, there is a quite full record here that could, not necessarily will, but could lead to a defendant's conviction.",

It's an argument. You know, I have a hard time seeing that, but still, you know, it's a possibility. It's not -- to clarify a little bit. Sometimes you have in a homicide case, the guy's charged with killing somebody, but also possessing a firearm. And in the room, the jury will trade the charges and convict on the lower one and not the homicide. Here, you have 34 of the exact same thing. Maybe they're looking for a way to cut things up.

As an example yes, Blanche went after Michael Cohen, but there was the middle of his testimony that sort of seemed to wander into the weeds. He's talking about Stormy Daniels and David Pecker. It wasn't exactly clear what the point was. By all accounts, Steinglass, who is apparently a very well respected prosecutor, seems to be following an arc, a timeline, and has very clear documents to back it up. Whether that works with the jury tomorrow, we don't know yet, but there really does seem to be a distinct difference.

We had evidence suggesting that he was involved in everything.What the prosecution appears to be trying to do here is make the argument that, certainly even if Donald Trump was distanced from some of the actions that gave rise to the actions here, he would necessarily have been aware of what was going on. Now, again, that's all circumstantial evidence because you don't have a direct statement of Donald Trump saying, I know you're paying a porn star to help my campaign, but there's plenty of evidence in the record that seems to suggest that well, you know, a reasonable juror could find that he was aware based on habit and practices of the Trump Organization.",

Was he lying or were they reimbursements for a previous payoff to Stormy Daniels and for other purposes?So, I asked and expected to hear the answer from the defense attorney. What was the $130,000 in Allen Weisselberg's handwriting doing on that sheet of paper? What did it mean? Will 12 jurors say, well, of course, that 130,000 is the same number that was paid to Stormy Daniels? Those aren't legal fees. That's a reimbursement for what Michael Cohen paid.

The two questions in this case, one is, were they legal fees? Of course they weren't. The payment that Weisselberg wrote, $130,000, was about reimbursing Cohen for the hush money. The first question, though, is, was the money paid to Stormy Daniels for campaign related reasons? Who had said yes to that question? Because if the answer is yes, then Donald Trump committed the same crime that Michael Cohen was sent to jail for. Hope Hicks, a close ally, said it was all about the campaign. David Pecker, a close friend of Donald Trump, said it's all about the campaign. What has the defense attorney said about those two pro-Trump, close friends of Trump witnesses? It was all about the campaign. Whether you like it or not, Federal law says if you give money for political motivations beyond campaign finance limits, that's a crime. In this case, Michael Cohen went to jail for that crime. And what the New York State prosecutors are saying is, if Michael Cohen went to jail for that crime, then so should the man that federal prosecutors, working for Donald Trump's administration, called he directed Michael Cohen to make those payments for which he did the time.

And here the defense goes first, and then the prosecution. If you believe in primacy and recency coming out of the block strong and finishing strong, it's an important thing to have in mind. I don't think I would have started with thanking the jury and mumbling a bit.If your theory of the case is Michael Cohen is the centerpiece, I think it would have played a compendium of prior consistent statements that came in, let the jury here, Cohen convincingly saying something else. But I think they make a mistake. Look taglines like GLOAT and MVP can be effective, I've had them effective, had the Latin King's case in which I had to defend their witness, turn to the jury and tell them he was a master liar, and that was stuck with the jury. But here, greatest liar of all time, you don't need that. Goebbels was a pretty bad liar or this is Trump's liar would be the response to that. I think that those things are dangerous. Here, I would personally I think played the two lawyers to some degree. I'm looking for a hung jury in this case.
