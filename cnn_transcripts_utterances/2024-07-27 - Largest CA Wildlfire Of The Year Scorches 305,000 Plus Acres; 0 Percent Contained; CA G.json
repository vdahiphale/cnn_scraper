It has consumed an area larger than the size of Los Angeles and is 0 percent contained. It even sparked a fire tornado, a vortex of flames, and ash spurred on by turbulent winds. And for some residents, just seeing smoke from the Park Fire is enough to bring back horrible memories of 2018's Camp Fire, which incinerated much of the nearby town of Paradise. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

More than 1,000 tests have been run on the ground to understand why the Starliner's thrusters stopped working. It now appears expanding Teflon seals may have choked off the flow of fuel. Despite the new discovery, there's still no timetable for bringing home the astronauts, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams. To help understand all of this, let's bring in Leroy Chiao.

And so I would fully expect Butch and Suni to come down on Starliner. But in the worst case, where things dramatically got worse or some new problem cropped up, of course, contingency plans are in place. We can actually -- probably we would delay them longer. But a Dragon spacecraft could be reconfigured that could also bring them home. Dragon is designed to take up to six people coming down so -- or going up and coming down.

And this -- on earth, those kinds of things are indicative of microbial life that exist in water.
