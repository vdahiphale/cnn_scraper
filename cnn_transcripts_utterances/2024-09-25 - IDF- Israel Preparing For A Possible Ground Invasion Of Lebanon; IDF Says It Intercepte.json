The IDF released this video showing Lieutenant General Herzi Halevi visiting troops, you can see there in northern Israel. He told them they could soon enter enemy territory to destroy Hezbollah. Israel also keeping up airstrikes on Lebanon, saying it hit more than 280 Hezbollah targets just today, and it's calling up two reserve brigades to join the fight. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to use full force until residents of northern Israel can return to their homes. Hezbollah is also escalating attacks, firing its first ever ballistic missile, as you can see there at Tel Aviv. It says it targeted Mossad headquarters in defense of Lebanon and the people of Gaza. Israel says the missile, as you can see, was intercepted.

      "sentences": "Well, realistically, these are two different areas which could require two different solutions.We have been reporting for quite some time that U.S. officials were hopeful that bringing together a ceasefire and a hostage release deal in Gaza would then bring down the fighting, bring down the tensions that we have seen exacerbated on the northern border of Israel. But now, without that deal in place, we're now seeing a very increased escalation between Northern Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. And so, U.S. officials have really no choice at this moment but to focus on that. And as we have reported, our colleagues have reported, U.S. officials are urgently working to try and bring together some sort of diplomatic solution that can de-escalate the situation there and then, of course, they would have to turn back to Gaza where the war continues to rage on. But, significantly, that U.S. support for a ceasefire and support for a hostage release deal, it really hasn't been actively worked on in recent weeks. We saw the Secretary of State travel to the region last week to Egypt. I was with him. He notably did not go to Israel. It was the first time that he had traveled to the region and not gone to Israel since we have seen the back and forth that he has done, this shuttle diplomacy after October 7th. And U.S. officials are saying at this moment, when it comes to Gaza, when it comes to the conversations with Israel and Hamas and Sinwar, that effectively, the U.S. can't want this deal more than those two parties do. And what they say right now is that Hamas and Sinwar have shown that they do not want a deal. But when or if they decide they do, it'll be incumbent on the U.S. to pressure Netanyahu to actually come to that deal. But effectively, they believe that even if they try and put different forms of, you know, a proposal on the table, it's not necessarily going to be accepted because both parties don't have the political will right now to actually say yes. And so, that is where they are at a dead end. There's some conversations about changing their strategy here. But for this moment in time, while the U.N. General Assembly is happening, they're really focused on trying to deescalate between Hezbollah and Israel.",

Let me pick up where my colleague, Kylie Atwood, just left off. We've heard in the last 24 hours or so that the Biden administration has all but paused the push for a Gaza ceasefire as well as hostage deal when we're also hearing that the Biden administration is now working urgently on a plan to mediate a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. Just speak to what is unfolding right now in the Middle East and your concerns or perhaps frustrations here, Prime Minister.",

Norway'sposition has been clear, you know, as we have condemned the 7th of October attack last year. We've also been very clear that the warfare going on from Israel's side is not proportional. It's really a breach of what international law sets of limits, and it's a kind of a disaster unfolding in Gaza. I appreciate that these negotiations have been very hard, that either party have not been making the right move to get to some kind of agreement. And then, comes Lebanon in the north. So, I can only, you know, encourage and support whatever the U.S. can do to put pressure on the parties. And we try, I think, as Europeans to try to be constructive in the same direction. But it is really up to the key parties here, Israel and Hamas concerning Gaza. And to find some solutions when it comes to the border with Lebanon and the fight with Hezbollah. Both are dangerous conflicts because they risk escalating into something which is much broader and I think it's important that we also here at the U.N. now do what we can to avoid that escalation. And I'm hopeful that we can manage at least to avoid that that further disaster.",

The otherconcern as well is this -- and we've heard this before from the Hezbollah side is that, you know, what could bring a pause is a ceasefire in Gaza. The Israelis, of course, want their hostages back as well. We're almost a year now, almost a year since this war started on October the 7th by Hamas. Why do you think, Prime Minister, we have failed, you think to get a ceasefire agreement?",

I think for Hamas, it's about maintaining their position in Gaza of the resistant force. They want to keep that alive. And on the Israeli side, I don't see that, you know, they either have an interest of ending their ability to go after Hamas. But it brings us back to this issue. What security threat will Israel face from a population of more than 2 million people? We have seen almost 80 percent of everything being destroyed. This is not going to enhance security. It is extremely short sighted. I appreciate Israel's right to defend itself after 7th of October. It is clearly written into international law. But international law is also very clear on the proportionality of this. So, I think, you know, it is a great tragedy unfolding because so many people are suffering. So, many people are being killed. And nobody seemed to be in a position to impress upon Hamas to release the hostages and get the ceasefire, and on Israel to stop this fighting, which is just, you know, fueling more conflicts. And let me just also add, because we don't mention it enough, the West Bank. That is, I think, is of great concern because the current Israeli government, Prime Minister Netanyahu and his ministers, are putting life in danger there by weakening and destroying the Palestinian Authority and weakening any protection of civilians on the West Bank. And I think that's really needs to get our attention.",

In August, and correct me if there's any new developments here, Israel revoked the diplomatic status of eight Norwegian diplomats working in the Palestinian territories.

And you know, Norway works now with our Arab colleagues, with our Gulf State colleagues, so that there is a dialogue ongoing on how you can work towards a broader framework of a two-state solution once there is ceasefire in the one conflict and the other. But the drama now is there seems to be, as one conflict is still emerging, another one adds to the big theater on conflicts. But we have to also keep the long-term perspective, because this has huge implications from far beyond the Middle East. And I want to be clear, you know, we didn't talk about Ukraine in this conversation, but when we talk about Ukraine and their right for self- defense, people in the south say that, you know, if we don't treat Palestinians with equal rights, we have double language.

And even after this report, the Secret Service isn't denying anything, and, in fact, in a statement said that this, in fact, matches up with their own investigation into the Butler rally that day. I mean, just another example, the Secret Service was tracking credible threats from Iran against Former President Donald Trump and local police officers in Pennsylvania didn't know that that was something that the Secret Service was watching. So, just across the board, a breakdown in communication with no one clearly in charge and no clear answers about how to fix these issues.",
