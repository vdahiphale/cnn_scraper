We have been asking the question about how Republicans across the country, particularly Trump voters, might view this indictment and if it's any indication in Georgia, at this GOP Convention, they are still viewing Trump favorably. Now, I want to show one other small piece of video, and that was Trump going to the waffle house after he gave that speech. And the reason I'm showing this video is because I want to show who's in the video with him. Walt Nauta, that is his body man, his aide who was charged alongside him in these conspiracy charges. There had been questions as to what was going to happen after Nauta was charged. It appears that, at least for now, he is sticking by Trump's side. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's also the author of the \"Modern Presidency: Six Debates that Define the Institution.\" Thanks so much for being with us here again.

MICHAEL GENOVESE, POLITICAL ANALYST, AUTHOR \"THE MODERN PRESIDENCY\" AND PRESIDENT, GLOBAL POLICY INSTITUTION, LOYOLA MARYMOUNT UNIVERSITY: It was vintage Trump. Even a rerun of the last four years. We've heard this speech before, at least most of it. A lot of rants. A lot of grievances. He was talking about fascists, communists, Stalinists, cowards. He called the special counsel deranged. He called the D.A. from Georgia a lunatic. And so, he was relitigating the past. The surprisingness in his speech today, I think, if there is one, is that he really didn't spend a lot of time on an active defense in light of the indictment. He let that slide and went on an attack, which didn't really focus on the charges against him. BRUNHUBER:  Yes. I mean, you know, going after the special counsel personally when could one would imagine Trump's defense team shaking their collective heads there. You talk about that sense of grievance.

During COVID, for instance, he did not do that because, of course, they did not want to -- people did not want to have large crowds in St. Peter's Square. So, he did it via -- it was broadcast via the internet when he conducted the angelus. But this will be the first time when he could but cannot conduct the angelus in public. In fact, back in 2021 when he underwent and operation to remove part of his colon, he actually did conduct the angelus Gemelli Hospital from one of the balconies behind me. But this time, the doctors recommended they can't really order the pope to do anything. So, they recommended he not go out on the balcony and put any strain on his abdomen after the surgery he underwent last Wednesday. Now, apparently, this was a surgery that was not necessary to do now, but the pope wanted to do it because he has a very busy schedule ahead of him later in the summer. Now, doctors say it will take about three months from him to recovery -- recover from this surgery. But in August, in the beginning of August, he is scheduled to go to Portugal to participate in World Youth Day there. And then, at the end of the month, he's doing a first ever papal visit to Mongolia for several days. And so, the hope is that he will be adequately recovered by then to undergo -- to participate in these fairly stressful activities for a man of 86 years old. Kim.",
