Do you agree?DONALD TRUMP (R) FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think I'm entitled to personal attacks. I don't have a lot of respect for her. I don't have a lot of respect for her intelligence. And I think she will be a terrible president. What's the last name of Kamala? Nobody knew. It's Harris nobody knew the last name. I don't even use it because nobody knows who I'm talking about. I did nothing wrong. I have crooked judges, I have crooked prosecutors, it's all a rigged deal, just like Fani, F-A-N-I, Fani with her boyfriend, but with Hillary she was subpoenaed by Congress to give everything she's got and she burned it. She acid washed, BleachBit, they call it. She totally scrubbed it. And yet Hillary Clinton when it came time to make a decision, I said, I don't want to put the wife of the president of the United States in prison. I want the country to come together and to be unified. And here it is a few years later. And these people say, let's put him -- why? Because I challenged an election, because I want to challenge an election or some other reason. It's a really disgraceful thing. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, the impulse was correct. He did talk about it for a little bit of the time. That was correct.But when you dilute it with everything else and you get off message and you just put so much other stuff in the basket. It kind of covers it up. And so, ultimately, he's the only one who can make the decision to get focused and stay focused and stay on it with her and advisers, new advisers, old. It doesn't really matter. It's really on his shoulders because he's the star of the show. And when he talks, people listen and some of what they heard today was great and absolutely correct and inflation is bad and some of what they heard today was way off the beaten path. He's going to have to decide how comfortable he is doing it that way for the rest of the election. I mean, there's an audience for it. I am not it.

He was asked about Israel today and he basically said, they need to stop the killing and they need to wrap this up. What's the plan? How are you going to do that?
