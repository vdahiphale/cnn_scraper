      "sentences": "Up first for us, though, a final CNN snapshot of the midterm climate and it is beyond bleak for the Democrats. Let's set the stage. Remember, Republicans need only a net gain of five, 220 to 212 right now. Republicans need only a net gain of five to take back the House of Representatives. Let's start there with the battle for the House.The president's approval rating, always the North Star in a midterm election season. Look at this as we get closer to election day. The president's approval rating down in our new poll to 41 percent, disapproval up nearly six in 10 Americans as we get very close to election day, disapprove of the president's job, as he's handling right now. So, take that, this is the national map. Look at this when we bring up just the competitive seats for the House. The president's approval rating is down, every point it goes down. Republican hopes go up in every one of these competitive districts. Now add in this, what is your choice when you vote for Congress? Some of you have already voted early. Some of you will vote in the next several days. Everybody finishes by Tuesday. Look at this, a month ago, we had Democrats with a small lead on your choice. You're going to vote Democrat or Republican in your congressional district. Now look, Republicans have an advantage heading into the final days outside of the margin of error 51 percent, a majority of Americans plan to vote Republican or Congress, that helps Republicans in every one of these competitive districts. Those are national numbers. These are more competitive districts. If the president's approval rating is down, the Republican vote is up. You look at these 78 competitive districts. That is great news for Republicans. Now let's switch maps. And take a look and view some of the other numbers in the context of the Senate battlefield control. They impact the House as well. But here's where we are in the Senate. 50-50 going into election day. Now we switch the map this way. This is how we write the races. The yellows are tossups, the light read lean Republican, the light blue lean Democrat. The economy is dominating in the final days, and that hurts the democratic chances. Remember, back after the Dobbs' decision in June, Democrats that abortion would help them in the suburbs here, help them in the suburbs here, maybe in red states like Ohio, and Wisconsin in the suburbs, certainly out in Arizona and Nevada, and in Colorado and more. That's what the Democrats thought, and you saw evidence of that in August and in September. But now look at where we are, as we get closer to election day. Number one, the economy is dominating the discussion. Look at these numbers. This is a change election. 72 percent of Americans think the country is going badly. Only 28 percent think things are going well. And so, what are people voting on? This tells you everything you need to know, as we head into the final days. Excuse me for turning my back, just to stretch this out a little bit. Democrats had hoped the abortion issue would at least compete with the economy and inflation. It's not a competition as we head closer to election day. 51 percent say the economy and inflation is the top issue, only 15 percent say abortion, 9 percent say elections. The economy is dominating in voters mind and that is why Republicans are stressing it, is that he tried to win across the board in their final ads. (VIDEO PLAYING)",

Just to underscore what the Republican advantage is on this issue, 71 percent of those voters are planning to vote for the Republican, 26 percent are planning to vote for the Democrat in their congressional district. That is a 45-point advantage on issue number one.So, you've got the overall mood like you're saying. You have an issue environment, that advantages Republicans, and you have the unpopularity of Biden.

It's hard to find. If you look, one of the big questions in an election years, which is, are you enthusiastic about voting? Midterm elections tend to be about the party in power base.Look at these numbers when it comes to, are you extremely enthusiastic to vote. Back in October 2010, if you go back that, look, there you see the Republican advantage. That was when Barack Obama lost 63 seats and lost the House. Look at the Republican advantage. Then move forward to November 2018, Democrats had only a slight advantage when it came to enthusiasm. And yet they took the House back under Donald Trump. If you look at now, look at that edge in Republican enthusiasm, Nia-Malika Henderson, and it looks very much like 2010, which was a big wave election. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yes. That was the show lacking in the words of Obama. And I think you hear from Democrats, the nervousness about what this election is going to look back. There was some, you know, optimism weeks ago, you know, in the sort of last weeks of the summer, but that pretty much has dissipated, is dissipated, partly because gas prices are up. They had been sliding down a little bit. They're going up now. Partly it's just history. The party in power tends to lose seats. Some of it is structural. You've got an issue with black voters, are they going to actually turn out in the way that they turn out in presidential elections? And sort of the Democratic base is such a diverse base, right? It's young people, it's African Americans, it's Latinos, it's college educated white voters. Can they have a sort of issue set that brings all those voters together, makes them enthusiastic, mobilizes them and gets to the polls? It's a very tall order for them. KING: It's tall order. Look, we have these new numbers, campaigns have numbers just about every day. They have as numbers as good, if not better than our numbers, which is one of the reasons to the enthusiasm question. Democrats see this coming, which is why the former President Barack Obama is out there, trying to convince Democrats, you might be discouraged. Maybe you're mad at the president, votes. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA 44TH U.S. PRESIDENT: But I'm here to tell you, Nevada, tuning out is not an option. Moping and feeling cynical is not an option.
