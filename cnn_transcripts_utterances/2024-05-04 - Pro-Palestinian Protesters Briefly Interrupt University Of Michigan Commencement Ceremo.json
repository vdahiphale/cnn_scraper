And we're following new developments in the college campus unrest we have seen across the country.Today, pro-Palestinian protesters interrupted the commencement ceremony at the University of Michigan. The event was briefly delayed as police guided those demonstrating graduates away from the ceremony. It is the latest in weeks of unrest gripping America's colleges. Protesters have been calling for an end to the war in Gaza and for schools to divest from Israeli linked entities. So far, police have arrested more than 2,100 people on about 40 university campuses. CNN's Whitney Wild is on the University of Michigan campus where there was a disruption at the ceremony there.",

      "sentences": "Well, it was interesting. When we were here earlier at -- before the ceremony began, we walked around the entirety of Michigan Stadium, and we did not see any indication there would be protests. We did not see protesters. We didn't see any flags. We didn't see any signs. And it was only once the ceremony got underway about 15 minutes in, as the Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro spoke, that protesters made their presence very clear.I'll give you just a sense of how close those protesters got to the stage. So, to my left, here is the stage where a long list of speakers was speaking. And again, this happened during the Secretary of the Navy speech. And then, if you come to look over my shoulder to the right here, it was right in the center of this field -- that Michigan Field where a group of protesters, between a dozen and two dozen protesters made a very vocal protest. They were chanting, they had flags. What was apparent though, was Michigan State Police were not going to allow those protesters to get any closer to the stage. More than a dozen police officers on top of those protesters immediately. The clash was not at all violent. It was very peaceful. And after -- I'd say about five minutes, police guided those protesters outside. And we heard very little after that. There were no disruptions. But the -- but the Secretary of the Navy did take a moment during his speech. And it's not clear if this was adlibbed, or this was pre planned, but did take a moment to acknowledge the ROTC members who are graduating today, and made a point of saying that their service is to protect speech. So, certainly acknowledging the protests that was going on around him even though his speech was disrupted. It was a very brief disruption. The rest of the ceremony went off smoothly. We have reached out to the Michigan State Police to find out if any of those students were detained. Whitney Wild, CNN, and over Michigan.",

      "sentences": "Yes, and you have seen administration officials really watching with a level of concern as these protests unfold on campuses.And that letter from the education secretary really spelling out the degree of concern inside his department, but also, telling these colleges that there are resources from the Biden administration that they can provide, if requested, when it comes to this issue of anti- Semitism and battling some of the hate speech that we have been seeing on campuses. And so, you really are seeing the Biden administration and President Biden himself really trying to thread a needle here. And you heard the president in that short speech that he delivered on Thursday, really talked about one: the necessity to allow free speech and to allow protests on campus; but two, to make sure that the free speech doesn't cross over into hate speech. And you heard him say very directly that while dissent is essential to democracy, it cannot spill over into discord. And at the end of the day, the president really is caught in some pretty strong political crosscurrents here. On the one side, he doesn't want to alienate some of these young people who are protesting, he will rely on them if he has to win reelection in November. But on the other hand, he doesn't necessarily want to be seen as provide -- a presiding over chaos in the streets. That's never a good look for an incumbent president. So, he did kind of strike the balance in that speech. Now, today, and over the next several days, what the president is doing is preparing for quite a significant speech on anti-Semitism. It's scheduled for Tuesday on Capitol Hill. It's part of Holocaust Remembrance Day, and he will speak about this issue that he has spoken about pretty strongly before he has set up a task force to combat anti-Semitism. What this speech will really be a sort of an expansion of the themes that the president was talking about on Thursday. But when you talk about college commencements, college graduations, the president is also gearing up to look -- to deliver his own commencement address, two weeks from tomorrow at Morehouse College. His presence there on campus has generated some controversy at the campus down there in Atlanta. Some students, some faculty wanting to discuss his presence there. At the end of the day, it was very interesting what the president said. As he was leaving the room on Thursday, he was asked whether these protests would cause him to reconsider his stance towards the Middle East. He said no. And I think that really does boil down some of the predicament that the president is in. While he is very eager to say that these students have the right to protest, he also says he isn't changing the stance, which some of them are protesting. So, the president sort of caught in a bind here but very eager to demonstrate that he is on top of it, and that he isn't allowing free speech to cross over into hate speech. Fredricka.",

So, that is about -- it's a cliff area by the ocean at about 50 miles south of downtown Ensenada. Still part of the Ensenada municipality, but a little bit out of downtown, a little about of the urban area.And these are cliffs, so, that go directly onto the ocean. So, there is maybe some speculation by the -- by the investigators that is an area where the surfers were trying to get to access the sea. Remember that they have been missing since at least the 29th of April. So, almost a week now that they have been waiting. Unfortunately, because we are talking on it on a Saturday, Fredricka, we still have to wait a few more hours, and hopefully, not a few more days before those identification have been completed those forensic examination, which are essentially are DNA checks. We know that the families of both the American Tourister and the Australian surfers have arrived, are traveling towards Mexico, to be around this investigation, to provide how whatever help they can with that, especially the forensic examination. But at the same time, Fredricka, I think this is a moment also to step back and understand the context where this appearance has occurred that like, we're talking about three theories there. But there are a hundred -- more than 116,000 people that are missing. in Mexico right now. These are Forster disappearance in the majority of these cases, some families haven't seen their loved one for years, and still do not want to give up the hope, of one day, being able to find them. Just this week, an NGO in the city of in southern Mexico -- in Mexico City. So, the capital. And discover that a mass grave that was meant, they believe, that is where some of these bodies could have been could have been taken. So, I don't want to mix the two stories. But it's important to point out that there is a security crisis going on all around Mexico, partly since 2006, with an increase of the war on drug in the country. And that while we don't see these levels of violence directed at tourist, sometimes, well, you still are in a country that is going through a very traumatic time, Fredricka.",

The question is whether Sinwar -- or there's any more urgency in Sinwar's calculations right now. There could be. The Israelis are threatening a significant ground campaign in Rafah, destroy the last four brigades of Hamas' organized military structure. Plus, the Americans are putting pressure on the Qataris if -- or reported pressure on the Qataris, that if Sinwar doesn't agree to this deal, Hamas' external leadership is going to be expelled from Doha in Qatar. So it's possible. I don't think Sinwar is interested in a comprehensive deal. I think we're talking about a first phase here. Which would be roughly, if the press reports are true, 33 Israeli hostages. That wouldn't be the women, the elderly, and the infirm, in exchange for an undetermined number of Palestinians, probably nearing 600, 700, 800. And a temporary ceasefire of about 40 days.

The popular seafood chain restaurant lost millions of dollars on all- you-can-eat deals after misjudging just how hungry customers were. Red Lobster is now reportedly considering filing for bankruptcy. Say it ain't so. Joining me right now is CNN consumer reporter, Nathaniel Meyersohn.

But it was terrible for Red Lobster because they lost all this money with -- with people loading up on cheap shrimp.But it's not just the deal last year for endless shrimp. This is part of a long decline for Red Lobster. You look back at its sales in 2013, they were about $2.6 billion in sales. That's dropped last year to $1.9 billion in sales. So a long decline here. Part of it also has to do with mismanagement. I spoke to former executives at Red Lobster. The company's recently been owned by a Thai seafood supplier. And the Thai company just didn't really know what to do with Red Lobster, according to these former executives. So the brand has really struggled. And then also competition. You think about all of them, the fast, casual restaurants, like Chipotle and Panera. A lot of people switching to there instead of Red Lobster.",
