We got a DJ who is also playing the trumpet. We're going to expect hundreds of people crowding up on where we are right here, edge at Hudson Yard, because this is the best view of New York City for these fireworks that are just coming up in a little less than an hour now.And I do got to say, everyone is getting in on the action. The buildings here on the New York City skyline, they're covered in red, white, and blue. We also had an NYPD helicopter fly by and wave to the entire crowd up here. Again, 1,100 feet up. That's how far I were up. And the fun thing is also, Dana and Boris, that the fireworks, they're also going to be 1,000 feet up in the air. So when I tell you that there is no better view of these fireworks in New York City, I am telling you the truth. And I'm glad that we can share this view with you.
