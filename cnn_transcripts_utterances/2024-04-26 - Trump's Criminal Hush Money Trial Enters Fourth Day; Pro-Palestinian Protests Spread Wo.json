And we start this hour right here in New York, where the court is now taking a well-deserved lunch break, but in about 15 minutes from now, prosecutors will continue with their redirect examination of David Pecker in Donald Trump's criminal hush money trial. Now, they are trying to re-establish the former tabloid executive's credibility after the defense exposed what were small inconsistencies in his statements during cross-examination. The defense attorneys are trying to portray the alleged \"catch and kill\" scheme to bury negative stories about Trump as in fact, nothing out of the ordinary. Meantime, it's not that clear if a second witness in this case will be called to testify today, CNN's Zachary Cohen joins us now from Washington. You've been tracking all of this testimony, we can just sum up what we saw this morning, given the defense, again, trying to poke holes in the credibility, and the fact that we're on a bit of a cliff-hanger here because this testimony could wrap up in the next hour, and we don't know who the next witness is going to be.",

David Pecker of the tabloid king has been on the stand for about 10 hours now, answeringquestions from both Trump's defense attorneys and from prosecutors. And we've witnessed our colleagues in the courtroom have witnessed sort of a tug of war over David Peckers credibility. You mentioned the defense attorneys for Donald Trump had been trying to poke holes and undermine the credibility of Pecker's previous testimony. They have really highlighted some potential inconsistencies with what he told investigators and what he testified to previously. And as you said to the big picture, that he's trying to paint these \"catch and kill\" agreements, these stories, buying these stories and making sure that they never see the light of day as nothing out of the ordinary. And in fact, he's trying to argue that this was good for business, and that one point got David Pecker to admit that this was good for business. But when prosecutors took to the stand, they did try to reclaim some of that territory and they did get Pecker to reiterate the fact that he was buying these stories from -- you know, the stories about from Karen McDougal and others in order to help Donald Trump's presidential campaign. And that really is the center of what the prosecution's cases here. They want to establish a need to convince the jury that this was election interference, that David Pecker, Michael Cohen were conspiring with the former president to suppress these stories in order to help him get elected. And David Pecker on the stand did acknowledge again and reiterate again to prosecutors that, that was his understanding of the agreement, really highlighting and trying to present to the jury what the nature of this alleged conspiracy was, who the key players were, and how they all operated together to help Donald Trump.",

It's a bloodbath relationship that's been terminate, but Pecker is still a friend of Donald Trump, whether they socialize now or not, and they both look -- they kind of like each other. They're almost like brothers. And one respects the other and vice versa. When you have a witness like that, who likes the defendant, admires the defendant, yet tells the truth and provides inculpatory, negative information about the defendant, you can't ask for a better witness because in closing argument, the government is going to say the prosecutor is going to say, listen, you may not believe Michael Cohen, but mostly everything he said was buttressed, corroborated and supported by the dear friend, David Pecker.",

You know, they're always having alleged affairs, and we've got to, you know, get their stories and kill them. So, I did this not just for Donald Trump, I did this for Tiger Woods, Arnold Schwarzenegger, probably like 50 others that he did disclose in a courtroom. But I got to tell you that's not a good argument because Donald Trump took it a step further, his actions were specifically directed at influencing the election. This agreement was crystallized and signed, honor that, October 28th of 2016. Ironically, the same day that Director Jim Comey sent out the Hillary letter to Congress, what an irony. But there was a fervency after that \"Access Hollywood\" tape came out October 7th, that they needed to close the deal on the Stormy Daniels story. Because if that came out, it would have affected greatly the election. And that's why Donald Trump's relationship with Pecker is unique. It's sui generis. It's taken it up a notch. They had to hide that payment from federal election officials because it was intended to affect the election. And then they compounded the problem by lying on their taxes and their business invoices.",

And what began as a small encampment at ColumbiaUniversity in New York has now swelled into a protest movement, really worldwide. More campuses across the U.S. are seeing pro-Palestinian demonstrations today. As you can see there, very wide from east to the west coast, from the University of Michigan, to the University of North Carolina, to multiple colleges in California. Some schools have been arresting protesters while others are leaving the encampments alone, at least for now. The students' demands include a ceasefire in Gaza as well as divestment from companies linked to Israel's war. Protests also spreading overseas, including in Germany, right here in the U.K. and Australia. Police in Berlin cleared this encampment in front of the parliament building today. And in France, we are seeing dramatic scenes at a prestigious university in the heart of Paris for a third straight day. Melissa Bell is joining us live from Paris. But first, I want to go to Polo Sandoval at the epicenter of these protests, Columbia University in New York.

And we've also heard from Columbia officials, both of them saying that there has been progress made in the last several days to try to find some sort of common ground, or remind our viewers around the world what those demands are. When you hear from some of these students, the investment and also amnesty for the students and the faculty that are already faced any sort of academic discipline for their participation and demonstrations, Columbia University, basically wants to be able to clear out the space so that they can begin the preparations for the graduation ceremonies or piles of tiles that they usually use to cover the areas so that you can have really thousands of people here to participate in the graduation. The commencement ceremony in a matter of weeks here. What we've also heard, however, from some of our colleagues that have been also speaking to some of these students, and just last night, leaders briefed the group, and what they told them is that they are currently trying to negotiate a statement from the president to be able to be issued, that would address the incident from last week. I'm referring to when Columbia University called on NYPD to remove a previous encampment here, and at the same time, they also said that they have not yet been satisfied with what the university is offering, which means that there is technically no end in sight. We're entering yet another weekend with this encampment. And so, this is going to be something they're going to be watching for the next few days. Finally, we will be hearing from some of the activist in a few moments, and we'll bring you any potential update when it comes to those negotiations now, days-long conversations that happened.",

You can see what's happening behind me now. That is the building that they've been occupying since yesterday evening. A much bigger police presence here these last few hours, that's because Isa, we understand that the police's plan at this stage is to evacuate this street, on the other side of that police line, dozens still of protesters sitting, you can hear them chanting and determined to stay, they keep chanting. We won't be moved. But the police have been announcing to them that anyone left will be arrested. I think one of the big questions at this stage is whether once they clear the streets, and they've been moving closer and closer on the other side towards the students, whether the police, they go inside the building, controversially, that's what happened on Wednesday night, first night the protests -- the police actually went to get the last protesters from inside.

Now Prosecutor Joshua Steinglass is now continuing his redirect examination of David Pecker, the former publisher of the National Enquirer. Defense Attorney Emil Bove is expected to question him again shortly. Again picking up where the prosecutor leaves off in terms of a redirect. Pecker's been testifying about the deal he helped broker with adult film star Stormy Daniels and the tabloid's efforts to suppress negative stories that could have damaged Trump's 2016 campaign. Meantime, Judge Merchan says he'll consider four additional gag order violations that are alleged to have occurred by the former president. The hearing on that is set for next Thursday.

And that is key here in terms of what the former president is accused of. Are white collar crimes. Now we've already heard nearly four days of testimony in this case. One witness. David Pecker, what kind of a witness do you believe he was for the jury in terms of being that person that gives them an overarching snapshot of this alleged cover up? DAVID WEINSTEIN, FORMER STATE &amp; FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: I think he was a great first witness to give this jury a picture of what's going on inside this uncharged conspiracy and the allegations that have been leveled against the former president. He was there with the people who participated in coming up with the payments, who was going to make the payments, how they were going to be made. And more importantly insight as to what the former president knew, how interactive he was with these people, how controlling he was of the situation. And that what they were really doing in the words of this witness were engaging in acts that were connected to the campaign, to campaign financing and to the election itself. So, not just paying for people not to have their stories published ad so he was a good first witness.

And that's why they try to introduce this evidence of other bad acts and bad character. And there's a hearing that takes place and the judge has to evaluate whether or not that's going to then become overwhelming part of the case or whether the jurors are going to focus on the testimony regarding the bad acts that occurred in a particular case itself. And in this instance, the court of appeals said, well, what happened was exactly what we don't want to happen. You shouldn't have let all that other testimony come in about uncharged crimes. It tainted the jury. They focused on that more than they did on the actual testimony. And that's why we're reversing the conviction. Now the impact is going to be felt. In the current case that's pending in New York involving the former president, if everybody would recall, there was a hearing just before the start of the case where the judge held what's called a Sandoval hearing. And that's where the prosecution says. We'd like to question the defendant if he takes a stand about other bad acts that he's committed specifically. The results in the case that was brought by the attorney general involving fraud and misrepresentations and documents and records by the Trump organization where there was a finding against him and then the two libel cases that were brought against him where he lost in those cases as well. And what the judge said was if he takes a stand, I'll let you question him about that. I would suspect that perhaps the prosecution maybe is going to rethink that position. I'm quite frankly surprised the defense hasn't filed a motion to have a rehearing on that in the light of the decision that was just handed down. Because the one thing nobody wants in this case is to have built in error and have potentially a conviction overturned by something they could have avoided. So, I think that the decision in the Harvey Weinstein case is going to impact on some thinking by both sides in this case.",

We know that as she entered the room, this is, of course, from our own producers inside the courtroom, saying that Trump looked over at her. She did not appear to glance at his table or on her walk to the witness stand, but we know that the assistant district attorney, Susan Hoffinger, is now handling the direct examination of Rhona Graff. Of course, as soon as there are any more developments, we will, of course, bring that to you. But David Pecker is now off the stand over what? Over ten hours or so. On the stand for over four days.

Blinken said the talks were candid and one area of their conversation touched on a delicate issue. CNN U.S. Security Correspondent Kylie Atwood spoke exclusively with Blinken and here's her report. KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: The secretary said his conversations with his Chinese counterparts here in Beijing were certainly better than they were last time he was here, ten months ago. He said both sides were forthright about their differences, but one area where there will only be growing tension is concerns about China meddling in U.S. upcoming presidential elections.
