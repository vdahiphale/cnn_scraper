In Morocco, the country's military is now at the epicenter of a deadly quake, which left almost 3000 people dead, soldiers working to remove debris from the roads to access remote villages in the Atlas Mountains. Israel Supreme Court is hearing arguments today and an historic case over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's planning to overhaul the country's judicial system. And Kim Jong-Un has arrived in Russia. We're waiting to see where and when he meets with Vladimir Putin to discuss a potential arms deal for the war in Ukraine. Well, a stunning and heartbreaking announcement coming from Libya, while we've been on air in the past. Medical officials say hospitals in the Northeastern City of Derna are out of service and morgues they say are full capacity. Derna is the worst hit city after massive flooding destroyed two dams and swept away neighborhoods. Officials say at least 2000 people have died and thousands more are missing. CNN's Eleni Giokos brings us more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELENI GIOKOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Chaos as volunteers from the Libyan Red Crescent scrambles to save residence. Put him in the car one of the rescuers says bring him here. A tireless effort, but limited by the sheer scale of floods that swept Eastern Libya. The full scale of the disaster visible in the daylight, the earth ripped apart, houses destroyed or completely washed away, and thousands dead and missing. Apocalyptic scenes stretching farther than the eye can see. The culprit Storm Daniel, the same that ravaged Greece and Bulgaria last week, it made its way back into the Mediterranean, picking up strength before crashing down on Libya. The downpour several times higher than the rain Libya usually sees in the entire month of September too much for the war torn countries infrastructure to handle. In Derna, one of the hardest hit cities two dams reportedly collapsed, wiping out a quarter of the city. Rescuers have been faced with a catastrophic scene.",

The infrastructure there simply could not handle that amount of rain in such a short period of time. And it was all because of what we called Storm Daniel. It took on a medication which is like a hurricane in the Mediterranean type characteristics as it plowed into the eastern sections of Libya. And you can see the rainfall totals here were very impressive. Derna saw upwards of 240 millimeters, but just to the west of that an area called El- Bayda that received 414 millimeters just in a 24 hour period and that is a record for that location. And that is why we saw the bulk of the flooding take place in that northeastern tip of Libya. Now I had a producer asked me it just seems like we've hit these heavy rainfall events that are happening so often. And they just pour they downpour and they downpour well what is happening. Remember, we got a go back to pre-industrial average our Earth has warmed about 1.2 degrees Celsius. What that does in turn, as it allows our atmosphere to hold more water vapor. More water vapor equals the potential for heavier rain events to occur more frequently and with more extremity as well. Now look at this. This is interesting as well. We dug deep into Benghazi Libya. This is of course a little bit west of the Derna region. But you could see the dry season clearly during the Northern Hemisphere summer month's starts to uptick into August and September. But the intertropical convergence zone where we get that thunderstorm activity typically during this time of year as well south of this area for a storm to move across the Mediterranean from Greece all the way into Libya. We don't typically see that and that is why the infrastructure was so dry, couldn't handle that amount of rain in such a short period of time. And unfortunately, the result was this, Becky.",

This logical next step will give our committees the full power to gather all the facts and answers for the American public. That's exactly what we want to know, the answers. I believe the President would want to answer these questions and allegations as well. This effort will be led by Chairman James Comer at the Committee on Oversight and coordination with Chairman Jim Jordan, for Judiciary Committee, and Chairman Jason Smith, on Ways and Means. I do not make this decision lightly. And regardless of your party, or who you voted for, these facts should concern all Americans. The American people deserve to know that the public offices are not for sale, under the federal government is not being used to cover up the actions of a politically associated family. Now, I would encourage the President and his team to fully cooperate with this investigation, in the interests of transparency.

      "sentences": "Yes, one big thing is that he did not say that there actually is a vote to open up an impeachmentinquiry. Remember, just on September 1st, that's when Kevin McCarthy told Breitbart News, the conservative news outlet that there would actually be a vote on the House floor to open up a formal impeachment inquiry. He did not say that just now in fact, he said that they would do is directing that key House committee, the House Oversight Committee to open up an impeachment inquiry. Now one big reason why perhaps the speaker is not moving in the direction of having a vote, he does not have enough support, a majority of the House to open up an impeachment inquiry at the moment. That's because there are a number of Republicans, including ones in swing districts, and some conservatives like Ken Buck of Colorado, who are skeptical about moving forward with an impeachment inquiry. That means that there was actually a vote to formally open up this probe going forward. At the moment, he would not have 218 votes as Democrats would vote against it. And more than four Republicans voted against it as well. So he is now telling the House Oversight Committee to move forward. And one big reason why there is not a support at the moment is because of the fact that they have yet to figure out how to come up with definitive proof or evidence to suggest that Joe Biden took official action as vice president to aid his son, Hunter Biden. Or that it's still Biden profited in any way by Hunter Biden's business dealings and these allegations of pay to play scheme. They have simply not proven yet, which is why there is a number of members who are skeptical, not just in the house, but also Senate Republicans as well. So McCarthy here, though, is still taking a very significant step by opening up an impeachment probe. Remember, if Joe Biden is in fact, impeached, he would just be the fourth president in American history to be charged with high crimes or misdemeanors. Donald Trump, of course, was impeached twice over two separate issues. But that is still the ways away. Now we're going into the part of the impeachment investigation where they have to actually continue to gather evidence, tried to build the case against Joe Biden and tried to charge him with high crimes or misdemeanors and then tried to get the boats in the house to do that. That is still a very, very heavy lift for Kevin McCarthy. But this action today, in some ways is being pushed by the far right of his conference, which has been very vocal at this moment for the speaker to move ahead on this issue. The speaker is aligning himself with that faction in his conference to move ahead with this impeachment inquiry. Now the question is what evidence will they gather? Will they actually have a vote either to formalize this inquiry at some point, or to actually impeach the president? All major, major questions is facing the speaker at this moment as he announces this historic move.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so let's start from the beginning. Israel doesn't have a constitution, the closest it has a seriesof what are called basic laws that make up this sort of quasi constitution. And also keep in mind that the way Israeli government is set up, although Benjamin Netanyahu likes to say there's three branches of governments, there's essentially two because the parliamentary system, the executive and the parliament run by the same party, and then you have the Supreme Court, which is essentially the only check on the government's power. So what happened in July is this government, this right wing government run by Benjamin Netanyahu passed an amendment to one of those basic laws. And what it did is it took away one of the Supreme Court's tools that it can use to nullify government actions. Now that was called the reasonable -- doctrine, because it meant Supreme Court could say that government action, whether it be a ministerial appointment, or something else, that is unreasonable, therefore, it cannot happen. And this law that passed in July, on party lines that nullifies their ability to do it. Now, immediately, there were petitions filed with the Supreme Court by people who said that that law is not justified. And so, now that's where we are today. The Supreme Court, this is the first day of the hearing, the hearing about essentially their own powers, and it's really bringing this sort of constitutional crisis moment, to the fore. Now we've already heard from, from both the plaintiffs, the people who are against this law, and from the government. Interestingly, actually, the government is not being represented by its own attorney general who's not a political appointee, because the attorney general is against this law. She is ironically sort of, people representing her have testified have spoken now in court, but they are actually on the other side of this issue. Now, what's interesting is the President of the Supreme Court, Esther Hayut, she is the woman that you see sitting in the middle, often we see kind of that big panel of judges. She has said, you know, there must be a mortal blow to democracy for us to strike down this law, because never before has the Supreme Court struck down and amendment struck down a basic law. They talked about it before, but they've never completely struck down. And that is what they're talking about here today. So it's hard to judge, you know, how judges are going to judge later on just what they're saying and hearing, because they grill both sides. But the quote that we talked about earlier, I think is so indicative here, of potentially where this could be ruling. And this is one of the Supreme Court justices saying democracy dies in a series of small steps. Now, we don't know how the judges will rule. They don't have a deadline for a ruling until January. But this could set Israel up for constitutional crisis, because we haven't even heard pledges from the government from the Netanyahu government that they would even abide by a Supreme Court ruling knocking down their law. And so, that could really set up a judicial a constitutional crisis for Israel that they've never seen before.",

And now we saw that the Secretary of State did issue a waiver, notifying Congress those banks overseas that hold some of these Iranian funds will be able to transfer those funds to a bank in Qatar. And then those funds will be dispersed to Iran, of course, once the American prisoners are released, so that they can use that money for humanitarian goods only. And that's really the key here that the administration has sought to emphasize is that this is not $6 billion that is simply going straight into Iranian coffers. It is something that is going to be closely monitored not only by Qatar, but also by the U.S. Treasury Department. That is not preventing, of course, Republicans in Congress from criticizing this deal as something that is essentially akin to paying a ransom. And that is how Republicans have framed this is that, there is no way for the U.S. to engage in these kinds of negotiations and deals with Iran in good faith, just given, you know how Iranian and U.S. relations are at this point and how Iran has proven itself to be not a reliable partner in these instances.

In the U.S. the DOJ says it accounts nearly 90 percent of all general search engine queries that wouldn't surprise anyone. But this big question is has it gained this dominance unlawfully?

So there's a big question as to whether that is unlawful, of course, Google says it isn't. Also, Google, of course, relies very heavily on search engine. It's interesting that more than half of alphabets revenue actually rests on the search engine. So that brings into question, what happens if Google loses this case against the DOJ, like Microsoft did back in the late 90s? Also a massive anti-trust case, probably the last big one we've seen actually is for this one. Will it involve a massive fine? Will it involve pushing Google to break up? Or will it just severely restrict what Google can do with its search engine? These are the options that Google faces if it loses this case, but we've got 10 weeks and possibly some really interesting testimony from some big tech execs. So this is going to be one to watch, Becky.",

Officials with MGM Resorts say their computer systems are nowoperational again, after a cyber-security issue affected dining hotel and gaming activities on Monday. But the situation is far from resolve. The chaos left slot machines in Vegas inoperable, forcing the company to only accept cash payments at restaurants and preventing digital keys from working. Joining us now, with more on what we understand to have happened is CNN's Natasha Chen, Natasha. NATASHA CHEN, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, well, they issued a statement late last night and with an update saying that our resorts including dining, entertainment and gaming are currently operational, and continue to deliver the experiences for which MGM is known. Our guests remain able to access their hotel rooms, and our Front Desk staff is ready to assist our guests as needed. We appreciate your patience. But if you notice, that statement doesn't really specify the status of this, the system shut down that they had to do. Their initial statement was just before midnight, Sunday into Monday, local time when they explained that they had to shut down some of their systems out of precautions to protect their data. They said that it was a cybersecurity issue that they reached out to leading external cybersecurity experts and law enforcement for help when they detected this problem. And so, it's been a rolling issue. Apparently, since Sunday, you saw that video of some of the slot machines that were down. And we've also seen some posts on social media about people, perhaps using some of the system, some of the machines now, but really just sitting there waiting for a cash payout at some of their properties. Here is an interview done by one of our Las Vegas affiliates KSNV speaking to an employee of one of the MGM casinos. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
