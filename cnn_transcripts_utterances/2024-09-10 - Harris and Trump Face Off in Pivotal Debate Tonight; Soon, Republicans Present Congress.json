This is the stage where Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump will meet face to face for the first time. With less than two months until Election Day, both candidates are determined to find an edge. Here's why. This New York Times/Siena college poll, like some of the other polls out there, showing no clear leader with both Harris and Trump locked in a statistical dead heat. Tonight, a chance to pull away. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He plays from this really old and tired playbook, right, where he -- there's no floor for him in terms of how low he will go.

She should treat it as a continuation of an interview. She needs to present what she wants to do, what her administration would do, a continuation of all of the successes, the economic successes of the Biden administration. A lot of the economic policies that she was part of with President Biden are incredibly popular, but she also has to talk about what people are feeling now, the costs, which she has talked about, how she's going to lower those, that is going to be what her plan is going to be moving forward.",

Our own CNN poll showed that the majority of voters believe that Donald Trump's policies are extremist and not in line with the values that Americans care about. So, Kamala Harris needs to underscore that she is the one that is in line with the values that Americans care about and that she is the one who will wake up every single day working for them, trying to find solutions for the problems that the American people face every day versus Donald Trump, who is only in it for himself. That montage that you showed, that's just weird and crazy and completely out of touch with what normal American people, centrist voters, Republican voters who don't want that crazy anymore. I think they will look at Kamala Harris and say, look, she is going to be focused every day on letting my family make ends meet, have a great future for my children.

And that led to a much more disciplined Donald Trump, particularly in the first 40 minutes, which is when these things are won or lost of the debate against Joe Biden back in June, and Joe Biden ended his candidacy. So, you know, I think the wise choice for Donald Trump would be to do more of the same, let Kamala Harris try to explain her inconsistencies in her policy positions, point those out and stick to policy. Don't attack her on a personal level and don't interrupt her. He's got to look more likable. He's got to try to connect.

In moments, top Republicans will present the congressional gold medal to the families of the 13 service members killed in Afghanistan as that war was winding down. House Republicans have released a years in the making report that blames the by the administration for the operation's failure.We should note that while the withdrawal did happen on President Biden's watch, former President Donald Trump did make the deal and set a deadline with the Taliban. Joining me now to talk about this is Republican Congressman Mike Waltz of Florida. He sits on the Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees, also served in Afghanistan. Coming up, I'll be talking to Congressman Jake Auchincloss of Massachusetts. But let me go to you first, Congressman Waltz. The State Department is saying -- the Biden administration is saying that this House Republican report on the Afghanistan withdrawal, quote, and we put this up on screen, issued partisan statements, cherry-picked facts and withheld testimonies from the American people. Your response to that? REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL):  Yes, they're saying it's politicized and questioning the timing. I would point out that Democrats were in charge of the House of Representatives for all of 2021, all of 2022, no investigation, no interviews, barely any hearings. They had one. So, what was politicized, I think, was basically trying to sweep this thing under the rug. This was worse than Saigon in many ways, because there wasn't necessarily an expectation that the Viet Cong were going to attack the homeland. Al Qaeda is back. ISIS is back. Americans were abandoned. And I would hope that we would just seek for lessons learned and get to the bottom of what happened. What the report shows, and these are from State Department interviews, DOD interviews, this is in their own words that the generals repeatedly, three four star generals advised Biden not to do it this way. Yes, President Trump entered a deal, but it was a conditional deal. And at the end of the day, what the Democrats are ignoring is that he left Bagram Airbase, he left 2,500 troops. He left NATO in place. He left our contractors because the Taliban didn't live up to six of the seven conditions of the deal. And then it was how the withdrawal was done. You pull out your assets, your embassy, your allies before your military, not the other way around. So, for the families, they just want someone, Kamala Harris, who was the last in the room, was she either a wallflower and had no part in this major decision, or was she at the table, they just want someone from this administration to say we did a lot of things wrong. Here's accountability. Here's transparency. We've learned our lessons that this will never happen again, but they've gotten nothing, not a call, not a meeting, zero from Biden or Harris, which is a real disservice to them.",
