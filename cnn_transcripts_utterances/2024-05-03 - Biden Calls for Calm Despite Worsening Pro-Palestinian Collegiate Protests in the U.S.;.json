All of whom who have paraded onto campus. They have suddenlydiscovered the, you know, the problem of Jewish safety. Well, I'd like to suggest that that's not actually what is going on. What's going on is that the anti-Semitism is being weaponized by people who are hostile to the university hostile to students hostile to faculty hostile to the values of inquiry research teaching learning that are at the heart of the University. So I really see this as a Trojan horse. This is not just about the Middle East. This is about attacks on universities not just You know in the last few weeks But that have been going on actually for years attacks on how we -- we teach the history of slavery for example, attacks on climate science, on vaccine safety, right?

The goal is to bring back samples from the far side of the lunar surface, which could help scientists peer back into the evolution of the Earth's closest neighbor, and the solar system. This is a key milestone in Chinas push to become a dominant space power. The nation plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and build a research based on its south pole. China became the only nation to land a probe on the far side of the moon in 2019.And finally, a remarkable discovery, scientists in Indonesia say they observed an orangutan intentionally treating a wound on its face with a medicinal plant. This is the first time this apparent behavior has been documented. Rakus treated a wound on his face by chewing leaves from a plant, extracting its juice and then repeatedly applying that to the wound. He then covered the wound with the chewed up leaves, which are typically used by humans in traditional medicine, according to a scientific paper published on Thursday.

They concede it could have been accidental and studying whether other orangutans repeat the behavior.",
