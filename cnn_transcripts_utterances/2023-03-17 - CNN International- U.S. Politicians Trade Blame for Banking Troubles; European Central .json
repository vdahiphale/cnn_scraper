Well, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, was very clear. Inflation at 8.5 percent in the Euro area is too high, and they are not seeing enough progress on bringing it down. They are, however, she said, closely monitoring the financial markets, keeping a close eye on whether banks tighten lending.
