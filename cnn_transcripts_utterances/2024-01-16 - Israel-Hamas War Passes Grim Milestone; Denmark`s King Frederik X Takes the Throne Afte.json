But amid that international pressure, the Israeli prime minister is defiant, for his part. He says, nobody will stop us from continuing to carry out this war from destroying Hamas and securing the release of those more than 100 hostages still held hostage in the Gaza Strip, the Israeli prime minister promising total victory and warning that this war will take many more months. But it`s clear, amid those defiant comments, that there are still concerns that this war between Israel and Hamas could erupt into a broader regional war. That`s as we look to the South in Yemen. Houthi rebels there are vowing to continue their attacks on that critical shipping lane in the Red Sea, following strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom, aimed directly at Houthi capabilities in Yemeni. If you look to the North at the Israel-Lebanese border, there are continuing cross-border clashes between the Israeli military and Hezbollah. An anti-tank missile fired by Hezbollah hitting a residential home in Northern Israel, killing a 76-year-old woman and her 40-year-old son. The Israeli military, meanwhile, firing strikes in Southern Lebanon at Hezbollah targets. Hassan Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, says that only a ceasefire in Gaza could see the end of those cross-border clashes. Meanwhile, in Israel, as we hit this hundred-day mark, many people across the country are marking 100 days of captivity for those more than 100 hostages who still remain in captivity, held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Tens of thousands of people flocking to what`s become known as Hostages Plaza in Tel Aviv, where a 24-hour rally was held to mark those hundred days of captivity. Messages recorded by leaders across the world flowing in during that ceremony. And as people mark those hundred days of captivity, we`re now learning that negotiators have struck a deal to allow for the entry of medication to the Gaza Strip for some of those 40 hostages who are being held hostage who the Israeli government believes are in need of medication. That medicine will be coming from Qatar, delivered to Egyptian officials, and then to members of the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Let`s turn now to the United States where we`re in the heart of the winter season. And mother nature is in full force pushing an Arctic blast across the country. 41 states started the week with weather advisories watches or warnings, and at least four declared emergencies because of the frigid temperatures. Get this, South Dakota is expected to endure wind chills as low as minus 45 degrees Fahrenheit. That can cause frostbite in as little as five minutes. But the cold weather is also affecting southern states. That region will see impactful, snow and ice for the first time this winter. And this frigid feel will not go away as more than 75% of the U.S. population will experience temperatures below freezing for the rest of the week. Now, when it`s colder than a polar bear`s toenails outside, it can be annoying, even downright painful for a lot of us. But there are plenty of adrenaline junkies out there who embrace the burr, maybe doing a polar bear plunge into icy waters sometimes for char, sometimes just for fun. But nobody knows how to embrace a polar bear plunge better than actual polar bears. Check this out. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
