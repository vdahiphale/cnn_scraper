Israel blames Hamas for firing 34 rockets from Lebanon yesterday. And the latest barrage since the two countries were at war back in 20 -- 2006. Now, that has raised fears of an escalating conflict across the region.And just overnight, we learned that Israel has mobilized some of its military reserves. A short time ago, Israel's defense minister ordered security bolstered across the country after two Israeli women were shot to death in the West Bank. Israel has called it an act of terror. Let's get straight to CNN's Fred Pleitgen, who is near the Israeli- Gaza border, and Scott McLean is in Beirut, Lebanon, for us as well. But let's start with you, Fred. Fred, you did talk to the spokesman for the Israeli defense forces just this morning. What did he tell you?",

In fact, as we stand here, we're constantly hearing Israeli drones overhead. Obviously, monitoring very closely to see that not more rockets are fired from the territory of Gaza towards Israel.We had that overnight where dozens of rockets were shot at Israeli territory. A lot of them were taken out by the Iron Dome air defense system, but one did land in the town of Sderot. At the same time, the Israelis, obviously, conducted their massive air strikes across Gaza where they say that they hit some tunnels and also what they call, research and development areas of Hamas, obviously, where rockets are made. Nevertheless, the Israelis are saying that right now it's an extremely volatile situation, not just here around Gaza but, of course, up north near Lebanon as well where you all said airstrikes overnight. But the Israelis are saying they don't want further escalation. Here's what the spokesman for the IDF f told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. RICHARD HECHT, INTERNATIONAL SPOKESMAN, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: We are ready for any developments. You can understand from the language of how this event is unfolding that we want to de-escalate. I mean, there's a very, very sensitive weekend ahead with Passover, Ramadan and Easter, all aligning. And we're looking for a -- hoping for a quiet weekend. Although, we had another attack the right after the prayers in Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley, but we look -- we are looking to de-escalate. And if it's quiet, it will be answered with quiet.

And, of course, later in the day in the West Bank, you did have those two women being killed when their car came under fire, the Israeli defense forces says.

Scott McLean and Fred Pleitgen, both of you, grateful to have you there.And let's continue this discussion with Daniel Shapiro, who is a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, and also David Sanger, a CNN political and national security analyst and a reporter for \"The New York Times\". Thank you, gentlemen for joining us. Ambassador Shapiro, I want to start with you and those very pointed comments from the Israeli military spokesperson who says that Israel wants this to be de-escalated. That is a clear message. But obviously the de-escalation will only happen if neither side take steps that lead to continued violence. Do you have hope that that will happen in the days to come? DANIEL SHAPIRO, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO ISRAEL: Well, that seems, Abby, to be the attempt by the Israeli leadership to try to deescalate this. They have trained their responses on Hamas targets, both in Gaza and in Lebanon. They have said that they do not believe Hezbollah was involved in this -- the rockets fired from Lebanon. And in fact, there was a helpful statement made by the prime minister of Lebanon, criticizing those who would use Lebanese territory to get conflagration underway between Israel and Lebanon. So, all of that suggests that there is a kind of common direction here, which is to keep the focus on Hamas to avoid this escalating into a regional conflict, which I have to say is not something that could necessarily be avoided without very close cooperation or careful actions by all of these actors because behind all of this, there is Iran. Iran is seeking to use its network of proxies in the region in Gaza, in Lebanon, in Syria to keep pressure on Israel. So, it takes a lot of care to avoid that going into the direction of a full-scale war.",

Of course, David mentioned the internal domestic Israeli discord between opponents of Prime Minister Netanyahu and his government trying to enact as judicial overhaul.And it is certainly true that when Israel seems divided internally, that could tempt its enemies, Iran and various properties of Iran, who may make the mistake in believing that Israel's won't unite in response to these constant attacks. Israel, of course, has a strong U.S. support for its right of self-defense. But again, it's effort to try to keep what happened in Jerusalem over the last couple of nights with conflicts at the holy sites, and this array of attacks from Syria, from Gaza, and from Lebanon from boiling over into something much wider and much more dangerous, suggests that they are trying very hard to get through these whole -- this period of holy days and holidays without something major getting underway.",

I actually think that it's conceivable that the fact that we do have these overlapping holidays, one would hope -- in celebrations, one would hope would be a diversion for a bit. But as Dan points out, you know, the scarce resource here is holy sites that all claim. And that's why these times of the year get particularly fraud.I think that if there was a sense that Israel is at a point of weakness and distraction, the Iranians will try to exploit that. But so far, there has been no sign that the Israeli command has been weakened in any way by the internal strife that we've seen over the judicial overhaul. And it's going to be pretty important to Prime Minister Netanyahu to keep it that way. He's also, somehow, got to try to keep his coalition together. And if that looks like it's fracturing, that may also seem like a moment of weakness at some point for some of these groups, and certainly for the Iranians.",
