The Republican candidate for president questioned his rival's race in a sit-down interview with black journalists. Here are those shocking comments. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  She was always of Indian heritage and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn't know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black. And now, she wants to be known as black. So, I don't know. Is she Indian or is she black? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Number one, of course, it's untrue, his claim about, for instance Former President Barack Obama being born outside of the United States. It's untrue, and people should know that. But people should also fasten on a second point that I don't think has gotten enough attention, and that is that our constitution does say that you cannot be president of the United States if you were born abroad. If you -- you have to be a natural born American citizen. It seems to me that's a bad thing.

You had companies like Amazon, you had companies like Apple and Microsoft. And, you know, Walter, each of those companies had a market capitalization that was itself bigger than the entire U.S. defense industry combined. And so, what that means for the Pentagon is that the locus of innovation, which, you know, used to live in labs like DARPA and other military R&amp;D labs a generation ago, the locus of innovation had completely shifted to the commercial sector. And so, Secretary Ash Carter, who founded Defense Innovation Unit and appointed Raj and I to lead it, he recognized this trend, this generational shift, and he knew that that for the military to keep accessing the best technology in the world, it would have to become, in his words, a fast follower of the commercial sector.

How much has it been cut by? And he said, that's the thing. You've been zeroized. Your entire budget has gone away. Your unit is being shut down by Congress. So, our first trip to Washington, it was supposed to be a victory lap. We were supposed to be meeting with the service chiefs, the service secretaries to figure out what their top priorities for us to work on were.

So, that's just one illustration of how much DIU had to cut against the grain, not only with Congress, but also, frankly, with the Department of Defense.

Chris and I had the opportunity to visit Ukraine in October to see firsthand how drone warfare is just changing our ways of thinking about conflict. So, for example, just recently, it was revealed that we had sent 31 M1A1 battle tanks to Ukraine. These are the most sophisticated tanks in the world. And 25 percent of them had been disabled by Russian kamikaze drones. So, they've had to withdraw all of them from the front lines. So, here's a situation where, you know, since World War I, you know, mechanized armored warfare has been our mainstay and now cheap, low-cost drones are challenging that.

The budget of Defense Innovation Unit is now a billion dollars a year, with even more money being spent on it through the replicator initiative, the most important initiative started by Secretary Lloyd Austin to develop autonomous swarming drones. So, all that is good. But Walter, you are right. If you look at what percentage of the Department of Defense budget is actually going towards new systems rather than legacy systems, it's still a fairly small fraction. And we are at risk as a country, because if we are spending most of our money on things like tanks, which now can be demonstrably defeated by low- cost drones, or for that matter, aircraft carriers, which as we know, are at increasing risk of being defeated by weapons like hypersonic missiles, we could end up with a military that might not be as survivable in a conflict of the future.

First, the most decorated of all time, Michael Phelps. While he was picking up medal after medal at the pool, few knew that the star swimmer was deeply struggling with his mental health. Phelps is now a proud advocate of therapy, and Christiane asked him about it in early 2022. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MICHAEL PHELPS, U.S. OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST:  I have had struggles through the pandemic, some of the scariest moments of my life, just, again, the uncertainty. And, you know, for me, I'm very fortunate that I have been able to build my sort of network that I can kind of reach to when I go through a difficult time. You know, I think we have seen a lot of people open up about mental health over the last five years. We have been able to see mental health on the forefront of a lot of conversations. And that's something that we never saw before. And I think it's been pretty incredible to see the movement, see the movement grow as it has, but also, just being able to share the stories and read other people's stories that we're hearing, because I think that's the biggest way that we're going to be able to help one another to get through these difficult times. My dark days look like dark days. They look like I want to climb into a black hole and be left alone. And there are times where I feel like I am all alone. But, in reality, we all know that now, that we're not alone. Mental health is real. And it's OK to not be OK.",

I was able to win gold medalswhile struggling through the darkest points of my life. I realized that I wasn't alone and there are other people out there that are going through the same exact thing. So, yes, I mean, it's -- yes, I think it's just understanding that it's real. You know, like that's the biggest thing, because I want to help people try to be their authentic self every single day. That's something that I try to do in my mission sort of every day too, because, for a period of my life, like, I looked at myself as strictly an athlete and a swimmer and not a human being. And, for me, going through some of the work that I have done, I have been able to learn about my emotions and my feelings and kind of nurture them and care for them, because they rise for certain reasons. And I have been so used to compartmentalizing and stuffing them down because of me being me and being an athlete and a competitor and can't show that vulnerability side. So, yes, just trying to live your authentic self, your authentic, best self every single day is what I try to do. And, yes, as you heard, there are days that aren't very good. There are days that are really scary. But the good days are so much better than I could ever imagine and ever dream of, that I just love being able to talk and share about mental health more.

But to be honest, getting lost in the air, which is, you know, as Simone said, she was going for a two and a half twist and ended up doing a one and a half twist, that's actually very common for some gymnasts and it would happen to me sometimes in my gymnastics career. It's just unfortunate that it did happened in the team final at the Olympic games. But, you know, it could have been anything. I'm curious, whenever Simone is ready to share, if she can think about why she got lost. Sometimes there's no reason behind it. Sometimes you just get a little bit confused in the air. I think gymnastics is one of those sports where, you know, someone like Simone makes it look easy, but it's actually in fact very difficult. And so, when you think about what she's actually doing a two and a half twists, sometimes what happens is you're in the air and you kind of lose track of, have I done a half twist, have I done two twists? It gets a little bit confusing. So, it is in fact actually very common. It's just -- you know, I think it just shows, unfortunately, that even the best athletes in the world, they have good days and bad days and I commend her for her bravery and speaking up and doing what's right for her and what she felt was right for the team. It's not easy. But, you know, even the greatest athletes of all time, they're not perfect and they're human, too. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
