In just two series against the Giants, he threw that touchdown to Garrett Wilson. Jets open up the regular season just 15 days from now, hosting the Buffalo Bills on Monday Night Football.And Lionel Messi making his MLS debut for the Inter-Miami last night road game sellout facing New York. Get in price at Red Bull stadium, $300. Fans, they had to wait a bit as he was resting. He came in as a sub at the hour mark. And then he did what Messi does. He put New York's defense in a blender, setting himself up on the give and go from Ben Cremaschi in just nine games for Miami. Eleven goals that leads the team in scoring. And, of course, he won them their first ever trophy last week with the League's Cup title. Check out the reaction in Times Square in Manhattan, Amara and Rahel. Simply awesome. Messi and Miami win two nil. When he comes here to Atlanta in a couple of weeks, the tickets in the nose leads that are normally $19 are going for $160.",

This is a racist, targeted attack against the black community. We know that. That's -- we don't have to, you know, sort of play around with words. This was just a racist killing and therefore would be covered by federal civil rights laws that could include investigations of others who supported him. The sheriff, I thought, did a terrific job in explaining what was going on. The only sort of difference I have with him is when he says that the shooter acted alone. We know what that means, that the shooter was alone that day.

It's the wearing of the tactical gear, it's the manifestos and the -- and wanting his father to know of the manifestos before the killing.There's a little bit of a time lag between when the father finds out and when the killing starts, and then look at who he addresses the manifestos to. It's not to the world, it's to his parents. But the other two audiences, there's a manifesto to the media so that we know exactly why, and then to law enforcement. So those are ways in which this generation, this incitement and this hate, racist hate has -- basically is putting on a performance about violence. They view it as performative. And the audience is not simply the other neo-Nazis. It's also, of course, the black community. This was a targeted attack. It was near, if not meant to be, at a historically black college.

Colonel, good to see you this morning, sadly, under these circumstances. Look, this isn't the first time an Osprey helicopter has crashed and killed U.S. military personnel. In fact, I think Angus just mentioned it. Just last year, five U.S. marines died after an Osprey crash in California. And I counted from, you know, our reporting and from news releases that there have been about eight Osprey crashes in the last decade or so. What do you make of the aircraft's history? Is the Osprey safe to fly? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Amara, good morning. It's a -- you know, it's one of those aircraft that has had a lot of trouble in its developmental phases. It had a lot of cost overruns. And like you mentioned, there are about 51 or so people who were killed in Osprey-related accidents since the start of the operational flying of this aircraft, which was in the late 1980s. [07:15:12] As to this aircraft came out of the operation that the ill-fated operation in Iran, when we were trying to extricate the hostages back in 1980, so what they needed was in aircraft, they could do both helicopter type takeoffs. In other words, vertical takeoffs and landings, as well as short takeoffs and landings. And they developed the Osprey as a result of that, but because it's got this very unique choke rotor capability, there were some issues mechanically as well as operationally with the aircraft. Generally speaking, the aircraft is perceived to be safe to fly. However, there have been those issues like you and Angus have mentioned.",

In this particular case, this seems to be an exercise that was associated with the U.S. Marine Corps, the Australian Army.And in the past, at least, the same exercise had Philippine and Malaysian troops associated with it as well. So what they try to do is they try to exercise interoperability, they try to make sure that everything from the communication systems to the operational employment of the forces that that works together, and there's a lot of coordination that goes along with these exercises.

The U.S. has historically relied on Costa Rica to help them with migration as well as a number of other issues. They are crucial partner in the region.

It's a preponderance standard. He has to demonstrate he has a colorable federal defense. The federal defense is just what you're saying, which is he would say that since he was acting as chief of staff, supposedly everything it did was part of being chief of staff, part of his job description, and therefore he has the federal immunity.

And what we knew from authorities on Wednesday, just after the crash, is that it was believed that Yevgeny Prigozhin, 10 victims in all, had died in this plane accident.What we just heard from the investigative committee is that all 10 victims have now been confirmed, their identities have been confirmed. They do indeed correspond to those on the flight passenger list that we heard of on Wednesday, which means they confirmed that Yevgeny Prigozhin, but also so many of his very close lieutenants (ph) at the helm of Wagner have been confirmed dead. They include, of course, Dmitry Utkin who managed Wagner's ministry operations and others who are at the very top of the group. The speculation is that Russian authorities may have been involved in this and have been the source of speculation for many days because, of course, the crash came just two months after Yevgeny Prigozhin's failed march on Moscow. The Kremlin has denied this. We heard from Dmitry Peskov on Friday denouncing what he says were absolute lies. In terms of the rumors, he describes of foul play involved. But the confirmation that Yevgeny Prigozhin has died, of course, that would leave a huge amount of questions about what happens to Wagner next. We heard also from Vladimir Putin just the other day speaking about Yevgeny Prigozhin's death. This now the confirmation that he has died as well as so many those who ran Wagner with him.",

Put a bit of closure to this situation. They hinted that Prigozhin had died in Putin's remarks and in Dmitry Peskov's, the spokesman's remarks. It was very clear that they were pretty convinced that Prigozhin was indeed onboard this aircraft. But they are trying to, in essence, put this behind them. They did that they needed to do from the Kremlin's standpoint. And now, they want to move forward and Putin, I think, hopes to consolidate power as a result of this. And, you know, move forward from a position of strength, hopefully, from his standpoint.",

This is very interesting as well because often what the Russians will do is, in spite of any evidence to the contrary, they will blame the west or they will blame Ukraine for acts like this. But when Putin spoke, it was pretty clear that he wasn't going in that direction. What he wanted to do was just kind of state the facts as he had them at that moment and make it appear as if, you know, this was kind of in the course of everyday business.And, you know, that's -- from a -- this kind of an analytical standpoint, you are looking at a way in which Putin is consolidating the information before he delivers it to the public. And as he delivers it to the public, he is making it pretty clear that he is in charge of this situation, and that's how he is looking at it.",

Mortgage rates are now at their highest levels in 22 years, hitting 7.23 percent for a 30-year fixed mortgage in the latest week. Now, just a year ago, you might remember, that that number was below six percent. Part of the reason for the surge, well the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate hiking to try to fight inflation.

I think people should look perhaps (ph) -- possibly at six percent as a good rate.And let's remember, let's back up to history. Most people, back in the '80s and '90s, purchased their homes at double-digit mortgage rates. And if you were to ask, was that a good deal? Are you happy that you made that decision? And nearly every homebuyer at that time would say, yes, that was a tremendous decision because I feel well, the housing prices rising over time. And furthermore, great thing about America, one can always refinance mortgage rate when the mortgage rate do goes down, and we know mortgage rate goes up and goes down. SOLOMON: Now, that's a great point. The difference I will say, I'm going to push back a bit in terms of interest rates, is now affordability is a real issue. And part of that is not just the interest rates but the cost of a home, which has gone up. And part of the problem there is just the lack of supply, that because there isn't a lot of supply, and demand is high, there is that imbalance and that keeps sort of prices elevated.
