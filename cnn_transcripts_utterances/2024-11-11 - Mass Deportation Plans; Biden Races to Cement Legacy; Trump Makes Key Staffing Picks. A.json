Trump had already picked his border czar, tapping his former acting ICE Director Tom Homan for the job. And he's nominated New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik as ambassador to the United Nations. And as Trump is hunkered down at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, we're learning that it's become ground zero among loyalists vying for top spots. CNN's Alayna Treene is live for us in West Palm Beach. Alayna, I want to talk about those discussions happening where you are in West Palm Beach, but first let's talk about Stephen Miller and what role he's going to fulfill in this new administration.",

And, look, I am told that Miller, who already had a lot of influence in Donald Trump's first term, is expected to have a much more expanded role this time around. I think they're still working out the details over what exactly his portfolio will look like, but you can assume and expect that Stephen Miller is going to have a very big role in what comes next, particularly when it comes to immigration policy. Now, there's no secret that Stephen Miller has long been a very hard- line immigration adviser to Donald Trump. He's encouraged a lot of his instincts, including on the campaign trail in recent (AUDIO GAP) the issue in election. And he's also been the lead architect behind the scenes of the incoming Trump administration's plans for this mass deportation of undocumented migrants. Now, I think one thing to keep in mind is how loyal Stephen Miller has remained to Donald Trump, particularly when you remember that in the aftermath and Donald Trump's departure from the White House in 2021, after the January 6 attack on the Capitol, when a lot of people sought to distance themselves from the former president, Miller did not. He stayed by his side. And then in the years after, he launched his own outside policy group, America First Legal, where he helped prosecute a lot of cases and issue a lot of lawsuits against Democrats. So I think all of that is good to keep in mind as you anticipate what he will be doing (AUDIO GAP) the White House. Now, I know we have some video of some of the things that Stephen Miller has said over the years. I want you to take a listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, he was there when former President Barack Obama executed a record number of deportations. So he has been at the center of deportations for some time now, which is also quite telling, because, in addition to the White House being the power center for immigration policy, Tom Homan is a pick who is quite operationally savvy. He understands how the government works. And that is telling in how they are thinking about fulfilling one of Donald Trump's campaign promises.

They focused on the economy. They focused on high prices. They focused on housing prices. They focused on trying to have the ability to make ends meet for their families. And, in fact, in a lot of the exit polls that a lot of Latino organizations have done, they asked Latinos whether they believed that Donald Trump was going to move forward with this. And they said no. So this is going to mean massive cruelty, massive pain in our communities. I really don't think, not just Latinos, I don't think the American electorate understands what this will mean and if it actually happens. Let's remember in 2017, when family separation happened, there was a huge outcry, Brianna and Boris. You guys remember those horrific images of kids being literally ripped from the arms of their parents. That will happen again, and it will be on steroids. And so if this is what this administration, this new incoming administration wants to focus on, that is not the mandate that they got. It is not a mandate for cruelty. It is not a mandate for pain.

We cannot have simply -- we simply cannot have millions of people rolling around this country who have been unvetted. Many of them have criminal backgrounds. I agree, most of them do just come here because they want to work and they want to have a better life. But we don't know that because we don't know who these people are.

The president's also focused on filling dozens of open judicial positions, with many of those appointments already having a nominee in place, but there's going to be a challenge with the calendar because Congress has a limited amount of time to finish this term, and they also have to figure out how to fund the government by this time next month.
