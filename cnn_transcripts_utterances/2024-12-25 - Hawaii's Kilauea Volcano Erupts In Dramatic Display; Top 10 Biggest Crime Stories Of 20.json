You can walk right up to the rim of that summit crater that we're seeing the footage from. And it is -- it's relatively calm in terms of volcanoes on the scale of, you know, nothing to super volcano, where Hawaii's like a one.So for the most part, that means that we can get really good instrumentation on the volcano so we can put seismographs or seismometers to take seismographs to get a sense of what's going on in the subsurface. We can measure the volcano, whether it inflates or deflates with lava magma underneath the surface. We can measure the gases, which actually are the most dangerous part of Kilauea, typically because the gases really irritate folks' respiratory systems. So it's a really good place for us to learn and study. And it's amazing to watch when you have these eruptions where you don't have a lot of people in harms way, we can actually breathe a little bit easier as scientists and enjoy the spectacle that nature's putting on for us.",

A survey conducted by the National Alliance on Mental Illness finds 64 percent of people struggling with mental health may feel even worse during the holidays.So what can be done for anyone who is suffering during this time of year? Clinical psychologist Dr. Jeff Gardere joins me now. Thank you so much for talking about this important topic on Christmas day. First, just how common is this, this, this feeling of loneliness and sadness on the holiday season? DR. JEFF GARDERE, CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST: Yeah, well, there are two things that we need to distinguish. First of all, as you said, yes, there are a number of people who do have some preexisting mental health challenges, such as depression and anxiety and may be more prone during the holiday season due to all of the stressors and the pressures of being there, of -- of mixing with other people, of even though being depressed, having to be part of different groups and dinners and get-togethers. So that makes it very difficult. And then there's something called the holiday blues, Danny, that's, you know, much, much milder. But people feel that same sort of stress that I just talked about -- the unrealistic expectations, some of the sentimental memories, changes in diet or routine, less sunlight, maybe over commercialization of this particular holiday.

They really don't have that holiday cheer, where they may be isolating themselves, where they may be more agitated, where they may have negative emotions, where they may be very anxious or worried about being able to meet those expectations, I think those are clear indicators that something is going on with that particular person.And so, it's really important that we be able to reach out and ask them what's going on. It may be, again, part of the holiday blues. It may be their depression kicking in, but certainly more than anything else, it's important to not just leave them alone and just think -- well, they'll go ahead and get through it.
