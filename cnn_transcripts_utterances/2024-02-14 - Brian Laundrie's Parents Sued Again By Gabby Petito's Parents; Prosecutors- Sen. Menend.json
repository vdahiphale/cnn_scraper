The details are outlined in court documents in a lawsuit filed against the Laundrie's by Petito's parents. They're suing for pain and emotional distress, claiming that the Laundrie's knew about their daughter's murder, but kept it a secret. CNN's Jean Casarez has reviewed the filings. Jean, what did they reveal?",

They want to get rid of this case.There were some settlement -- notice of a settlement proposal from the Laundrie's, didn't go anywhere last fall. So now they want to have a summary judgment, case over, done. And then there's a mediation conference in a couple of weeks, which will be interesting. But the Petitos have filed this. They have remained strong, steadfast because they want answers. And I think, in their mind, they believe this civil case is what can bring them justice.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Boris. So a new detail here, a new element of this bribery scheme and that Menendez, his wife, had received a diamond engagement ring.So prosecutors are saying that this was a part of the bribe where, if Menendez, his wife would have received this diamond ring and the luxury Mercedes-Benzes convertible, Menendez was going to help in a criminal case involving car insurance fraud of somebody who is not even attached to the scheme, as we currently know it. According to prosecutors, though, Menendez was swindled as part of this because he was supposed to -- the businessman was supposed to buy a diamond engagement ring worth $35,000. Instead, bought a diamond ring worth $12,000. And Nadine Menendez later found out about that when she brought the ring to a jeweler. Now, this is all coming out because Menendez is trying to suppress the evidence that was -- that was obtained through search warrant of Menendez's homes in D.C. and New Jersey. That was the gold bars, the cash stuffed in Menendez's jacket, and other materials that they found. They're trying to suppress that, saying that prosecutors hid information from the judges who signed off on the search warrants. Why we're seeing this material now is that prosecutors are saying, no, this is what the judges were told. There was probable cause to search these houses. This is all part of an aggressive defense being mounted by Menendez. He has pleaded not guilty to these charges, as is everyone else in the case. Now he's also trying to sever his case from any of the other defendants, in particular his wife, because he is trying to say that, in order for him to testify in his own defense at the trial, he can't reveal marital communications that are usually protected. And prosecutors are opposing that. Menendez also wants to have this case moved to New Jersey, saying it should be New Jersey residents who decide the fate of their senior Senator, not New York City residents -- Boris?",

I mean, you can see them. It was 224 threats in 2021, then more than doubling over the past three years to 457 threats. Members of Congress really spelled out the details, the specifics of these threats. It was just in July that the chief justice of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, he received a threatening voice message. The man responsible for that has since pleaded guilty. And then there's been a number of threats related to judges that are overseeing some of the former President Donald Trump, his criminal and civil cases. We saw a Texas woman who left three threatening voicemail messages for the federal judge overseeing the classified documents case down in Florida. She recently got three years in prison. And then other judges who are overseeing various cases involving the former president, they have also received threats. Judges in Colorado, who issued that decision out of the Colorado Supreme Court taking Donald Trump off the ballot there. Also threats to judges in New York and here in Washington, D.C. So the director of the U.S. Marshals Service, he spelled it out a little bit more. Here's what he was saying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RONALD DAVIS, DIRECTOR, U.S. MARSHALS SERVICE: I must state in stark terms that the current and evolving threat environment facing the judiciary constitutes a substantial risk to our democracy.

So while they might not be targeting a specific judge, there's still alarm over that, too, because the rhetoric online has this become, in some senses, very violent as well?",
