You know, we heard the police chief of St. Petersburg tell us this morning that the message for people in the flood zone there is to use this time between now and 4:00 p.m. to do what you have to do and prepare. What more can you tell us? What more do you want people to know? KEN WELCH, MAYOR OF ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: Well, you know, we have so many -- first of all, good morning. We have so many new folks in Florida that they might not be aware of how unpredictable these storms can be. And you know, a recent example is what happened with Hurricane Ian just last year. It was at the real -- really the edge of the cone and the projected track changed in the last few hours, and they had devastating results. That's just a hundred or so miles south of us. So, our message to folks is if you're in an evacuation area, heed the call to move to higher ground. And you don't have to move a hundred miles. You can move, you know a few miles and move into safety. And that's the message we're trying to get out to the folks in our area.",

But their example I think is one of the best things that we have to show people what can happen with these storms, how the storm surge can really devastate neighborhoods.

Months ago, this cohort of Uzbek nationals entered through the southern border presented themselves for asylum, were vetted according to standard U.S. procedure, and then were released into the United States pending a court date. It wasn't until later, just in recent weeks, that the U.S. intelligence community received information that allowed them to understand that this group of migrants had traveled to the United States with the help of a human smuggling network that included a member with troubling ties to ISIS.Now, this obviously set off some big alarm bells across the U.S. government. It set off a scramble. The FBI immediately moving to try to locate, investigate, and assess all of the different migrants who had traveled to the United States with the help of this group. The U.S. also moved to try to break up the smuggling network. Turkey at the U.S. behest, arrested members of this smuggling network, including the ISIS-linked facilitator. This allowed the U.S. government to pretty quickly get a sense that this person wasn't actually a member of ISIS, he's more like an independent contractor who had some personal sympathies with the group. So, pretty quickly, the Biden administration was able to understand this more as a case of kind of run-of-the-mill human smuggling less than a potential terrorist threat. U.S. officials now say no evidence that any of these migrants are involved in any terrorist ISIS plotting, ISIS planning, but still deeply troubling evidence for some intelligence officials of a potential vulnerability along the U.S. southern border, Boris.",
