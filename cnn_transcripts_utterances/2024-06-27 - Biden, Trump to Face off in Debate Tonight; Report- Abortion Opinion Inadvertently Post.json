If it does, that will, of course, be before President Biden and Donald Trump take the stage. The court is also this morning grappling with an astonishing breach of protocol. According to Bloomberg News, the Supreme Court appears poised to temporarily allow abortions in medical emergencies in Idaho after a document was posted on the court's website and then quickly taken down. The court has acknowledged inadvertently posting the document. They say that they have not officially rendered a decision in this case. Our panel is back. And Kate Bedingfield, the abortion decision in question would be a victory for abortion rights supporters. They're, of course, saying, well, this is just a delay of something that they view as a terrible policy.

You know, it's a good argument for him to lay at the feet of Donald Trump, who has tried -- because Trump recognizes this is a political loser for him and for the Republicans. Trump has sort of tried to give, you know, six different answers to this. But he has bragged about putting the three justices on the court who overturned Roe. And Biden can really be aggressive. And I also think, you know, this case illustrates -- gives Biden an opportunity to say, you know, we shouldn't be here. We shouldn't be here. And the reason we're here is because of Donald Trump.

And Donald Trump continues to say, well, it should be returned back to the states. Well, that has occurred, and it's not moving in the right direction for Republicans. And so I've advised his campaign he needs to go further and say states should have referendums. Allow the voters to vote on this issue. Because we've seen in Ohio, we've seen in Kansas, we've seen in Wisconsin, even counties in Kansas, for example, I think 80 percent that went for Trump voted with Democrats to protect reproductive rights.
