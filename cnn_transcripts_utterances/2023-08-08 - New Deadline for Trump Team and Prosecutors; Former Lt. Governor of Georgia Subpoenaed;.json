The former New York City police commissioner, a long-time associate of Rudy Giuliani, he coordinated with Giuliani during the contentious post-election period, trying to investigate election fraud. And now he's speaking to the special counsel. Let's get to it. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is outside the federal courthouse in Washington with the very latest, of course. So, Katelyn, walk us through this new deadline today. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Kate, there's a dispute in this case early on, January 6th, federal criminal case against Donald Trump, and the judge over top of it. She wants to get this dispute settled fast. So, what's happening here is Donald Trump and his team, they're going to get evidence that they've never seen before that the Justice Department has collected, things like grand jury transcripts, other things that the Justice Department may have learned in this January 6th investigation. That's all going to get handed over to Donald Trump's team to prepare for trial. And the dispute is over that information and what Donald Trump can do with it before trial. So, Trump's team, they don't want any restrictions on that information whenever they're getting it. They are saying that if there are things in there that the Justice Department believe are highly sensitive, those things, those could be locked down. But Donald Trump and his lawyers have been out there quite publicly saying they don't want anything that would curtail Donald Trump's ability to have free speech about this case before the trial. Now, the Justice Department, they want to lock down all of that information that Trump and his team have never seen before, that they've collected, and they're going to give to him, and make sure that it's not disclosed publicly to anyone really that the documents aren't shared, that Trump isn't speaking about them. And they're saying that Donald Trump has no right to be sharing these sorts of things legally before he goes to trial. That it could hurt his ability to have a fair trial if he's out there and speaking about these things. So, where the line is drawn on how sensitive the information has to be for it to be locked down, that's what's at issue here. And the judge does want to have a hearing by Friday. So we should hear by the end of the day today at least when both sides, the Justice Department and Donald Trump's team, are available to have that hearing. And there should be something on the calendar pretty soon as well.",

He's a very close associate of Rudy Giuliani who was working to try and find election fraud, which they never were able to get proof of after the 2020 election.But Bernie Kerik yesterday, he spoke to the special counsel's office for about five hours. And upon leaving, his attorney said they had a lot of questions about what the Giuliani team was doing. Giuliani is a co-conspirator in that indictment against Donald Trump. He's not charged at this time. But clearly the special counsel still has questions and a reason to be convening that grand jury today in the courthouse behind me. Kate.",

Can be a political group. Can be a street gang, a drug trafficking organization. It's being used more and more broadly.Generally speaking, under RICO laws, as a prosecutor you have to show two things. First of all, the existence of what we call a racketeering enterprise. Meaning, a group, it doesn't have to have an official name, but a group that gets together in order to do the second thing, which is commit a pattern of racketeering, which means two or more crimes for some sort of common purpose.

Of course, that has to be counterbalanced against the First Amendment statement.And this particular statement, if you go after me, I'll come after you, is a perfect sort of Rorschach test almost. You can look at it from either way. I'm sure Donald Trump's team argues that's political speech. That's a general statement. That means politically I'll come after you, or if you take the stand you'll be cross-examined vigorously. I think prosecutors are of a different view that the meaning there is well understood.

Plainly, where does Ukraine go from here? MAJOR MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): So, we're two months into their counteroffensive to the day actually today. And right now their counteroffensive has not gained the kind of land back it thought it was going to. It - you know, it -- frontal attacks on fortified positions that are surrounded by mines, without air superiority, does not have any historical context to be successful. So, and in some ways they've overset expectations that they thought they were going to be in a different place by now. They've not been able to threaten Crimea on any level. But until they get air superiority, until they have, you know, more crew protection in some of these western equipment, their reserves have not been committed yet. That's kind of the issue here.
