Authorities are getting several reports of downed trees across the area. We do know that wind gusts this morning were forecast to reach more than 40 miles per hour. Power outages also reported. I mean, if it isn't snow and it isn't wind, now you've got the wind, if it isn't snow and rain and ice and you've got these wind gusts to contend with as well. So there is that in the Atlanta area. Let's go even further south right now. People are bracing for their coldest Christmas in decades. Houston is expected to spend nearly two days in below freezing conditions. Temperatures there are already just in the teens. Normally the high in Texas this time of year is around like the mid- 60s.Let me bring in right now Harris County Commissioner Adrian Garcia for more on this. Commissioner, thanks for coming on. I mean, there are other areas in the country that are colder, yes, but there are a few places that are as unseasonably cold as what Texas is dealing with right now. What's happening there? ADRIAN GARCIA, HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS DISTRICT 2 COMMISSIONER: You got it right, Kate, and thank you for having me. We are experiencing unprecedented cold for this time of the year, but we're resilient, we're working through everything and we're being very thoughtful about our residents who typically don't have to deal with this kind of weather. So we are preparing for yet another day of this. But, you know, so far the news is good. We've been able to accommodate at least 1,000 people in our respective warming centers, probably more, because we have good faith-based organizations and other committed neighbors that are helping their unfortunate neighbors out. So we're very confident about that. Our energy, though, if you recall, during winter storm Uri, our grid failed us, but this time it seems to be holding strong. Although we do have 17,000 homes across the county that are without power, 300 of those have been restored thus far, but those don't seem to be grid related, so we're very hopeful about that. BOLDUAN: And this isn't -- one thing about it is this isn't just a one day freeze. This is a multiday event that you guys are going to be dealing with. I mean we're seeing that in other places in the country too. What does that mean for you all? And how does that complicate things?",

However, that can obviously change as you know Mother Nature. So right now, our roads are passable. We are not having any particular challenges. I did stand up my public works operations to provide that coverage for our roads if necessary. We haven't had to do that.However, the further you get away from this particular area, the road conditions could very well changes. So we want people to think about it. If you don't need to make that travel, please don't do so. If you do, then obviously, you know, take your time, be patient, be careful. Try to monitor the conditions as you're moving. Stay in touch with the respective state alert systems. But, you know, my first recommendation is if you don't have to make the travel, please don't do it.",

The Tennessee Valley Authority is requiring all local power companies to reduce their electrical load by between 5 and 10 percent. The reason being is, if they don't or what they're trying to do is to avoid bigger, more major outages across the Memphis area. We're going to bring you updates on this as we get them in.I do want to turn to this, though, which is CNN has new reporting on the allegations pushed by Elon Musk that the U.S. government ordered twitter to suppress stories about Hunter Biden, his laptop, and his e- mails. Evan Perez joins me now with what the CNN investigation has uncovered in all of this. Evan, let's start with the bottom line here, which is that Elon Musk says that these Twitter files show the government ordered Twitter to censor a New York post story, and I believe it was October 2020 about Hunter Biden's laptop. Do these internal Twitter files and CNN's reporting show this?",

      "sentences": "They do not, Kate. And look, we spent some time myself, Donie O'Sullivan and Brian Fung talking to people on both sides of these conversations, both tech executives and the FBI. We've looked at these twitter files that have been released by a group of journalists that Elon Musk chose to share some of these internal documents. And what emerges from that is no direct order from the FBI to Twitter to suppress the story, which was done for a few days ahead of the in October of 2020.Instead, what appears to have happened is Twitter executives were primed. They were ready for what they thought was coming, which was a Russian disinformation effort, and they thought this was it. It is something that obviously emerges. You can see a lot of confusion in the behind the scenes at Twitter as they were trying to grapple with what to do with this story. They all admit, by the way, that this was a mistake to suppress that story. But there's enough in these files to raise questions, and I think that's one of the things that the Republican lawmakers are latching on to. Certainly, James Baker is a former FBI official who's now -- who was working at Twitter at the time he has since been fired. And I think you're going to see an effort to get to more communications because something could emerge from additional searching by the Republicans. BOLDUAN: And can we just dig into a couple of the other major allegations? I mean, there's a lot to this, so I just want to explain it, and you're doing a great job of explaining it to folks. The major allegations that have been made by the reporters with whom Musk has chosen to share these internal documents with, one of them is that the day before \"The New York Post\" story publishes, an FBI agent uses a secure channel to send over a batch of documents to a Twitter executive. What's that about?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So $3.4 million, according to -- you'll see a tweet that explains that there is some, perhaps some connection, you know, in the relationship between Twitter and the FBI. The FBI says that under federal law, companies are allowed to seek reimbursement for the cost they incur to respond into FBI records requests, for instance, subpoenas. If they have to comply with anything that the FBI is ordering them to supply as part of an investigation, they are allowed to seek reimbursement of that. And that goes across the board for, you know, service providers like phone companies and so on. So Twitter is one of those companies. And that figure is what that explains, $3.4 million.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so the FBI says and Twitter says that all of this is in part because of 2016, right, where the intelligence community found that Russians, the Russian intelligence agencies, used social media to help interfere with U.S. elections. And that includes the hacking of Democratic campaigns, dumping files that were intended to hurt the candidacy of Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump. And so the companies and the FBI were trying to figure out a way to stop that from happening again in 2020. And so that's what you see in some of these Twitter files that have been published. I'll read you just a part of the statement from the FBI pushing back on these claims from Elon Musk and others. And they say this is part of the traditional effort that the FBI makes to work with social media companies. And they say, it is unfortunate that conspiracy theorists and others are feeding the American public misinformation with the sole purpose of attempting to discredit the agency.The bottom line from the FBI is that, you know, they haven't -- there is nothing that has emerged that shows them going over the line. Kate, it's clear, though, we're going to hear a lot more of this because Republicans are promising to investigate this stuff, even though, at this point, you know, even -- you know, some of the journalists that have been digging deep on behalf of Elon Musk have so far said that there was no direct order from the FBI to censor these stories.",

Governor John Bell Edwards has also put out a warning that the state is preparing for what needs to prepare for what could be a, quote, life threatening storm there. Joining me right now is Louisiana's Lieutenant Governor Billy Nungesser. Lieutenant Governor, thank you so much for being on. Again, your entire state is under a hard freeze warning. What does that mean for Louisiana?LT. GOV. BILLY NUNGESSER (R-LA): Well, it's something we're not used to. Not only a hard freeze, but several days of hard freezing all across Louisiana, even down to the southern tip, something we never see. So it's going to be a tough couple of days. People aren't used to driving and surely the houses, especially the mobile homes, are not prepared for this type of cold.",
