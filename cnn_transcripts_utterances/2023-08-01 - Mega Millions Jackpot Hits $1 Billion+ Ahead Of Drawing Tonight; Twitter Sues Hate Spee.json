And you've heard a lot of these things. Intermittent fasting, cold plunges, things like that. But there's different ways that people are looking at aging overall and they sort of break it down in these categories. The \"Dorian Gray\" approach, which is basically to say that we're going to slow down aging. The \"Wolverine\" approach, where you're going to reverse aging. And the \"Peter Pan\" approach, where aging really never occurs in the first place. So how does biohacking -- how do any of those sorts of things influence those types of approaches to aging? That's what it is. It's a huge burgeoning field. It's part of -- you know, people quantify their selves and measure everything about their selves, and then try to figure out how to enhance their natural biology. That's basically what it is.",

How many cells you have in your body that aren't working as well. There are ways of measuring aging other than revolutions of planets.

We talked to people from the NFL at that point and they basically said look, \"If no underlying cardiac abnormality is identified, then individuals can safely resume training and competition after resuscitation from commotio cordis.\" They found no other underlying abnormalities so it wasn't that surprising.
