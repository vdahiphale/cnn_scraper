Some bad news for former President Trump as a federal judge has ordered that former Vice President Mike Pence must testify about conversations, he had with Trump in the lead up to January 6th. The former president had tried to assert executive privilege. But now investigators will be able to get details about conversations between Trump and Pence during what investigators have described as a pressure campaign on the former vice president. He faced enormous pressure from Trump and his allies. Not to certify the election results. In Biden's favor. There was one particular call that multiple witnesses have testified about on the day of the Capitol attack, where Trump launched a series of insults at his vice president. But a judge also wrote that Pence will not have to testify about anything connected to his official duties as president of the Senate on January 6th. He has tried to assert constitutional protections under the speech or debate clause, and the federal judge appears willing to accept that. Now this is yet another victory for special counsel Jack Smith. He's had over a dozen victories as he presses to get testimony from various witnesses and really test the limits of presidential power, vice presidential power and the separation of powers.

Mexican officials say that the fire at a migrant detention center killed 38 people. More than two dozen others were injured. The disaster happened in Ciudad Juarez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. Now there's new video showing the moment that the flames and smoke spread through the facility. CNN's Ed Lavandera has the latest -- but a warning that his report contains graphic content.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This dramatic video captured what appears to be the beginning of the fire that spread through this Mexican migrant detention facility in Juarez late Monday night. You can see flames and smoke filling the detention area in a matter of seconds, migrants scrambling for their lives and several Mexican immigration officers walking away from the area while migrants were left locked in the cells. Eventually, thick smoke fills the area, making it impossible to see anything else. Outside, witnesses described hearing migrants screaming for help as fire spread through the detention center. Rescue workers responded, pulling people from the smoke and flames. This woman says there was smoke everywhere. Everyone was running for their lives. But all the men were left locked inside and the door to let them out was never open. Mexico's president says the migrants started the fire when they found out they were being deported. The president says they protested by setting fire to mattresses inside the building where they were being detained. The video from inside the detention center doesn't clearly show how or who started the fire, but several mattresses can be seen on the ground by the steel jail bars.

But to have President Joe Biden, who has long talked about how he is a stalwart supporter of Israel talked about -- he's talked about how he has known so many Israeli Prime Ministers for the last 40 years has made so many visits to Israel, to have him come out and make such a public and sharp critique of Benjamin Netanyahu and of his planned judicial overhaul. That is incredible to me.

That is incredible in its own right.Now the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded in a middle of the night tweet thread, saying that while the alliance between Israel and the United States will be unbreakable, he is trying, he says, to strive to achieve a broad consensus. But he also talked about how Israel will make its own decisions and will not be based on pressures from abroad. What's also been interesting is to hear from Netanyahu's coalition partners and their allies talking about how Israel will need to make its own decisions. His minister of national security Itamar Ben-Gvir saying that Israel is not one of the stars on the United States flag. Some are even saying that the Americans are being fed what they call fake news about a coup in Israel. Those are quite striking comments from Israel's ruling coalition. This whole situation that was being portrayed in the Israeli media as a crisis in the relationship between Israel and the United States. This is likely not something that the Israeli government was seeking to have on top of the brewing internal crisis over this overhaul. Now, as you noted, there is a pause right now in the legislation to get the two sides to come to some sort of compromise agreement, but we are very, very far from that compromise agreement being anywhere nearby -- Bianca.",
