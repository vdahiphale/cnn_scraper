But, anyway, all right, the great debate unknowns, we got four of them and we'll kind of go through them quickly here.How rusty will these candidates be? We're dealing with record old candidates, and neither of them debated during the primary season. That is the first time that that has ever happened where neither candidate debated during the primary season. Usually at least one, if not two, has done going into a general election debate. So, how rusty will they be come Thursday? We're just going to have to wait and see. All right, how about some other great unknowns heading into this debate? Does Trump name a V.P.? He's kind of teased a little bit, because if he does, it might be the only thing that we talk about post-debate. If all of a sudden you have a complete ticket on the Republican side, it could cover up for a potential gaffe that he in fact might make. Maybe if he feels like the debate is going well, he won't actually say anything. All right, that's two unknowns. How about a third unknown? Which Donald Trump shows up at the debate on Thursday night? Are we going to get that first debate Donald Trump from 2020 where he's constantly trying to interrupt folks, or are we potentially going to get calmer Trump, a calmer Trump to maybe throw Biden off, who's so prepping for Trump to try and interrupt him at every turn, but all of a sudden we get a Trump that is, dare I say, a little bit more presidential? Of course, presidential and Trump, not necessarily two things that always go together in a sentence. Finally, one other thing I'll note, what will be the impact of the fact that this is the earliest debate on record by far. This is happening three months before any prior general election debate. It could make for a maximum effect, right? Oftentimes we have these debates, and then you see a debate a week later, a vice presidential debate, which basically keeps the sort of bump a candidate might have at a minimum. Maybe we could have a maximum effect on this one, especially considering there are no other debates anytime soon. So, this is going to basically take up a chunk of the news cycle, not just this week, not just next week, but going into July.

And he said, are you going to save the world or to be an actor? And back then we didn't know you could try to do both. So, this has been important to me for a long time.And I think that you really hit the nail on the head when you said personal because we talk about legislation. We talk about bans. We talk about the Supreme Court. And abortion care is personal. It's about stories. It's about our lives. It's about our capacity to decide if to have children, when to have children, how many to have, how to plan and space the births of those children and to terminate a pregnancy if that's what we need to do. And there're so many different ways to address this. My abortion story includes male sexual violence. A guy I'd known for a really long time raped me. That rape resulted in pregnancy. And the relief I experienced when I accessed an abortion was enormous. And there were many reasons for that, not the least of which is that rapists have paternity rights in Kentucky and Tennessee, as they do in 43 states. So, when we're talking about these bans with no exceptions for rape and incest and particularly looking at the vulnerability of adolescent girls forcing them to give birth, when maybe their pelvises aren't developed enough to safely give birth without developing fistula, there's so many ways to talk about this.

Their number one concern is getting, you know, all the hostages back. For them, you know, it's been a long time that they didn't know whether their son was alive or not. They then got a proof-of-life video on day 201 back in April. Hersh's left hand had been blown or shot off in the attack. He was in a bomb shelter that they were shooting and throwing grenades into.So, that was the first proof-of-life they've had. They've had no word of Hersh since then. So, they're just desperate to get to, you know, inform people and keep people, you know, trying to remember that there are hostages being held, that there are American hostages being held.",
