And we want to see a peaceful transition and no threats to the neighbors. What we're hearing from the Gulf Arab states, from Jordan and from Iraq, is some nervousness. Assad was very unpopular. He was a threat to the region through his alliance with Iran, but he was a threat they knew through him and his father for 50 years. They don't know who these guys are, and so there is some nervousness. We're going to have to work closely with the U.N., which has a mandate still on the books to try to reconcile everybody in Syria, and also stay close with our partners, which is, again, Israel, Turkey, the Arab states, and in the northeast, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.

We saw him as a bulwark against Assad.Two administrations, the Trump administration and then the Biden administration, worked with all these factions to freeze the conflict and stop Iran, Assad, and Russia from taking over the country. That worked until last week, and then the country started collapsing. Again, that's good. Julani has been relatively effective in managing a significant chunk of Syria in the northwest with some 3 million people who fled Assad into the area. He's worked closely with the Turks. And again, we had USAID providing contractors support to the people in that area administered by Jelani. We had to sign waivers, but it all worked. We didn't have any problems with him.

But at no point did Bashar al-Assad express, you know, solidarity with his own people and with the modernization in the region.Remember when he first came to power, there was a group, there was a threesome of new Arab leaders. There was King Abdullah of Jordan who had taken over after the death of the longtime Jordanian monarch King Hussein. There was Bashar al-Assad in Syria after the death of the longtime dictator Hafez al-Assad. And then in Morocco as well, Hassan VI had taken over after the death of his father. And there was a thought back then, and this is, you know, early 2000s, there was a thought that these three new leaders would usher in a new reality. Well, in Syria it didn't happen. There was a lot of hope, there was a lot of investment by the United States and others to try to see whether there was a new ability to create maybe not a full democracy but at least some kind of different situation. But it never happened. And then of course the assassination of Rafic Hariri, the reformist modernizing president of -- prime minister of Lebanon who was assassinated. The U.N. blamed the forces of Syria. You know, Assad always denied it. But that's what happened there. And then you saw the gradual dissolution of the Lebanese state as well. And now all these years later, and in the interim of the Arab Spring when Iran came in specifically first to put down the Syrian-Arab Spring, Iran came in on the ground along with its Hezbollah foot soldiers, and then shortly thereafter, a couple of years later, Russia entered saying that it was coming in to put down terrorism. And a point that Lavrov, the foreign minister, raised yesterday, they said we came into Syria and they came in on the ground, you remember, and they were serious proxies at the U.N. Security Council. They always were the political voice for Assad and protected him in the international community for all these years. Now all that investment has essentially appeared to have gone down the drain. We don't know if there are any meetings between the rebels and the Turkish authorities and the Russians and the Iranians. We don't know how this is going to end up. And we don't really know what the pathway by the rebels is going to be. They talk a good game right now. They're talking about being more inclusive. Julani, who is apparently the head of this rebel group, who was a member of al-Qaeda who then broke away, created HTS, or whatever it is, the group that they're with now, we don't know where they're going. We also don't know whether ISIS will be reengaged, but we certainly do know that the United States doesn't want to get involved. We've heard a tweet from President-elect Trump, but presumably they will use their ability because they are, you know, they are also stationed in Syria. How long that will last, we don't know. But they say that they will continue to operate against ISIS if that threat reemerges. So a lot of unknowns right now, except for the fall of the Assad regime. That seems to be clear.",

Let's stay right here in this -- the implications for Israel and what this means now that Julani and HTS are in control. Julani has his roots in al-Qaeda Islamists. Does he want that fight with Israel? I mean, considering all that must be managed now with taking over after Assad has been forced out, does he also want to head southwest?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Victor, good morning again. I think the answer to that is for the moment, no. Julani seems to be somebody who understands that he needs to consolidate power at this particular moment in time. And what he's looking at, Victor, is basically melding together a workable coalition, not only of the people that he has with him right now, with the groups that he has with him right now, which are, you know, certainly a disparate bunch of different factions, but he also wants to make sure that he can have a viable government in Syria. He's got a lot of challenges. Not only does he have to control the area, that -- to maintain control of the area that he has right now, and that includes, obviously, Damascus, but he also has to work with the areas in the west where perhaps loyalists to Assad still exist. The other thing is in the northeast, in that yellow area around Raqqa, that is Kurdish territory, and that, of course, gives him a lot of challenges right there as well. So the last thing he needs is to go into Israel or do something that, in essence, provokes Israel to do something. The Israelis have moved troops into the Balfour zone (ph), and the Golan Heights. Their 210th Division is the one that is looking into Syria and is basically to respond to anything that happens there. But the Israelis also do not want to get involved in anything in Syria. They're waiting to see what happens and, you know, what kind of regime Julani and his groups create out of what has happened here.",

And that's going to have to come from a multiplicity of sources, but primarily the rich Gulf States would be a prime candidate for that as well.

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, certainly there should be anxiety, and I'm sure mixed in with the jubilation there is. Look, in short, this is the removal of one of the most horrific brutal dictatorial regimes in modern times by an unknown.We do think we know quite a lot about HTS, the group who led the rebel forces here. And this is a huge smuggler's board, different types of rebel groups here, some on the extreme fringes, others much more western-minded in terms of the moderate force that they wish to market themselves as being. But ultimately, the leader of HTS, al-Jolani, is a man with a $10 million bounty on his head because of his former associations with Al Qaeda, associations that he now rejects and very much trying to suggest he is a matured version of himself. But as we well know, this is all easy to market oneself as in an offensive where you're taking towns and moving forwards militarily. The job of governance is exceptionally hard. Although, the messages we've been hearing so far very, carefully put together from HTS is that they wish to be a government that has a space for all the different religions, the different sects, the different ethnicities inside of Syria. There's obviously one potential immediate issue outside of trying to heal the horrific rifts between the Alawi Shia that form the minority that essentially Bashar al-Assad relied upon to keep himself in power, and the Sunni majority who they persecuted horrifically in the civil war, and that's the Kurds who are supported by the United States up in the northeastern area that were the bulwark of the U.S. campaign against ISIS, died and did so much of the fighting for them. Turkey, who've been pretty much, I think it's fair to say, the eminence grise behind this remarkable lightning rebel advance and, frankly, its sophistication and the sophistication and inclusiveness of its messaging, Turkey have made it quite clear they don't want to see any support for those Kurds because they see some of the affiliated groups of the Kurds in the northeast as being terrorists in the minds of Turkey. So, we've already have one huge complicating factor here initially. Is that necessarily going to come to a head in the week ahead? Possibly not. It may get put on a back burner. But we're now dealing with the huge complexity of a group that's been in the sidelines for a long period of time and obviously, suddenly, found itself capable of taking on the hollow remains of the Assad regime abandoned, it seems, by Tehran and Moscow having to deal with a country that's been through utter horrors in 13 years. Just to remind people, you know, the Assad regime, Bashar's father carried out the massacre of about 20,000 people in Hama in 1982. That was, you know, where we're building from. And the Syrian civil war saw the use of sarin gas against children's suffocating in a basement in 2013 in the east of Damascus. We've seen prisoners turning up in Aleppo's rivers bound and shot at point blank range. We've seen random airstrikes using barrel bombs, essentially the hollow, empty barrel filled with all sorts of metal fragments and explosive and just dropped on civilian areas to cause horror and damage, tearing across so much of Syria. Bashar was responsible for some utterly horrific things, and that's certainly scarred a nation. And that will make them, I think, possibly many Syrians desperate for change, for hope, maybe for some kind of better governance, but also with an awful lot of tough stuff to get over.",
