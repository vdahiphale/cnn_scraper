      "sentences": "This is very significant. Russia says it suspended the deal for an indefinite period. This was a deal that was struck by the U.N. Two parallel deals. One with Ukraine and one with Russia at the end of July. And it was struck. Because since Russia invaded Ukraine, all the grain that Ukraine produces and it produces a lot for the world was stuck in its ports on the Black Sea, piling up nowhere to go.And the third world countries this grain was destined for desperately short of food, the prices were going up. So after that deal was struck, the anticipation was about 20 million tons of grain could be shipped out of Ukraine to these third world and other countries. Now, what we know has happened during this period, a barely half of that has been exported 9.1 million tons, about 403 ships have come in here. And in recent weeks, Ukrainian officials have been saying that Russia has been slowing up the way that the grain deal is working. Russia has been complaining and saying that actually this grain is not going to the right places. It's not going to the third world, it's going to the first world. What's interesting about this deal in the first place is that the only or one of the only reasons Russia agreed to allow Ukraine to get the grain out of the country. Remembering that Russia precipitated all of this by starting the war. One of the only reasons Russia agreed was because they were given some sanctions relief. What happened overnight last night, Russia is saying is the reason for the suspension. Russia is alleging that in occupied Crimea that they occupy in the port of Sevastopol. Some of their ships were blown up or damaged and they say that was done by the Ukrainian military with the help or led by British specialists. Ukrainian officials are saying that's not true. That didn't happen. So now the deal has been suspended. The U.N. is asking Russia to hold fire on its decision.",

And he's going to have to continue with relying on advertising for now.You see him on Twitter saying he's going to start a content moderation council to make decisions about content moderation. You know, yesterday, he said that no major content moderation decisions had been made yet, despite previously promising to rollback some of these restrictions. And so -- but, you know, in the last 24 hours, we've also seen a lot of this sort of objectionable content, a lot of racist content, a lot of hate speech, starting to bubble up. I think people are trying to test the limits now that there's a new leader involved. And so I think the big question at this point is, how soon is he going to act on some of that content.

You have heard in some of the people in this piece. Notably, the woman who said people who didn't have insurance seemed to be getting assistance quicker in the form of FEMA money or some financial assistance than those who did have insurance. What is your response to people trying to navigate what is very difficult?",

      "sentences": "Well, there's no doubt it is very difficult. I would echo that everyone at FEMA is very empathetic and compassionate towards the kinds of experiences these folks are going through.Really it is some of the most dramatic and the most difficult things you can go through as a human being. So that is not lost on us. What I can tell you is we are here to support the state and local governments as they apply all their capabilities for folks like the ones you have interviewed. I can tell you, first and foremost, we support the state. We have a unified group with the state. We are executing policy and process that executes protocols, if you will. Embracing that is also legislation and other concerns that means we have to go through certain ways of getting people to the right place. That's where I'm going to go. The good news, it's not 1.2. It is $1.6 billion that has been incumbered to both households and FEMA and also local and state governments to facilitate their emergency response. There's the Small Business Administration, which is here as well, with significant hundreds and millions in loan amounts, as well as the insurance capacity. That is 1.6 as we speak. Obviously, money is great. But there's also boots on the ground. Again, this is coordinated and unified with the state where we have our disaster response centers. Those are actual physical locations. There are places people can go and try to work through these issues. Yes, every individual is different. And the components of how they live their life, where, the financial decisions they make are all part of how we have to assess both in their situation and apply it towards all the programs that we can bring to bear in partnership again with our state. So I think there's a way to go at this. And that includes the online capability if they have the Internet. There's an app process with they have cellular capabilities and can put the app on their phone. There's also the 1-800 number, 621-FEMA. All of those are ways to access. As well as we are backing that up with disaster servicemembers actually walking the streets. They are out in 22 different counties trying to facilitate every way to make contact with people. Not just one time but follow up again and again. And we encourage people. I get that sometimes the line was too long. Certainly earlier on. Or whatever it was that hit their difficulty with persevering. We asked for patience. But we are getting better, faster stronger every day. Now at the four-week mark, as I say, we have 22. And we hope to build out as many as 30 disaster relief centers. Those are co-located with the Small Business Administration, our state partners so we can get back in. If anyone has given up, please don't. Please give us that extra chance to get back in. We have set up different ways we can get you to another name. And sometimes, because of the way this works, it's not that you have to be rejected. But you have to show good intent. And I know everybody has. But don't give up on us. Go back in. If you had to leave the state for housing, go update your information because we do have people that are reaching out and returning phone calls, returning apps as best we can. That was a little long, I guess.",

OK, you're back. And while there's money that's been dispensed. There's shelter that's been offered. There's still a lot of frustration one month after. And there are people who don't see any end to it. And looking at the reminders of the debris everywhere, it just is symbolic of this monolithic, gigantic, gargantuan task.

I spent the morning with Kevin Guthrie, the emergency management director, and all of us are focused on the same thing. Give us another try. If you get good cell phone coverage -- and I was on the islands this morning and the cell coverage is go. If you can get to the app and don't give us. We are also driving hard to build more of the disaster relief centers. They should be at a scope and scale as we get into the next week where it won't be very long lines they experienced in week one or two. Like I say, the capacity is there. The money is there. And I will tell you, FEMA prides themselves on core values of compassion, fairness, integrity and respect in everything we do. And our strategic plan is instilling equity and responding to the effects of climate change, as well as readying the nation. We work with FEMA in Florida and they are good people here. So don't give up on us. I know it's too long. It always feels that way. But if they can continue with us, continue to access the different ways, or be available out front.
