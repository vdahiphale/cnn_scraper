THOMAS GIFT, CENTRE ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF LONDON: Well, I think that that's absolutely right. You know, Donald Trump won last night, because nothing disturbed the equilibrium where he's the clear frontrunner. And I think nothing happened that would make Trump second guess his decision to bow out a future debates. And I think that's really all that matters. But, you know, it's got -- you've got to say, it's hard to parse winners and losers. Like this is a typical debate, because it's really not a typical debate, the guy that's dominating the polls isn't there. Most of Trump's rivals save Chris Christie and to a lesser extent, Ron DeSantis are essentially pretending that he does not exist. Usually, we can assume that candidates are at least trying to knock a leader, but Donald Trump's Achilles heels, the criminal indictment that he is facing were not even brought up. And with the president facing 92 felony charges that's really something. So I think the debate felt more about a diversion. There was some infighting, some psycho traumas among the different candidates that were there. But no one's really budging in the polls. And I don't think that's all to Trump's advantage.",

You know, you can't ignore that. The underlying pretense of these debates is that there is a real competition. But there's not a real competition. And I think by refusing to show up, Trump is just reinforcing his main message, which is that this is going to be a coronation. It's not going to be a primary. And, you know, Trump's entire candidacy is built around this air of inevitability, that his nomination is somehow preordained. That it's kind of self fulfilling. And I think that looks right.

And the only way that Trump is going to face a real primary is if he is forced to go head to head with a single opponent, whether that is DeSantis, or Haley, or someone else. That does mean other candidates dropping out.Either in the coming weeks or bright before Iowa and New Hampshire, because, right now, this is Trump versus everyone else primary. It's a huge fractured field. Everyone is putting in an anti-Trump vote, and in winner-take-all, or proportional primaries, Bianca, Trump can essentially amassed all the delegates with that formula. So he's got 55 percent of the party vote at the moment. The only way to beat that is one-on-one. But there is a collective action problem which is, dropping out might be good for the broader effort to challenge Trump but it's not good for the candidates individually. And no one wants to self sacrifice, and no one wants to be that first mover. So I think to a large extent, there's going to be pressure on some of these candidates that are just lingering in the single digits, but, you know, who is actually willing to bow out first? I'm not sure if I see it. Particularly because it almost seems futile. You know, if Donald Trump is going to run away with this, why not just stay in the race?",

In South Korea where he was involved in a altercation at a club in Seoul, South Korea, he was set to return to the United States to face a potential disciplinary action by United States military. It was dropped off at the airport, set to board a flight. But then was able to leave the airport and then ended up in the demilitarized zone. And we saw this very dramatic set of events unfold, as far as his current status. A lot of that according to officials is going to depend on how his examination goes. Once these questions and answer sessions take place, once his health is evaluated. We will get a better idea as to where some of these administrative issues will go, how they will be handled.",
