The flow of ships in and out of the port is indefinitely halted, straining supply chains along the East Coast.Matt Egan joins me now for more. So, Matt, how big of an impact will this have on all of us, particularly on the East Coast?",

      "sentences": "Well, Alisyn, this disaster has crippled the Port of Baltimore. It's really delivered a body blow to the local economy. This port is a major employer. We're talking about 15,000 people directly employed, around 140,000 in related services. Now, those workers are facing the threat of having their hours cut or even being temporarily laid off.And Baltimore is a key part of the supply chain. This is a major port. It's the number one port when it comes to sugar imports, number two for coal exports, farm and construction machinery imports. And it's also really critical when it comes to autos. 850,000 vehicles went through this port last year alone. That was a record. And a lot of major companies are going to be impacted because they either rely on the port or they did rely on the bridge or both. We've already heard from a number of companies on the auto space, Ford, GM, Stellantis, Carnival. They're moving their cruise ships to Virginia. We know that FedEx and Honor Armor, Home Depot, they have a presence. Also, Domino Sugar, they have a sugar cane refinery that is really a landmark in the Baltimore Harbor, but it's also the biggest sugar cane refinery in the Western Hemisphere. And, Alisyn, you know, during and right after COVID, you and I spent a lot more time talking about supply chains than we ever imagined we would, and we learned that when something breaks in one part of the supply chain, there are shock waves elsewhere.",

      "sentences": "Well, so I think the early assessment here is that, yes, this is going to deal a significant blow to the local economy, but that the national economy is likely going to be spared significant damage. And that's because when you look at the map, there are other options here. Along the East Coast, there are major ports where cargo can get redirected, including the Port of Virginia, Port of Philadelphia, New York, and New Jersey. And, in fact, we're already seeing that happen.Now, we do have to pay attention to what the ripple effects are there, right? Because we could be looking at some port congestion at some of those East Coast ports. That could cause delays. Also, it's going to cost money to get all of the cargo shipped by truck to those other ports. So, that could add to costs as well. But right now, we're not hearing major alarm, major concern from economists. They're not downgrading their growth forecasts. They're not warning of price spikes. J.P. Morgan put out a report saying that even in the auto sector, there's probably just going to be a minimal impact when it comes to car prices. But Alisyn, like everything else, the longer this disruption lasts, the greater the impact. And U.S. officials are warning that nothing about this is going to be easy or straightforward.",

We have come together in the past with major disasters like this, like the one in Minneapolis back in 2007, 2008. And look, I think this is one of those moments that people recognize that we've got to help states when they are really hurting through no fault of their own.So, we may be able to recover, of course, some funds from the shipping company. Ultimately, we obviously are awaiting the report from the National Transportation Safety Board. I talked to the chair of the board yesterday. So, there are other sources of revenue that could support the bridge rebuilding effort. I will say, Alisyn, that on this immediate issue of clearing the channel, the president has already ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to begin work. They're working with the Coast Guard. They'll probably bring in some Navy assets. That obviously needs to happen very quickly for all the reasons that you just reported in terms of the economic impact on workers in Baltimore, the region, and then the ripple effects beyond that.",

So, here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETE BUTTIGIEG, U.S. TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY:  The impact of this incident is going to be felt throughout the region and really throughout our supply chains. We're talking about the biggest vehicle handling port in the country that is now out of commission until that channel can be cleared and a bridge that took five years to build. This is going to be a big, long and not inexpensive road to recovery. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, the most important thing is getting this channel cleared because as your reporting indicated right now, the port of Baltimore has stopped operations. I believe there were four ships in port when the bridge collapsed. There were 20 waiting to get into the port. They'll have to be diverted elsewhere. But that is the issue.I mean, there are about $80 billion worth of cargo that comes into the port of Baltimore every year, 15,000, you know, direct jobs over any more beyond that. So, clearing that channel. You know, this is a dredged channel. It's a deep channel to take these supertankers. I mean, this ship was about, you know, more than three football fields long. So, that has got to be the priority for the economy of Baltimore, Maryland, and the region. And so, getting the Army Corps of Engineers in there, getting it evaluated quickly, that has to be the priority as we do the longer- term work through building the bridge. And I want to thank Secretary Buttigieg. There's a fund, Alisyn, called the Emergency Relief Fund. It's within the federal highway administration. The state is going to be taking the urgent steps to access those funds right away.",

And that will go into the assessment of fault, and of course, ultimately, who has to pay some of the costs here.But, you know, in the immediate term, I'm really glad the president ordered the Army Corps to clear this channel so Baltimore Port operations can resume. And then ultimately, of course, as the president also said, rebuild this bridge that, you know, carries over 35,000 vehicles a day. Right now, vehicles, commercial vehicles that have hazardous material have to be rerouted along the outer beltway in Baltimore because they cannot go through the tunnel, the Baltimore Tunnel, which would be the other ways to, you know, get through this harbor area underwater. So, obviously, lots of disruption. We're going to be dealing with that in terms of diverting traffic. But again, priority right now, clear the channel, reopen the Port of Baltimore.",

They are 17 years old and they were on their way to a pre-planned vacation out of Miami where Diddy owns a home when he was briefly stopped by authorities. He cooperated with them and then was released.Now, there were no arrests made. And as -- according to Diddy's attorney, they think that this was a completely overzealous operation. I am hearing from this source close to Diddy that they were shocked by the scope of these raids on his homes. And we have a statement from his attorney. I want to read part of that to you, Alisyn. He says, \"Yesterday, there was a gross overuse of military level force as search warrants were executed at Mr. Combs' residences. There is no excuse for the excessive show of force and hostility exhibited by authorities or the way his children and employees were treated.\" Now, they go on to say that Mr. Combs is innocent and will continue to fight every single day to clear his name. They are calling this a \"witch hunt,\" and they believe that this was a coordinated effort. I hear that Diddy's team believes that the media was tipped off on the raid on his Los Angeles home because there was a local news chopper hovering over the home before the breach into Diddy's property. Now, of course, as this investigation is going on, this comes at a time that Diddy is facing five different lawsuits. This all started back in November, 2023, when the singer Cassie, who is Diddy's ex, they were in a long-term relationship. She sued him in November. Now, they settled overnight. But then soon after, there were two more lawsuits that came, and now Diddy is facing five suits total. Now, he denies all of the claims in these suits, but they are very serious. Cassie has accused him of rape and sex trafficking, among others. So again, very serious claims that Diddy is denying.",
