The Baltic State of Lithuania hosts some of the anti-Putin Russian opposition, like Alexei Navalny's former chief of staff, who was recently attacked by thugs in the capital Vilnius, a chilling sign of Putin's ideas beyond Ukraine. Gabrielius Landsbergis is Lithuania's foreign minister and one of Ukraine's fiercest allies. He is currently in the United States to drum up urgent support.

And this is a very horrible story, and it's a horrible story not just to Ukraine. It's a very sad story also to the neighbors. It's also a very sad and horrible story to Lithuania, where we've seen Russia encroaching, where we've seen Russia winning wars in the past, and where we see countries losing their independence to Russia.

We can argue with Russians, and we have this agreement in place. When the war broke out again in 2022, you know, there were people coming out and saying, look, Baltics were right. And now, you would hear Baltics saying exactly the same thing, Putin is not about to stop. Today, we're hearing a message from Putin's officials who are saying that they are going to recreate their army, basically, possibly mobilizing additionally up to 500,000 troops, additionally what they currently have. They already have one-third more than they had before the start of the war in 2022. Now, they're planning additionally to mobilize. What would they need it for? I mean, the question is real, it's actual, and we have to get prepared. So, honestly, what we need right now is not coming down. We need mobilization.

I think, in general, what we can say is that as soon as possible there should be a return to this dialogue, and that this form could be the start, the New START, or any kind of agreement that may exist, but it is clear that the number of nuclear weapons must be reduced and ultimately eliminated completely, but we know that it is not for tomorrow.",

We also see and hear than closer to my own mission, which is non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.

You know, In certain parts of the country, their whole entire funding is being cut, you know. So, it is a time where, as a community, we are all trying to gather around and help and support one another. And I think in terms of the West End, I mean, it's commercial theater. You know, getting big stars is part of the history and the blood of what commercial theater is. And it's a testament to Nica Burns and to Nimax that, you know, they really took a punt on us. You know, when I first had conversations with a lot of producers, it was about, would you want to recast and get some big names? And I'm like, there's something about this play that is authentic and raw, you know? And it's a lived experience. And I was like, no. And I really, really fought to have these young men in it.
