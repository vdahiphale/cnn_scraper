That he wants to find a way to get his case moved out of state court to federal court so he can be shielded. But that is going to take lawyering and at this point in time, Rudy Giuliani has a series of bills around fighting investigations and lawsuits that are really making him essentially out of cash.He says this in a court filing in Monday, one that was in a lawsuit where he's being sued by the company Smartmatic, the voting company. They want access to some of the records that he has. They are held up in a company that hosts electronic records. And yet, Giuliani doesn't have the money to be able to pay for those records to be searched at that time. That bill would be about $15, 000, or $23, 000, somewhere in that range. And he just doesn't have it. So, he's had to go to the court and say he doesn't have it. But on top of that, there are so many other legal bills that Giuliani has at this time that we're learning about in court filing after court filing. There's a 20,000-dollar fee for him to keep his electronic records stored so that we can respond to other lawsuits. There's a 50,000-$57,000 court judgment that he recently received because his company, Giuliani Partners, didn't pay all of its phone bills in 2020, and now have to pay that $57,000 for the unpaid phone bills. There's also a sanction he's received from another judge in another lawsuit related to the 2020 election of $89,000 for not turning over all the evidence he needed to -- just like in the Smartmatic lawsuit. And so, that $89,000 that appears to be just the tip of the spear as others are trying to get Rudy Giuliani either to pay for their legal bills, if they are suing him, and he is not responding the way that he needs to in court, and they're also trying to get judges to rule in their favor, since there are several lawsuits around him related to what he was doing for Donald Trump after the 2020 election.

But officials keep warning that that heartbreaking figure were only keep rising. Search and recovery teams are sifting through the ash and debris of what used to be vibrant neighborhoods in the tourist town of Lahaina. So far, they have made it through less than one third of the disaster zone. We're hearing the main highway into Lahaina will fully reopen for the foreseeable future for the first time since the tragedy. But it will still be closed nightly from 10:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. local time. One resident described the devastation that she finds on her doorstep. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Only about 60 percent of this upcountry fire has been contained, and we can actually see at least two hotspots around here, which explains the yellow helicopter. That is the Maui fire department. He's taking bucketloads of water from a nearby swimming pool of a home that is completely burned down. They're refilling it with a fire hydrant. But the fire department is stretched so thin here that it's really sort of do it yourself, DIY, fire protection, which explains this set up.This homeowner was gone, his wife was here, but she fired up their improvised sort of fire prevention system. And they're spraying it as far as they can down into the ravine here. With the fear that some of these hot spots might whip up. There's a couple of storms brewing in the Pacific, nothing near to the hurricane or the storm Dora that created all the fire storm winds. But still, anything that would kick this up is one more horrible thing to worry about here. Meanwhile in Lahaina, officials say only about a third of that area has been searched with cadaver dogs. About a dozen souls have been identified through DNA, four identified and notified families. And then they've got dozens of other families who are now giving DNA samples because they have loved ones who are missing. So it's agony knowing maybe the worst has happened, but hoping you'll get a better result. Here again comes another drop. And in addition to fire departments sprinklers, we actually met a couple of guys, volunteers who are putting out hotspots with bottled water, sort of bushwhacking through this dry brush. One of them actually burned a foot when he slid into still-smoldering ash. So that's the scene here in upcountry. People understand here that there's a lot of action and sympathy happening in Lahaina. But this is an ongoing story. We're going to stay on it for you all day here. I'm Bill Weir, CNN, in Maui.

We do drop by the time we get to Friday, 100 in Portland, Seattle close to 90 degrees -- normal high is 78 degrees. So, a huge departure from normal across this region.In fact, we are finally seeing cooler temperatures across portions of the mid-South, where high temperatures in Memphis, 81 degrees. That's really come down. However, right along the Gulf Coast, that's where temperatures are going to stay very hot. Dallas at 97 degrees, that's cooler than we have been, Kansas city at 85, D.C. at 87. Below average temperatures are going to take hold across portions of the East. But below average temperatures will quickly start to build in behind that, especially for the Northern Plains as we get into the beginning part of next week. Cooler temperatures will be found across the Rockies and the West. Feels like temperatures this afternoon, 101 in Houston, 91 in Shreveport, 97 in Dallas. So really, temperatures are in the 90s but feeling so much better than we have been over the last several days and even weeks on end for the summer. So, I think it will be a noticeable change across this region. High temperatures will climb though once again. Enjoy it while we can, at temperatures at 97 degrees, because we'll be back to 109 in Dallas Thursday and Friday. Monroe hitting 104 on Friday, New Orleans hitting nearly 100 by the time we get to Friday. We do have a couple of lingering storms that we have to deal with today that will be pushing off portions of the Southeast. We do have a severe risk today as well across the upper Midwest, with damaging wind and large hail being your primary threat. This is a level two out of five when it comes to severe weather. So, here's that forecast radar. And you can see those showers and storms just racing across. By the time we get into Wednesday night into the wee hours of Thursday morning, your forecast rainfall, looking at about an inch or two of rain. We could see some heavier downpours with higher amounts across some of these areas for the upper Midwest.

Now we don't -- we're not able to independently verify this account or indeed how many mass graves there are in Sudan. In July, CNN reported that 87 bodies were found in a mass grave, also in West Darfur. Now this conflict has an ethnic tinge to it. A lot of bodies that were found from the Masalit non-Arabic community tribes. And you remember that Darfur was also the site of genocide 20 years ago. Now the devastation in Sudan has been total.
