And right now, what we're seeing on Capitol Hill is a total impasse over this issue of the supplemental package that includes some $60 billion of additional aid from the US to support Ukraine. And it seems very unlikely that anything on this front is going to get done before the end of the year.Look, I think both leaders had hoped that this kind of highly symbolic and high-profile in-person visit from President Zelenskyy could help sway some of these Republican lawmakers who are very much set on making sure that border policy is attached to the supplemental package. It seems like that is not going to happen. But there's also sort of a broader goal as well to this visit, and that is sort of sending a message to the rest of the world, including Russia and President Vladimir Putin, that the world, the international coalition that backs Ukraine remains steadfast, supportive of the Ukrainian cause. Now, President Biden and President Zelenskyy, of course, has met before. This was about a year ago at the White House. But it's incredibly notable just how much the politics around this issue has changed. And certainly not helping President Zelenskyy or President Biden is the fact that here at home, public opinion on this issue has shifted quite significantly as well.",

The president telling donors just some moments ago that Israel is beginning to lose the world's support in terms of this war. You know, we have seen U.S. officials and senior members of the administration in recent weeks increasingly expressing their concerns about the way that Israel is conducting this war. Particularly when you're looking at the huge civilian death toll in the Gaza Strip and the massive amounts of destruction that we have seen. And the U.S. has said pretty explicitly that the way that Israel conducts its war in the south must look different than how it conducted its war in northern Gaza earlier on in the conflict.And, you know, even last night, we heard the president basically warning Israel, look, public opinion when it comes to this war can change quickly. But today, it seems like for the first time and probably the most pointed remarks that he has given on this issue so far, the president confirming that Israel is, in fact, beginning to lose support on the war. The other thing that was incredibly noteworthy was the president saying that Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel, needed to change his government because it is too conservative and that it doesn't support a two-state solution. This, of course, is a very strong signal that we are getting from the White House, from the president himself, that this administration at moment in time, is beginning to think in concrete terms about what the post-war Gaza governance should look like. And there are some major differences that we are already seeing between the U.S. and Israel on this issue. Of course, the war is now well into its third month. But again, just clear signals that the administration is starting to focus more and more on that issue.",

We're following the facts where they lead is hitting a stone wall because the White House is impeding that investigation now. They're not allowing witnesses to come forward and thousands of pages of documents. So, we have no choice to fulfill our constitutional responsibility. We have to take the next step.

Hunter Biden lives in California, but we know right now he is in Washington, D.C., and he will be here tomorrow, which is the date where House Republicans have demanded that he come in and sit for a closed-door deposition as part of their escalated impeachment inquiry. Now, Hunter Biden has said he's willing to answer questions, even though he now faces two criminal cases, but he wants to answer these questions publicly. His lawyers have said they're concerned if they sit behind closed doors that Republicans might, you know, selectively leak certain information to help their narrative.Republicans, though, they rejected that request. They said, look, we want you. We insist that you sit behind closed doors first, and then maybe eventually we can do something publicly. And last we knew, there's just a stalemate. But our colleague on the Hill, Annie Greer (ph), says that Republicans, they are prepared for Hunter to possibly show up tomorrow among their preparations. Cameras are set up for the deposition. Now, that would not be for us to see. That would be for them. Lawyers have prepared hundreds of questions, but they haven't heard from Biden's legal team. So, at this point, it's unclear if Hunter Biden is going to show up. But again, he's going to be in town. This could be quite the showdown if he does show up, because as of right now, there's no agreement as to whether this interview will take place. And if it does, publicly or behind closed doors.",

I just want to do it publicly. I showed up, maybe in a suit or whatever, right? I said I would do it. I would sit with you. But you were being too specific on the terms.

And this is just a process we have to go through in our democracy to work with our parties. We've got divided government. The Democrats are not in charge of everything, so they've got to compromise.

So, I don't know that the support is flagging. Certainly, there are some of my colleagues who are wondering about why are we giving more money to Ukraine when we haven't actually fixed our problems at the border. And that's a sentiment that the American people share.And you can go look at the polling numbers on the president's job approval rating at the board and see that he is significantly underwater because of his poor handling of it.

So, I think with broad agreement we need to do that.I think the other thing is that the president put the border in place. in his supplemental request. So, if it's a mistake, it's the president's mistake, because he put it in there. And the mistake the president is also making is he hasn't done anything about it in the three years he's been president.  So, policy has to be a part of this.
