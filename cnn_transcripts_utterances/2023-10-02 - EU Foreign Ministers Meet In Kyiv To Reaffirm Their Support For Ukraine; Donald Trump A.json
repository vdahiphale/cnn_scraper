That hasn't been enough to alleviate fears of Ukraine fatigue. Then former President Donald Trump appears in court for day one of his civil fraud trial, and as expected, he's slamming the proceedings. We'll have all the details for you. Plus, I will be speaking to the President of Costa Rica as he orders a state of emergency over the surging migrant crisis. That interview coming up very shortly. We begin tonight though with reassurances from the European Union as foreign ministers meet in Kyiv to offer their support to Ukraine, sensing what seems to be some Ukraine fatigue setting around the world, EU Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell threw his full weight behind the war effort. This is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOSEP BORRELL, HIGH REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS &amp; SECURITY POLICY: This war is having deep consequences for the whole world. But for us, Europeans, it's an existential threat. Maybe not been seen like this for everybody around the world, but for us, Europeans, I don't need to repeat it, it's an existential threat. And that's why we have to continue supporting them and discussing with our American allies and friends for them to continue to supporting. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Well, those meetings come after the U.S. left aid to Ukraine out of a temporary bill to fund their government, andanother sign of possible Ukraine fatigue is right next door as Slovakia elects a pro-Kremlin prime minister. EU leaders say their support is unwavering. The big question now is whether that will remain the case if support continues to waiver elsewhere. Fred Pleitgen joins now from eastern Ukraine. So Fred, what we saw there, what we heard there from Josep Borrell, a show of unity, a show of support from the EU. But what has been the reaction from Kyiv to the drama critically that we have been seeing in U.S., engulfing U.S. Congress? So they believe that this is just a political blip or do they see this as a sign of waning support here?",

But at the same time, of course, Kyiv is quite concerned about the mood in the United States, and not just in Congress, but also among the United States population as well as they see support for providing weapons to Ukraine also waning. So, for them, it's very important to keep the weapons going because quite frankly, as this war goes on, Isa, Ukraine is increasingly relying on western weapons. They're running out of old Soviet weapons, they were certainly running out of Soviet ammo which they were using before.

More than 84,000people entered Costa Rica through its southern border in just August alone. That's a 55 percent increase from the previous month. In a press conference, President Rodrigo Chaves Robles said they will take a firm stance with quote anyone who takes Costa Rica's kindness for weakness. His words. According to Mr. Chavez, the people crossing through the country are from around the world, including Venezuela, China, Haiti, Yemen, as well as Bangladesh. Well, in a moment, I'll be speaking with Costa Rica's president. But first, we want to remind our viewers of the treacherous journey many migrants are undertaking. And that's the trek through the daring jungle, extending from Columbia through Panama. Many are injured on muddy slopes and vulnerable to robbery, violence and sexual abuse. And last week, if you remember, right here on the show, CNN reported from many points along the route to the United States. Our David Culver brings us to one crossing point along the way. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): To get a better sense of the migrant crisis impact in the U.S., we wanted to come to the border. Not the border you might be thinking of, rather we're at Mexico's southern border with Guatemala. And that's Guatemala over there. And that -- if you look here are folks crossing, waving at us, migrants who have made the journey from various countries. We've met folks from Haiti, from Cuba, from Honduras, ultimately though, many of them tell us, if not all, they want to go north. By the way, that's the official crossing that bridge, not many people using that. Instead, they come to this side, the Mexico side, and this is in to a city that's Ciudad Hidalgo. And they've set up little encampments. You can see here, you've got folks with tents set up, they've got clothes hanging, they're cooking food, you see a lot of families, a lot of young children in particular. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's putting pressure on our communities and public safety, on waste management, on health services, and especially on our budget. We are a country under an IMF program, with some severe austerity to reduce our debt levels. So, our fiscal position has been strained by this migration.

Look, just layout for us, all of us watching this court drama unfold. The opening statements and what this trial may unpack because I believe there are several claims here. SHAN WU, LAWYER &amp; FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR: Sure. So, first of all, it's important for us all to remember that the main issue of liability has already been decided. The judge did something called a summary judgment, which means that no important material, facts were in dispute, and the government Attorney General James is entitled to judgment on the law. On this question of whether the assets had been inflated. So at this stage of the trial overseen by the judge because it's a judge trial, not a jury trial, is all about what kind of penalty is going to be paid by the Trump organization. So as we saw in the opening statement, we're going to see this repeated tension where Trump's legal team tries to take it back in merit, saying there is no fraud, your star witness, perhaps Michael Cohen is a liar, Trump's out-of-the-courtroom statement, this is all political. All that though really tends to go to the liability issue which is mostly done at this point. What they're going to have to do is really get into the crevices about the accounting evaluations to talk about what kind of penalties will be appropriate here. It's going to be pretty dense financial stuff, and I think it's really going to also reveal just how complex is the web that's woven by very rich sophisticated people like Trump who are using these kinds --",

But here, because it's civil in the U.S. system, if he asserts the Fifth Amendment, says I don't have to testify, there can be an adverse inference drawn against that that the judge can use, meaning if you're not testifying, I'm going to assume there's something bad about this point for you. That can't happen in a criminal case. In a criminal case, you cannot testify in the Fifth Amendment, no one can mention it, nothing adverse against you.

The question is whether McCarthy will be able to get a majority of the House voting for him to survive. There's a very thin majority that the Republicans have.
