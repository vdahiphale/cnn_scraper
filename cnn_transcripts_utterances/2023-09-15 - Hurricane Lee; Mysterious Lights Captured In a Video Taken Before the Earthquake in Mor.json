Some of the largest leaders in tech high profile CEOs and members of the Senate met this week in Washington. Why? They were in deep conversation about the future of AI regulations. And they had some serious words of caution about AI, including the potential impact on humanity, like potentially putting humans out of jobs or what might happen if it`s not used responsibly and regulated correctly. But it wasn`t all doom and gloom. They also chatted about how AI could be a total game changer in a good way for our future society. To give us the low down on all this AI drama, here`s CNN Tech Quiz, Brian Fung. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

In the meeting, Bill Gates spoke of how AI could help end world hunger. Others talked about its potential to cure cancer. Elon Musk to the meeting \"may go down in history as being very important for the future of civilization.\" But questions are still swirling about how the us might approach AI regulation. Does the U.S. need a new federal agency to regulate AI? What about bans on AI and political advertising? How soon could Congress come up with a comprehensive bill? Many of these questions are still unresolved after Gates, Musk, and others like Mark Zuckerberg descended on Washington to offer their views. Meanwhile, officials in the meeting from the entertainment industry and labor and civil rights groups called for protecting workers, writers, and minorities from some of the harms that AI could cause. Senators coming out of the meeting said most everyone agreed, the United States should remain a leader in AI development while also trying to protect people. But outside of the meeting room, some lawmakers took issue with how the sessions were closed to the public. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
