While questions have now been raised over how the private industry of deep sea diving should be regulated. Pakistan now says at least 350 of its nationals were onboard the migrant boat that capsized off the coast of Greece last week, leaving hundreds of feared drowned when you see it an investigation reveals what happened in the hours before that fishing boat sank. Western officials say the first stages of Ukraine's counter offensive are not meeting expectations, but the Prime Minister urges patients. And following a week of escalating violence in the occupied West Bank, we will speak to the Former U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk about what is the worsening situation there? Well, the tragedy of the Titan submersible is now a search for answers instead of survivors. The focus of the investigation is shifting. Other officials announced the sub suffered a catastrophic implosion killing all five people on board. More details aren't now emerging the U.S. Navy saying it detected sounds of a possible implosion on Saturday or sorry, on Sunday, around the same time that communication was lost with the sub. We'll go live to CNN's Paula Newton in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in Canada. And Paula, there are an awful lot of questions now about regulation about whether this vessel should have been allowed to make this dive in the first place. What do we know?",

Obviously, all of that is done now the big question remains what about those banging noises? The U.S. Coast Guard indicated that obviously that had nothing to do with the fate of the Titan. Again still a lot of questions, Becky, especially as to who will be taking over this investigation. Whether the transportation safety board here in Canada will be the lead and also whether those remote operated vehicles will get to the bottom of the deep sea to collect yet more debris.

So I was thinking implosion then that's Monday morning, then I watched over the ensuing days, this whole sort of everybody running around with their hair on fire search, knowing full well that it was futile, hoping against hope that I was wrong, but knowing in my bones that I wasn't.

And what we are seeing right now, according to activists, U.N. officials, other NGOs is new patterns that are emerging. Whether it's from the smugglers and traffickers who are trying new and more dangerous routes to try and get people to Europe, for example, seeing this as we saw in this case, more and more fishing boats leaving Eastern Libya, a 600 percent increase this year in this route, more and more boats leaving towards Europe from there And also very disturbing as well, according to officials we spoken to is this new pattern coastal countries, including Greece are accused of not only pushing back something we have reported in the past refugees and migrants towards Libya and other countries out into international waters. But what they are doing and what they're accused of doing is facilitating the movement of these boats by providing them with water, food and even fuel towards Italy that has of course recorded this year a serious increase in arrivals. So the concern right now is while there is this, where people are not being deterred. People who are risking everything for this new life in Europe that they have been planning for and saving their entire lives for they're not deterred.

Kremlin appointed Governor of occupied Kherson was quickly at the scene to condemn the attack and blame the West. It's another senseless act by the Kyiv regime at the behest of London, he says. But it will make no difference to the result of the special military operation what Russia calls its war.
