Trump's plea today avoids another media spectacle by foregoing an in person appearance next week. Today, Trump's legal team also formally requested to sever his case from the co-defendants who want a speedy trial. Let's begin today with CNN Senior Crime and Justice Reporter Katelyn Polantz, who has been all over the story.Katelyn, why does Trump want to split his case from the others?",

They need time, they're busy, this case is complex, the sort of things that Donald Trump has been arguing in all of the criminal indictments that he faces here. Though in this situation, this is going to be quite a question for the judge handling this case going forward. How does this case go to trial? Does it get split up?Do defendants go to federal court? Do some stay in state court? All of those questions are going to be a real driving force of what's happening in the coming days and weeks here, because there are defendants like lawyer Ken Chesebro, also another lawyer, Sidney Powell, that have quite vocally said, yes, we want to go to trial very fast, not like Donald Trump. And Trump is wanting to distance himself from them and potentially others in this group of 19 total defendants. The DA's office from Fulton County, they are already getting a trial date set on that calendar for October, for Chesebro at least, and want to keep all of the defendants together. But watching how this goes forward is going to be really crucial in that Trump will keep arguing to push things back. There will be others who argue to split things out, and Trump may want to separate from others, but it is a racketeering case with a lot of people involved. And so seeing how that functions now, especially now that not guilty pleas are coming in and getting people on path to trial, that is going to be really something we're going to be watching over many, many days.",

And in this case, he said these men were part of what the Proud Boys were trying to accomplish that day. He sentenced Joseph Biggs to 17 years in prison. He was an organizer for the group in Florida.In the case of Zachary Rehl, he's gotten 15 years. The government was asking for more than 30 years apiece for each man. They were convicted on charges, including seditious conspiracy. They both spoke to the court. They asked for some leniency. Both of them tearfully talked about what they were losing, essentially the chance to see their daughters grow up, something that obviously weighed heavily on everyone in the courtroom.

And so how I communicated shifted for a while.And so but that's different than if there is something medically seriously wrong that would prevent you from healing to a place where you can continue to do your duty. So I think we do have to have some grace, but it's fair to say if you're in a leadership position, and certainly if you're in a position, frankly, of leadership where you could be running the country at some point, I think it's important for there to be transparency.",
