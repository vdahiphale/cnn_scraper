Or people that get guns that shouldn't have them? What do we do? It's a complicated situation. I don't think there's one solution that you can say, well, if we just do this, we won't see this kind of thing happen again. And can anybody say that? I don't think so.   WALLACE:   There is one other way in which you've taken the road less traveled during your career. I want to put up a picture again of the Steppenwolf Group. You and that very pretty young lady there in front of you. Her name was Moira Harris. She was an early member of Steppenwolf. The two of you have been married for 41 years, and you're in the process of moving your family and your foundation from Hollywood to Franklin, Tennessee. How come?",

Last fall, I sat down with Perry who opened up about his friendship with Winfrey, and a surprising way it started. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TYLER PERRY, ACTOR/MOVIEMAKER:   Rushing home from school to watch her on television was a big deal for me, because there was this woman who looked familiar like she was a cousin, friend, sister of mine that aunt, too, was so inspiring and so smart. And it was very rare to see Black people on television, and she was one of the first Black people on television where you actually got to hear her have an opinion every day. I remember when \"Diary of a Black Woman\" came out, I was walking down the street in Las Vegas. My phone rings. I'm like \"hello\" as I am in the middle of a million things. And she says, \"Hi, this is Oprah,\" and I almost walked into traffic, right? So that's where it all started and here 18 years later --",
