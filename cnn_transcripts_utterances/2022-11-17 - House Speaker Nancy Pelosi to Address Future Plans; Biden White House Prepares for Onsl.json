Speaker Nancy Pelosi is about to make a major announcement on the House floor about her political future. Her speech will come just hours, of course, after Republicans won control of the chamber with a slim majority now. And it is just weeks after her husband was viciously attacked at her San Francisco home. Her tenure has been historic, the first and only woman so far to be Speaker of the House and she has served in that role twice and has led House Democrats for 20 years. Let's get started. Manu Raju live on Capitol Hill. A lot of moving parts and she's definitely keeping people guessing up to the last minute, Manu. What are you hearing?",

That is according to her office. At that point we'll learn what her future plans are and, if she were to step aside, it would be hugely significant. She's been the central presence in her Democratic Party, in her caucus, more than any other person, keeping it together both in the minority and the majority. And if she were to step aside it would prompt a leadership scramble to replace her. In talking to Democrats, some say it is time for a new chapter. Others are calling for her to stay.

Speaker Pelosi is widely viewed as perhaps one of the most effective speakers in history and certainly for the Democrats in recent history. And I think there are a lot of Democrats who are concerned about what it would mean for Democrats to lose that level of experience. But on the other hand, there is a real clamoring for new blood, for younger blood in the leadership ranks of the Congress.

But she's been able to maintain unity through her course of two decades. It's a remarkable feat, given the significant divisions that could exist, that have existed for some time, between moderates and liberals in the caucus. Narrow majorities,  as in the past Congress, in getting the Inflation Reduction Act through Congress and dealing with all the different back and forth through the course of the past two years. But also getting the Affordable Care Act through Congress and the House. That was an incredibly difficult task back in 2010, in the first two years of the Obama administration. Ultimately Democrats lost the House that year. They were in the minority for several years until they got back into the majority back in 2017. So she's been through the majority and the minority, keeping her caucus together and that is going to be the real challenge for the new Democratic leadership team if she were to step aside. Can they do what she did? Can they stay disciplined and stay united?

And I think that, for some of the moderates in the Republican conference, for the members in the Senate especially, who are going up for election in 2024, the real question is going to be what is the actual affirmative agenda?

The one less traveled by would be to pass bills that would make things better for the  people, the more tempting and historically more frequented road would be to pursuit pointless investigations, messaging bills, threats and government shutdowns. \"The road we choose could make all the difference.\" Romney sees a problem coming here.

That is the push and pull of Republican House majority. There will a push to do significant investigations. Two Republican committee chairmen laid out how they plan to pursue the Hunter Biden investigation. They have subpoena power and they could pursue that. But the legislative front will be the real challenge. Remember, Kate, there are roughly 30 or so Republicans who come from Democratic leaning or swing districts. And there're also about 40 or so Republicans who are more conservative and come from the Right flank for McCarthy. And he has the narrowest of majorities. So they will disagree on bills that are messaging bills and have no chance of passing the Senate. They will have a difficult time passing the House because of the divisions that exist internally.

And the consequences of their actions were so severe and their attitudes so detestable that a mere time prescribed sentence would not suffice. Russia has maintained that it was not responsible for the attack but reiterating today that it found that a Russian surface-to-air missile, a Buk missile, was deliberately launched, given the complex processes needed to launch this particular missile. But did say that the operators may have been under the intelligence that they were launching this toward a military aircraft. But of course, while Russia maintains it wasn't responsible, these three individuals were tried in absentia. The verdict given in absentia. And they aren't expected to serve the sentence, given they are believed to be in Russia. But it is the first time that an independent judgment has been given on the 2014 attack.

So Russia has significantly degraded the electrical power-generating and distribution system as well as killing civilians along the way and is now targeting the heating system. The temperatures have dropped here. You see snow behind me and it is freezing. The power engineers here say that, because it is so cold, people are turning on their heaters more and that is going to create more instability in the system. Russia intentionally trying to bring down Ukraine's resolve to fight the war. In President Zelenskyy's statement, he has significantly moved his position, his latest is to say very, very clearly, falling in line with what President Biden understands, what NATO leaders are saying. I said I don't know for sure what happened and the world doesn't know for sure. I am sure, he said, it was a Russian missile. And I'm sure that we fired our air defense system.

A number of calls back and forth to try to establish what had happened and where the missile had come from and make sure that this was not actually a deliberate attack by Russia on Polish territory. Of course, Poland is a NATO ally. So that is the heart of the discussions. And it became early on that this was not a deliberate attack and it was likely accidental and likely a missile that Ukraine had fired that then landed accidentally in Poland. And so as this was all becoming clear, based on intelligence the U.S. was receiving and based on the conversations with the Poles, the Ukrainians believed it was a Russian missile. That was not very helpful. Jake Sullivan did call his Ukrainian counterparts and say to them, look, let's wait off and hold, see what the investigation actually uncovers. So now it is just a wait and see game. And what the Ukrainian investigators uncover, they are at the site in the Poland, looking at this for themselves, Kate.",

We're getting them all of the weapons they need to take back as much territory as they possibly can.But there has been a lot of back channel conversations going on. Jake Sullivan was there in Kyiv a week ago having these conversations, about two steps here. Well, three, actually. One, we want the Ukrainians to be as successful as possible in the battlefield and we've helped them in being very successful. And two, we don't want to go to war with Russia or NATO to go to war with Russia. We're very careful about that again. President Biden's leadership has enabled him to accomplish both of those things. Number three, we want peace. We want the war to stop. We have got to make it clear that we are interested in getting to that end point. And that, I think, is in keeping with what Chairman Milley said. He doesn't say we should force the Ukrainians to give up territory. He said we have to look how we get to the end of this.
