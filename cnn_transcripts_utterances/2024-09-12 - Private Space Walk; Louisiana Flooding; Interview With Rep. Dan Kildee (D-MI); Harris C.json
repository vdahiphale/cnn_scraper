At any moment, the vice president is expected to head to North Carolina to kick off her New Way Forward Tour through swing states. Former President Trump is on the trail too, targeting two critical battlegrounds today. A few hours from now, Trump will hold his first post-debate campaign event in Tucson, Arizona, while his campaign launches a new ad in Pennsylvania attacking Harris on fracking, a major industry in that must-win state. Let's take you now live to Charlotte, North Carolina, where CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is covering the Harris campaign for us.

But with that now behind them, they are hitting the battleground states, and not only the vice president, but also surrogates across the country. Now, of course, they did choose North Carolina to be their first stop after the debate, which is telling, because this is a state that they are trying to make inroads in with voters, particularly those who are undecided and those who may not be die-hard Democrats, but are also uninterested in former President Donald Trump. They also see an opening here, given what is happening with the governor's race and with the issue of reproductive rights. In fact, the campaign today releasing a new ad, a new abortion-related, - focused ad that it seizes on one of what the campaign thinks was one of the strongest moments by the vice president. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it. And the Supreme Court had great courage in doing it. KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I have talked with women around our country.

The message from the vice president today is one that we have heard before, that she maintains that they are the underdog and that they need to continue this campaign with intensity and with focus. But, again, Boris, they are trying to seize on whatever opening they have in a state like North Carolina that Joe Biden won -- or -- I'm sorry -- lost in 2020.

The outcome of the election in Michigan could be the outcome of the election for the whole country. We have got a lot riding on this. And so I think whether we believe this poll or that poll, I think it's correct to be concerned and to act on that to concern, whether we think we're behind or not, to campaign like we're behind every single day.

In Michigan alone, 35,000 new volunteers since Kamala Harris became our nominee, 35,000 people coming in voluntarily to work on this campaign because they know how much is at stake, and they feel that, in this case, we have a chance to win. Whether it's fair or not to President Biden, and I don't think it was, there was a concern that maybe we didn't have a path to victory. Now we know we do, and it's bringing a lot of people to this campaign. Small donors and volunteers are how you overcome the margin. Somebody in Wisconsin said it, but I have stolen the idea. It's not the margin of error. It's the margin of effort.

And the people going out into the vacuum of space were private astronauts, your everyday citizens. Granted, they'd trained quite a bit. And the reason that's so significant is because the private sector is typically able to do things faster and for a lot less money. Just take these space suits. NASA's been -- for its astronauts for about 20 years. SpaceX was able to design and develop these in just 2.5 years.

That's where this pre-breathe took place. Then they put on their space suits, checked out the space suits for any leaks. You see Jared Isaacman opening the hatch right there, and then he ventured out for about 10 minutes, followed by mission specialist Sarah Gillis. She's a SpaceX engineer.

And so you want them to be very capable of protecting human life. But on the other side of it, you want to be able to do useful things, like do some work, whether you're on the surface of a planet or outside a space station. And so you have -- as engineers design them, they want them to be very protective, huge temperature swings, hundreds of degrees plus, hundreds of degrees minus in the course of a few minutes. And you want them to be protected against micrometeorites and so forth. So they had to be kind of armored and yet very pliable. And you can imagine a pressurized suit, just the act of closing your gloved hand can rub it raw. So what they were trying to do was just see -- kind of doing a little bit of a Macarena up there, trying to move the arms, see how they -- whether they're pliable enough, whether the design is such that an astronaut could do some real work if you could take a few moments not to be looking at the Earth below.
