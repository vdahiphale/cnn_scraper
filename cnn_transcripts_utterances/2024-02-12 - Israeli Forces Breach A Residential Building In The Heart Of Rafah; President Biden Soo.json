The White House saying that the two men will discuss the situation in Gaza, as well as efforts to produce an enduring end to the crisis. We know, King Abdullah has repeatedly called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, which is something so far President Biden has resisted doing. But it does come as the public rift between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become more pronounced in recent weeks. Just last week, the President called Israel's response in Gaza over the top, and there's also been frustration behind the scenes that Netanyahu has not heeded the advice of the U.S. to de-escalate some of their military operations in Gaza. Now, this all comes as the U.S. is closely watching the situation in Rafah, saying that they would not support any military operation there unless there is significant planning underway to protect the civilians who are located in that southern city in Gaza. As Jeremy noted, many had been displaced to that city from other parts of Gaza during this war over the course of the past few months. And President Biden yesterday, stressed all of this in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. They spent about 45 minutes on the phone and the President in that call, said that any operation in Rafah should quote, \"not proceed without a credible and executable plan for ensuring the safety of and support for the more than one million people sheltering there\". So, this is something that the U. S is expected to continue to press Netanyahu on as he is considering the next steps in his military campaign. Now, another issue that's likely to come up in these discussions with King Abdullah is the latest in the hostage negotiations. The majority of the President's phone call yesterday with Netanyahu centered around how to secure the release of those more than 100 hostages being held by Hamas. We know that Netanyahu has referred to the latest terms provided by Hamas as delusional. And a senior administration official did acknowledge that there are still significant gaps in these hostage talks, but they do believe progress has been made been made in recent weeks. That is part of the reason why President Biden is deploying the CIA Chief Bill Burns to Egypt tomorrow to continue discussions on these talks. But it really all comes at a critical time, not just for the war between Israel and Hamas, but also for President Biden domestically. He has been under a lot of pressure, especially from the progressive flank of the Democratic Party, to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, to call for an end to this war. And so, this meeting with King Abdullah will be closely watched as he is one of those proponents of calling for a ceasefire at this time.",

So, Barak, as we noted at the top of the show, this was only the second successful hostage rescue in the nearly four-month military fighting there between the Israelis and Hamas in Gaza. What is the sense about any potential future hostage rescues? I just came back from Israel last week. This is the number one priority of everyone that I spoke with -- is getting all of those hostages home.

They are going to continue trying to find a way to break the -- break the freeze in these negotiations over the hostages. But I think that what we saw in this operation is that we thought that the hostages are all in the tunnels and we saw that it's not the case. And what the Israeli military thinks right now is that maybe because of the Israeli operation in Khan Younis, Hamas moved at least several hostages from the tunnels in Khan Younis to family homes in Rafah where they are hiding them, which might give more options for future operations.",

We, in the press, got our first statement about two and a half hours later. That statement from the Pentagon said he'd been taken to the hospitals with symptoms suggesting an emergent bladder issue and that the President had been notified, the White House, Congress, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. A notification here, obviously working very quickly as the Pentagon and the Office of the Secretary of Defense seem to have learned their lesson about how critical this is. We got the second statement a couple of hours later that he had transferred his authorities to Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks, and then shortly before midnight the statement that he had been admitted to critical care there for extra support and for extra monitoring as doctors were treating and caring for him with this emergent bladder issue. There wasn't much time here. The Pentagon had announced on Thursday that Austin would be traveling to Brussels for a meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group and then a NATO defense ministerial. That trip was supposed to leave within the next 24, 48 hours or so. And we got the statement from a defense official a short time ago that the trip itself had been canceled. The Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting would be held virtually, and then the NATO Defense Ministerial, Austin, will not be attending that. So, you see the effect this hospitalization has already had on Austin's schedule. Remember, it was December 22nd, 23rd, he went in to treat prostate cancer. He was then re-admitted on New Year's Day for complications from that surgery where he stayed for two weeks. It took days for him to notify President Joe Biden and others. He was then working from home for another two weeks before he came back to the Pentagon. He was only here for about a week and a half or so, two weeks before this last hospitalization began yesterday. At this point, it is unclear how long he'll stay at the hospital.",

We, of course, remember that this is an issue about mishandling of classified documents, some of which obviously were retrieved from Mar-a- Lago. What the Trump legal team is asking for, and they're meeting with this judge over the last three hours, is to get access not only to the documents that they want to use -- in the federal that the government says they want to use that the government says they want to use in the federal trial, but also documents that they believe will help his defense. So, documents that right now, the federal government is saying are so sensitive that the former President can't see the documents. He can only look at some summaries of it. So, in the courthouse behind me, you know, there's a special room that's known as a SCIF where the legal team, where the former President, are able to look at some of these documents.

You can see that line continues to push east and then move north into the Carolinas as we go into Monday. Then as we go late Monday into Tuesday, it starts to clash into some cold air up in parts of the Northeast going into New England and that's going to pump some snow from central Pennsylvania, upstate New York and parts of New England. And we'll find that snow come with some gusty winds and could drop visibility late Monday, early Tuesday morning and then going into Tuesday night. All of that starts to exit. Here's your footprint of the snow. You see all the deep pinks and purples. That's where looking at some snow totals 6 to 8 even offers or 12 inches of snow. Snowfall rates could be one to three inches per hour. Couple that with the gusty winds gust up to 40 mph and you're looking at some really messy conditions with low visibility. Kind of peaking as we go into Tuesday. Really again, exiting Tuesday night. Now, we haven't really seen too much snow up in the East. A lot of our snow depth, so far, this year has been to the west, 25 percent snow cover for the lower 48 and a lot of it from the Sierra Nevada into the Intermountain West where we had that atmospheric river event unfold just a week or so ago. Seasonal departure from normal for snow has been well below average for some places from the upper Midwest in the Great Lakes area where you see all those brown dots and then going into New England. Some places that you really typically see snow like Minneapolis, Buffalo haven't really seen too much so far this year. And part of the reason is we've had a really warm winter. You see all the red dots? A lot of these cities in the Great Lakes region and then in the east there are looking at their warmest winter on record. It's just been kind of spring-like, really lacking a lot of the cold and lacking a lot of the snow. We know that winter is warming across the lower 48 since 1970. You could see those same places. The upper Midwest Great Lakes going into New England or some of the places with the biggest fever 4 to 5 degree fever since 1970.
