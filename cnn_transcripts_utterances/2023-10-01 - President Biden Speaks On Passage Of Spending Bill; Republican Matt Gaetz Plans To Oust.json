This week MAGA hardliners are expected to try to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy for that bipartisan move.

They just reiterated that McCarthy wants to ensure that there's not just aid for Ukraine but also border security funding as well. Now it comes at a time when the president had wanted that Ukraine aid in the initial package but there was opposition among some hardline Republicans about including it.

Arlette Saenz, at the White House, thank you very much.Joining me now, CNN political commentator and Democratic strategist Maria Cardona and CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Alice Stewart. They co-host the podcast \"Hot Mics from Left to Right.\" And, Alice, let me start with you. You're on the Republican side of things here. What just happened this past several days with this shutdown that was averted? Kevin McCarthy reaching across the aisle, working with Democrats to get this shutdown avoided. But then the next day, we're waking up to this fight between him and Matt Gaetz over whether McCarthy is going to stay on as speaker. Does he stay do you think?",

Look, we knew we were going to get to this point when Kevin McCarthy was voted in as speaker when Matt Gaetz and his vocal crew of critics filed -- said the only reason we will allow you to be speaker is if we have a motion to vacate, which is one person can fire you. We knew this was going to happen when McCarthy made some kind of a deal with Republicans and Democrats.But he had to do this. If he didn't make this deal with a bipartisan deal, we would be in a government shutdown. And here's the thing that Gaetz doesn't seem to recognize. He is so angry with McCarthy for making a deal across the aisle with Democrats. He's not going to be able to get this motion to vacate approved if he doesn't work with Democrats. So he can't have it both ways. He can't be critical of McCarthy for working with Democrats, knowing that he has to do the same thing. So this is a petty, personal grievance Gaetz has with McCarthy for some reason, and Republican colleagues, rational Republicans are calling him out. He is not conservative. The proposal on the table was a conservative proposal and he's nothing more than a charlatan that's out for himself to fundraise off this and then make a name for himself. ACOSTA: Yes. And, Maria, I mean, you know, and perhaps this is not going to go anywhere if Matt Gaetz gets this started. It just may not go anywhere. Maybe they'll fizzle out. But if it does get some kind of momentum, I mean, I was talking with Republican Congressman Bob Good earlier on in this program. Didn't want to answer the question even though he's in the Freedom Caucus, very conservative, doesn't really seem to like McCarthy very much. Didn't want to give us an answer as to whether McCarthy should go.",

And I think that's smart because they do need to figure out what their options are. And I think there could be several things that different Democrats do depending on what the leader thinks their needs are and how to move forward.But, you know, Alice is exactly right that at the end of the day, Matt Gaetz if he wants to really put in the motion to vacate for real, he's going to need help from the Democrats, and then at the end of the day, Kevin McCarthy, if he is going to be saved, it's going to be because of Democrats. And so this whole thing, the irony of this whole thing, Jim, and I think what Democrats are going to continue to underscore as they should, is that they're the ones who ended up saving this whole chaotic mess. That it didn't have to be this way to begin with. Kevin McCarthy should be smart enough to have realized that this was the only way it was going to end up. I guess he was smart enough in that he didn't want to go down the road of the government actually being shut down because then things were going to get worse and at the end of the day, he was going to have to depend on Democrats anyway. But Democrats don't trust McCarthy and this is definitely going to give Democrats huge talking points and ads going into the 2024 election saying, America, you cannot trust Republicans to run the House.",
