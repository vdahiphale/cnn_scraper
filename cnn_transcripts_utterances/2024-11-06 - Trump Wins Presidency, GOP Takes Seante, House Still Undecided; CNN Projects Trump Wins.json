Today, the president-elect is hailing a sweeping victory, and I'm quoting him now as saying \"the greatest political movement of all-time, end quote.\"As for Vice President Kamala Harris, she is expected to address the nation later today at 4:00 p.m. Eastern. We will have live coverage. President-Elect Trump is also on track to do something he has never done, actually win the popular vote for president. In fact, no Republican has accomplished that since George W. Bush did back in 2004. CNN just projected, by the way, that Trump has won Michigan. But we are also following two other battleground states that have not yet been called. Standby for that key race alert right now. All right, let's take a look at Arizona right now, it's 11 electoral votes. Trump is ahead by more than 100,000 votes, 51.9 percent to 47.2 percent, 63 percent of the estimated vote in Arizona is now in. In Nevada, 89 percent of the estimated vote is in, six electoral votes in Nevada. Trump is ahead by almost 65,000 votes. 51.7 percent to 46.6 percent. Trump is ahead in Nevada over Kamala Harris there as well. I want to head over to John Berman at the Magic Wall. You're getting more information even as we speak.",

We're not calling that yet because there are still votes being counted in several key races. And this one is not clear which direction it may go. Manu Raju is back.

      "sentences": "Yes, look, there are several races that have not been called yet. But I've got to tell you, Erin, it is a complicated path to the House majority for the Democratic Party at the moment.Remember, they have to pick up a net of four seats in order to be back in the majority in the House. Right now, Republicans have five pickups that we have called so far. Two Democratic pickups. So the Republicans have a net of three at the moment. Democrats are vying for Republican districts. But this is the problem. The Republicans are ahead in Democratic districts, including three Democratic districts. So why are they having problems? Let's go in and dig a little deeper into some of these key races. Here in Iowa, the first congressional district in Iowa, Democrats thought they would have a really good chance of flipping this seat in Iowa. The incumbent Republican, they thought she was clearly vulnerable. She is hanging on by a thread, 799 votes ahead against the Democratic challenger, with 99 percent of the vote in. Republicans feeling they can sneak away with that one. Also in Nebraska, Don Bacon, the incumbent Republican, someone who represents a district that Joe Biden carried in 2020 and Kamala Harris carried last night. This time, though, Bacon is at the moment prevailing, 8,300 votes ahead of his Democratic challenger. And with 95 percent in, Bacon is feeling very good about hanging onto that seat. But there are still some pick-up opportunities for Democrats, including Arizona. A Republican incumbent, a freshman seen as vulnerable going in. He is down narrowly to the Democratic challenger. That's 4,100 votes behind her. But at the moment, there is still a lot of votes to count, 59 percent of that vote is in. There are still some pick-up opportunities in New York. There are two for Democrats and one of them is in the upstate, House congressional district 19, where the incumbent Republican, Marc Molinaro, is trailing his opponent, Josh riley, by 3,600 votes. Now they believe they can pick up that seat because there is 94 percent of that vote that is not in. So why is it so important? Because as you mentioned, Erin, Democrats lost control of the United States Senate. They lost the White House. And look at the Senate right now, 52-42. Right now, the Republican majority there. They have three pickups so far. They could potentially get another one in Pennsylvania. That looks very good for them. That's a 53-47 Senate. And they are leading in another one in Nevada in the United States central. Up to 54 seats. Potentially, as a handful have to be called. That's what makes the House so important but a difficult path back to the majority for the Democrats.",

Although it is important to emphasize that Harris underperformed in those urban areas and that is part of the reason for the loss as well. Because Donald Trump's win was also boosted by voters in the suburbs. Let's go to Harry Enten to dig through the exit polls. Harry, there is so many layers to this onion. That's how you get a landslide. It's not just one thing. It's many things. But when you go through, peel back the layers, what trends are you seeing right now?",

We have learned that Vice President Kamala Harris has officially conceded, officially conceded the 2024 presidential election, calling President- Elect Donald Trump to offer her congratulations.Our senior White House correspondent, M.J. Lee, is here with me in the studio to give our viewers a little more information. What else are you learning? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this was a phone call we had been waiting on all day. We are told by a senior Harris aide that the vice president did call the former president to concede the 2024 race. She congratulated him on his victory. We are told that she talked about the importance of the transfer of power being peaceful and also about being a president for all Americans. Of course, as we've been talking about all day long, the next time we expect to hear directly from the vice president is at Howard University. This is, of course, where she was expected to be last night. She ended up not appearing at her own election night party. This is not surprising that the vice president ended up making this concession phone call. We got no indications whatsoever from Democrats and the Harris campaign that she had any plans to contest the race in any way. I think, watching for the tone that she is uses and exactly how she talks about her loss in this moment in American politics is going to be so significant. There are going to be millions of Americans, many of whom are disappointed, even despondent about the results of last night's election, that will be looking to her for cues on, so what does this mean for going forward, how do I move on? This was an election that was so divisive, that was so just ramped up in the rhetoric. And I think a lot of people are wondering, now that the vice president has conceded the race, what are the cues we can take from her on what moving on actually looks like and how to process the prospect of Donald Trump coming back for a second term at the White House.",

If the former president, who now, of course, is the president-elect, returned to the White House, there were a few ways his federal cases could be resolved.One, is he said he would try to fire Jack Smith. Unclear, if he could do that because Smith is not an appointee. But it was expected that his Justice Department would drop these cases. It was clear, if he was reelected, he was never going to face trial. But we knew there's another option. That is that potentially the Biden Justice Department could try to resolve or wind down these cases before Trump takes office. A lot of this stems from an Office of Legal Counsel that is a department within the Justice Department that gives advice to lawyers who work there this memo that talks about prosecutions of a sitting president. They are looking very closely at that memo to try to determine how does that apply in this case, where you have two pending cases against a president-elect. Can they continue to move forward? Can they take additional steps? They are in discussions. Jack Smith talking with top leaders at the Justice Department about exactly what this looks like. I'm told that Jack Smith is somebody who understands he has to follow whatever the rules and regulations of the Justice Department are. So at this point, they are looking for ways to wind this down.

So now, impacting the election is no longer a concern. But this will be a surreal moment. We will have the president-elect, not just the former president, but now the president-elect going into a county level court to receive a sentence. But I do want to stress this. No matter what the sentence is that Judge Merchan pronounces, if this goes ahead in a few weeks, it is almost entirely symbolic and formalistic. There is no way that the president-elect will be locked up. Even in an ordinary circumstance, he would probably be allowed to appeal before he had to serve a sentence. So it will be an important moment and an interesting moment. But anybody that's thinking Donald Trump will be locked up, you can just let go of that fantasy.",
