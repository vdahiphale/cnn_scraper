We'll go live to the war zone as Moscow stands by its claim that it hit a critical U.S.-made Patriot air defense missile system.Also tonight, President Biden and congressional leaders wrap up a new round of talks without a deal on raising the nation's debt limit. The president speaking out about the meeting just a short while ago as he scraps part of his overseas trip to keep the negotiations going. And a very disturbing new security lapse by the U.S. Secret Service, an intruder entering the home of Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, undetected. We're taking a closer look at the growing threat to top American officials. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Tonight, air raid sirens have been blaring in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv a day after a major new air assault by Russia. Moscow claiming it hit a critical target overnight, a U.S. Patriot air defense missile system. CNN's Sam Kiley is on the ground for us in Southeastern Ukraine. Sam, first of all, what do we know about the strike by Russia and the fate of that Patriot system?",

These include the ultrasonic -- hypersonic, rather, Kinzhal, the normal cruise missiles, and a standard surface-to-surface shorter range missiles.Now, the Russians are saying that far from being able to shoot all of these down, first of all, the claim that the Ukrainians shot down six Kinzhal missiles is nonsense, say the Russians, because they didn't fire that many in the first place. What we do know now, though, is that the United States officials have confirmed that some kind of missile was able to do some damage to one of the two Patriot batteries that have been given by the United States and Germany to Ukraine during that very concentrated assault on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv with these missiles. So, they're not saying that it's been knocked out entirely but it's clearly been damaged sufficiently that they're going to have to perhaps take it out of circulation if you like, for a while, while they examine it and repair it. The Ukrainians have not made any comment, which is typical of them, about what has not been and has been successfully hit, particularly not military targets. They do not reveal the details ever of success or failure in attacks against military targets. So, what they are saying, though, is that this was a new tactic being employed by Russia, Wolf, to try to focus a very large amount of missiles on a single target or a single target area in the form of Kyiv over a very short period of time, clearly intending to try to overwhelm Kyiv's air defenses. And, of course, these air defenses, depending heavily among other things, on the Patriot missile batteries. Wolf?",

As you said, there are two in country, one provided by the U.S., the other by Germany and the Netherlands.Our best understanding is they are situated to protect what is arguably the highest value target in Ukraine, and that is Kyiv, the capital. So, if you have two systems with a range to strike incoming missiles, something along these lines and you lose one of them even for a period of time, that opens you up, makes you vulnerable. Again, it's not the only air defense system they have there. There would be others that are integrated with it, but to lose one definitely creates vulnerability going forward. We should note the Patriot has the ability to strike targets other than missiles, including Russian aircraft at great distances, and to lose that offensive strike capability would have impact as well.",

They've used them to strike Russian targets in Russian- controlled territory here in the eastern part of the country. And the reason I put these range finders here is just to show what a difference these missiles make in terms of giving Ukrainians capability. This is a 50-mile range radius around Luhansk, which is a key Russian-held city in the Russian-held part of Eastern Ukraine. 50 miles was the maximum range of the missiles that Ukraine had prior to the deployment of the Storm Shadow. Now, they have the Storm Shadow, which is three times that range, 150 miles. It gives them the capability to fire those missiles from this far away and strike key targets in Russian-controlled territory from stand-back conditions. And this is what we confirm now, that the Ukrainians are using them and they're able to strike well behind the battle lines there giving them an advantage going forward, particularly, Wolf, as we've talked many times, with this highly anticipated counteroffensive in the works.",

A U.S. official tells CNN Russia likely did damage the Patriot air defense missile system near Kyiv. How much of a setback potentially is that for Ukraine? GEN. JAMES SPIDER MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, it's a setback, of course, because it's a great piece of equipment, and as Jim described, it's integrated into a more fulsome kind of body of air defense capabilities that the Ukrainians have been employing frankly quite well since the beginning of this conflict. So, it's a loss, but it's not a complete game changer in terms of the ability of the Ukrainians to continue to watch the skies and then interdict as appropriate, and, again, as Jim indicated, to use these offensively to stretch and push the Russian aircraft capabilities that much further back.",

And as General Marks was mentioning and Jim mentioned before, the whole idea is to have an integrated air defense system. What you want to be able to do is cover all altitudes, all areas where you could potentially get a threat from, and that is what the Ukrainians are trying to build with the Patriot and the other systems like the German IRIS-T.",

But Democrats say that they will not get behind anything that includes such work requirements. McCarthy wants longer spending caps for domestic programs, something that Democrats are yet to agree to, as well. So, there are a whole wide range of key policy issues, including how to deal with permanent energy projects, something that could slip into this package to raise the debt limit, which raises a lot of questions about whether they can ink a deal, when they can do that, and if they can draft the legislative text, get buy-in from the House and Senate Democratic and Republican caucuses, and get that all through in time by June 1st.

And to that point, officials that I spoke to at the Secret Service have guaranteed that they are going through a rigorous mission assurance investigation to prove that this was an isolated incident, that these were actions that these agents took or really to the point that they did not take while applying their protective structure to the residence, and not systemic to the agency as a whole. And I do believe that. I was on this detail. The national security adviser falls under the presidential protection division. I had spent a lot of time with the national security adviser during my time in the Secret Service. And it is a critical protective assignment because of the role that the NSA plays in the administration. But for these agents not to be aware that, one, there was an intruder on the property, two, that this intruder got into the residence, and, three, engage with your protectee, that has to undergo the rigor of a serious investigation to figure out what happened and ensure that it never happens again within the Secret Service.",

The fact that he has not been out and about until this past weekend glad-handing because that doesn't seem to be his natural inclination on how he campaigns.He changed that this weekend. He went to Iowa and did what Iowa voters demand from people before they even consider voting for their candidate which is to see them -- to hear them, to actually get to be in the same room and interact with them. And so, that is the kind of thing that he is doing in the short term. What he's up against is a huge amount of money from Donald Trump's campaign, from the super PAC supporting him that has already been launching at DeSantis for months in a very specific way.

We've heard about his competency, forexample, how he would be a no-drama administration, and all that stuff. But he still has to differentiate himself. He started doing it a little bit on the question of abortion. That may appeal to some Republican primary voters, not necessarily in the general election. But he has to figure out a way to say you think he's the frontrunner, I know a lot of you really still like this guy, but this is why I would be better.
