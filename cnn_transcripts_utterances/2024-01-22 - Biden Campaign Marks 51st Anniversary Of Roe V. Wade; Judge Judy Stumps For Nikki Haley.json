Wade decision to focus on the consequences of the 2022 Dobbs decision that overturned Roe and what the 2024 race means for the future of abortion rights in America. Moments from now, Vice President Kamala Harris will kick off a nationwide reproductive freedom tour in Wisconsin.CNN's Priscilla Alvarez joins us from Waukesha, Wisconsin, where Harris is about to speak.

And it's notable that it's the vice president that is kicking this off. She has been a leading voice on this issue and is expected to play a central role in 2024.Now, her argument is coming here to battleground Wisconsin. This is a state that Biden eked out a win over Trump in 2020, and also a typically red suburb here in Wisconsin. And her argument is going to be that former president Donald Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices, conservative Supreme Court justices, and that is what led to the overturning of Roe. She's also going to speak about the harm and confusion that has occurred since the Dobbs decision, pulling on specific examples of what that's looked like, particularly here in Wisconsin, where those pro or the Roe bans were invoked after that was overturned. And she's also going to be talking about an ad that was released by the campaign this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And right now he's embroiled in legal, financial, personal, civil, criminal actions.You need someone who is totally focused on being president of the United States. I never saw greatness and neither did anyone else in the then 50 years that Joe Biden was in public office. He was an ordinary guy. He tried president twice and backed out. There was a reason for that. How it comes about -- for the same crazy way it came about that Donald Trump was president for four years, that was the same finessing that gave us Joe Biden. Neither one of those two men should be president for another four years. Joe Biden is now older. I'm not getting -- trying to get into with you what everybody talks about with regard to his cognitive ability, but I know he's my age. I run a big -- and I said in my heart, I run a big business. I'm the matriarch of the family of 20 plus. I make decisions that affect hundreds of people every day. I need a nap in the afternoon. So does Joe Biden, probably too. Nikki Haley is better. She's young. She's vital. She's focused. She has the intellectual capacity. She's measured. She doesn't get ruffled by bullies. Stand her ground. Respond respectfully. I mean, if you listen to her at the United Nations, she commanded respect. Well, that's what I'm looking for in a president. Again, someone who commands respect.

And the DeSantis campaign made many of them, his advisers, allies, and supporters have acknowledged to CNN in interviews.\"Quote, \"Every single thing that could have not gone as we had hoped or planned for went horribly wrong.\" That is according to one close adviser. I'm going to bring my panel back to talk about this. First of all, I encourage everybody to check out that reporting on CNN.com. It's really, really good. Let's just go to the not so way back machine of last week. And this headline in Politico, was an op-ed written by Alex Castellanos and Curt.

The candidate himself came into this race so confident because he just won a huge reelection in Florida. And running for president is very, very different and it's very, very difficult. So I'm thinking of one moment in my mind that really crystallized how dysfunctional this all was. There was a parking lot just north of the Quad Cities in Iowa last month. The DeSantis campaign bus was parked there. The Never Back Down Super PAC bus was parked there. It just, among voters, who was running what. What was going on -- collision between this but he didn't bring it. His ground game didn't work, but this is all on him. He became a much better candidate actually as we saw in town halls and other things. But I just wonder if he had done all of the events if he had talked to people, taking questions from voters at the beginning, would this have ended differently? Perhaps not, but it's on him.",
