Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suspending his presidential campaign just two days before the New Hampshire primary. This comes after a disappointing, distant second place finish in Iowa, and polls showing he was expected to place a distant third in New Hampshire. On his way out the door, he dealt a final blow to Nikki Haley, endorsing the former president despite questioning his electability time and again out on the campaign trail. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R), FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Now, it's clear to me that a majority of Republican primary voters want to give Donald Trump another chance. He has my endorsement because we can't go back to the old Republican guard of yesteryear, a repackaged form of warmed over corporatism that Nikki Haley represents. The days of putting Americans last, of kowtowing to large corporations, of caving to woke ideology are over. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Someone who started out with so much promise, so much money, really barely limping out of Iowa and of course not even making it to New Hampshire. But if you think back to a year ago, he really was even leading Donald Trump in some polls, as we've said.So it was the textbook case of the outsourcing your campaign to a super PAC, which he did. Clearly not the best idea. But just as a candidate, he only really came into his own over the last couple of months or so. When I was really seeing a real growth by him on the campaign trail. But of course by then, it was too late. In terms of him kissing the ring, I mean, he said, look, he signed the pledge that he would support the Republican nominee, so now that's what he's going to do. But he's also going back to Florida as governor of a very major state. And his -- you know, hopes there will be a future. But of course that's very much an open question. 2028 is a long time from now, and who knows what will happen between now and then. In the short-term, though, I'm told that he was talking with donors between the Iowa and New Hampshire period here. He wanted to keep going, but it became clear over the last couple of days that simply there was not the financial support and that there simply was not the path for that. So, Jim, it's extraordinary. As we head into the second primary, there are two candidates left in this race. So it's dramatically different than 2016, when there was still a very large field here.",

That's why New Hampshire it still holds the possibility to surprise here. Let's not get ahead of things. We remember -- I remember coming in here in 2008 on the Democratic side, Barack Obama after winning Iowa, Hillary Clinton got third place in Iowa.Everyone assumed that Senator Obama would win. He did not win in New Hampshire. So, look, something could happen. But history is not our best guide here because there is a former president who is essentially an incumbent in this race. That's why this race is so dramatically different. So Iowa effectively did its job in terms of winnowing the field dramatically so almost before the voting even began. But there is no historical reference that we can draw upon here because of the -- really the weight of Donald Trump in this contest. It has been different from the very, very, very beginning.

And he ended up in the middle of all these legal entanglements, which for anyone else on planet earth would have killed off his candidacy. But for Donald Trump it was like he was in \"Fast and Furious\" and he hit the nitrous. I mean, that's what happened to his campaign. And DeSantis, Haley, none of them ever came up with a real answer for it.I will say on the timing, you know, on election night 2022, DeSantis, there was a moment and there was a few weeks where he had a moment and Trump was down, DeSantis was ascending. But he waited almost 200 days to launch his presidential campaign. And in that intervening period, Trump re-coagulated himself. He started to have the legal issues. He got a little boost from those engagements. But by the time DeSantis got into the race ultimately in late May of 2023, Trump had already sort of found a way to rebuild himself and reassert his position in the Republican Party. So, politics is often about timing, and there was a window for DeSantis. And I kind of think he missed it.",

So if in a very close race in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, the states we all know are battleground states, if those third party candidates can shave enough votes, Trump losing the popular vote by up to 10 million votes, which is very possible, he lost the last one by seven million votes.",

RUTH BEN-GHIAT, PROFESSOR OF HISTORY, NYU: Absolutely. And Trump has always had a thing for Orban because Orban has been very successful in instituting what's called electoral autocracy, where you keep elections going, but you purge the judiciary, the election machinery, judges, so that the result is weighted to come out the way you need it to. He's also domesticated about 85 percent of the media, so the opposition's message isn't even heard. So all of this is very appealing to Trump. But, you know, now he's praising Orban in the context of praising also one-party state leaders like, you know, Xi Jinping and Putin. And he's making a whole push to educate Americans to find authoritarian rule and strong men rule as something positive, as something necessary. And that's very, very disturbing.",

So it is the institutionalization of lawlessness actually. So it was very -- I've always written about this.

Are you surprised by how easy this has been for Trump to essentially be in the driver seat here?BEN-GHIAT: Sadly, I'm not, because many of the things that have happened, the dynamics within the Republican Party, are truly understandable only according to authoritarian dynamics. Such as -- and I will never forget this -- the first GOP debate, when everybody but two of the candidates raised their hand, totally undermining their own power, and said they would support Donald Trump, their rival, even if he became a convicted felon. This is not normal. This is not what happens in democracies. And so DeSantis, you know, said, yes, you have to kiss his ring, which is an interesting mafia-adjacent terminology, then promptly endorsed him because the cult leadership thing that Donald Trump has, which comes from authoritarian tradition, is very strong, is very robust, and it's driving the organization of this campaign.",

And the reason why this is so significant, not just because of the problems at the border but also because this is tied to the issue of Ukraine aid as well as Israel aid.Republicans say that immigration, border security must be dealt with first before they green light more aid to Ukraine, and riding along with that aid to Israel. So Senate leaders want to put together a major package on the Senate floor that includes an immigration proposal as well as aid to Ukraine and Israel. But here's the problem that they have to get it through both chambers of Congress. And already the former president is weighing in. Donald Trump saying that Republicans should not accept anything less than a, quote, \"perfect deal.\" And that is raising real fears among proponents of this package that Trump could sway enough on the fence Republicans to oppose this issue as well as the speaker of the House to essentially scuttle any sort of Senate deal. And that is what some Republicans frankly say that Donald Trump's weight will carry. His voice will carry significant weight. That's why Jim Jordan, who is one of Donald Trump's top allies and influential voice among House Republicans, told me that if Donald Trump opposes this plan, essentially, it will put the nail in the coffin.
