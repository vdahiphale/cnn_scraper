One of whom died from a treatable infection due to delays in medical care, stemming from that Georgia abortion restriction.

They have really been trying to figure out how to best message on this.We know that so far, they've really tried to just lean in to Donald Trump's decision, or even non decision, to say that this is -- that he wants to leave abortion up to the states. But they have repeatedly now been presented with these personal stories of people who are really struggling and being affected by this. And look, when I talk to Trump's campaign advisers, they recognize how difficult of an issue this is. You hear Donald Trump often when he goes to these different events, and he actually talks about abortion, which is not frequently. But when he does, he says, you know, this is an issue that is tough. He says he believes in exceptions for some of these cases, like complications, the life of the mother, rape, incest, et cetera. But a lot of people still blame him for what is happening and for these things. You're going to hear Harris today as Priscilla laid out, blame Donald Trump for the death of these two Georgia mothers. And so, it continues to be an issue that I really don't think they know how to handle and how to talk about without just going back to what Trump always says, which is this needs to go to the states, and also that you need to win elections, which is something he also says almost every time he talk about --",

The specifics of that law itself has been kind of disputed by some conservatives here, and I think that's what the governor was talking about. But the overarching message slots very well into what you've seen from Democrats over the course of the last several months.Just take the last month. I think Democrats, the Harris campaign, aligned group, spent $289 million on air. Over the course of the last month, $84 million of that mentioned abortion. They know this is a winning issue. And if you need an example of it, you look at the debate where it was by far the strongest moment for the vice president. And that's not just an opinion. I was watching a focus group of voters who had not decided how they were going to vote. It was not a Democratic group or a Democratic leaning group by any means that in their minds, almost universally, was the strongest moment for her. It resonates. It connects.

But that tells you where they -- where they feel like they stand.NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Yeah, that's right. I mean, you know, if you're Donald Trump, you essentially want to say to American women that they shouldn't care about the one-third of American women who live in these states with fairly extreme abortion bans. And in the Harris campaign, she is bringing the stories of these women to light. It was not only powerful in the debate, it's also powerful at the Democratic National Convention. It was powerful last night with the story of Amber Thurman's family. You know, they let her die. I mean, that was her sister's words about this 28-year-old woman who died. Her last words to her mother were, please take care of my son. And so, you know, if you're -- if you're Donald Trump, you sort of want to make it seem like it was just this legislative sort of clerical move, and it's all good. I think in the debate, he said something like, this is what people wanted. And the refrain, of course, from Kamala Harris was no, this was not what people wanted.

Filled out a questionnaire several years ago saying, that she would approve some of these surgeries in jails. But at the same time, it's way out of context. And the goal from the Trump campaign on this is to try and really put fears in the minds of voters. A lot of people who are worried about, you know, whether minors are getting transgender surgeries, whether this is something that would continue if a Democrat were to take over office. It's all about really trying to go back to scaring them. I think it's a lot of the tactics we saw on in 2016 and 2020. You hear Donald Trump on the trail often say, will take men out of women's sports. He tries to refer to the Tim Walz saying, he's tampon Tim about putting tampons in men's bathrooms. This is all the rhetoric that they want Americans to be focusing on, and it really is part of the cultural wars that we continue to see, not just Donald Trump, but many other Republicans really try to heighten and emphasize in this election.",

And as you saw him having said in his own words, that he would support a statewide ban on abortions with no exceptions, and then obviously, interspersing that with Donald Trump's past praise of Robinson.Look, part of what I was told about this advertising campaign is the reason they're focusing on antiabortion is because Harris is heading to Georgia today, as we discussed, to talk about Donald Trump's role in the overturn of Roe vs. Wade, but also the death of those Georgia women. They're using this issue in particular, of course, because they see it as one of their best issues against Trump ahead of the election. But I do want to just turn briefly to what I'm hearing from the Trump side about all of this Robinson drama. Because, I mean, first of all, it's remarkable timing that Donald Trump is actually going to be in North Carolina tomorrow. And remember, all of his recent events in North Carolina, he has had Robinson there. The Trump campaign has said, even before the CNN story dropped, they had not invited Robinson to this event tomorrow, and he's -- obviously that decision is going to hold. You can read between the lines there. Part of that is, I'm told that some people in Trump's inner orbit had been given a heads up and had been like -- had learned that a controversial story on him was dropping.",

Trump called him up on stage and called him a very good man, but it seemed like they were trying to separate them a little bit. The reality is, he's on the ticket, as Dianne was just reporting.
