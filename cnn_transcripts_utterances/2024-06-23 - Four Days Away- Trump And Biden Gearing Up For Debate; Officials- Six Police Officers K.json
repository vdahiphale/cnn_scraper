This Thursday night, right here on CNN, President Biden and former President Donald Trump will face off in the first presidential debate of 2024. This has the potential to reshape what has been a remarkably stable race in the polls, at least for the White House. In the lead up to this critical showdown, the two candidates are taking their own unique approaches in preparation. President Biden has hunkered down at Camp David all weekend holding we are told intensive prep work and mock debates with a team of advisors behind closed doors. Meanwhile, Donald Trump has spent his weekend out on the campaign trail holding a rally in the swing state of Pennsylvania and revving up his base. Today, Trump's supporters hit the Sunday political talk shows to give their advice on what he should focus on. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KRISTI NOEM (R-SD): It will be a great opportunity for President Trump to talk about his policies and how his policies when he served as president of this country, were good for every single family that lived here. They had more money in their pockets. The grocery prices were down, gas prices were down. There was a lot more opportunities. You know, I don't think that he has to talk about get personal it in this debate at all, because he is going to have so many good things to talk about in contrast with Joe Biden's policies.

He has run for president four times. He has been campaigning since President Nixon was in office. This guy has got the ability and we've seen it. We've seen him in debate four years ago. We've seen him in the State of the Union this year that when he needs to, he can step up, but I think this is a real opportunity for CNN, most trusted name in news, to ask some tough questions, including, you know, because this is a rematch, and when we add this debate just before the election four years ago, Joe Biden looked into the camera and said they know that Hunter Biden's laptop was a smear campaign, Russian disinformation, called it garbage, and now we know that none of that is true. And I think this is an opportunity, like America is waiting. I mean, CNN has got an opportunity to ask tough questions of both these candidates.",

So let's deal with that.But as it relates to the debate, I do think that bipartisan big game Biden will show up. His experience will be a tremendous factor going into Thursday night's debate, both preparation and both on the debate stage. I am very confident that this president has a record or in my community we call it receipts that he can speak to where every corner of the American square has benefited from his presidency. I think that is going to be the key. I do not think he can allow the former president to draw him into a personality conversation, but keep the focus and attention on policy because I am very confident that everything this president has accomplished in record handsome form 70 percent or above in most cases that the American people agree with it from a policy standpoint.",

You know, I think at this point, you're stuck with it if you're Biden. I mean, they are running ads on it. All their surrogates are talking about it. I mean, it is basically part of their campaign.

That's what a convicted felon is all about.I think that is one case to be made as relates to this debate in how we frame the former president until the truth about who he is as in true muscle memory and muscle mass to his record, that's part of that. You can't run away from the facts. But regardless of that, regardless to that, I think what President Biden has to do is speak to one, of his record; but two, what a vision for the next four years will look like for the American people, that's Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and even those who are not thinking about participating at this point. And I think Joe Biden has proven to be a unifier. The debate stage will give him a tremendous direct opportunity to do that in a place like Georgia where he was able to garner enough support to win the race in Georgia four years ago with a true bipartisan, unique coalition to get him across the finish line.",

Then you had widespread amounts, you know, four to six inches or more at Mankato. There was another pocket of some ten inch total.

A couple of tornadoes again, especially up in this orange area level three out of five, enhanced risk in New England.

And essentially, they are not going to get into this back-and-forth with the prime minister. What a White House official told me was that: \"We have made our position clear on this repeatedly and that we are not going to keep responding to the prime minister's political statements.\" The official went on to say: \"We look forward to constructive consultations with the defense minister in Washington this week.\" And that is true, the defense minister, Yoav Gallant is arriving in Washington today. He is expected to meet with the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin; the Secretary of State Tony Blinken, and currently this rift between the Biden administration and the Netanyahu government will be a backdrop to those consultations. We also expect him to talk about, of course, the war in Gaza, but also this potential for a widening conflict on Israel's northern border with Hezbollah and Lebanon. Now, as Gallant was leaving Israel, he did reiterate the importance of the US alliance with Israel. He said its important perhaps no more important than it has ever been. So certainly, Gallant will be wanting to discuss this with members of the Biden administration. Now, this is all coming before Prime Minister Netanyahu will be in Washington next month to address Congress. Youve already seen some Democrats weigh whether or not they want to boycott that address.

The first one, obviously, Gaza, as you mentioned. Ukraine on which there are very big differences, and one would assume that China would have to come up as well. On the Gaza issue, it is really sort of interesting because president -- former President Trump has said very little about this, but his history and his time in office would suggest that he would fully back the Netanyahu government, give them whatever weapons they want. He never showed a particular interest in the Palestinian problem, did not say that the two-state solution was the way to go. At various moments, he said that and then at other moments in that wonderful Trumpian way, he said, well, maybe there are some other options. President Biden finds himself, I think, Alisyn in just the sweet spot where two sides are going to be angry with him -- those who strongly support Netanyahu and his approach in Gaza, who believe the president has in fact and fully, and those on the left of his party who believe that the United States has provided the arms that is allowed for the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians.",

I suspect you will hear him say the United States has tried isolationism twice before World War One and before World War Two, and was a huge failure both times. President Trump I suspect will say the invasion wouldn't have happened if he was still in office because Putin respected him too much. I find this difficult argument to completely believe, but certainly the fact is that the invasion didn't happen when President Trump was an office, so I think he will make that case and he will say he will solve it in 24 hours without telling us how.
