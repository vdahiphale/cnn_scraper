I'm Laila Harrak.Former President Donald Trump hasn't stopped campaigning for re- election despite being under federal indictment related to his handling of classified information. The president of Colombia visits the four children rescued after being missing in the Amazon for 40 days. New details on how they survived the ordeal. And the man known as the Unabomber found dead in prison. We'll look back at the crimes that sent him there for life. Donald Trump has -- was back on the campaign trail on Saturday, angrily sounding off about the 37-count federal indictment against him in the classified documents case. Appearances in North Carolina and Georgia were his first public events since the indictment was unsealed on Friday. Trump tells Politico he has no intention of taking a plea deal and vows to stay in the race even if convicted. Well, the charges are extremely serious, and Trump has his first court appearance Tuesday in Southern Florida. The indictment alleges Trump violated the Espionage Act on numerous occasions and obstructed government efforts to recover the documents. CNN's Kristen Holmes was at Trump's rally in Columbus, Georgia, and has our report. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Donald Trump appeared to be consumed by his legal issues when hearing a political speech talking to the Georgia GOP convention. He responded to that indictment, that federal indictment, for the first time in public, calling it a joke, saying it was horrible for the country, blaming Biden and the Department of Justice. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: The ridiculous and baseless indictment of me by the Biden administration's weaponized department of injustice will go down as among the most horrific abuses of power in the history of our country. Jack smith, what do you think his name used to be? I don't know. Does anybody -- Jack Smith, it sounds so innocent. He's deranged. This is a political hit job. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, again, it's supposed to be a political speech.However, while he was focused on those legal battles, the voters here in Georgia did not seem to care. They were happy he was here. They were cheering him on, every insult to Biden, Hillary Clinton. They were cheering for, they gave him a standing ovation, at one point, people were shouting four more years. We had been asking the question about how Republicans across the country, particularly Trump voters, might view this indictment and if it's any indication in Georgia at this GOP convention they are still viewing Trump favorably. Now, I want to show one other small piece of video and that was Trump going to the waffle house after he gave that speech. And the reason I'm showing this video is because I want to show who's in the video with him, Walt Nauta. That is his body man, his aide who was charged alongside him in these conspiracy charges. There had been questions as to what was going to happen after Nauta was charged. It appears that at least for now he is sticking by Trump's side.",

It didn't ring well, of course, with Democrats. It was only something that was playing well with Republicans. And the problem for Trump is in the 2024 election, this isn't him just with the Republicans. He has to win over a majority of the public that care a lot about other things besides his legal woes or Hunter Biden's laptop and all the types of things he tries to deflect on.",

The Ukrainians are being very deliberate, very careful about what information they release about this certainly when it comes to strategy. And this wasn't an announcement as such by Zelenskyy. He was responding to comments by President Vladimir Putin of Russia on Friday, who definitively said the Ukrainian counteroffensive was under way and that it had so far failed in all of its goals. So, he said it's good they're at least feeling it. There are certainly information operations going on alongside this.But what is sort of coming clear is unlike previous counteroffensives that we've seen from Ukraine around Kyiv in the spring of 2022, Kharkiv last autumn, which were more localize the areas, this is shaping up to be a very large operation taking place at multiple locations along hundreds of miles of frontline. We're hearing about operations up in the north, in Donetsk, around Bakhmut where the Ukrainians, as you say, have claimed to have advanced fairly significantly. There is Russian reports around the border of Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk further south, and then towards the western part of Zaporizhzhia, the town of Orikhiv, seems to be another sort of nexus of fighting at the moment. The Ukrainians -- the Russians, rather, are saying that they've repelled several attempts by the Ukrainians to break through, certainly in that western part of Zaporizhzhia. So, that is sort of the picture that we're getting at this moment. And there continue to be these aerial assaults as well. Overnight, the Ukrainian military says Russia launched eight missiles and 35 Shahed attack drones of which they shot down two missiles they say and 20 drones. So, we're awaiting more information as of that. And there was an attack the previous night which seemed to have targeted Odessa with drones that were shot down but still three people there were killed and 26 wounded. So, they have announced a day of mourning today in that town, which I should note is also affected by the fallout of the breach of the Kakhovka dam, the flooding and the rescue efforts continue there.",

There is something that's been happening over the last few weeks in particular that has actually less to do with the counteroffensive and more to do with incursions of small groups of Ukrainian fighters and drones onto Russian territory.There were eight Russian drones that crashed -- eight drones that crashed in Moscow a couple of weeks ago. There have been drones appearing on the internationally recognized territory of Russia almost every day for the last couple of weeks. And that creates a kind of plurality of actors in Russia, where local governors -- oh, and also there was a major incursion of an actual fighting unit into the Belgorod region about a week ago. There were casualties and there were prisoners taken, possibly hostages, depending whether they're civilians or military. And so that required the local governor of the Belgorod region to actually become an actor in this war, to decide whether he was going to negotiate with the Ukrainians who had entered Russia. This is something we haven't seen before. Russians, very much like westerners, have seen the Russian military effort as a monolith with Putin at the helm. And what we're seeing now is -- it's like an inkling, like a stirring of politics for Russians. I wouldn't go too far and draw any conclusions from it, but it is a somewhat new situation.",

As far as the court, there will be a perimeter set up around the court to make sure that the protesters and supporters don't get too close to the courthouse as well. And as far as the threat assessment that was done here at the Miami courthouse, they did find no credible threats. So, that was certainly good news. And they're going to continue to monitor all of this. They'll be looking very closely at social media. They'll be making sure there isn't any actionable intelligence that they need to do anything about accounts, and then, of course, they're going to be looking at what they would call a call to action, making sure that nobody in their speeches or on social media could be instigating any type of violence here at the federal courthouse.
