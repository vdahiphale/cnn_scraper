      "sentences": "It is 7I'm Lynda Kinkade. Thanks so much for joining us today on CNN NEWSROOM. Let's get you straight to the news. In just a matter of hours, steps away from the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris will recall the dangerous images of America's recent past. This is part of her message for the country's future. Harris will deliver the final stretch closing argument right here on the ellipse where she plans to draw sharp contrast between Donald Trump and herself. The ellipse is, of course, when nearly four years ago in January 6, former President Trump rallied his supporters. Prior to the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn his election defeat both major candidates of fighting an uphill battle in the final week of the election a brand new CNN poll shows no clear leader in Arizona. You can see here Harris is just barely ahead in the critical battleground state. And in Nevada also, no clear leader there. Donald Trump has the slim lead there. I want to bring in CNN's Kevin Liptak, who is tracking the Harris campaign from Washington, D.C. Good to see you, Kevin. So just take us through what the expectations are for Kamala Harris when she delivered her speech later tonight?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. The words her advisers are using to describe this speech are hopeful, optimistic. You know, I don't think when we heard that she was going to deliver this speech from the ellipse, from the site of Donald Trump's January 6 speech that those are the words we necessarily would have expected, but I think in talking to people who are around her and people who are close to her campaign. They really do view this speech as something bigger.This isn't going to be entreaties on democracy, a dissertation on the state of the American republic. They really do want it to be a much more, much broader vision of how she would govern in office, but also to contrast herself and to contrast her vision with that of Donald Trump. And certainly this site will help her do that. It does allow her, of course to reemphasize the chaos that Trump brought to the office when he was president. But it also allows her to try and help people visualize what she would be as president. And you know, where shell be speaking today. You can see the White House that will be right behind her. It's only about 500 yards from where she will be speaking to the Oval Office, the Oval Office she hopes to assume in January. And I think that is sort of the goal and the objective for her tonight. It is to help people really kind of imagine her as president because as she enters this final week that I think is her biggest challenge is to help people really understand what kind of precedent she would be number one, but also just who she is as a person, she has been running an extraordinarily truncated campaign. The shortest general election campaign of any candidate in modern history and I think her challenge is still to convince people that she's up to the job and when you talk to her advisors, they do mention this term, the conflicted voter, people who aren't necessarily sold on Donald Trump, who may be very concerned about what they're hearing from him on the campaign trail over the last several weeks, but aren't necessarily convinced of Kamala Harris either who don't necessarily they feel like they have a good understanding of what she would bring to the job. And so, she has been working on this speech for several weeks. We did hear her yesterday preview a little bit of the themes. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  There is a huge contrast in this election. And I'd ask us to just imagine the Oval Office in three months, okay. So just picture it in your head. So either it's Donald Trump sitting in there, stowing -- stowing over his enemies list, or me with your help working for you, checking off my to do list. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But I do expect to hear from her in broad terms how she would approach each of those issues. And so you have heard her talk previously about trying to bolster the middle class, making sure that their taxes don't go up, trying to ensure that wealthy Americans pay their fair share in taxes. I think we'll hear that tonight from Kamala Harris.We'll also hear her talk about this idea of freedom particularly when it comes to reproductive rights. And I was down at the ellipse earlier, they have enormous banners with the word \"freedom\" that you'll be able to see on camera when she speaks tonight. And I think she will talk about those things, certainly as she tries to lay out her own vision, but also as a contrast with Donald Trump. And that is the sort of the balance that she's trying to strike in this speech, is trying to lay out, you know, her vision for these various policy areas, but also to lay out the stakes of the policy areas when it comes to Donald Trump as well.",

I think the challenge for her now is to present a contrast in the way that she talks about the events of January 6, not necessarily completely focusing on former President Trump and his authoritarian tendencies that she has talked quite a bit about, in advertisement and on the campaign trail, but also talking about what she offers as a presidential candidate and possible commander in chief.

And so even if it is through a surrogate or a comedian on a stage as large as Madison Square Garden, now to insult an entire group of people, certainly not a position that you would want to be in so close to voting when people have already cast their ballots. I think that shows that the Harris campaign is certainly paying attention to this and wanting to take advantage of this moment. That's why she cut this advertisement and why she's been talking so much about this, while so many Democratic Latino no surrogates are talking quite a lot about this in places like Philadelphia and other states.

Naim Qassem has been appointed the group's new secretary general, a role he was already fulfilling acting as the interim chief after his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, was assassinated by Israel in late September. The killing of Nasrallah, a man seen to embody the Lebanese Shia movement struck a huge blow and left a vacuum inside a group that had already lost much of its leadership as a result of months of Israeli assassinations.
