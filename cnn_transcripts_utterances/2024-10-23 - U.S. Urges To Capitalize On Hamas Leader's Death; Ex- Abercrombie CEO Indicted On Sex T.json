Lebanon reported the highest daily death toll in three weeks on Monday when 63 people were killed, taking the total number to nearly 1900 since the conflict began. The IDF says a possible successor to the late Hezbollah leader and other commanders of the Iran-backed group were killed in an attack in Beirut earlier this month. Hezbollah is yet to confirm that claim. Meantime, the U.N. human rights chief says he is appalled by an Israeli strike on Monday near Beirut's Rafik Hariri University Hospital that caused significant damage and killed at least 18 people.

What are the characterizations of this victory?And it's not clear what exactly are the orders that the Israeli government is giving to the Israeli military who is conducting the fighting. And it's not just me who says this, but this Israeli high- rank defense officials who believe that the war, that at least most of the goals of the war, were achieved long ago. And, of course, achieved after the killing of the leader of Hamas in Gaza and say the world Yahya Sinwar just last week. The difficulty is that the IDF, Israeli Defense Forces believe that this war cannot be -- cannot end and cannot be won without the closing leg of a political settlement, without discussing the day after who will be a viable alternative to Hamas, what can be -- what sort of a regime, what sort of government, some kind of new page that will be an alternative, not just from the Israeli population in the -- on the border and, of course, to guarantee their safety that something like October 7th will not have again, but also for the Palestinians. Mr. Netanyahu has other considerations that are superior to these. He is afraid to the integrity of his coalition and he's afraid that if he will call the Palestinian authority to help which are basically the only alternative to Hamas, then the right of (INAUDIBLE) coalition will disassemble that and he puts that as the first -- maybe the only priority.",

But it's not just Mr. Netanyahu, it's also the U.S. administration. The U.S. administration, the White House, the State Department, the state secretary has basically stopped pressuring Mr. Netanyahu to make a deal in the last 2-1/2 months.

So, you know, I don't think there's anything that interview that's really going to change things very much.I mean, you know, we are talking about a race at the margins. You know, it's interesting. I mean, Harris is obviously more competitive than Biden was among voters of color, and as a result, is more competitive in the Sunbelt battlegrounds of Georgia, North Carolina and the Southeast, Arizona and Nevada and the Southwest. But even though she's more competitive, it's not clear that she can really win any of those. Which means that her path to the White House may be the same as Biden's in the end, which is sweeping the three Rust Belt battlegrounds that were in the blue wall that Trump dislodged from the blue wall in 2016 places where she was with Liz Cheney yesterday, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And those are states where the election administration process, you know, is -- I think, in safe hands, Democratic governors and all of them. Ultimately, the Electoral Count Act reforms passed by Congress in '22 give the governor the final word on certifying the winner. So, Trump can rage and storm and you know, the Speaker of the House, if Republicans hold the House, may support him and create mischief down the road but he doesn't control the government this time.

A militarized mass deportation unprecedented in American history, that would remove potentially millions of people over a presidential term to intern in camps and then out of the country. Democrats have chosen not to really contest him very much on that ground. I mean, Harris, on multiple opportunities, has had the chance to challenge that idea. Has chosen not to try to emphasize our own strength on the border, but the prospect that Trump will make significant gains among Latino men, if not necessarily Latino women, truly does complicate her task in the southwest states of Nevada and Arizona. And is one reason why I believe that you know this kind of paradoxical situation, that the Rust Belt battlegrounds are more fertile ground for her as they were for Biden, precisely because they are more white. And Democrats are holding their support among white voters compared to 2020, better than they are, certainly among Latino voters, and maybe even better than they are among black voters.",
