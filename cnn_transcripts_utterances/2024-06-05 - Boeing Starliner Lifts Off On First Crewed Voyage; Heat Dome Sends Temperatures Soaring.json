Kristin Fisher is near the launch site in Cape Canaveral, Florida and she joins us now. Two, in fact, aborted missions, Kristin, and you've got the sense that people were very cautiously optimistic today, right until the last moment before that launch.

All quite common in in terms of the first crewed test flight of a new vehicle, scrubs super common in spaceflight. But still, there was a sense as we got down to under five-minute mark that, wow, like this thing is -- this thing is finally going to go. Big cheers when it finally lifted off. And then everybody at NASA, the United Launch Alliance, and Boeing really breathing a big sigh of relief once those astronauts were safely in orbit. This is a big deal for NASA's commercial crew program. It is really the fulfillment of what they've been trying to do for a decade, which is outsource the transportation of its astronauts to the International Space Station to private companies so that they can then focus more on bigger missions like the Artemis Program, returning American astronauts to the moon for the first time since the Apollo Program. So to now have two options, SpaceX and Boeing, two options for NASA astronauts to get into orbit, that kind of redundancy is something that NASA has been working towards for a very long time. Now, one caveat, Julia, I will say just because it was a successful launch, this mission still far from over they still have about another 11 days until this mission is complete. They're going to be spending eight days up the International Space Station. They've still got to dock with the Space Station and they still have to of course, return to Earth safely. But so far everything is looking great. The two astronauts on board, Butch Wilmore, and Suni Williams, finally, getting to fly this thing. And for Suni Williams, she was assigned to this mission back in 2015. So it has been nine years that she has been waiting to fly this bird in to space -- Julia.",

Of course, they had to fly a rocket ship that's never beenflown before, so it is a huge risk and they and their families recognize just how large a risk that is. So it is great to have that behind them. And now no one has ever flown this spaceship with people on board before either. So this is a big checkout of a new spaceship, but touch wood, everything is working okay, so far. As Kristin said, they are now doing a bunch of tests and things on their way in to try and doc tomorrow midday Eastern Time in the US, and then that same vehicle, a week or 10 days from now has to safely bring them down through the atmosphere and just use the heat and friction from the air three or four thousand degrees on the outside of the ship and they are landing out in the desert using parachute and airbags. So they are by no means done yet, but the most danger per second is launch and both of them feel hugely relieved, proud, excited, keen about what is going on next. But also, they both lived on the Space Station before for extended periods, so there is also a great feeling of sort of being back home and it is going to feel great for them to see that little light of the Space Station get bigger and bigger and bigger, and then dock and go inside.",

They've got a contract. They're trying to deliver and it is super hard to build a safe spaceship. If you want to build one that kills people regularly, that's easy, but if you want to build one that has a real high probability of making it like the one did today, you have to be very painstaking. If you look back to the previous spaceships, it takes 10 years, mostly to build a human-rated spaceship. SpaceX got a bit of a head start because they were already building their rocket and they had to integrate a capsule on top. Traditionally, it takes about 10 -- the space shuttle, gosh, it was way late and delayed and all kinds of similar sort of processes. So that is all normal -- is that there is more than one flight leaving the station. I mean, if you went to the airport and there was just one airline or one airplane, then you really have your limitations. But now two different companies, two different rockets and spaceships -- that just greatly improves the United States' capability to get their own people and stuff up to the Space Station and back. But it is also great for the two companies because they can maybe not just fly government astronauts, but they can fly commercial astronauts and private astronauts. Other companies are building Space Stations, so it is still very new technology and therefore expensive. But this is a big step towards making it safer, simpler, and therefore less expensive than it has been in the past. So today is just a day of triumph. And I saw Elon and Gwynne Shotwell at SpaceX, they are both all full of congratulations to everybody at Boeing for getting it done right today.",

So they get the economic financial benefit of that and then they launch it together to do something that each country couldn't do alone. And so, it is sort of along that model now, you don't have to pay another country to fly your astronauts up. You don't have to trade anything for it when you have your own domestic capability. So that's just good for national business. It is a good but step. And there is a third vehicle in development as well with a third American company, but the beautiful side product of that is, we are now creating and advancing and developing technologies that didn't use to exist. It is kind of what NASA ought to be doing, and that is looking at what the future should look like, trying to put it in the seed money to help companies then develop the technologies that then improve capability that is available to everybody, nationally or internationally. And if you look at SpaceX as kind of the front leader, they are the number one launch company in the world as a result of the technology that they've developed and that NASA partially paid for. So, it is a long, slow train getting there, but I mean, just this week China landed on the other side of the moon and took off. A vehicle from New Zealand launched a rocket to space with NASA payload onboard, they launched today. And as you mentioned SpaceX is launching their huge new starship on their fourth flight test tomorrow. So this is in one week, so pretty amazing moment and I am really pleased for the success that took Suni and Butch safely to orbit today.",

ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: Let me be very clear again. The phase out of fossil fuels is essential and inevitable. No amount of speed or scare tactics will change that. Let's hope it doesn't come too late. WEIR (voice over): While the head of the United Nations has been railing against polluters and petrostates for years, he is using this report to plead with world leaders to cut dirty fuels faster than ever.

We need to get, I think, more savvy to do that around greenhouse gas emissions as well. WEIR (voice over): To avoid the worst, scientists say global emissions must fall 9 percent a year until 2030.

Italy for example, it is one of the largest country with the largest storage, we are at around the 75 percent. That is quite unusual if we go back to the old days.

But what's fascinating to me about your business is how you're sort of digitizing, pivoting, and hoping to ensure that not just natural gas can be used in some of this infrastructure and pipeline network, but bio methane, and hydrogen in the future.

So, it is becoming now a reality. The view that we have in Italy is that by 2030, bio methane will cover 10 percent of the need of the Italian in term of gas. So bio methane is already a reality. What we need to add, like you mentioned, we need to have a fully digitized network to be able to manage different kinds of gases. Hydrogen is something that will be available probably by the end of the decade. I am talking about economic sustainability of the production of hydrogen and I feel the hydrogen will play in the next decade a huge role, not only replacing of natural gas, but more even important as a vector to store the energy. I mean, there is a lot of debate about our to store the energy when there are many renewable going on. I don't think the battery is the only solution, it is probably fine for residential use, but not for huge need. The way to store the energy and to use these energy storage for balancing renewable and the demand of power is through the hydrogen. Hydrogen produced after renewable.

You produce fertilizer and you solve for the waste problem. So at the end of the day, if you put these elements into the full equation, at the end of the day, you will have a competitive price also for bio methane. We are not very far now.

But the question now is what indeed could trigger such an escalation? And it's really unclear. You know, what is clear at the moment is that there is renewed attention on the security situation in northern Israel on these clashes between the Israeli military and Hezbollah, which have really been kind of kept at a low -- slow simmering level over the course of these last eight months. Kind of steady barrages of airstrikes by Israel in southern Lebanon, sometimes creeping slightly further north, Hezbollah firing a drone and rocket attacks at Northern Israel. But we have yet to see either side really employ the full arsenal that they have at their disposals, which would result in much more significant devastation on both sides of the equation. What is clear as well is that we've been witnessing, though, somewhat of an uptick in the size and scale of these attacks from both sides over the course of the last week or so. And today, this latest attack by Hezbollah, which appears to have been carried out via explosive drone, injuring at least 10 people in the northern Israeli town of Hurfeish, a significant moment one that no doubt will provoke a strong Israeli response. And earlier today, before this strike took place, we saw the Israeli prime minister in northern Israel where there have also been wildfires that were sparked by some of this rocket fire from Hezbollah, vowing that Israel will carry out -- is, \"prepared,\" I should say, to carry out very intense action in the north, vowing that one way or another, the situation will be resolved. And he's obviously talking there about resolving it either via diplomatic means, we know that there have been U.S. and French efforts to try and resolve the situation diplomatically between Hezbollah and Israel. But also, the alternative to that is military action. And that specter of a lot war between these two sides. And there is a sense that the clock is very much ticking, it's just not clear what exactly would trigger such an escalation. We do know, however, what could potentially de-escalate things. And that would certainly be a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, which would potentially offer a diplomatic opening for some resolution between Israel and Hezbollah, because Hezbollah has been saying that they're firing these rockets, they're carrying out these attacks in order - - as a response to Israel's military campaign in Gaza. So, everything is very much connected in this region, in this situation, and we will obviously just have to monitor the situation very closely over the coming weeks to see whether or not we are approaching that tipping point in this conflict.",

What comes to mind is as other things that might be triggered as a result of this, clearly, the first one here is the gun license, and that gets revoked. Anything else that you would flag in the (INAUDIBLE) future?",

The gun laws in Florida are very different from the gun laws in New York. But the one thing that won't be different is if he's a convicted felon, and he still possesses it, that could be a problem. Now, the strange part here is we're talking about Donald Trump, former president of the United States, afforded Secret Service protection 24/7 wherever he is, presumably for life. So, why would he need to have a gun? Why would he need a weapon for personal protection? Why would he need a permit to carry a concealed firearm? He probably wouldn't. But it does appear that since his license was still in effect at the time he was charged in Manhattan, and he's had it for at least a couple of decades, that it appears he continued having a license to carry a gun in New York City through the entire time he was president of the United States. And during the time he has been guarded by the Secret Service as a former president, which is odd and somewhat unique.",

The brand's owner TJX says it's equipping security workers with the devices at some of its stores, saying it wants customers and employees to feel safer. But there's criticism over just how effective the move will be. Nathaniel Meyersohn joins us now on the story. Nathaniel, for people that perhaps don't live in the United States and are watching, they'd be bamboozled I think to go into a hardware store or into a pharmacy and see everything behind screens and barriers to prevent people from stealing. But that's the point that they're doing this for security purposes, to protect workers, I guess and their product.",

And one of the facts that I pulled out from that, about 90 percent of assetprotection specialists surveyed last year by the National Retail Federation said the crime had become more of a risk over the prior three years, and that shoplifters themselves have become more violent. What do criminologist to those that you've spoken to, experts in this field, say the impact of these body cams will do? Do they think it will actually help?",

There are a lot of concerns. You know, it's really opening up kind of a can of worms with these body cameras, questions about privacy, training. I mean, you are giving workers kind of police like tools, police like body cameras, putting them in the hands of hourly retail workers making $15.00, $16.00 an hour. I spoke with one T.J. Maxx worker who said that they felt that this was more security theater, these cameras were more theater, and were not actually that effective. I spoke with a re -- with the union leader. And he told me that workers really want to see more training and other security measures. And the union leaders worried that the cameras could be used to potentially surveil workers or try to deter union organizing. So, look, there's a lot of concerns from customer privacy standpoint and also worker safety.",
