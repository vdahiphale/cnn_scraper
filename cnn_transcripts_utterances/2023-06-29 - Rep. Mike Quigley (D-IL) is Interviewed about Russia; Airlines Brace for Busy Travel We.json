In Tennessee, the court decision will allow transgender youth to still receive treatments, like hormone therapy and puberty blockers from now, but the ruling keeps the bans on surgical procedures in place. In Kentucky, a judge put a temporary hold on a similar law taking effect as it works its way through court challenges.All right, starting Saturday, in Connecticut, babies born into poverty can receive $3,200 in what is known as a Connecticut baby bond trust. Once they turn 18, they can access the money to help buy a house, or pay for education, start a business or start job training. Supporters say this will help level the playing field for children who would otherwise lack opportunity. A Florida murder suspect on the run for almost 40 years is now finally in custody. Donald Santini was wanted in the murder of a woman found strangled in a canal in 1984.

      "sentences": "Now to the latest developments from Russia. President Putin is trying to assert his authority once again after the weekend's insurrection by the Wagner group and by its leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. Putin spoke this morning in Moscow. On Wednesday he traveled to southern Russia, greeting supporters, even taking selfies with some of them.But beyond the photo-ops there are real questions today on the whereabouts of a top Russian general, for one, General Sergei Surovikin. \"The New York Times\" reported Wednesday that U.S. officials believe Surovikin had advance knowledge of Prigozhin's plans. \"The Moscow Times\" is now reporting that he is under arrest. There are also indications that other Russian generals may have supported the rebellion. One pro-war blogger claims a military purge is now underway, though CNN has not independently confirmed that report. Joining us now for all of this and where this leaves things in Russia and in Ukraine, Democratic Congressman Mike Quigley of Illinois. He's the co-chair of the Congressional Ukraine Caucus. Congressman, thank you so much for being here. What do you make, first and foremost, of this mystery there seems to be right now surrounding the whereabouts of General Surovikin? The Kremlin is pushing questions about him to the ministry of defense at this point saying they're not going to be talking about it. What do you think? REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL): I think we use our common sense when we assess the situation. After a dramatic coup attempt like this, there will be lots of speculations and rumors. It'll take some months to really figure out. But let's ask ourselves what happened. An operation like this, of this significance, would have taken some time to prepare and a lot of coordination. And probably troops massing and moving over to the east where they eventually went. It's hard for me to imagine that the regular Russian army wasn't aware of the mercenary army moving about and making plans. and if they were aware of it, why didn't they let others know? It's also hard to imagine at least some of them didn't at least think about participating.",

But what does a desperate Putin do? The fact that he does these presses in front of guys with big hats, goes out and meets the public. I think you saw just the beginning of the possibilities with another missile attack on a civilian target. We're pretty sure, in my mind, that he blew up this dam. When I was in Bucha in Ukraine a year ago I saw evidence of war crimes and mass graves. What else is he capable of doing? It makes me worry very much about the nuclear power plant in Ukraine. It makes me worry about what other extreme measures Putin would take, not just to show his strength, but -- to the Russian people, but to the rest of the world.",

You know, if Putin is gone, we're going to see probably someone from the security services, the Soliviki (ph), the hard right nationalists take his place. Those that weren't angry with the invasion. They were angry that it was bungled. And they're probably furious at this point in time how Russia looked to the rest of the world. So, I think there's opportunities there.But we also have the realization that a desperate Putin is a very dangerous one.

Schools burned down. Police stations taken over. What they're bracing for tonight is even more violence. Forty thousand policemen and women will be out on the streets of France to try and bring calm and order.

Just a handful of opinions left. We have an opinion day today beginning at 10But you guys highlighted really two major cases, affirmative action and student loan forgiveness. The reason why they're so major is that they will affect millions and millions of people. Affirmative action has been allowed in the country for more than 40 years. There are nine states that do prohibit affirmative action in colleges and universities, but the rest of the states allow universities and colleges to consider race as one factor in the admissions process. And it's possible that this conservative court will say no longer. Colleges and universities can no longer consider race as a factor. That's something that we're waiting for because the conservative justices seemed very skeptical that race was still needed as a factor for colleges to sufficiently diversify. So, that's a big case that we're waiting for that would obviously affect students, people applying to colleges all across the country. The other big one, with a big number, 44 million students - student loan borrows who are waiting on this, is the future of President Biden's student loan forgiveness program. He tried to get this program into effect over the Covid period. He was blocked by lower courts. Now he's waiting to see if the Supreme Court will give him a green light. This could forgive student loans -- up to $20,000 in student loans, for about 40 million student loan borrowers. However, the conservative court was very skeptical here that the Biden administration even had the power to enact this program because this is a program that would amount to a $400 billion price tag for the government. So, there's a lot of questions here about whether the Biden administration - whether they'll be able to let this plan go into effect and give significant loan relief for millions of Americans. So, guys, we are waiting for those opinions coming down any minute now.",
