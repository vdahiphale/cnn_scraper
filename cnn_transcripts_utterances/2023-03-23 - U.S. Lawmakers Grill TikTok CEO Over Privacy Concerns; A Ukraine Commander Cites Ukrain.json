Tonight, U.S. lawmakers grill TikTok CEO of theprivacy concerns, many arguing the app should be banned, we'll have more on the intense questioning we have seen on Capitol Hill. Then Ukraine could be ready to stage a counteroffensive in Bakhmut, according to top military officials, we'll have more on that at this hour. Plus, a day of anger on the streets of France as President Macron doubles down on his decision to raise the retirement age. We are live amongst the protesters in Paris. First, this hour, though, we begin on Capitol Hill in Washington with a showdown between U.S. lawmakers and the head of social media platform TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew is being grilled by members of the U.S. house congressional committee. It comes as a Chinese-owned social media app faces growing scrutiny as well as cause for it to be banned. Lawmakers are worried user data could fall into the hands of Beijing's communist government. They are also concerned though about consumer privacy and dangers it may pose for young people. Shou insists the app poses no threat though to national security. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And Vanessa, to you first, I mean, it was quite a grilling, sometimes quite uncomfortable to watch, I have to say, but did he -- was he able to convince lawmakers here? Vanessa, that the platform is not an agent of China, doesn't provide data to China. VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, certainly, eyes of the lawmakers he did not. He was grilled for four and a half hours, those tough questions that you heard there mainly about whether or not China and the Chinese government has influence over TikTok, and whether or not they have access to TikTok's data. More specifically, the 150 million users here in the United States. Shou at the top, unequivocally said that TikTok was not an agent of China. He went on to make some commitments to the committee, saying that he was there to confirm that they were going to try to protect teenagers on the app that they were going to put all U.S. privacy data behind a firewall. They were going to make sure that all of that privacy data was on a U.S. server in the U.S., run by Oracle, but that all really fell on deaf ears. The committee was simply not believing what he was saying. And what this does really is embolden Congress, embolden the White House on their mission to either pass legislation to severely restrict TikTok here in the U.S. or force a sale of TikTok from ByteDance to another company that may want to buy TikTok here in the U.S. And we heard from many committee members. They just reinforce that they want to see an outright ban of TikTok here in the U.S. However, it's going to be a little bit tricky, restrictions, yes, maybe we can see some limitations that Congress may place on TikTok and other social media apps, however, an outright ban or sale, that's tricky. We saw the Trump administration in 2020 tried to ban TikTok. They were unsuccessful. They had many legal challenges. Judges ultimately ruling that they could not ban TikTok here in the U.S. So as much as lawmakers potentially want to see that happen, that will be an uphill battle for Congress.",

Well, that's not something that the Chinese government wants to necessarily give up, even though it says that it's not necessarily doing that in the case of TikTok. But broadly-speaking, it's something that governments want to have control line. As far as the official line, though, from Beijing, we heard some response from the central government just a few days ago. They feel that the U.S. government has kind of overreached principles of national security, and that it's getting in the way of free markets, of free choice, and that it's really getting in the way of the economic process. You know, depending on how things unfold, Isa, it's -- and the U.S. decides to follow suit with other countries and actually ban TikTok, we could perhaps see retaliation or at least, that's the suggestion of an economist I heard from, you know, yesterday, you know, here in Tokyo, who said that, perhaps we could see -- we could see the Chinese government say to U.S. tech companies, your apps are banned on Chinese --",

Then there's been a lot of let me get back to you on this, and they were not happy essentially with that type of response. But again, this goes back to the power of Congress and the legislators. Can they pass some sort of sweeping bill that could regulate TikTok and other companies? And ultimately, the White House has to decide as Mark was saying, how far do they want to get into this with China? Do they want to force a sale right now? And do they want to sort of tamper relations with China? It's going to be a lot of discussions, because right now, there is some power in what's come out of this hearing. There is a little bit of firepower that Congress and the White House now has to say that, hey, we gave the CEO an opportunity to ask tough questions -- to answer tough questions, and to tell us 100 percent that China has no involvement in TikTok.

Now, last Thursday, there was this movement by the government to ram through legislation. That would mean that the pensionable age would rise from 62 to 64. It is the ramming through the exercising of that presidential fiat, if you like, that has angered people in addition to these economic reforms that Emmanuel Macron is now absolutely adamant, he is going to drive through, even though, we've now on the sixth day -- of the fifth or sixth day of these demonstrations. This was an organized day, though, Isa, of demonstrations across the country with a million and 89,000, according to the Interior Ministry, participating in street demonstrations, and about 120,000 here on the streets of Paris.

But the problem is that at the end of these formal demonstrations such as this, there's always going to be a ramp element who quite like to mix it with the police. It's almost become a sport, and the danger is that that could escalate further and further. But Macron has been absolutely clear. That he is not going to back down, that he considers it an unwelcome economic necessity to make these reforms.

They were killed by Russian drone attacks overnight on Wednesday. That same day, Russia also fired missiles at the city of Zaporizhzhia directly, and an apartment building where families were living really, their lives as best as they could really in a war zone. Ivan Watson tells us how those people are responding. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  The cleanup work is now underway a day after Ukrainian authorities say Russian missiles slammed into the side of these nine-story apartment buildings in the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia. At least, one person was killed in the attack and some 34 people wounded. I met some of the families who live here who survived the explosion, and insisted on staying here again last night, boarding up their shattered windows with wood and staying here despite the fact that there is no electricity, nor any heat right now. I'd like to point out right here, we've got a children's playground right in front of these buildings. This is the kind of community that was targeted by these deadly strikes. Now the Ukrainian authorities are offering assistance. They've offered temporary accommodation to residents. There is a distribution going on here for people in the neighborhood. This isn't the first time that an apartment building has been pounded by deadly rockets and missiles here just in Zaporizhzhia alone. The city is about a half hour's drive from active frontlines. These buildings face to the southwest, and that is in the direction of Russian- occupied territory. So you can logically conclude that the deadly long- range projectiles were fired from there, and then slammed into here. Just last week, I was in another Ukrainian town, Kramatorsk, seeing a similar scene in a lower kind of three-story building, suggesting there is a deliberate military strategy where certainly, a pattern where Russia fires these types of deadly weapons at residential buildings.

Anna Stewart has more from London. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER (on camera):  Well, given the ECB raised rates by half a percent last week and the Federal Reserve by a quarter of a percent yesterday, this decision from the Bank of England came as little surprise. The labor market is tight in the U.K., and inflation actually increased in February from the month before, coming in at 10.4 percent far higher than the central bank's 2 percent target. It is the 11th increase, a painful cost for many in the U.K. who hold business loans, credit card debt or mortgages, and it could get worse before it gets better. According to the Bank of England's minutes, investors are expecting rates to hit 4.5 percent by August. So, a quarter of a percent higher yet. There was some glimmer of good news, though. U.K. GDP is expected to be higher next quarter than previously forecast, and inflation is still expected to fall significantly, which means hopefully, the Bank of England is approaching the end of its rate hike path.

It's been happening now for 5-plus hours. Some lawmakers are calling for a ban on the app, citing concerns about national security and privacy for the 150 million Americans who use it. Shou Chew says TikTok is safe, and the company plans to firewall U.S. user data from unauthorized foreign access. Well, many people allege that China uses the app to spy. Ironically, TikTok itself doesn't even exist in China. Here's CNN's Selina Wang with a Chinese perspective on all of this for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SELINA WANG, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Pressure is building again in Washington to ban TikTok all because it's owned by a Chinese company ByteDance. In China, TikTok is banned; in fact, it never existed. Instead there is a separate version of ByteDance's app in China called (INAUDIBLE). Boasting more than 600 million daily active users, (INAUDIBLE) is already a viral sensation in China. Before TikTok launched overseas.",

Versus on TikTok you'll see that a bunch of videos pop up about the massacre. WANG (voice-over):  One of Washington's concerns is that because of its Chinese ownership, Beijing could use its propaganda and censorship methods on TikTok, too. The other fear is that TikTok could be forced to hand over data to the Chinese government. But security experts say the national security risks are hypothetical at best. Beijing says the U.S. government has been abusing state power to suppress other countries' companies but the irony is that China has outright blocked countless foreign websites and apps, including Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Netflix and more.

It was the Child OnlineProtection Act and -- or COPA and it was packed. It was passed, in part because there was so much research that was coming out about the impact of broadcast media on children and the ways in which we need to protect them and pass standards of health and safety from them. And part of what's happening. Is that we can't get the research from these tech companies. And some of part of what we know comes from brave whistleblowers like Frances Hagen, who talked about how Instagram had data of how social media was impacting young women and girls specifically and mental health and body image. And they hid the data for two years. And so part of the problem is that we're not getting the data about social media's impacts and real costs on children's mental health.",

And it is incredibly sensitive information. When these recommendation algorithms are unleashed on children. And it's pulling data from children at a very young age. And one of the legal scholars in my film on \"TikTok, Boom,\" notes that this information, you know, if we -- if a company starts collecting this information when a child is 13, by a child -- by the time a child is an adult, it can know you better than -- that algorithm can know you better than a parent can know you.

      "sentences": "Well, what could have been a very dramatic evening essentially ended in the prime minister, saying thathe plans to continue on with this planned judicial overhaul. Despite what we have been hearing all afternoon and through this evening, Israeli media reports and I have now confirmed that the defense minister had gone to prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu and he had actually planned to give a speech, according to Israeli media reports, calling for the judicial overhaul to be frozen. Because of the fears over what it would do to Israeli national security. Now the defense minister, according to these reports, had been meeting with the chief of the IDF, with the security heads. And all of them expressed concern because we have already heard reports from Israeli military reservists, including the really important selective air force crews, who said that they would refuse the call to serve if called if this overhaul passed. But it wasn't just the situation amongst the reserves that was concerning. There was concern about how this was trickling down and the feeling and the morale amongst all of the -- all of the soldiers all of the military. And there was also concern about what it was doing. For security ties also abroad with other countries and international relations. And so that was what the defense minister was planning to say. He had a meeting with the prime minister beforehand and then he decided to -- essentially canceled his own speech and said Netanyahu went up to the podium. And while he said that he does want to work with the other side and he understands the concerns of the other side and there are fears and that these are real concerns. He essentially said that he plans to push ahead. It's rather surprising when there are these very clear reports that the defense ministry and on the IDF and all of these people are not denying that there is a real concern in the security establishment about what this overhaul would do. Don't think about the financial issues, don't think about even the independence of the judiciary. These are people who all they care about is national security. They think there's a national security concern here. And instead of coming out and saying that he was going to be freezing the legislative process, he instead actually says that he is now going to get even more personally involved. Why is he getting more personally involved ? Well, earlier today, a blog was passed that essentially said it's much more difficult to declare a sitting prime minister unfit for office. It would only be able to be about physical or mental issues. And 75 percent of the cabinet would have to declare that because right now Isa there's a petition in front of the Supreme Court to declare Netanyahu unfit for office because of a conflict of interest declaration he agreed to as part of his corruption trial. So essentially, he is now in his mind free to get personally involved into this judicial overhaul. And he says that now he will be stepping in. He is calling for the opposition to have negotiations. But we're hearing from the opposition leaders that they think that Netanyahu should have frozen the legislation, that he has not done so and it's not clear whether they will actually be sitting down for these negotiations, because, Netanyahu says, he's pushing forward.",
