      "sentences": "Peru is seeing some of its worst violence in recent decades after the ousting of former President PedroCastillo has led to protesters throughout the country to call for political change, particularly in the south where dozens of people have been killed in clashes with the police. But these protests are about so much more than former President Castillo. Peru has been experiencing a deep political crisis for years. The current president, Dina Boluarte, is the sixth head of state in less than five years and even if she were to go like some of the protesters are now demanding a solution to the crisis is hard to see. Both the presidency and Congress are widely discredited and are perceived as corrupted institutions. Only 21 percent of Peruvians said that they are satisfied with Democratic rule in the 2021 poll by LAPOP, a survey research laboratory at Vanderbilt University. And on one in two Peruvians, I think that the military takeover is justified when corruption is high. Even though the country has experienced an economic boom in recent years, the expectations of better living conditions have not been fulfilled. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Peru has recorded the highest per capita death toll in the world and according to the United Nations, over half of the population lack access to enough food. Many people simply think that the system is not working for them. Boluarte has so far resisted calls for early general elections and has declared a state of emergency in the areas of the country that have been most affected by the protest. The attorney general has opened an inquiry into Boluarte`s handling of the unrest, and it`s hard to predict how the situation will be in the near future. However, even if khan were to be restored in Peru, the root causes of this crisis still need to be addressed. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Appalachian Mountains is your answer here, home to America`s longest hiking-only trail they`re thought to have been formed around 480 million years ago. Let`s go to the Appalachia Region now, home to more than 25 million Americans. The area extending from Mississippi to New York, known for its mountain terrain, relies heavily on the mining, forestry and agricultural industries. Recently though, a new industry has become a concern for some residents, the crypto mining industry, and mostly the noise pollution it creates. We`ll hear now from CNN chief climate correspondent Bill Weir who recently traveled to Murphy, North Carolina, to speak with residents who pushed back when the sound of silence was replaced with the sound of cryptocurrency. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This is the sound of Green Mountain Farm. Certified by Quiet Parks International as one of the most peaceful spots in North Carolina. Thanks to their rare local enforcement of laws against noise pollution. Meanwhile, about 90 minutes away, beautiful Cherokee County sounds like this. It is stack upon stack of computer servers, and the fans needed to cool them. This is what`s known as a crypto mine. And it makes the sound of people in San Francisco trying to make virtual money.",
