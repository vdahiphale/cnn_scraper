Welcome back to our breaking news coverage of the Israel Hamas war.It's now 11:00 p. m. in Jerusalem, and we have new developments unfolding right now. An IDF spokesperson says that they're going to increase airstrikes in Gaza from today, and the IDF chief of staff telling military commanders that they will \"enter the Gaza Strip and launch an operation to take out and destroy Hamas.\" It's not clear exactly when that will happen, but Israeli troops, tanks, and armored personnel carriers have lined the border with Gaza for days now. This, as U.S. President Joe Biden is promising that he will work with allies to keep Egypt's Rafah Border Crossing into Gaza open for humanitarian aid. For the first time since the Israel Hamas war began two weeks ago, 20 trucks filled with food, water and medical supplies went into Gaza today, but the crossing only remained open briefly. Palestinian officials say the supplies are not nearly enough amid constant Israeli shelling and airstrikes. More on that now from CNN's Clarissa Ward in Cairo. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, there is a somber feeling here.It is quieter than I have ever seen it. I used to live here back in 2012 and '13 and have been back in 2014 and 2020 and I have absolutely never seen Jerusalem like this, where the old city is very easily to traverse. Usually, it is backed and packed with tourists and people from all around the world and local people going about their business. So, you can really tell that something has happened here in a similar way to what happened during the beginning of COVID, where you saw people shutting down and people sort of just waiting until the danger is over. There is a similar feeling, although a very different situation that is happening in this country. Certainly, there is official war here in Israel, and you can certainly tell by the mood of people here and by the concern of those who live in the West Bank, those who have been out protesting in large numbers against the Israeli bombardment in Gaza that has been unrelenting because of the humanitarian crisis it has caused and the number of deaths, including those of children in a place where about 50 percent of the population is under the age of 18.

So, initially, they were told that what was needed was tactical gear, things like bulletproof vests. And now, what they're hearing is that there's a huge need for medical supplies.

So, it's intertwined.And there were two elements to the Balfour Declaration. One triumphantly achieved a safe homeland for the Jews who had faced the most appalling hundreds of years of history of oppression in Europe. But we also promised that we would respect the rights of the existing population. And of course, that hasn't happened at all. And we are now seeing it in almost in the last chance saloon, and with this response to Hamas' attack on Israelis, and one can ought to be able to understand the context from which that appalling event arose, but if Israel responds in a continuation of what is done already it will be way outside the reams of the laws of war, way outside the rules of the International Community about how we conduct relations between nations. And indeed, the occupation of Gaza is already based on an illegality under international law, a straightforward breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention. And of course, this conflict is now spilling over into the West Bank, with 80 Palestinians, I think, have been killed since this thing started. And the -- there are 750,000 Jewish people settled on territory that is anticipated to be the territory of a future State of Palestine.

And he also released a statement this afternoon, recognizing that humanitarian aid had gone into Gaza, and he attributed that to days of diplomatic engagement. Of course, this is something that came on the heels of the president's trip to Israel. It's also following a conversation that the President Biden had with Egypt's president, where the two agreed to have this opened, the Rafah Crossing, that is.Now, in a statement, the president went on to say the following, \"I made it clear from the outset of this crisis, in both my public statements and private conversations, that humanitarian assistance was a critical and urgent need that had to get moving, and I express my deep personal appreciation about for the leadership of Israel -- of Israel, Egypt and the United Nations to allow for the resumption of this assistance.\" And, of course, this is going to be an ongoing challenge for the administration when they recognize and one that they are working behind the scenes on. And that too -- this is also in addition to the hostages held by Hamas and getting those hostages released. Now, this week, we learned that two American hostages were released by Hamas, the president welcoming that news, as you mentioned earlier. And yesterday, as he was making his way to Rehoboth Beach, the president said -- answered yes when asked whether he wanted to see more hostages released. Of course, this has been incredibly complicated for the administration. Officials have said that the -- it being an active war zone as well as the complexities of a group like Hamas has made it more difficult to assess the conditions and the locations of American hostages. But when they describe it, they say it is about a handful of hostages who they say are American.

And from what we can see on the ground, this ground invasion does appear to be imminent, whether imminent means Tonight or tomorrow or in the coming days remains to be seen. But certainly, we are seeing a significant massing of forces around the Gaza Strip.Just today, we were driving, you know, within 10 kilometers of the strip and we came across not one, not two, but four different groupings of armored vehicles, tanks and bulldozers, which are used to clear the roads of IEDs and other potential obstacles for those forces to be able to move in. We have video of just one of those groupings where you can see dozens of tanks and armored personnel carriers and those D9 bulldozers there. And this is -- again, we saw four different groupings of this very same size. This is all coming as we are hearing those comments from the Israeli military's chief of staff saying, we will enter Gaza, and also telling troops what their task will be. He said that their task will be to \"destroy Hamas operatives and infrastructure,\" and also making clear that while the -- they understand that Hamas has certainly prepared for a ground invasion, booby-trapped the Gaza Strip, dug new tunnels under the Gaza Strip and reinforced their positions, he said that while they are prepared, we are prepared also in preparing to go in. Now, there is a real question about what a ground invasion means in terms of casualties. Certainly, Israeli politicians and generals have been preparing the Israeli public for the fact that this will be a long and painful war. Painful certainly in terms of Israeli troop casualties. But there is also a question of what this means for the civilians inside the Gaza Strip who have already suffered immensely in these two weeks of war. The death toll altogether, including combatants as well as civilians, has risen to over 4,000 inside the Gaza Strip. Hundreds of those are women and Children. And when we witnessed a training yesterday of special forces reconnaissance unit, a reserve unit of troops, we spoke to one of their commanders, a lieutenant colonel who told us as I asked a question about civilian casualties, he said, Israel has time again warned civilians to leave the northern part of the Gaza Strip and head south. And he said, anyone who has chosen to stay there has chosen a side. Now, he did say that Israel will nonetheless continue to try and avoid civilian casualties, but that was certainly a striking message to hear from a lieutenant colonel who is preparing his forces to go into Gaza. Certainly, the message that some troops will receive is that anyone in that area, any moving person could potentially be a target. So, this could be a -- certainly a very bloody war ahead, very bloody days ahead as the Israeli military prepares to move into the Gaza Strip. But again, we don't know exactly when that will begin.",
