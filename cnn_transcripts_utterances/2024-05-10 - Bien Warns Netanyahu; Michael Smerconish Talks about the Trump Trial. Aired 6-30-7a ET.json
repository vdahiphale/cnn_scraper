In other words, it really wasn't - the timeline really wasn't established so much by the election, as it was the re-emergence by Stormy Daniels. Something else that I want to say. I've heard so many observers, pundits on CNN and elsewhere saying that this was - you know, Donald Trump is an incorrigible client and that yesterday perhaps they went on to long with the cross-examination and that was at his behest no doubt. And I believe that. But I think there's more to it. And that is that Trump is playing to an audience beyond those 12 jurors. Thus far, none of this has hurt him. And it looks increasingly likely, because of what happened with Judge Aileen Cannon, because we're waiting on the Supreme Court relative to the January 6th case, it looks - and the Georgia Fulton County case is still, you know, slogging along because of the relationship between Nathan Wade and Fani Willis, it looks like this is the only one. And Trump, I think, is mindful of that. Rick Scott, the audio that you played, which is really interesting, is further proof of what I'm saying, that he's trying to convince the American electorate that this is all political. It is about the sex, as tawdry as it is, and it's very little about a campaign finance violation.",
