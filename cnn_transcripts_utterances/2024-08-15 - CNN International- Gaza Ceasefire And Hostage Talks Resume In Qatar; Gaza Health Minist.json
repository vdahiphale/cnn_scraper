      "sentences": "Good morning or good evening, depending on where you're watching. I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, a devastating milestone, more than 40,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza. It comes as stalled peace talks in Doha are now underway. We are live in Israel and Lebanon for the very latest here. Plus, Ukraine making more advances inside Russia, as it conducts its biggest attack on Russian air fields since the war began. And it was supposed to be a speech about the economy, but Donald Trump could not resist the insults. Well, we begin this hour with that devastating milestone in Gaza, a reminder of all the lives that are at stake, as mediators begin a last-ditch effort in Doha to end the war. Officials from the U.S., Israel, Egypt and Qatar are all taking part. Hamas is not at the table, but says that it could meet with negotiators afterwards. Now, each day that passes with no deal, more people in Gaza lose their lives. Gaza's Health Ministry says that the death toll now tops 40,000. Now, we don't have a breakdown of how many combatants versus civilians have been killed. But, earlier this month, the Palestinian Ministry of Relief Affairs reported more than 10,000 women and 16,000 children have been killed in Gaza since October 7th, and the numbers could actually be significantly higher, because Gaza's government media office estimates that at least 10,000 people are still missing, believed to be under the rubble. We have team coverage for you. Let's get more now from Jeremy Diamond, who is live in Haifa, Israel, and Ben Wedeman, who is in Beirut. Jeremy, let me start with you. What more can you share with us, and what more are you learning about these ceasefire talks?",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, these ceasefire talks are certainly a critical moment in these negotiations that we have seen in the conduct of this war that has stretched for more than 10 months now, as we are learning that more than 40,000 Palestinian civilian -- Palestinians in Gaza, I should say, both civilians and combatants, have now been killed.But, the expectations for these talks today are certainly not very high. There is certainly no expectation that a deal will be reached today, but there is the potential for progress to be made, and with that, the potential for these tensions in this region to be significantly lower. That also means, of course, that there is the potential for a lack of progress in these talks, and for that to then perhaps hasten that prospect of Iranian and Hezbollah retaliation attacks against Israel over the coming days. Now, all the key players are in Doha today, the CIA Director, Bill Burns; the Director of the Mossad, David Barnea; the Qatari Prime Minister, as well as the Egyptian head of intelligence, all of them set to meet today. They're actually meeting, as we speak right now, trying to hash out some of the differences that remain between Israel and Hamas and to come up with what could be a bridging proposal that could bridge the gap between Israel's position and Hamas'. Now, Hamas has said it will not participate in these talks, but that's -- a lot of that is rhetoric, because they are still in Doha and they are willing to hear out the mediators after their meeting with Israel, which, frankly, isn't all that different from the way in which these talks have been conducted in the past, with the mediators acting as the go-between between Israel and Hamas, never the two parties having actually been in the same room together. We understand that the Israeli Prime Minister has given his team an expanded mandate to engage in these negotiations to try and reach a deal. But, sources that I've spoken to have expressed doubts about whether or not that will actually be enough to bridge the gap between Israel and Hamas. So, certainly, a lot riding on these talks, a lot of potential for progress, but also most folks who we're talking to trying to keep expectations very low. Rahel.",

Does it mean that the United States is simply going to give up if they fail? But certainly, the worry is that, if they fail, that really we are back on that slippery slope to perhaps a regional conflict. And now, diplomats here in Beirut, for instance, have stressed that they don't believe either Hamas or -- rather Hezbollah or Iran are ready or willing or wanting a regional war. They can't afford it militarily, politically, or economically, given that the economy here in Lebanon is in shambles. In Iran, it's not much better.But, they worry that the same sort of hesitance for a regional war doesn't exist within the Israeli cabinet. They have seen as going back to April when Israel struck the Iranian diplomatic complex in Damascus, and then just two weeks ago, killing a senior leader of Hezbollah here in Beirut, and then it's widely believed, even though Israel denies it, killing Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, that they've crossed red lines that some thought they wouldn't cross, the Israelis. And the worry is that the Israelis confident that the United States will continue to provide diplomatic cover, will continue, as we saw yesterday, to increase its sales of weapons and other munitions to be used in Gaza. And the he fear is that the Israelis, there is no real control or pressure being put by the United States on the Israelis to tamp things down. American diplomats are busy calling on Iran and Hezbollah to restrain themselves, but they are hearing very little on this side in terms of calls of restraint on Israel. Rahel.",

It does appear as though the Ukrainians are, in fact, still advancing, but it seems as though at a much slower pace than we have seen in the past couple of days. You already mentioned the President of the country, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying that the Ukrainians are now about 35 kilometers into Russian territory, which is still very far. However, they also say that in the course of really since the beginning of today, they managed to advance about 500 meters to 1.5 kilometers. Now, that, on the face of it, is not very far.However, one of the things, of course, that is remarkable is that on day nine of this incursion into Russian territory, the Ukrainians are still advancing. If we look, for instance, at Russia's recent offensive into the Kharkiv area in northeastern Ukraine, that came to a standstill about two or three days into that offensive. So, the Ukrainians still able to move forward. That in itself certainly an achievement for the Ukrainians. The Russians, for their part, today have said that they've been hitting the Ukrainians back in certain areas. They claim that they've taken one village back from the Ukrainians. However, Kyiv saying that they still control 82 towns and villages on the Russian side of the border, of course, not just in the Kursk region, but all this seems to be spilling over into the Belgorod region as well. One of the things you mentioned is that there is now a federal emergency in place in that region, Rahel.",

One of the things, of course, that the Ukrainians have been trying to do is sort of degrade or to a certain extent trying to halt Russian air power. The Russians, in recent weeks, have become a lot more proficient and effective at using their air power, using some pretty heavy aerial glide bombs, as they're called, which they can dump off their jets further away from the frontline than before.Now, the Ukrainians managed to hit, they say, four airfields really pretty deep into Russia, and there are satellite images that came out from one of those airfields in the Voronezh region, which is in the south of Russia, apparently showing two hangars that have been damaged in general. The Ukrainians saying that they obviously wanted to damage aircraft, but then also hangars and fuel depots as well for those planes. How much of a dent that's going to put into Russia's air capabilities? Of course, very difficult to ascertain.

Certainly, every dent that they could put the Ukraine can't put into Russia's air power is something that will benefit their frontline troops. It's hard to overstate how much more effective the Russians have become at using their air force. Of course, there is other things that are in play as well, like, for instance, the Ukrainians having those F-16 jets, which they haven't used on the frontlines yet, but seemingly they're waiting for their pilots to get a little more experience. So, on those also, the air defense capabilities have gotten a lot better.At the same time, of course, the front that we're looking at right now, the Kursk front, is only one of several in this war. And if you look, for instance, into the Donbas area, first and foremost, the town of Pokrovsk, the Ukrainians are saying that the Russians there are indeed still advancing and getting closer to that town, which is an important logistics hub for the Ukrainians. So, certainly, that offensive by the Russians or those -- that pressure that the Russians are putting on the Ukrainians there, that is still ongoing. It seems they may have redeployed some of their forces in some of those areas, but certainly, still very capable of putting pressure on the Ukrainians on other fronts.",

I think this would suggest that, although publicly the administration has said that the parties are close, they're actually not as close, as Kirby would like people to believe.It's important to note that Hamas is not at the table. It said it will consider what's discussed at the table today, and that the Israelis have made modifications to their demands related to the control of the Rafah border crossing and where and how Palestinians can cross into the northern part of the Gaza Strip, and of course, they have to be disarmed. Those are things that are more than just nitty-gritty details that need to be worked out. So, I'm not at all as positive as the White House is sounding right now.",

That is the big issue, and that has been the big issue from the very start with these long running on and off again negotiations. And then there are those details that I mentioned, control of theRafah crossing, whether armed cadres of Hamas can return to the northern Gaza Strip. Those types of things are important.

The hostage families, of course, want a ceasefire. These poor Palestinians who have been caught in the crossfire for 10 months of course want and need a ceasefire. But, there is a problem with political leadership, and neither leaders at the moment can make those concessions to get a ceasefire. It's notable that Netanyahu has broadened the mandate somewhat slightly for his negotiators. That may be a political tactic.

And Walmart has really been able to use that size and scale to drive down prices with suppliers. And you think about Walmart in the past. Its core customer has typically been lower and middle income. Bu, Walmart has really seen higher income shoppers flock to stores right now. That's where the biggest market share gains are coming from, higher income customers making more than $100,000 a year, who are looking to save money on groceries and other items after the run-up in inflation in the last few years. SOLOMONfine point on it. Not only did they retain sort of their core base of customers, but they were able to attract a different perhaps clientele because of inflation, folks who might have otherwise shop somewhere else, but were looking for lower prices.
