And as former President Trump nears the end of his hush money trial in New York, he held a rally uptown in the Bronx trying to court Hispanic and black voters.Both candidates are readying for next month's debate, which is, here's a plug, right here on CNN. You won't want to miss it. Let's get some details now from CNN senior White House correspondent MJ Lee. So, MJ, what are you hearing about this next phase of Biden's campaign, especially as we get closer to that big debate? MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you know, the Biden campaign, like all of us, they have no idea what next week is going to bring. They don't know if the former president is going to be found guilty, not guilty; is there going to be a mistrial; is it even going to end next week. But they do know that ultimately, when the trial does end, you know, the coverage that has taken up so much time and so much space, that is also going to end as well. And they do see an opportunity for there to be just more space, more room, more opportunities to make their case in a way that they haven't been able to in the last several weeks. And a source familiar that I was talking to says that end of the trial for the Trump New York case is going to coincide with this more aggressive phase of the campaign for the Biden folks, whether it is on the kinds of ads that they're going to run, the messaging, the rhetoric that we're going to hear from the campaign, including from the president himself. And we did sort of see sort of an unofficial launch of that next phase with this new scorching ad from the Biden campaign that is narrated by Robert De Niro and it is called \"Snapped.\" Let's take a look.

But what I'm told is that guilty or not, a convicted felon or not, the thrust of their message and running after Donald Trump is largely going to remain the same.One interesting thing from this source is that - that I was told is that the Biden campaign is still grappling with the reality that the vast majority of voters still don't see election day as a choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. This is something that they've been grappling with for months and really is one of the key obstacles that they're really trying to fight.

But nevertheless, they saw this as an opportunity to maximize his time in New York and speak to these communities that they are hoping they can win on the margins. Now, like you said, he's not going to win the Bronx. He's probably not going to win New York, but there are communities in Detroit, in Atlanta, in Nevada, in Arizona, that they hope that they can speak to.

They didn't know exactly who the clients were, but they said they repeatedly asked how these voice samples would be used and they were told they would be used for internal purposes only, for academic research and test radio ads. But years later, they said they made what was for them a shocking discovery. First, Paul came across a YouTube video that sounded like it was narrated by his voice, but it was not words that he had ever said. Then they were listening to a podcast about the dangers of AI, where the host was interviewing a chatbot, but it sounded like Paul. The couple say they eventually traced these and other samples that they say sounded like their voice back to this company, Lovo, which markets AI-generated voices for marketing purposes or online trainings.
