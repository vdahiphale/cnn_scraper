I'm Laura Coates and this is CNN TONIGHT.And we have stunning news tonight, Alec Baldwin facing criminal charges in the deadly shooting on the set of the movie Rust. Prosecutors planning to charge the star with involuntary manslaughter in the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins after she was struck in the chest by a live round of ammunition fired from a prop gun held by Baldwin back in 2021. We've got an in-depth hour on those charges against Alec Baldwin and the armorer on that set later in the show. And there is also some very sad news tonight on the death of a folk rock icon. David Crosby has died at the age of 81. His family says after a long illness, he has succumbed. David Crosby is one of the founding members of The Byrds in Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, and his music, for so many, was really the soundtrack of 60s and decades to follow in his genre in particular. And who could forget songs like, well, like this. I want to bring in CNN's Bill Weir who interviewed Bill Crosby for the CNN documentary, Woodstock at 50, also Greg Harris, President and CEO of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Glad to have you here and lean on your expertise on this icon in particular. I want to begin with you, Bill, if I can, because you enter viewed David Crosby for the CNN documentary Woodstock at 50. Tell me about some of the highlights during your time speaking with him.",

Not just because I'm a huge music fan of his era but because he's one of the most honest and open books at this stage in his life. His whole life at this -- when I met him around 2005 and then through the years we had kept in touch, he had been through heroin and cocaine addiction, he had been in jail in Texas, he'd had eight stint in his heart, he had a liver transplant. His son that he had given up for adoption in the 60s, they were reunited later in life and was a musician and they actually recorded and toured together. And so he was just sort of grateful and sort of sheepish about the fact that he didn't expect to survive his contemporaries, like Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, but, wow, what a life he lived.And at the time, he was recording five albums in five years of new music. He was not just content to play CSNY, he had all of this stuff he wanted to get down. And I asked him about it. There was a song at that time, he recorded, that the lyric is I've been thinking a lot about dying and how to do it well. And that led to this question. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's a sort of Southern California kid, dad was a cinematographer in Hollywood. He falls into a band with Roger McGuinn and the former The Byrds, eight miles high, turn, turn, turn. So, you want to be a rock and roll star. But then they couldn't get along. They break up. And then he forged this super group, where he -- the first time they harmonized at Momma Casas (ph) at the Mommas and the Poppas, their house in with Graham Nash and Steven Stills, they looked at each other and knew. And they also knew that it would be Crosby, Stills and Nash because Nash, Stills and Crosby sounds like a law firm and just came together. And then when Neil Young came by at Joni Mitchell's house say, I want to join the band, and they were like, what can you do, and he says, have you heard me sing with Graham Nash and (INAUDIBLE) play a guitar. And they brought him on. But, at the end they weren't talking to each another anymore. And it was either insulting a spouse or something that -- Cros said he was hugely selfish, he had a huge ego. Well, that broke my heart because when you look at Woodstock, the film, their second set ever was at 3:00 in the morning on Monday. So, 5,000 people, half of them were probably asleep. The beauty of that, the little trio on stage there, and so I asked Cros about the breakups. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm glad that you are both here, because, I'm telling you, I've been looking through this, and, of course, many of us are watching this and seeing this when it first leaked and thought, man, who did this, get to the bottom of it quickly and I wonder how it will impact the integrity of the court. But then I saw in the review, I'll start with you here, Steve, it's being touted this investigation as very thorough.

I mean, I think if we're measuring thoroughness about whether the investigation was conducted by Inspector Clouseau, where the (INAUDIBLE) cops, then that would be one thing. But this has all the hallmarks of an investigation that was never seriously intended to actually find what it was looking for, not asking for polygraphs from any of the dozens of employees who were interviewed, not asking the justices, not asking the justices' family members if they had knowledge of the leak. In some cases, basically, asking the employees to say, did you do it? And if they said, no, that was the end.And I think, Laura, the question is why would the court be so invested in not actually getting to the bottom of it. And I think the answer is because no resolution is probably better at this point than a resolution that is going to piss off half the country, where it's identified as someone from one side of the aisle.",

How do you see this investigation? IRIN CARMON, SENIOR CORRESPONDENT, NEW YORK MAGAZINEAnd so I guess I'm left wondering, why do this at all? As Steve said, it shows that there's no particular appetite to find out who leaked it but there were under no obligation to conduct this type of investigation. There were under no obligation to write this super weird report that on the one hand is very revealing and on the other doesn't really tell us that much. Ultimately, this is a decision that affected the lives of millions of people, continues to affect the lives of millions of people, and this, on some level, was a sideshow.

I mean, I think when the justices publicly go out and say, you know, we're going to have a hard time trusting each other, right, this is going to change how we function behind the scenes, that has to be right. And I think we saw the one thing in the report that actually made sense was some of the information technology-related recommendations about modernizing the court's infrastructure, about actually imposing the kinds of security protocols that every other government entity and law firm when it needs to.And, frankly, I think that there's a lesson there, it's that this is a court that has become so cloistered from the political branches. This is exactly the kind of thing that, as recently as 15, 20 years ago, would have been the invitation to some kind of inner branch dialog, hey, Congress, we could use some more money for new technology, hey Congress, we could use help figuring out how to create a meaningful, secret, secure system, right, in the building. And you look at something like the chief justice' year-end report, Laura, this anodyne just sort of the now statement that John Roberts put out on New Year's Eve, where there were all these opportunities to talk about, how Congress could help, how the courts could benefit from being a part of this inner branch conversation, and instead all talks about is judicial security. So, to me, I mean, Irin is right, like the real question is why do this report? I think it's of a piece with this mentality that there is absolutely nothing rotten in Denmark and people could stop complaining that there is, when the report itself is actually evidence of all the ways in which that's just not true and whether you like what the court is doing on the merits or dislike what the court is doing on the merits, this really just is not how we would expect an institution to function in a healthy system.",

I mean, there are structural, systemic policies that prevented African- Americans from even -- we talk a lot about we want everybody to start at the same place, but there are a lot of people in this country that never even had a chance to get to the starting block.

Also, with me CNN national security analyst, Juliette Kayyem. Glad to have you both here. Let me begin with you Lowanda because you were actually going to the school to pick up your grandson that day, saw this teacher who was touching and clutching her body, and you saw that she was bleeding. And you helped to provide some kind of first aid. What was going through your mind? What did you think happened?LOWANDA SAMPLE-RUSK, GRANDSON ATTENDS RICHNECK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL: Well, at that point, we knew that a teacher had been shot. We knew that someone had been shot. Because another school official came into the office where I was, signing up my grandson, and let us know that there was a shooter and that someone had been shot, of course. Within a few minutes then, Ms. Zwerner, came into the office holding her hand and stating that she had been shot and to call 9-1-1. At that point, she laid out on the floor and she, you know, she was in a lot of distress. It was really scary. It was very scary. We did know what to do. I didn't know really exactly what to do. So, someone just yelled, put pressure on her wound. And at that point, she was on the floor, and I did that.",

What have you made of the school's response to now?SAMPLE-RUSK:  Well, up until -- as far as the school's response to the shooting, once the teacher came into the office and there were others in the office as well, two secretaries and then someone else came into the office. So, once they got into the -- once the teacher was secure and the school's response, they were doing everything they could to make sure that the children, the other children in the school were safe because at that point, we knew it was a shooter. We didn't know who it was, where it was before Ms. Zwerner came into the office. We didn't know who it was. So, that was the panic there. But afterwards, once we found out then we -- everything kind of calmed down a little bit. And then I guess they were communicating over the walkies all over the phones from the classrooms and we were told that the person that was shooting, the child, had been secured, that they had -- someone else had the child.",
