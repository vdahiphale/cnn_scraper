She's the editor-in-chief of the National or Global News Organization based here in Abu Dhabi. What do you make of what is what is unfolding? MINA AL-ORAIBI, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, THE NATIONAL:  Incredibly historic. It's a moment that is deeply personal for every Syrian. So, for those who are displaced inside their own country or refugees, there are at least half of the population of Syria got displaced from its homes. And then there are those who stayed in areas under the control of the regime and those who supported Bashar al-Assad. For all of them, it's either a moment of hope or fear or a mix of both. And, politically, this is huge. It is 61 years of Ba'ath rule in Syria and 54 years of Assad family rule in Syria. And so how Syria goes forward from here is not only deeply important for Syrians and what it means for the Syrian state, but for the entire region. And, of course, when we put the developments in Syria over the last week or so, within the context of the last 14 months, the fact that Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, is no longer here, the fact that Iran is on a back foot in Syria and Lebanon, but also the fact that there is a terrible raging war in Gaza and that the wounds of the Palestinians are not to be forgotten or ignored. And so I think putting it in that context is important geopolitically and regionally, but for Syrians, it's deeply personal today.",

Millions of refugees, of course, who will be wondering, you know, what their next move is at this point. Many, I'm hearing, are already intending to get back to Syria as quickly as possible. We don't know, though, what Syria will look like in the days and weeks to come.So, let's talk about this opposition. Who are they? Who are they backed by? And what's their intention at this point? AL-ORAIBI:  Well, there are oppositions, right? So, the fragmentation of the Syrian opposition, back from 2011, 2012, hard to believe, over a decade ago, the different groupings that emerged, and until this moment, there were certain opposition groups that remained political, so, you know, they're either based in Washington or in Paris, but they really lost any influence, especially in the last decade. And then there are the armed groups. And, of course, there is Hayat Tahrir Al- Sham and that incredible CNN scoop speaking Jolani and hearing directly from him, that was part of seeing Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham in new light. This was a group that was very much Al-Qaeda affiliated and now has said that they are no longer Al-Qaeda affiliated, but they are Islamist in their outlook, and there is concern about what that means. Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham have been backed by Turkey very directly and in previous era supported by Qatar also. There is also the Free Syrian Army. The Free Syrian Army is not an Islamist grouping. They were mainly in the southern part of Syria and in and out from Syria. Free Syrian Army is made out of -- made up of former soldiers in the Syrian army. So, one there is seen as more of a nationalistic kind of army, and also they know operationally Syria much better and in a different light than Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham. There are many other groupings, smaller groupings that you can talk about in Suwayda and the southern part of Syria that never really calmed down, mainly Druze communities. There has been opposition there, very local opposition, and they've been able to push out local forces and so forth. What we have to keep in mind is opposition at the moment is very fluid. And it's quite interesting, there is a former Syrian diplomat who put a note on his Facebook post this morning. He used to be a diplomat. He was one of the first diplomats to defect based in Washington. And he said, it's strange, I'm no longer the opposition. Who am I? And so this idea of that fluid and some, especially the foot soldiers, will now go and join different groupings, depending on who, one, seems more aligned to their values, but, two, may be the ones winning.",

Your group is a prescribed terrorist organization by the United States, by the U.N., by the E.U. and others.ABU MOHAMMAD AL JOLANI, LEADER, HAYAT TAHRIR AL-SHAM (HTS):  I say to people, don't judge by words, but by actions. I believe the reality speaks for itself. These classifications are primarily political, and at the same time, wrong.

So, it's hard to tell what will happen in a year's time. But definitely in this moment, those who hold ground are going to be able to have sway on what happens next. It's important that Jolani said, judge us by our deeds, not words. It's interesting. That is what an American official said to me in Manama just yesterday attending the Manama Dialogue, IISS Manama Dialogue. And the American position has been, we're going to wait and see. Because, of course, let's not forget that HTS, Hayat Tahrir al- Sham, is prescribed, is considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and several other countries. And so that has to be reconsidered for Jolani to be able to play any active role on a political stage outside of Syria. He's not going to be want to see as a terrorist, be seen as a terrorist. So, I think he will have an important role in this transitory period. How he behaves and how he is able to hand over to civilian rule, of course, let's not forget the prime minister of Syria, at-Jalali, has stayed in Damascus, he made the address to the people, not the former president. We can actually say that now, not the former president, Bashar al-Assad, not the former president, but the prime minister. So, will Jolani have a relationship with the current P.M. and say to him, you know, we, we will follow your direction. But the statements from Jolani have been that we are not here to try to run the day-to-day, you know, electricity, water and so forth. They know they have to hand that to the technocrats. That role in itself is very significant.",

I think they do have an interest in Syria They don't have an interest now in this regime because it became too costly. And the way that the Syrian army fell back was because it showed you how hollowed out it became that it was Russian planes, it was Iranian-backed forces that were really keeping the Assad regime in place, but actually to a point that you heard this being said from Russian officials saying, we can't fight harder than you know Assad's army will fight to defend his regime rather than to defend Syria. Russia's interests are very strong in Syria continuing, and that is why it's going to be very interesting to see what sort of agreements can be made. Of course, we often speak about Tartus, the important Mediterranean port that Russia feels is hugely important for its own strategic interests and its security, basically. So, what they do there will be important. And just on what it means for the region, it depends what lessons have been learned. From Iraq, tragically, completely different story in 2003, what happened in Libya, what happened in Yemen, what happened in Sudan, and so forth. If the Syrians are able to learn the lesson where they determine their future, everyone's going to have an interest and will want to influence what's happening, everyone from the Iranians to the Russians and others. But if they are able to say, you know, this is -- we're going to control the situation and not allow foreign influence to supersede Syrian interests, then they would have been able to do a great service for their people.",

They want to see de-escalation around this region. They want to see economic integration, told by the Americans some years ago, sort your own backyard out. The region, they will say from Abu Dhabi and from Riyadh, you know, is undergoing this sort of reorganization, you know, so much more regional integration these days.So, that is absolutely clear. And you're right to talk about the wider region here. What will be interesting is where the interest is from the United States. Just this morning, in the last 40 minutes, Donald Trump, the president-elect, soon to take over on January the 20th, has said very categorically on his Truth Social side, the U.S. has no interest in Syria. This is not our war. He has also said that the Russians have no interest in Syria. You are right to point out that is no interest in Assad, of course. You have very adroitly pointed out why the Russians have an interest in Syria, but very specifically, not in this regime. But I just want to just close very briefly with a comment from you on this U.S. perspective at this point. The Biden administration says simply it is watching what is going on. AL-ORAIBI:  There are hundreds of American troops still inside Syria. Will they be withdrawn tomorrow? I don't think so. They will want to keep eyes there. There is still Al Hol Camp, which has tens of thousands of ISIS family members there. There are ample examples of why Syria is hugely important. There were reports, not yet confirmed, that there were Israeli tanks in Quneitra, in Syria. The U.S. position from Trump, and he is still not president, still president-elect, is that we don't want -- we're not going to come in and solve this, we're not going to come and try to determine what happens. But the Biden administration is still in play, and I think that what is clear that Americans will want to make sure there are no extremist elements, but will also want to maintain serious and territorial integrity, which is a key issue for the Gulf states also, not to allow extremists, serious territorial integrity. But also the U.S. has had a very bad track record in the region. Will this be a moment where they have a little bit more of a positive track record, and that may mean that they just stay out of it?",

What happens in Syria doesn't stay in Syria. This is a regime, that for over 50 years under the mantra of freedom, unity, and socialism, oppressed, tortured, and disappeared many, millions in Syria, half a million that are estimated to have lost their lives since the uprising against Bashar al-Assad in 2011, but also next door in Lebanon, where the regime occupied Lebanon for many years, for hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in that country, sometimes in the name of defending Palestine.But there's no doubt that this is a joyous moment for many at a human level. It's a moment of opportunity, but it's also a moment of potential peril because many Syrians don't know what comes next. And particularly for minority communities, Alawites, Afshut of Shia Islam, Ismailis, Druze and Christians, there are concerns about the more Islamist, Jihadi elements of this rebel force, particularly Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, HTS, which is the designated terrorist group by the United States and many of the outside countries.",

And I expect that we will face something of the sorts, the Syria that used to exist in the 60s and prior, where it was very much an arena for regional competition.These rebel forces are predominantly supported by Turkey, and so Turkey will no doubt emerge as a big winner in all this. But the most direct impact is going to be felt in Lebanon, where Hezbollah depends on Syria for strategic depth, but it's also its lifeline of support from Iran, the arms that come through to Lebanon, and that sustain Hezbollah's hegemony over the country. Having just suffered a severe blow after a major war with Israel, this is a significant yet another blow for Hezbollah. And then Israel, there are already news of the Israeli military mobilizing along the border with Syria, perhaps wanting to go further and create some kind of a buffer zone, communicating, sending messages out there to the rebel forces that they need not to approach that border and potentially destabilize it further. My understanding from sources on the ground is that the rebels have already designated special regiments to control the borders, both with Lebanon, because of Hezbollah smuggling there, but also with Israel, their focus is going to be consolidating power over the coming days and weeks, rather than wanting to instigate any trouble with the neighbors, be it Lebanon, Israel or Iraq.",

I think they genuinely want a stable Syria and hugely important to be able to return some of those 3 million Syrians back to Syria. A key reason that had President Erdogan reached out and accept the outreach from the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, it was because they wanted the Syrian refugees to go back. They were in dire economic conditions, many of them were. And so to be able to create that, you know, safe zone for them to be able to go back, well, now perhaps it could happen. So, that's also a very important imperative domestically because during those elections, those presidential elections that President Erdogan won, this became a very contentious topic. And when people said that, you know, Turkey is going through its own economic woes, we need people to go back, that will be important. But the miscalculation of Bashar al-Assad, exactly as you said, Becky, rightly said, of not seizing that opportunity, because for many people, they thought that's when it was really over for the Syrian opposition, because Bashar al- Assad was being more and more accepted. Italy just opened a diplomatic mission a few weeks ago in Syria, and everything's changed now.",

      "sentences": "Well, let's get you back to our breaking news in Syria, where 50 years of authoritarian rule by the Assad family has crumbled in the face of a lightning fast rebel offensive.I've got Mina Al-Oraibi, the editor-in-chief of the National, a global news organization based in Abu Dhabi, here with me. This is a remarkable time, it has to be said, for the region. You are, in the break, reminding me that you know, there have been remarkable times over the last 25 years. You're an Iraqi, for example. You know what it feels like to feel as if we're at a pivotal point in this region, only to be so sorely disappointed. And you can talk to anybody around this region, Iraqi, Iranian, Syrian, Lebanese, who will say the same thing. Let's talk about how, what is going on in Syria at present has such an influence though around the region. Let's start, you know, in Tehran. I want to take on Tehran and Baghdad, Iran and Iraq at this point. There's many people doing the rounds at the moment, I've seen this on social, suggesting that, you know, this is a sort of fall of the Berlin Wall moment for Iran's influence, what's known as its malign influence around this wider sort of Middle East region, the fall of these proxies, the decapitation of both Hezbollah and Hamas, if you buy into that. How significantly, you know, hurt is Iran's influence? And why does that matter so much for this region? AL-ORAIBI:  Iranian officials used to boast that they now control Damascus, Baghdad, Beirut, and Sana'a, four Arab capitals, and definitely not the case anymore in Damascus and Beirut. And I would say many Iraqis in Baghdad, and even those in government, used to resent that sort of statement because, you know, Iraq remains a sovereign country. And Yemen, surely, yes, the Houthis control Sana'a, but they're not really ruling for all Yemenis, and actually the internationally recognized government is sitting in Aden. So, that's on the one hand. The next moment, as you said, it's like the fall of the Berlin Wall. I think we had a beginning of that with the killing of Hassan Nasrallah and a change of what it meant, but also the fact that Ismail Haniyeh, head of Hamas, was assassinated in Tehran, you know, that chipping off of Iran seeming almost invincible happening in its own capital. Again, this is only happened a few months ago. So, definitely the aura of Iran being invincible and also calling the shots in several Arab capitals and countries, that moment has ended. But what comes next? And, again, I think it's really important to say, no one is saying that Iran isn't an important player or an important country in the region, or, God forbid, anyone would want to see conflict, you know, inside of Iran. [03:07] But it's more this idea of it is not normal to have Sovereign countries unable to call the shots on war and peace in their own countries. You know, ultimately, what is a nation state? Number one is providing for its people. Number two is having a monopoly over the control of arms. And that was taken away from certain countries. Tehran today will be making many calculations, but one of them is how they will be able to reconfigure their role in the region. It's not just being a sponsor of either no- state actors or regimes like those of Bashar al-Assad",

Why is that significant?AL-ORAIBI:  There were questions about whether Bashar al-Assad and his family would come to the UAE. Now, we have to remember, there has been tradition, really, in Saudi Arabia and sometimes in the UAE, where former dictators will leave, and it spares the country from more unrest and killing. And so, Dr. Anwar Gargash was responding to a question about that. And he said, where Bashar-Assad ends up will be a footnote in history, and I think that's actually true. Many people care about it. Syrians care about it. But the reality is the regime, as it was, is over. And actually, what's really interesting, a week ago, nobody knew, I don't think most people knew, the name of the Syrian prime minister.
