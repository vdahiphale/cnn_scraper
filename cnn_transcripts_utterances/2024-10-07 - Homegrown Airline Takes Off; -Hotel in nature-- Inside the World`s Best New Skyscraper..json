(On camera): Yeah, there are many families that are in critical need of that power because without the power, they have no air; without the air, a lot of the food is going to spoil. And on top of that, we talked to families who are barely making it by. And they are wondering where they can get their next meal. We saw a lot of free food giveaways in these affected areas.

But China is looking to change that with its C919 airliner, a potential rival to the Western companies. Beijing debuted its C919 airliner outside of Chinese territory by staging a flyby at the Singapore Air Show in 2023, flying only within China since then. The aircraft is a prominent symbol of Beijing`s made in China strategy, aiming to reduce reliance on foreign manufacturers. CNN`s Steven Jiang took his first trip on the aircraft. Take a look.

Well, today my excitement has nothing to do with the destination. I`m actually flying to Shanghai, basically China`s busiest air shuttle route. But today I got up bright and early for the 7:30 am departure for this guy. This is the C919, China`s first homegrown mainline passenger jet. It`s China`s answer to a very exclusive club, one dominated by Europe`s Airbus and Boeing from the U.S. The Boeing 737 and the Airbus A320 are two of the world`s best-selling aircraft types. In contrast, the C919 first flew just last May and has yet to be certified by American and European regulators. But there is potential space in the market, especially as Boeing is dealing with ongoing strikes and has been facing huge losses of billions of dollars in the last couple of years. Here`s the moment the truth. I`m about to board the C919.",

      "sentences": "OK. Final takeaway. Very few people choose their flights based on aircraft types, saving us aviation geeks. I think most people on the C919flight just took had no idea what kind of plane it`ll be on until after they bought it. Some of them did take photos after arriving Shanghai because obviously there was national pride involved, but also it`s still very rare to be able to ride the C919 because there are only a handful of these planes flying strictly within mainland China. The plane I was on is Air China`s first and only C919, they`ve got just last month in August, 2024. So it still have that very special feeling now to measure the new plane smell. Now, the fact passengers like myself, didn`t notice much difference between flying the C919 and the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 is probably a good thing. That means the plane has met our expectations when it comes to safety and comfort. Now, of course, the state-owned COMAC, which manufactures C919 and the Chinese government have much bigger ambitions. But as many people have pointed out, their priority right now should be proving the C919`s reliability to carriers and passengers alike. And the focus should be churning out more workforces, not just show horses. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
