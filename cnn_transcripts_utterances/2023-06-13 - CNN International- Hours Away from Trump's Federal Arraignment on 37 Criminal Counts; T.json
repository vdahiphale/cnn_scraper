They resigned in part because Trump was pursuing adding another attorney to the team and they've been the top attorneys who were litigating this. So he is down two attorneys who are handling the documents case.Still searching for someone else. It's not clear right now that this will be resolved before he actually has that arraignment. That's not really seen as a big deal from the people that I've spoken with. Todd Blanche who is the other attorney that he added to his team just back in April only about two months ago, is going to be one of the people that you do see go into court with the former president. It remains to be seen who he adds ultimately to the legal team though. Obviously, you can see, you know, when two people depart the team who've been working on this case, it's been difficult for Trump to find attorneys in the past. We may not even see him going into the courthouse. We believe there will be some courtroom sketches. But it's not going to be we believe photos or anything like we saw last time. Where photographers were briefly allowed in. That's when you saw those historic photos of Trump of course in the courtroom. We're not expecting that to happen. So really the question is not among his team, what happens. Obviously, he'll plead not guilty. It's what happens next. Because that's when the next date will be set. That's when he could potentially be in front of Judge Cannon, the Trump appointed judge. I should note, who was appointed by Trump in just the days after he lost the 2020 election. That is what really, Trump's legal team and those around him will be looking at. It's obvious they're going to have that historic moment, as you noted, pleading not guilty for the second time in just a matter of months. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
