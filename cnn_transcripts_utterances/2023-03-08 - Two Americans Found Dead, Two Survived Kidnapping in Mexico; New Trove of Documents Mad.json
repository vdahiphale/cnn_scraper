And he made that pitch when President Biden visited Kyiv not that long ago.He made that pitch, the Ukrainians, they need the fighter jets, they need longer range missiles.

It gave them hope that this thing could be -- that their victory could be achieved.And he was very, very, very, very tough on the Russians, saying they don't care how many dead Russian soldiers there are.
