I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi for you.Well, Iran's unprecedented drone and missile attacks on Israel appear to have subsided, that is according to U.S. officials. This though is what it all looked like a few hours ago. The IDF says more than 3,000 -- 300 missiles and drones were fired on Israel overnight, and that 99 percent were intercepted. That's 300 missiles fired on Israel overnight, 99 percent intercepted. The attack lasted approximately five hours. Israel says, a seven-year-old girl was injured by a shrapnel from an interceptor missile. But there are no injuries directly from the attacks. Tehran says, the attack was in response to an Israeli strike on Iran's embassy in Damascus earlier this month, and that the matter can be regarded as, \"Concluded\". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken on the phone with U.S. President Joe Biden. He told Mr. Netanyahu, the attacks were largely unsuccessful which was a win, he said, for Israel. CNN's MJ Lee has learned the president told Mr. Netanyahu, the U.S. will not take part in any offensive operation action against Iran. Meanwhile, Mr. Netanyahu reacted on social media saying, \"We have intercepted, we have contained, we shall win.\" But in Iran -- (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That they have been involved in intercepting those.And in Jordan, as we heard, that there were intercepts over the skies in Amman, Jordan. There's a very sizable Palestinian population in Jordan who are absolutely incandescent about the way Israel is treating the people of Gaza, more than 33,000 killed, and will not want Jordan to get in the habit of supporting Israel militarily. So, if the conflict goes on between Israel and Iran, then tensions between leadership and public, particularly in Jordan, could grow, and that could be very uncomfortable. Of course, the risk of Israel targeting something directly back in Iran that it hasn't done so far in this conflict of that escalating Iran further is very possible because Iran says, if they are struck, then they will strike back with more force.

Ultimately, that is not going to lead to de- escalation. In fact, it has led to the very situation that we're faced with today.

And as a result, it will be a de-escalation in the region. That is what the line is that the Iranians most likely are going to put forward. If, however, the Israelis escalate further, then I think it's going to be very difficult for the Iranians internally to be able to say that their attack was successful, because it would have led to a war that the Iranian people absolutely do not want.

One in five barrels of oil goes through the Strait of Hormuz each and every day.
