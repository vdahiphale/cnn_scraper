Four percent -- that's pretty good in comparison to the U.S., but's the fastest pace in Japan since 1981. On Wall Street, stock index futures are barely mixed right now. The Dow and the S&amp;P fell for the third day in a row yesterday. Investors still worried about corporate earnings and more Fed rate hikes, even as inflation eases. And news of more tech layoffs. The Wall Street Journal reporting this morning Google's parent company Alphabet will slash 12,000 jobs -- the company's largest-ever round of layoffs. So you've heard these layoffs in the headlines, but let's look more widely here. Jobless claims -- this is first-time filings for unemployment benefits -- fell, lower than expected -- 190,000. The labor market, overall, remains tight outside of tech and media. Mortgage rates fell to levels not seen since last September. The 30- year fixed-rate mortgage fell for the third week in a row, now at 6.15 percent. And on inflation watch, gas prices up one penny overnight, now at $3.39 a gallon. All right.

But at the peak of this trend that you mentioned, over 70 percent of new job postings quote-unquote require a bachelor's degree. So that math just doesn't work. It's tens of millions of workers off.

If what you want is somebody who is great at sales, why don't you have them make a pitch? These days you can do that online. You don't have to bring them in. So, in other words, you can use technology to supplement human judgment but you've got to start with your own judgment. What is it you're really looking for? And when we have that discussion with company leaders they find very quickly that there's actually very few skills that they might be looking for that they couldn't find both from a college graduate or from a star.
