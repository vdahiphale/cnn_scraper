We did hear a lengthy rant about Nikki Haley, though, it was actually particularly long, calling her a globalist, saying she was too weak to be president, and reliving that Chris Christie hot mic moment. That is something that Donald Trump has said over and over again, is the only thing he agrees with Chris Christie on is the fact that Haley is going to get beaten in this race. Obviously, that was something that was caught again on a hot mic when Christie was dropping out of the race.Now, as for Donald Trump's team, they are waiting to see what happens in the Des Moines Register poll tonight. They had been looking at internal numbers where they had seen a rise from Nikki Haley. Now, of course, they still say that Donald Trump is going to win. They say he's still leading by a big margin.

If the Senate convicted a president of a high crime and misdemeanor and removed him. On the other hand, you shouldn't be able to prosecute a president because we don't want -- we don't want political involvement in the legal system.

The attacks countered the Houthi's ability. You've talked to others today that there were 100 precision weapons, hit 60 targets in 16 locations. I think we saw the additional strike this morning against the radar system, which appeared to have survived the first strike. So this is all as a result of bomb damage assessment, analysis by the Intel community saying, what did we hit? What did we miss?
