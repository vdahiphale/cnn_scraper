And clearly, he is having a very difficult time processing that. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: She's been there for three and a half years.

That was a 31 percent jump from the June showdown between Trump and President Biden, which drew about 51 million viewers. That is a lot of people who saw Harris continually bait Trump into going off-message. Starting today, the vice president is trying to keep North Carolina in play with a stop there.

DAVID FRUM, STAFF WRITER, \"THE ATLANTIC\": I think two things are driving this rise. First is, in every democracy, we can see that incumbent governments have been damaged by the inflation of '21-'22. The -- Biden/Harris. The conservative government in Britain just lost a big election. Justin Trudeau in Canada. Very different politics. His numbers are terrible. Everywhere you go, if you were there in '21 and '22, voters are mad at you. Because prices went up a lot, and they went up faster than wages did. And we can offer all kinds of explanations. Well, the economy was coming back to life after COVID. What did you expect? They -- not this. I didn't expect this. That's issue one. And then issue two, I think, as -- as Isaac just said, the immigration issue. I wrote in January of '21, when President Biden relaxed many of the Trump border controls, this was going to be the most important mistake of his presidency; that it was just -- that numbers had surged during the early part of the Trump presidency. They put some measures in place in the later part, and then came COVID. And America got a little holiday from this mass border crossing where people abuse the asylum laws. And President Biden, for his own political reasons, decided to undo a lot of those restraints and got the influx that was predictable in January '21. And people don't like that either. So, those are the two big things that override genuine strength of the American economy in 2024. And of course, the threat to American democratic institutions posed by former President Trump.",
