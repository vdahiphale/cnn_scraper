Thousands of mourners are in the streets of Tehran for the funeral of President Ebrahim Raisi, we'll be in the Iranian capital in just a moment. Also, we've got exclusive access to a Ukrainian town that's become a last stronghold for the Russia's forces and Ukraine's second city of Kharkiv. Now, let's begin with a landmark announcement. It comes from Spain, Norway and Ireland. Now, those countries will recognize a Palestinian state. The three plan to formally make the recognition of statehood next week. Israel has already responded angrily to the decision. It's recalled its ambassadors from all three countries. At the same time, the leaders of the three nations say the move represents an important step towards peace. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PEDRO SANCHEZ, PRIME MINISTER, SPAIN (through translator): Next Tuesday on the 28th of May, Spain will approve its council of ministers, the recognition of the state of Palestine. JONAS GAHR STOERE, PRIME MINISTER, NORWAY (through translator): This is an investment and the only solution that can bring lasting peace in the Middle East.

And I think that's why you're seeing these countries in Europe come out today. Is that there is a growing impatience with Israel that work towards a two- state solution has all but stalled. You've heard Prime Minister Netanyahu outright reject a Palestinian state as a threat to Israeli security. And so, I think what the president and his national security adviser are trying to do is maintain an openness to a Palestinian state, a two-state solution. And President Biden has talked about that frequently, including just over the weekend when he called it one of the most complicated issues in history.

Today, it's just two of about a dozen different issues that the judge is going to have to work through. There's no trial date on the calendar until she starts resolving some of this backlog. But this apparently very intense part of the hearing this morning, where there was apparently shouting between the lawyers, that's about some historical bad blood between the defense lawyer for Trump's co-defendant, Walt Nauta, and a prosecutor on the case from the national security section of the Justice Department. It seemed to be quite a sidebar for what is really at issue here, but it all goes to the bigger point that the defense team was trying to make in court today to the judge that they believe the prosecutors have acted out of line, that they have selectively and vindictively brought charges against this co-defendant, Walt Nauta, to try and get him to cooperate against Donald Trump.",

There are many hearings she hasn't even scheduled yet. Not all judges would do it that way. So, she is doing it differently.
