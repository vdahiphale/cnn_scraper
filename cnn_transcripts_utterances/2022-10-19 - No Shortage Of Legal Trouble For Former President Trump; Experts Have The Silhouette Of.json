They are talking about these issues. But what I do think all of this does, and frankly I think it is baked into both sides of whether you're a Trump supporter, none of this is going to matter. But where I do think it matters is there were several polls in the last month that said threats to democracy were a priority issue for these voters. So, the more that Trump is in the headlines, the more that we see he's being deposed, the more that we see a judge talking about how he knew this was fraud. We all know he knew it was fraud. But the fact that a judge says it is going to bring to mind and have top of mind for all of these voters, how they kicked him out in 2020, and they don't want that kind of chaos.
