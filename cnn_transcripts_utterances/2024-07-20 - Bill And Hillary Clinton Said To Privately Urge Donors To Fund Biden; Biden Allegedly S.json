      "sentences": "You are in the CNN NEWSROOM. Hi, everyone. I'm Jessica Dean in New York.And we begin tonight with President Biden defiant as ever and facing new calls from Democratic leaders, donors, even former national security officials to suspend his campaign. Tonight, the president is recovering from COVID-19 in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. His doctor says tonight in a new letter that Biden's symptoms are steadily improving. What's not improving right now is the Democratic Party's confidence in Biden to beat Donald Trump in November. The list has now grown to 35 Democratic lawmakers publicly calling on Biden to drop out of the race. Let's go straight to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, who's with the president in Delaware. And Priscilla, you have new details tonight about Democratic efforts to keep the donations flowing to the Biden campaign. What can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yes. And high- profile Democrats at that. Former president Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have privately urged donors to continue to provide funds to the Biden campaign as long as President Biden is the presumptive Democratic nominee with one source describing it as, quote, \"deferential to the process.\"In other words, as long as the president is the candidate and presumptive nominee, donors should continue to back the president. This is an area where the campaign has recently faced some headwinds as big-dollar donors have held back their checks. He has of the questions that have been swirling around the president's candidacy and his viability as the Democratic candidate. Now I should note that Vice President Kamala Harris did have a fundraiser today in Massachusetts where they raked in over $2 million. That was bit of a bright spot in this moment as donors, too, have been calling privately for the president to step aside. But the campaign has maintained over the course of the last 24 hours and on the airwaves and in statements that the president is staying in the race. They remain defiant on that front, despite acknowledging that there has been some erosion of support and that it has been difficult few weeks. But their argument, too, is that in many ways voters' views are already hardened, even if it is about the president being older, they still think that voters view the president as the best candidate to go up against former president Donald Trump. Now for the president himself, he has been in isolation here at his residence in Delaware, where sources say he has been deliberating and he has been among some of his closest advisers. Now, of course, some officials have told CNN that this entire situation has become wholly untenable as there has been Democratic lawmaker after Democratic lawmaker calling for the president to drop out of the race. But some of his most loyal aides say that the president is dug in. So there has been sort of quickly the developing story here as Democratic lawmakers continue to put out their letters. I also obtained a letter from former national security officials and foreign policy experts that while commending the president on his foreign policy chops, also made the point that they just can't risk former president Donald Trump winning a second term. So they too are calling for the president to step aside in hopes of perhaps a stronger Democratic candidate. So all of this piling on in a moment where the president can't be out front the way that lawmakers and allies have hoped that he would be. Instead having to stay in isolation as he recovers from COVID-19 -- Jessica.",

      "sentences": "You know, Jessica, this is the biggest fundraiser of the year for Democrats in this crucial battleground state. The Biden campaign, of course, has already invested heavily in North Carolina in both staffing and financially. This, though, is about those down-ballot races. It has long been dubbed the unity dinner. And of course, tonight's event comes as the top of the ticket is anything but.The former speaker headlining the event is expected to talk about trying to bring the party together to beat Republicans up and down the ballot. But it's going to be whether or not she says something about the top of the ticket, the uncertainty there that many people are looking for. Again, clear focus on down-ballot. That's what they're here raising money for and they have big names and deep pockets in the room. But they also want to talk about those races that could be impacted by that uncertainty at the top, like the governor's race, the most closely watched in the entire nation between the Democratic attorney general, Josh Stein, who is speaking tonight and the Trump aligned lieutenant governor Mark Robinson, the Republican. Look, they believe, the Biden campaign has told us for months now, that they think that they can flip North Carolina blue. North Carolina was the slimmest victory for Donald Trump in 2020, winning by just over a point back then. And so they think they have those numbers, but that uncertainty, those rumors that are swirling around and with the former speaker here tonight, many of them are going to be waiting to see if she is going to say anything else beyond that wave-making interview last week where she said, quote, \"It's up to the president to decide if he's going to run. We are all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short.\" Now, she is scheduled to speak to close out the event just after 8:30 tonight, but I have already seen her out here taking pictures with donors and candidates, and elected officials speaking with many of them. There was a very loud and raucous sort of pep rally ahead of this in a private room with some of their VIPs and their top donors. And one more thing, Jessica, also speaking tonight, North Carolina's Democratic and term limited Governor Roy Cooper. His name in recent days, of course, being thrown around by prominent Democrats and pundits as a possible running mates for Vice President Kamala Harris if President Biden were to step aside and she were to become the Democratic nominee.",

Vance introduced him, they hugged on stage, they shook hands, actually, I'm just going to turn around, I was curious if J.D. Vance is going to come back out, but he has not done that.It's been interesting to watch them together but still we don't really have an idea of what their ticket looks like.

Congressman, thanks so much for making time on a Saturday night. We appreciate it. Yesterday you called on the president to withdraw his candidacy and yet today as it stands Biden is still adamant publicly he is staying in this race. Do you think there's anything to change his mind here? REP. GREG LANDSMAN (D-OH): No, I'm not sure what they're working through, although I do have faith that President Biden who's always done what's right by the country, he knows the stakes here in terms of our democracy, in terms of freedom, and what tens of millions women and girls are dealing with now that reproductive freedom has been taken away from them. He understands the stakes as it relates to the economy and what most working people are dealing with. So I think he'll make the right decision. It's hard and it's for those of us who are watching this, you know, it's sad. But the country needs somebody new. The vast majority of people in my district, and it's a 50-50 district, an equal number of Democrats, independents, and Republicans. They mostly want someone new and the Republicans have nominated Trump, and some folks like him, but majority of folks don't and they want somebody different.

So I do appreciate it and understand it, and there are a lot of folks in my district who were worried about what a change would look like.And that's an uncertainty that is very real, but I -- what happens if Biden decides to release the delegates is that, you know, we get someone new and those delegates get released. And if it is the vice president, someone who can excite young people, the entire Democratic base, and I think appeal to those folks who are in the middle and can prosecute this case against Donald Trump, she's a former prosecutor, so she'll do well, I think she will win. And others do, too. And that's all we want not for the Democratic Party, but because we care so deeply about our democracy.

And Steve wrote that including six former Trump Cabinet secretaries, four people he nominated as ambassadors, one of them is former ICE Chief Tom Homan, who Trump keeps saying as recently as this week, he plans to give another prominent role in a next Trump administration. And that's not all, Steve also found that dozens of additional former Trump officials hold positions with other outside conservative groups that are advising Project 2025.

You know, just a month ago, Trump was facing -- he had just been convicted. He was facing sentencing. He was facing dozens of felony counts. He was considered to be in very deep legal trouble.

I mean, if you briefly, and that's really the overview and it's unfortunate in as much as the law should be about just that, the law. There shouldn't be a political dynamic, but we are in different times and it appears as though the decisions, and again, is not -- that there's not legal authority supporting what the Supreme Court did, but I don't think that anyone could have imagined and no legal analyst really spoke about or envision the extent to which in that immunity decision they would protect the president. And so, when you look at all the four cases that are against the president, I think all of them are in jeopardy, including the New York case, by the way, in which he's been convicted and in which of course he's pending sentence. But of course, the attorneys are asking for that case to be thrown out and that may end up in the Supreme Court after it winds its way through the court system.

You're going to have an ideology that certainly favors you as it relates to even the overturning of Roe v. Wade, of course, dealing with abortion, and then of course, coming down to your own personal protection concerning immunity. Wow. The fact that you had a Supreme Court, not only indicate that you have presidential immunity, but even say that there's certain evidence that can't be considered including the president's state of mind. You can't consider state of mind in prosecuting a defendant in a case and then you exclude evidence with regard to high-level officials who the president has spoken to. And so yes, this is of course Trump's decisions in terms of who he appoints coming to -- nor to his benefit including of course, who we are talking about, that is Aileen Cannon, who's presiding over the classified documents case wholesalely dismissing the case on grounds that this should not have been -- it should have not been in the special counsel who have moved forward because they have no authority to do so, according to her.
