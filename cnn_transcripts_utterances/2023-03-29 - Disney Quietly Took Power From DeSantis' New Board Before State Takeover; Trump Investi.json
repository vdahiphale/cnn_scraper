You'll remember to Florida -- that Florida law that prohibits instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity through third grade and only in an age appropriate manner in older grades. That was the law that critics dubbed \"don't say gay.\" DeSantis retaliated, you'll remember, by going after Disney's special tax status around its sprawling Orlando area theme parks.Okay, so, we have a lot to discuss with my panel. Jay Michaelson is here. He's a Rolling Stone writer/rabbi. We have Elie Honig. He is our CNN senior legal eagle. He's going to explain everything tonight.

Basically, the state of Florida has allowed them to run their own shop, to make their own rules, and get special little tax breaks. Okay, along comes this law that sometimes called the \"don't say gay law.\" Disney opposes this. Ron DeSantis, in his sort of typical Ron DeSantis fashion, sees a moment of political opportunity. He says, oh, good, I can go after Disney because they don't like this law. And so, he says, I'm going to take away your special privileges, Disney. I'm going to take back control of you like any other company for the state.And so, the way that they execute that is DeSantis is given the power to name this board, there's a special board that governs Disney, and to put all his own people on the board. But before DeSantis's people could take power, the old board entered into an agreement with Disney, which basically said, you can continue running yourself forever before we leave office. So, it's like a lame duck Congress sort of passing a bill in its final days saying we're going to preserve the status quo forever and now we're going to have a legal battle about whether that agreement is good.",

And so, it could be. I'll give you some of the why. Everyone is saying why, why, why, why is it taking so long. It could be he just wants to think about it. It could be he's just not sure. It could be he is waiting for more witness testimony. It could be he wants to bolster his case. It could be he wants to minimize the amount of time between an indictment and actual in-court appearance.
