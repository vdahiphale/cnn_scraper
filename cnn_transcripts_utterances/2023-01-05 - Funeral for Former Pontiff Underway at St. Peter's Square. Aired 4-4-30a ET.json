The response is let us pray to the Lord. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): We pray in German. The Pope Emeritus Benedict who has fallen asleep in the Lord, may the eternal shepherd receive him into his kingdom of light and peace. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We pray in French. For our holy father Pope Francis and for all the pastors of the church, may they proclaim fearlessly in word and deed Christ's victory over evil and death. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): We pray in Arabic. For our leaders of nations and international organizations, may they strive to promote justice and peace with wisdom and foresight. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We pray in Portuguese. For our brothers and sisters in need, may God's love open our hearts to compassion and concern for the poor and for the least of our brothers and sisters. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): And we pray in Italian. For us gathered to celebrate the defeat of death by the triumph of the Lord Jesus, may it be for us a leaven of hope as we await the coming of the kingdom. POPE FRANCS (through translator): God, our father, lover of life, hear the prayers we raise to you with faith in the risen Lord for Pope Emeritus Benedict and for the needs of the church and of our world. Grant us shared worship with you in the heavenly Jerusalem where sorrow and tears will be no more through Christ our Lord.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, this is the always way with masses from the Vatican because, of course, it's a recognition these masses are broadcast throughout the world and that Catholics are from different countries throughout the world. So, there are always prayers and readings in different languages.In the homily when Pope Francis spoke just a few moments ago, you'll notice the homily has some real rules to it. It needs to refer to the scriptures, to the readings that were given at mass. So, that's why we didn't hear him necessarily giving an eulogy for Pope Benedict. It was a reflection on the scriptures but in homage to Pope Benedict it was taken, there were excerpts from some of Pope Benedict's own reflections on some of the scriptural readings. Of course, for Pope Benedict, the liturgy, the mass was a central part of his work and of Catholicism. He was very devoted to it. And so, it strikes me that this mass today we have, yes, a Pope who is very conservative being buried, a Pope who is more progressive in Pope Francis, but it really does represent the Catholic Church under this one umbrella. That's what it's all about. You can have the conservative and the progressive sides, but they stay unified. They stay together. That's what's been happening throughout the decades. A kind of the pontificate here from the Vatican trying to keep all of those elements under the same umbrella. And surely now with Pope Benedict's death, that will also be foremost in Pope Francis's mind going forward -- Bianca.",

Pope Francis called him -- I thought it was very beautiful -- faithful friend of the bridegroom. Which may sound a little strange. What that means is Jesus Christ typically is seen as the groom for the church and so he's saying that Francis was a friend of Jesus for his whole life.And we have this person who spent his entire life in service to the church as a priest, as a theologian. He was very active in the Second Vatican Council and then certainly working in the Vatican, in the congregation for the doctrine of the faith, as Pope and Pope Emeritus. So, I'm just thinking of just a long life that he led. And you look out and you see all of the Cardinals and people that knew him and just the impact he had for decades on the Catholic Church. So, it's a very profound moment for me and for so many Catholics.",

But obviously, it's not in St. Peter's Square. But the liturgy of the word, the liturgy of the Eucharist, the communion, the prayers, was called the final commendation. So, in death, you know, Benedict is like all of us, like all Catholics, like all Christians and the sacraments. This is a sacrament, the funeral mass, is something that unites us all. So, it's another sign of humility that this is the same kind of mass that all of us would have.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's a very good question. I think at times, you know, there were some people who sort of coalesced around Benedict. But Benedict always made it clear that there was one Pope. That Pope Francis was in charge. By the same token, Pope Francis was very sort of respectful towards Benedict. One of the things that Francis did regularly was that every time he creates new Cardinals, named new Cardinals, he would bring the Cardinals, to Pope Emeritus Benedict's house, his residence, to see him. He relied on him a lot for wisdom and council. He said it was like having a grandfather around. So, I think Pope Benedict was in a sense a great asset to the papacy even after he resigned.",
