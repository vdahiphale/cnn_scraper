The mayor said it's a miracle doctors were changing shifts when the attack happened. It means that fewer people were working at the time of the strike. Sirens could be heard over Kyiv.

In fact, in the early morning hours and overnight, we did hear sirens here in Kyiv, and we also have heard the air defenses here around Kyiv at work, as well. The strike on Dnipro happened a little bit later in the morning hours of this morning, and it hit that medical facility, which also has a veterinarian facility nearby, as well and some of the video that was coming out of that area in the early stages was just absolutely horrifying where injured people were trying to save themselves and get out of that building, people were helping them get out, a lot of people drenched in blood, essentially. And then, of course, you have that toll of 30 people who were injured, a lot of them still in hospital, some of them in quite critical condition, and two people who have been killed. Now, the latest that we have from the Ukrainians is they say that they believe that for the strike that hit that medical facility, that ballistic missiles were used on the part of the Russians, either S-300 or S-400 missiles. And just to put that into context for our viewers, those are missiles that are normally used to shoot down airplanes. However, they also have a mode where they can be used against ground targets in a surface-to- surface configuration. However, when you use them that way, they become extremely inaccurate. And of course, if you then use them to shoot into an urban area, the kind of things happen that happens today where this medical facility was hit. And you know, it was obviously pretty much completely destroyed, a big fire broke out, rescue crews are still on the scene looking to see whether there are further survivors or people still maybe still buried beneath the rubble there. So, a major strike, it's been condemned by Ukraine's President, by the First Lady of Ukraine, by countries internationally, as well. But of course, it is something that we've seen very frequently here in Ukraine, where we've had these massive missile strikes across the country that in some cases have also hit civilian facilities as well, Zain.",

But even though they are close to a deal, we know that there are sticking points, especially when it comes to work requirements. But also what concerns me is the timeline.

They could pass it by that June 1st deadline, but it's not probable. And let me walk you through why. First of all, the prospects of getting a deal today, very, very slim because they still are working through a number of issues. Now, they have made significant progress on issues like spending cuts. They are talking about a compromise deal that would exchange two years of spending cuts in exchange for lifting the debt ceiling for two years. They haven't finalized that, but that is a step forward that they're even talking about that and more so getting on the same page. But there are a number of other issues, big issues, that they have yet to resolve, particularly tougher work requirements for social safety net programs. That is something that Republicans have been pushing for. Democrats are completely dug in against it. In fact, there was a closed- door conference meeting yesterday with House Democrats where a number of lawmakers got up and said, you should not take our votes for granted and that our support might not be there even if Biden blesses a deal, if it has something in there like work requirements that we can't get behind. And it's important because you're going to need democratic votes to get something bipartisan across the finish line. There are already signs that Speaker Kevin McCarthy is likely going to lose a significant chunk on his far right because they don't think that the bill is conservative enough. And so, the clock is ticking. You mentioned the June 1st timeline. Well, there's a number of other procedural hoops. Even when they get a deal, they still have to write it into bill text. They have to get a official score, and then they need 72 hours to read the bill. And that's just to get it through the House. Then, of course, it has to go through the Senate, which is notoriously slow. So, clock is ticking, a lot of work to get done right now and not a lot of time to do it.",

Nearly 1.9 million ballots cast by Turks living abroad have arrived in Ankara. In the first round of voting on the 14th, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fell just short of the majority that he needed. He was a good five points ahead of his main rival, Kemal Kilicdaroglu. Earlier this week, third-place finisher Sinan Ogan threw his support behind President Erdogan, as was expected. Nada Bashir joins us live now from Istanbul. So, it does look likely at this point that President Erdogan will emerge victorious in all of this.

And as you most likely put, the strongest storm on the planet this year and the strongest tropical cyclone since 2021. So powerful that the eye has completely cleared out once again, and you can see the Pacific Ocean right through a cloud-free center of circulation. That is the strongest part of a typhoon or a hurricane. And where is it headed? Well, it's got a lot of open ocean to traverse before it even impacts parts of the Philippines or Taiwan, and that's a big if. Certainly, it'll influence the weather patterns, but will we get a direct hit? Not likely, and I'll show you why in just one moment. A hundred and sixty-five mile per hour winds, that makes it a category five Atlantic hurricane equivalent. Remember, you need 157 mile per hour winds to reach that Category 5 status. Now, here's the forecast. It does show a slightly weakening storm as it traverses the Western Pacific but notice this curve in the forecast. All of our computer models coming into consensus that it will veer away from Luzon, as well as Taiwan, but it's still going to impact this area with heavy rainfall because we have our southwest Monsoon and this helps influence that, helps bring back precipitation and the potential for flooding and gusty winds exists even as our computer models depict this steering away from Northern Philippines, as well as Taiwan.

Where it started to get into trouble was when the way that it reacted to the pressure. And so, this is really when I advise companies on how to do this, there are really three things. There's consistency, there's transparency, and there's the idea of not being too pushy as a company to push your ideas onto people. And Target has done a pretty good job, I think, of all three of those on the LGBTQ issue. It's just that when this other group started to come in and put pressure, they left their consistency I think behind a little bit and so they put themselves into trouble that maybe they didn't have to.",

It was developed by doctors at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and two of them just spoke with CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOCELYNE BLOCH, MD., PLACED IMPLANT THAT ENABLES PARALYZED MAN WALK AGAIN: He's the first, he's the test pilot but I'm sure it's going to work in other patients. So, it works because his brain is intact, and the part of the spinal cord that is controlling leg movement is also intact. So, we could put electrodes above the region of the brain that is controlling leg movement and above the region of the spinal cord that is controlling movements, and we could then link them. So, in all the patients who have these intact regions, we could apply the same technology.",
