Israeli officials say Hezbollah launched a drone attack on Sunday, killing at least four soldiers and wounding more than 60 people.The drones targeted an army base in Israel about 40 miles from the Lebanese border. The IDF says it will investigate why the attack didn't trigger an alarm. Hezbollah called it retaliation for Israeli strikes in Lebanon on Thursday. The U.S. announced Sunday it will send an advanced anti-missile system to Israel to help bolster the country's air defenses, along with about 100 U.S. troops to operate it. It comes as the aerospace commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps says his country is ready to respond to any action or quote \"misstep\" by Israel. CNN military analyst Cedric Leighton explains why this could be a risky move for the United States. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: What it does, it does, you know, it signify a presence in the Middle East and certainly an effort to protect Israel. It is a defensive effort on the part of the United States. However, if those troops are harmed in any way, that could then result in the U.S. being dragged into the war. And that could of course have significant consequences beyond what we would like to imagine at this point. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Yesterday this was the particular area where civilians had been sheltering their tents that was struck by an Israeli air strike. The Israeli military has acknowledged this. They say they were targeting Hamas militants operating in the area, once again accusing Hamas of using Palestinian civilian as human shields, but this is an area that was known to be and has long been known to be housing over 5,000 displaced civilians sheltering in these tents in around the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital area.

The deadlock extends to key battleground states, where even smaller percentages separate the nominees in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Both candidates will focus largely on the battleground states in the coming weeks. And Donald Trump is hoping his anti-immigration rhetoric will resonate with voters as he doubles down on his false narrative that the Biden- Harris administration has opened the floodgates to a wave of violent migrant criminals, while studies generally find no evidence that immigrants commit crimes at a higher rate than people born in the United States. Trump continues to make fear of outsiders a central theme of his campaign speeches.

The logistical planning and the movement of supplies, fuel, cash, everything had to be planned to the T.So a number of different things are being done. Better logistic pre- positioning of vaccines and cold chain equipment, finger markers, further training and redistribution of teams, how many in fixed sites, how many mobile teams, but more importantly, decentralized decision making so that each governorate will have its own emergency operation center so they can make decisions locally.
