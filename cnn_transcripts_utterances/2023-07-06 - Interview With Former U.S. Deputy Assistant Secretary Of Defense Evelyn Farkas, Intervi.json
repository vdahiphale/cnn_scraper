And we dig into the extraordinary raid on the St. Petersburg home of Wagner chief, Yevgeny Prigozhin. I'm joined by U.S. national security expert Evelyn Farkas. Then, the Taliban ramps up efforts to shut women out of the workplace by closing all beauty salons. I'll discuss with former Afghan diplomat Adela Raz. Also, ahead, the fight for democracy in Venezuela. Opposition leader Corina Machado speaks to the program as her campaign for the presidency is disqualified. Plus, amid fatal flooding and record-breaking temperatures, we get a health check on our planet. He is in St. Petersburg, or maybe this morning he will travel to Moscow, or elsewhere. He is not in the territory of Belarus now. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. President Zelenskyy is vowing a tangible response after a Russian strike on Ukraine's western city of Lviv. The attack on a residential building killed at least five people and injured dozens more. Meanwhile, Moscow is once again gazing inward (ph) after Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko revealed that Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin is still inside Russia. Now, that's in spite a deal that should have exiled him to Belarus after his failed rebellion. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXANDER LUKASHENKO, BELARUSIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  In terms of Yevgeny Prigozhin, he is in St. Petersburg, or maybe this morning he would travel to Moscow or elsewhere, which is not on the territory of Belarus now.

So, Ben, first let's talk about yet another indiscriminate attack in Western Ukraine in Lviv, it was the largest attack on a civilian infrastructure in that city since the start of the war. We know that Ukraine's air defenses struck down seven of the 10 missiles, but we see the damage from the three missiles that were not intercepted. What is the reaction there in the eastern part of the country where you are?",

Now, obviously, in the western part of the country, in Lviv, which is much farther away from the front lines, not accustomed to this sort of airstrike, they've had a few but nothing like this, the reaction is one of shock. Now, the rocket hit at about 2:30 a.m., when everybody was asleep. It was a caliber missile, that's a Russian missile that carries a 500-to-600- kilogram payload of high explosives. And as you can see from those pictures, it caused massive damage. At this point, the death toll is five people, among them a 95-year-old woman who survived the Second World War, almost 40 people injured. Now, what's come out in the aftermath of this strike is that perhaps because the city authorities had become accustomed to the relative quiet in Lviv, 10 bomb shelters had been locked shut. Now, the prosecutor is conducting an investigation to ask -- to find out why. Bianna.",

You'll continue to follow these stories for us. And for more on the latest out of the war, I am joined by Evelyn Farkas, the executive director of the McCain Institute, and she served as the deputy assistant secretary for defense for Russia and Ukraine under President Obama. Evelyn it's good to see you. So, let's talk about yet another indiscriminate strike against civilians and civilian infrastructure in Ukraine, this time in Lviv. Earlier last week we had talked about the tragedy in Kramatorsk there at a pizzeria. Do you think that there's any sort of strategic mission that the Russians are attempting with this increase in massive strikes against civilian areas in light of perhaps the NATO summit next week and obviously, everything that's happened with the failed mutiny by Yevgeny Prigozhin? EVELYN FARKAS, FORMER U.S. DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  Yes, Bianna. I think -- first of all, thanks for having me on. And I would say that this is a moment when the Russians are desperate for some kind of action that they can chalk up as a success. Of course, it's not a success if you target civilians and you kill them. But they are retaliating against Ukrainian successes inside -- so, first of all, inside Russia proper, and then also -- or inside, I should say, Ukraine where Russia's occupied Ukraine. So, the Ukrainians recently targeted one of the areas where the Russians have occupied successfully. In addition to that, the Ukrainians have been making some creeping progress forward. And then, of course, yes, at the strategic level, Vladimir Putin looks incredibly weak. He needs to show something that looks like a success again, not a success, but something that looks like results to his nationalist and to his people.",

Clearly, this was all choreographed today when we saw Belarusian leader, Alexander Lukashenko,address journalists and say that Yevgeny Prigozhin is not in fact in his country, but in St. Petersburg in Russia. There had been some questioning, perhaps that is where he had been all along. There had been some internet (INAUDIBLE) who thought that they had seen pictures that looked very similar to Yevgeny Prigozhin surrounded by bodyguards that he had used in the past. But that having been said, here you have an ally of Vladimir Putin's confirming -- again, it's hard to know who to believe here among these propagandists -- but confirming that Prigozhin is in Russia.

It's unclear, but what we are -- the reporting that we have from, again, our, you know, U.S. and international sources is that Prigozhin's Wagner troops, the ones that were in Ukraine, have gone back to Ukraine. His international organization is of a different nature, and that also needs to be managed. It remains to be seen who will manage it. I don't think he will have control over those men in Ukraine. And in fact, I think the Russian plan is probably to, essentially, as you said, make him more of a discredited figure, and in fact, I think they will try to smear him with, corruption, eventually take him into custody so that he's no longer challenge to the Russian president.

And it's great that we've now proved the F-16s, that will help, and we -- and maybe we're inching towards approving longer range artillery, the ATACMS, and there are already British variance of these longer range missiles on the battlefield. But all of these things are coming late. The F-16s won't be there until the fall, so he's correct. I mean, we are asking -- we are pressing the Ukrainians. And the Ukrainians have no choice, they have to fight. But every day they fight without the best equipment, without the most capable equipment, that is a day that they lose more soldiers.

Because Ukraine is ready from a military perspective, 100 percentready. It's the largest most NATO interoperable, most capable battle- hardened force on the European continent today. So, militarily, there is no question. And they have conducted a lot of defense reforms, I'm not worried about that. I think what the White House spokeswoman was talking about, what Karine Jean-Pierre was talking about was the democracy, progress, fighting corruption. But I will tell you, and you know this well because you know this region, every country that entered into NATO still had to fight corruption and still had work to do when it came to democratization. So, Ukraine is ready and Ukraine has shed its blood and Ukraine is now already fighting the largest existing potential threat to NATO anyway. So, I believe we should allow Ukraine into NATO and make some, you know, adjustments with regard to where the fighting is ongoing, because, of course, we don't want to be fighting against Russia. NATO doesn't want to, you know, come into an existing war. But there are ways to do this and I think Ukraine has earned it.",

She served as her country's last ambassador to the United States. Adela Raz, welcome to the program from Washington. I wish it was under better circumstances, but I think this is something we've become all too familiar with, just another edict against women in Afghanistan. And this is much more than just about nails and hair, this was one of the last areas in bastions for women to congregate, to socialize, to work. I was struck by what one Kabul female resident said about this move, and she said, \"Parks are not allowed for women. So, it was a good place for us to meet our friends. It was a good reason to see each other, to meet other women, other girls to talk about issues. Now, I don't know how to meet them, how to see them, how to talk to each other. I think it will be very impactful for us and women around Afghanistan. How are you coming to terms with this move? ADELA RAZ, FORMER AFGHAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S.:  I -- it's really sad to witness what's happening in Afghanistan. The start of the last two years, Taliban's takeover and then the restrictions that's arriving one after on the women of Afghanistan. And as women of Afghanistan had always said, and we had predicted, this would be the worst time of our lives. We had experienced it 20 years ago. 22 years ago when -- for the first time Taliban arrived and they took power, and it's happening again, and I completely echo those women in Afghanistan, and the one you had quoted, because for beauty salons it's not simply a space that's -- where some men may think it's not really important for women, but it's a space of social gathering, it's a space of women coming together. And it really was the last face left. The public parks are banned for a woman, the public baths are banned for women, women cannot work, women cannot study, they can't be outside. And this was really the only place that they could come together. In addition to the impact it's making in the lives of so many families, so many breadwinners in the household, it's already impacted about 60,000 jobs that woman -- these bloody salons had created. So, it really is like, what else will come? And I -- and then, I have to be very pragmatic, worse may come, worse even than what we are hearing and what we are seeing, because 22 years ago I lived in that country and I lived under the regime of the Taliban, and I knew what it means as a woman to live and where every single hope and dream is taken away from you.",

Could you argue that his power is even stronger now than it was just a few years ago?",

Venezuelan economy has shrunk by 75 percent, nearly 100 percent of the country is now living below the poverty line. You mentioned the 7 million who have fled the country given these conditions, and now living abroad. Inflation is at 429 percent. Why are we not seeing more people, more Venezuelans out in the street protesting against these horrific living conditions?",

Theviolation -- massive violations of human rights have been so severe that there is an investigation currently underway at the International Criminal Court. We have seen also, just hours ago, the United Nations, the High Commissioner for Human Rights stated a report that it's, you know, heartbreaking in terms of tortures, all kind of killings and persecution. So, this kind of, let's say, repression, using hunger. Because I have to say that over 9 million people are suffering starvation in Venezuela, and the regime has used the food stamps as a way to have social control. And all this is melting down in this last month. What mothers tell me around the country is that the regime cannot threaten them anymore with taking things away from them because they have lost the most valuable thing they could have, which is their children that have left. So, this whole feeling sentiment that we want our kids back home has brought our society very strongly together, and what we are fighting goes beyond a political struggle. This is a spiritual one, and that's why I'm absolutely certain that we will prevail.",

I know that you have long admired Margaret Thatcher as well. Before we get to your politics, just talk about your stamina and your strength and lack of fear in the face of confronting these dictators. You have taken on Hugo Chavez. You have taken on Nicolas Maduro to his face. What gives you the power and the strength to do that and not worry about the consequences?",

And my dream, and the reason I work and I wake up every morning is because I want my kids back, and I want our family together. And that's the same feeling that brings, as I said before, our country to fight at this time. And I'm certain that Venezuela has the potential to turn in this Graceland, to be the energy hub of the Americas and to be a country in which we can bring back those who have left and also, produce democracy, strong institutions and prosperity for all.

And experts are warning that record could be broken several more times this year. Joining me now to discuss is CNN's Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir. Bill, it is good to see you. As we just mentioned, this is the first of what could be several records broken in a relatively short period of time.

In Europe, Copernicus goes back to 1940, the warmest there. So, those two confirm each other.

And this is how it would happen. You set a new record, which we did on Monday, break it on Tuesday, we tied it yesterday. But it will be sort of like a whack-a-mole. To mix metaphors here, you watch a man walk a dog on a beach, and you want to see where he's going, watch the man, not the dog. And these daily temperature spikes are like the dog going erratically, whereas the trend over time. This last June was the warmest June ever recorded by far. And then, the last nine Junes since then are the next warmest, nine warmest.

It's sort of like you take a cold bath tub and heat it up one kettle at a time, it takes a long time, but a certain point, you're doing it. Well, our kettles went from five Hiroshima's per second, just a few years, ago to 10 per second right now. And a result -- and that's a result of this disappearing sea ice at both ends of the earth. Antarctica is missing enough sea ice that is about the size of India just in the last couple years.
