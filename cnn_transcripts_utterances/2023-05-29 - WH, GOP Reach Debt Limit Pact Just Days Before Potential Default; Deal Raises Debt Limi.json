Honoring their sacrifice, the president marking this Memorial Day with a stop at the tomb of the unknown soldier. And it was an address thanking troops who gave their last full measure of devotion to the country they serve.Plus, a dead deal if they can sell it. The text of Biden, McCarthy deal is now out. The president and the speaker must find a goldilocks road now to get it to the president's desk. And Chris Sununu says, he'll decide soon on a 2024 run with the field already overcrowded for everyone, not named Donald Trump. But up first for us, a salesmanship test for the president of the United States and the Republican House speaker. The pair is striking a deal to avoid going over the debt cliff, but now comes the hard part. Mr. Biden must convince Democrats he didn't give away too much. And Mr. McCarthy must convince Republicans he extracted just enough but deals taxes now public released late last night. And this morning, new optimism that the middle out strategy will get enough members on board to push the deal across the finish line. But there are already loud complaints too, progressives say the president opened up the door to draconian restrictions on work requirements. Heartland Republicans insist their speaker only got a tiny slice of what they want it. So, that's for all this. Let's get straight to CNN's Lauren Fox on Capitol Hill. So, Lauren, break down this deal for us and tell us what the path ahead is?",

      "sentences": "Well, Manu, this deal certainly cut between Biden and McCarthy in the middle of what both sides wanted. It raises the debt ceiling for two years through January 1, 2025. It also imposes new work requirements on social safety net programs, claws back some of that unspent COVID money about $28 billion. And we're rescind some of the money that was going to go to the IRS for more IRS agents. That's about $20 billion.But like you noted, this is when the sales game begins. You are already seeing furious efforts to whip this bill with Republicans trying to get votes from some of their members. Meanwhile, some conservatives are already arguing that this bill does not go far enough that the spending cuts are not significant enough. We're going to see the first test tomorrow in the rules committee. That is when we expect to see whether or not a number of conservatives who serve on that committee are going to support the rule or not. That will be the first test, then it goes to the floor of the House on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Democrats have their own work cut out for them. The White House is doing a series of detailed briefings today, trying to convince members, trying to help them understand why this is the best deal that the president could get after this passes, or if this passes out of the House of Representatives. Then it goes to the Senate and that is another fight entirely. This could push of course, up to that June 5 deadline. If any one Republican or Democratic senator decides to drag out this process.

And here with me in the room our panels, CNN's Jeff Zeleny, Marianna Sotomayor of The Washington Post and Tia Mitchell of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.So, you know, we have heard some opposition building on the right and the left. Probably the loudest opposition so far has been the conservatives. They have really taken to Twitter, some have gone on air and really railed against the justice. So, just some of them Ralph Norman Congressman says, it called an insanity, Chip Roy called it a turd sandwich, Dan Bishop called it Zippo, and Ken Buck called it a major win for Joe Biden. Now Ken Buck, he voted against this bill and the Republican bill that went much further back in April. The other three actually voted for that Republican bill. How do you see this conservative opposition playing out here in the days ahead? And how much of a risk is it for McCarthy?",

Well, McCarthy really needs is the majority of the majority. It was actually a promise, not necessarily written in stone.But during the speakership week that any bill that is brought to the floor needs to have a solid amount of Republican support. That means you can lose 111 Republicans, that's a pretty hefty amount and it gives a lot of these conservatives the space to say, I don't like this because of all of these different reasons. But then, when you get to the math, you obviously would need 107 Democrats. [12:05:00] The thing though of course with these Freedom Caucus members is, they obviously have the option to vacate McCarthy. So, sure, you could lose their votes, but they still want to be seen and heard. And that's a lot of the things that I know you and I will be watching this week.",

But look, this is what the risks that McCarthy took. And he's the one the speakership. He cut this deal to allow a single member to call for a vote to seek his ouster.And any member who was angry could do it. And then McCarthy would need 218 votes on the House floor. That means losing no more than four Republicans to maintain his speakership that has to be weighing on him. He says, he's not concerned about. He told reporters yesterday, I'm not concerned about losing my speakership over, but this is the first real test of Republican division in the speakership. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: Right. And so, the test to me is not just will they support the bill. But in the next few days as they watch how McCarthy whips votes, as they watch what happens in the rules committee, as they watch what happens as the bill heads to the floor. Will they start saying they're displeased with his leadership? We already have seen some conservative saying, they didn't think he did a good job in the negotiating room with President Biden. They think he didn't fight hard enough. I was speaking to Representative Andrew Clyde, who is one of those kinds of hardliners. And even on Thursday, as they were planning to recess, he was saying, I want Kevin McCarthy to keep fighting for our Republican bill, don't settle for anything less. So of course, they're disappointed. But are they at the point where they're ready to kind of, you know, execute this plan to remove McCarthy. We know that that's unlikely to happen. But they could toy with him a little bit and make it difficult, embarrassing. But right now, it's not clear if they're willing to go that part.",

And look, he won them over.Now they're going to be divided. This is what McCarthy tried to avoid. There are serious divisions, though, on the Democratic side, to me. The Republicans are upset that there were not enough concessions, the Democrats, they will listen to the White House, who said, we were going to concede on anything. We were going to just demand a clean debt ceiling increase. And here are a whole host of debt concessions that they made. And listen to Pramila Jayapal. She is the chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, someone who, unlike other progressives are not happy about allowing the concessions or what has made. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL, (D-WA): It is really unfortunate that the president opened the door to this.

He's missing from this equation. So, we'll see how the left actually fares on this. But some of them actually believed what the president was saying. And the White House was saying is, we're not going to negotiate on this. Well, the reality is that was never going to work. It's (crosstalk) not how things work here. The president obviously knew that, I mean, he was definitely trying to negotiate as he was saying, we're not going to negotiate. He thought that Republicans would fracture. That's what they thought all along that Republicans would not be able to say together. They did say together up until now, we'll see if they do over the next week or so.
