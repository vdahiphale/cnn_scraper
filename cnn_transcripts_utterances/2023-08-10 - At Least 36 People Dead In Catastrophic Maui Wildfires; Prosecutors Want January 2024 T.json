In Florida this morning, Trump and his body man Walt Nauta pleaded not guilty to additional charges in the Mar-a-Lago documents case. In Georgia, with a potential indictment on the way, Trump released an attack and -- attack ad that smears the Atlanta area district attorney investigating him for 2020 election interference. And then in Michigan today, nine Republicans were arraigned on felony state charges for signing on as fake electors in an effort to block Joe Biden's 2020 win in the state. And now, a total of 16 defendants have pleaded not guilty in that case. We have CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers here with us to talk a little bit about this.

So, there are some interesting defenses here.Obviously, the attorney general has thought long and hard about all of this before she charged. And she feels very good about the charges.

So, you want to kind of knock down the defenses of all of the defendants on trial, so they will have to kind of address both of those things. But where those things really fall down is even though it does appear that these electors in Michigan were lied to in the sense of these electors were told that their forms would be submitted if and only if litigation that was challenging the results succeeded, they still knew that they were forging documents.In other words, they knew that when they signed a piece of paper that says, I am a duly elected elector for Donald Trump. And these are the certified election results, that that was just factually untrue at the time that they signed it.

When we called -- when my team called and asked them, the U.N. Mission in New York said this is a result of humanitarian cooperation, also by a third-party government. Iran and the U.S. have agreed to reciprocally released and pardon five prisoners. And the transfer today, they said -- the Iranian said is a first step to that. So, that means the Iranians expect five prisoners to be released by the United States at some point in the future. And then there's the bigger question of the frozen funds that Iran expects to get.

It is Iranian funds that the South Koreans owe them for getting Iranian energy.

So, the idea is to unfreeze that amount of money and put it into a third-party controlled account that will then help -- you know go to help in a humanitarian way. Iranians inside Iran. We don't know -- I don't know the nature of the Iranian prisoners held in the United States. They may be as in the past as sort of a combination of some business people, sometimes journalists, those who have been arrested for whatever America says they -- laws they violated. This has happened before. Many, many American presidents have undergone this kind of transaction. Tragically, Siamak Namazi, who's the longest-held was left behind during the prisoner swap that accompanied the nuclear deal back in 2015, 2016. And he was left behind during deals to free two Americans under the Trump administration in 2019. So, for him and his family, this has been a massive ordeal.

So, Katelyn, what does that mean for this case?KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, Alex, it means that if this is granted by the judge, it would be a very, very speedy and aggressive road to trial for both prosecutors and Donald Trump's team and the federal court in Washington. So, in this January 6 case, what the Justice Department, the special counsel's office is asking now is jury selection in December. And then the trial beginning January second, the day after New Year's right before the anniversary of the capital attacks, which would be January 6, of course, and then also right before voters starting -- would start to go to the polls in primary elections. Donald Trump obviously running for the Republican nomination, the Iowa caucuses would naturally be first there. And at the same time in January, that kicks off a trial schedule for Donald Trump in a bunch of other proceedings, including lawsuits. In January, he does have a trial that is set to begin in a lawsuit from E. Jean Carroll, the columnist in New York. And so, there is going to be quite a lot of thought that the judge is going to have to put into this. Can they get to trial this fast, four months away from now, essentially without jury selection in mid-December? Is that plausible? And Trump's team too, they're going to be able to come back and argue against this. They most certainly will. They wanted to put his trial in Florida off until after the election, and they've already signaled that they want to do a lot of motions. Test the law quite a bit here before this goes to trial.",

That's when the FBI placed this suspect under surveillance. They eventually made contact with him to confront him about a series of troubling online posts in which he was making threats against officials. The suspect, according to the criminal complaint, told the FBI look all those posts, that was part of a dream. He then got very aggressive with those agents telling them to go away and not to come back unless they had a warrant. They eventually obtained that warrant after they noticed troubling information about President Joe Biden.I'll read you one of the alleged posts from the suspect. He wrote that I hear Biden is coming to Utah. Digging out my old ghillie suit. That refers to attire -- camouflage attire worn by snipers. And cleaning the dust off the M24 Sniper Rifle. Of course, would concern the U.S. Secret Service in the FBI was that President Joe Biden was indeed en route to Utah yesterday. And so in the early morning hours, they went to his home, attempted to take him into custody. Law enforcement source told me he then brandished a weapon toward those agents, one of those FBI SWAT operators opening fire, firing that fatal shot. It's worth pointing out. You know, people ask well, why the heavy- handedness by the FBI? Why bring in a SWAT team? Take a look at some of the imagery that the suspect had on his social media platform, including the weaponry that he had. A lot of pictures of guns and graphic detail about how he wanted to use these weapons against prominent Democratic officials. And so, they then came in with that heavy tactical team to try to arrest him. Of course, it's worth pointing out, Brianna, that all of this comes as the Department of Homeland Security and other intelligence agencies have been warning about political rhetoric and how that could lead to violence. It's something that law enforcement is certainly watching as we continue toward the 2024 election cycle.",
