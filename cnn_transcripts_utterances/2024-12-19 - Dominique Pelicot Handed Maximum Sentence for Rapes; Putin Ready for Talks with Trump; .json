If the prosecution decides that they feel that some of their sentences have been too lenient, they can appeal, as you just heard Dominique Pelicot can also appeal the decision. What that would mean, Erica, is that this courtroom, which had a jury of five judges on it, there would now be a second Mazan trial that's been called off -- the name of the village not far from Avignon, where these terrible events unfolded, where the Pelicot couple lived. There would be a second Mazan trial, this time in front of a jury. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I mean, in France now, it's starting to be clear that rape is a huge political matter, that it's everywhere in the -- in the streets, of course, but mainly in the families, at the workplace and so on. So she did something really important by choosing to get -- not get that private. So it's -- -- yes, it's very, very important. She put the matter in the place again, I would say.",

But it tends to become more usual to get that public, actually, because women are victims. Not only women but victims are really much more aware that it's important and that it's not to them to be ashamed of. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We were watching out, of course, for any commentary around president-elect Trump just 32 days out for when he takes office. The Kremlin and Putin himself have made some pretty approving noises about him in recent weeks, unsurprisingly, given his policy toward Ukraine, at least what we know about it as of now. Putin recently called him an intelligent and experienced person. And in this press conference he was asked by a U.S. journalist from NBC what he could bring to a potential meeting with Trump. Take a listen to what he had to say about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PUTIN (through translator):  You asked me what we can offer or what I can offer to the newly elected president Trump when we meet. First of all, I don't know when we will meet because he hasn't said anything about it. I haven't spoken to him at all in over four years. Of course, I am ready for this at any time and I will be ready for a meeting if he wants it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But also unity is a big part of what Zelenskyy has been pushing for today. We do see, of course, with the incoming Trump administration, that there has been a gulf on some issues surrounding Ukraine. Trump's incoming Ukraine special envoy, Keith Kellogg, has talked about how both sides in this conflict want to want to tap out and look for a way out of this; whereas, of course, on the E.U. side, they're saying we don't want to talk about peace as of yet because Russia doesn't want it.

Every five years, all the countries that signed onto the Paris accords are supposed to come back and say, here's where we stand on our promises. Here's how we'd like to increase them or face reality in those cases. His interim numbers that Joe Biden gave a few years ago, 50 percent to 52 percent, he's now goosed those up 60 percent to 66 percent by 2035. Even if Kamala Harris had won, that would have been a challenge. The Inflation Reduction Act, studies show, will get the country to about 50 percent or just under of those goals. But, of course, if Donald Trump claws all this back, the momentum, it'll make it much harder to meet those goals in the end.",

Electric vehicles, for example, have made such an impact into markets around the world, 40 percent in China. So you can't kill the electric car. Even if Donald Trump tried at this point there's enough momentum with big cities, governors, this climate alliance between so many around the world, around the country, that they can keep the momentum going, they hope. And maybe four years from now, there's a change in administration. That's what leaders are sort of building in, this pendulum effect that we're seeing, between elections in America.",

Trump could try to go at that but that could take years. And in the meantime, automakers know that the market is going in that direction. So they have to build factories in anticipation for three or four years down the road. And there's so much momentum there, there's not a whole lot that Trump can do to claw back that.
