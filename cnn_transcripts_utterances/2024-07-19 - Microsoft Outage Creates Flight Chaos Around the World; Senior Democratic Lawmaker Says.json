While you were sleeping, a massive cyber outage swept around the world. Airports in the U.S., Europe, and Asia are shut down for hours, along with major banks, media, and even some stock exchanges. Right now, only some are slowly coming back online. In Russia, jailed American journalist Evan Gershkovich is sentenced to 16 years in prison. The U.S. government has denied the espionage charges against The Wall Street Journal reporter and called the case a sham. And just in the last hour, the president's campaign top manager there, officials insisting Biden is in the race and will beat Donald Trump who wrapped up his convention last night. That's despite the pressure on the president to exit the race. We'll talk to a top Biden surrogate in just a few minutes. But first, we begin with this massive worldwide cyber outage. Here's what we know at this hour. It's causing gridlock at airports in every corner of the world. This is Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the world's busiest. It looks quiet there on the outside, but inside, a lot of frustrated passengers noticeably missing, of course, in this video, a lot of planes taking off. Multiple airports across the U.S. are still facing full or partial ground stops. This is a live look at the FAA's airport delay map. All of the red dots that you're about to see here on screen right there are ground stops. Passengers, of course, are upset at the moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, you can imagine the scenes inside some of the airports. Heathrow is impacted, so is Stansted, so is Gatwick, so are airports in Paris, Madrid, Lisbon. Honestly, I think you'd be hard pushed to find an airport that isn't impacted. And also, of course, the number of airlines, I think we have a list we can show you.

I really appreciate it.Let's shift gears right now to the Biden re-election campaign. Just this morning Biden's campaign chair says that the president is absolutely staying in the race. But despite all that, we have new reporting this hour that things could be changing. More Democrats are publicly calling for him to abandon the race. And behind closed doors, senior aides are telling CNN that there is a growing belief that he might quit soon. One senior lawmaker on the Democratic side is telling me that while pressure is building on Biden to drop out, the timetable could be fluid as the president recovers from COVID. That lawmaker said some advisers around the president appear to be digging in and insulating Biden from some of the polling information that shows he could lose the race. But, of course, there are still lots of Democrats defending President Biden, insisting he should keep on running. Joining us now is one of those Democrats, Democratic Congressman Veronica Escobar of Texas. She is a Biden campaign co-chair. And let me ask you this, Congresswoman. We have a number of sources painting a very grim picture on the record though, you're here with us. We appreciate that. What's the state of the president's re- election campaign? REP. VERONICA ESCOBAR (D-TX):  Folks are hard at work. Canvassers are knocking on doors. Folks like me are traveling the country. I just got back from Milwaukee, a great visit to Milwaukee to offer counterprogramming and talk to some of those canvassers. I've been to Arizona, Pennsylvania. While some folks are commenting to reporters anonymously, the rest of us are on the record and working hard to make sure that we win this election in November.",

They're coming from prisons. They're coming from jails. They're coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. They're taking their criminals and they're putting them into our country.

Despite the hype that, oh, Donald -- you know, the gun violence attack at his rally had changed him or humbled him or made him calmer or softer, despite all of that hype, Donald Trump is Donald Trump. And he uses the most vile and dangerous language to basically rile up his base. But in addition to riling up his base, Jim, in a couple of weeks, here in El Paso, we are going to be marking the fifth anniversary of the August 3rd shooting, a shooting by a white nationalist who drove ten hours to El Paso and published a screed that mimicked Donald Trump's vile, incendiary language about an invasion. He walked into a Walmart in my community and slaughtered 23 people because he wanted to rid the country of the invasion and of the immigrants. Donald. Trump is a risk to communities like mine. And just to double back on this, everything he said was a lie. We know that immigrants commit crimes in fewer numbers than native-born Americans. We know that immigrants help our economy. And, frankly, Democrats have recognized that we need to fix our broken immigration system, but who has stood in the way of that?

We will find out in the coming weeks. Some Republicans I've talked to this morning have called it a missed opportunity to sort of extend the sympathy and well wishes from last weekend's horrific act in Pennsylvania on, but the moments of drama at the beginning of the convention speech when the former president was talking in really stark detail about that attempted assassination really had this hall where I'm still sitting here now, just gripped following every word, but it quickly turned.

It reinforces the Trump brand. But talking to a few voters who live just outside Milwaukee here in those all-important battleground counties still undecided. And our Gary Tuchman was with a group in Waukesha County and several voters did not give the speech high marks. Jim, I think convention, they often deliver a bounce.
