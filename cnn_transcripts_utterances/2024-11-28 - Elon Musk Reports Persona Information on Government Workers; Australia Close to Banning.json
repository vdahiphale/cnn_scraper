More than a million households were left without power. Air raid sirens sounded in the capital Kyiv for more than nine hours because of a combined missile and drone attack. Residents took shelter in metro stations until the assault was over.The ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah appears to be holding for a second day and Lebanon is boosting its military presence in the country's south in an effort to prevent Hezbollah from regrouping there. Thousands of displaced people are returning home and schools are set to reopen next week. Many U.S. federal employees are concerned about President-elect Donald Trump's promises to cut the government workforce. Those cuts won't get underway until Trump is in office, but right now they're also worried about becoming online targets of the world's richest man. That's after Elon Musk reposted items containing personal information on four obscure federal employees who've since been barraged with negative attention. Details on that from CNN's Hadas Gold.

A spokesperson for the company tells CNN they had dinner with members of Trump's transition team and discussed the incoming administration. The \"New York Times\" reports the two had been in contact in the months leading up to the election, but it's not known what they discussed.Trump was also spotted Tuesday night with Boris Epshteyn, a top aide who was under internal investigation for reportedly trying to benefit financially from his access and influence to the President-elect. Now, Australia is one step closer to banning social media for anyone under 16. The Senate is in session right now and is expected to vote on a bill that would introduce that ban. It easily passed the lower house on Wednesday, but time is running out because today is the last day of the parliamentary year and senators have about 30 bills they hope to bring to a vote. Hanako Montgomery is monitoring the story, joins us from Tokyo. So, Hanako, what's the status of the bill at the moment and is it expected to pass?",

      "sentences": "Hi, Christina, it's good to see you.So right now we know that the bill is being deliberated by Australia's Senate and of course this is a monumental bill and if it passes, it would be some of the strictest laws surrounding social media in the world. Now we know that if it does become law, tech companies would have about a year to remove under 16-year-olds from their platforms and if they don't comply with the new regulations, they could face fines of up to 32 million U.S. dollars. And, Christina, we also know there would be no exceptions, meaning even if kids get consent from their parents, they still can't create accounts. But what we don't yet know is how this ban would actually be enforced. It's a huge task to verify each user's age and also there are some security concerns, especially if you're asking each user to submit government ID, highly sensitive data, and then storing that data online. Now the bill does say that social media platforms shouldn't ask users to submit that kind of information, but again, Christina, we don't yet know how this ban would actually be enforced. But it does look very likely to pass the Australian Senate today. Now of course it's received also widespread bipartisan support from Australia's government and it's also been criticized by the tech companies that would be affected and some human rights organizations. Elon Musk, the tech billionaire who owns X, said that the bill infringes upon children's human rights and Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook, has echoed similar concerns and has also said that Australia should take more time to deliberate this bill and iron out the details. Now Australia's Human Rights Commission has also said that there are better, less restrictive ways to protect children from online harm than simply imposing a blanket ban. But in response to this criticism, Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has largely dismissed these claims and has pointed to the fact that children still get access to important platforms regarding education and health services. Of course this bill also comes after several high-profile cases of children ending their own lives because, according to their parents, they were bullied online. So Albanese has been very supportive of this bill. And also we've seen that the public is, in general, quite supportive as well. According to a poll released by YouGov earlier this week, as many as 77% of the general public is in support of banning social media access for under 16-year-olds. And of course for Albanese, personally, that's also important to get the public's support because he faces very important elections in May next year. So again, Christina, lots more details still to be discussed but experts are telling us that we can expect this bill to pass sometime very, very soon. Christina.",

And we've seen really, really rapid progress in this last week and of course now it's being voted upon.It is important to note that today is the last parliamentary session so that the Senate really does look to vote on these bills. Now of course if you ask the Australian Prime Minister and many government officials, they'll say that this is a pressing issue that's been affecting Australian society but also the rest of the world. So this is a necessary bill, a necessary regulations and it's about time to impose new restrictions. Of course also earlier this year in September, again, there was a very high-profile case of a child enduring her own life, according to her parents, because she was bullied online. But if you do look at the general state of politics in Australia, there is again that very important election that could come in May for Albanese so he could be looking to boost his approval ratings before those general elections, especially again before Parliament actually ends.

But uranium mining can still have a steep environmental cost, and the waste remains radioactive for centuries. (On camera): One pellet of enriched uranium holds as much power as one ton of coal. So these 127 canisters hold all the pellets that produced 50 years' worth of electricity for a big chunk of New York City. Hell of a legacy. But now they've got to figure out what to do with this. (Voice-over): In 2010, Harry Reid and Nevada Democrats killed a plan to bury the nation's nuclear waste under Yucca Mountain. And with no new plan, it has been piling up at dozens of sites around the country ever since. PAUL MURRAY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY: If we move it at 3,000 tons a year, which is a lot of fuel to be moving, it would take us approximately 50 years to move to interim storage. WEIR (voice-over): And that's just interim storage. A permanent site could take 250 years to fill and close. First they have to build the world's safest train car to move it, and then they have to find a community to take it, likely in exchange for a fortune in taxpayer dollars.
