      "sentences": "Well, Amara, CNN has geo-located footage appearing to be from this particular camp that was targeted on Sunday evening, identifying the tail of a U.S.-made small diameter bomb. Now, we've been speaking to weapons experts who have reviewed and identified the bomb in this footage.We've heard from explosives expert Chris Cobb-Smith, who has said that this was indeed a high-precision munition manufactured by Boeing, again, a U.S.-made bomb, that this was appearing to be used in the strike on Sunday, that this was consistent or rather the properties of this bomb were consistent with claims and descriptions put forward by Israeli military spokesperson, Daniel Hagari, who spoke on Tuesday. Now, the weapons experts have acknowledged that while this was indeed a high-precision bomb, the use of any munitions in densely-populated areas carried significant risk, particularly of course, when it comes to the civilian population. As we know, this particular area of Rafah, which came under attack on Sunday evening, was filled with thousands of tents sheltering displaced Palestinian civilians. Now, we have heard from the Biden Administration previously telling CNN that if Israel were to go into Rafah, the U.S. would not be supplying weapons for that sort of offensive. Clearly though, American weapons are already in the hands of the Israeli military. And in response to this particular incident, the White House has said that they do not believe that Israel has crossed the Biden Administration's red line, that they would be against a major ground offensive and that they have not seen such an offensive at this stage. But as you mentioned, Amara, we've been hearing from eyewitnesses on the ground who have told CNN that they have seen Israeli tanks and armored vehicles in central parts of the city and important to remember, of course, that in the last 24 hours, we have seen further strikes on the southern city of Rafah in the early hours of Tuesday morning, targeting the Tal as-Sultan neighborhood once again, a particular area that was targeted on Sunday evening, but also targeting the Al Mawasi coastal region which is designated as a humanitarian safe zone. It is an area that the Israeli military had earlier this month told civilians to evacuate to. And while the Israeli military has denied targeting a humanitarian zone on the coastal region, we have seen graphic and disturbing video emerging from the scene, showing the bloodied bodies of the victims of this latest strike.",

And given the signs that we are seeing on the ground, it appears that that is only pushing further ahead with regards to the Israeli military. Now this proposal, according to a U.N. Diplomat that is set to put forward by Algeria not only calling for a full ceasefire, and of course, for the full return of hostages, but it is partially calling for an end to offensive plans in Rafah. We've heard from the French ambassador to the United Nations say, it is high time members of the U.N. Security Council take action. So certainly, growing outrage there, but it remains to be seen how the U.S. will respond to this particular resolution, and of course, this comes less than a week after the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to halt its military operations in Rafah.",

So, Israel's bombardment of Gaza since October 7th is having a dire effect on health care the enclave, as we have been reporting. Many hospitals have been forced to shut down, others are barely functioning. CNN's Paula Hancocks takes a look at the crisis and this warning for you, her report contains some graphic images.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAULA HANCOCKS, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Another residential building reduced to rubble by an Israeli airstrike. This time, in Gaza's Jabalia neighborhood, killing at least four people on Sunday according to medics on the scene, adding to the more than 36,000 Palestinians killed since the Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th. But even the survivors may not stand a chance. The U.N.'s humanitarian agency says there are no functioning hospitals in the area after the two remaining facilities in northern Gaza came under siege last week, prompting this panic to escape. (Inaudible) one hospital's director claiming the Israeli military deliberately targeted the emergency room and reception area, forcing doctors out onto the streets with their most vulnerable patients. This was deliberate, Dr. Abu Safiya (ph) says. Those here are medical staff providing medical and humanitarian services. They targeted us with the first missile, then the second, then the third. They want to force us out of this hospital. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. But in a statement of Reuters, it said the IDF is looking into the source of the hit and is reviewing the possibility that it was IDF's straight fire that was not directed at the hospital. It was a similar scene outside the nearby Al-Awda Hospital the next day. The Director of the World Health Organization says the Israeli military forced most of the staff and patients to evacuate. We were shocked today, says Dr. Abu Jassa (ph), after four days of suffocating siege Al-Awda, that the military has reached us and the tanks positioned outside the hospital gate. Airstrikes, power outages, and supply shortages have pushed dozens of health facilities in the Strip out of service. The Israeli military has accused Hamas of using hospitals to launch attacks from, making them legitimate targets. The U.N. says they are protected under international law. On Monday, yet another health center forced to close, Rafah's Kuwaiti Hospital, after a drone strike killed two members of staff and just outside the gates according to the ministry of health. The devastating result of a health system under attack means injuries sustained by innocent Palestinians, or even childbirth or dialysis can quickly become a death sentence.

He was speaking in Uzbekistan and just for the context to that, we heard, as you say, Olaf Scholtz and President Macron speak at the end of that three-day state visit yesterday, backing from the point of view of (inaudible), what Jens Stoltenberg has been saying very forcefully several days now, which is that some NATO allies don't have restrictions on how the weapons can be used by Ukraine once they arrive, most do. He feels, the NATO secretary general, very strongly that it is time they remove those restrictions. And what we heard yesterday was a forceful backing of that position.Now, from Uzbekistan, we heard from Vladimir Putin speaking directly to that, saying to the West, look, that would mark a direct escalation, be very careful, if these sorts of long-range weapons were used from Ukraine onto Russian soil, this would involve, and I'm quoting here the Russian president, Western Intelligence. It would likely involve Western military operatives even if they weren't on the ground. This, therefore, would be seen as a direct attack by NATO on Russia. And he warned that NATO allies need to be very careful about what our response would be, specifically some of the most smallest countries with large populations, speaking specifically there without naming names to, for instance, the Baltic States, NATO eastern flex. So, a very direct threat of what would happen should this policy be pursued. But I think it's important to remember, Amara, that for the time being, it certainly divides NATO members, European allies. There is far from consensus so far as to whether these restrictions should be lifted globally.",

North Korea says this is a response to South Korean activists sending prohibited materials.For a long time now, South Koreans, a lot of NGOs, sometimes former North Korean defectors that are now living in South Korea, they send into the North, sometimes using balloons, leaflets, food, medicine, even media like Korean dramas or K-pop, music that is forbidden for North Koreans to listen to, programs that are forbidden for North Koreans to watch. But they send them from South Korea anyway, as part of this propaganda push to try to convince the North that there is a better way of life in the South. This has been going on for a long time. North Korea has long accused the South of psychological warfare and has promised retaliation. So now, by sending these hundreds of trash filled balloons, they want South Korean authorities to experience the headache of cleaning up and locating all of this, just like they say they've been dealing with for a long time. But for North Koreans who receive content, particularly from South Korea, the penalties can be extremely severe. Remember, we showed you rare footage of those North Korean teenagers apparently sentenced to hard labor for viewing and distributing South Korean content.

And to help us sort through everything the jury heard and what they will do once deliberations begin, I'm joined now by Trial Attorney and Legal Analyst, Misty Marris. Good morning to you. Thanks so much for being with us this morning.Let's talk about the jury instructions because that's where the judge will start this morning, right? There was disagreement between both sides last week, when they're talking about the jury instructions, the jurors will get. Tell us why that's important and what they will likely hear from the judge? MISTY MARRIS, TRIAL ATTORNEY: Absolutely. The jury instructions are of critical importance and the reason that that is the case is because it sets forth what the prosecution's burden is to establish every element of this case beyond a reasonable doubt. So in most cases, jury instructions in New York, in an every state, there is what is called pattern instructions. So, it's pretty well known what the instructions are ultimately going to say by both the defense and the prosecution. But in this case, because of the way that this case is actually stacked, you have the falsification of business documents in furtherance of another crime. You have the New York State election law statute that also requires an unlawful act, and then we have campaign finance violations. These jury instructions are going to be quite complicated. So the first thing that will happen today is the judge will read the instructions to the jury. He will go through each of those elements and explain how -- what the jury needs to find in order to find Trump guilty or to determine that the prosecutors fulfilled their burden. There was an all-out fight between the sides as to what these instructions would say. And today, it will be revealed which side actually might have come out with some slight lead as far as what those jury instructions actually are going to tell the jury.",

This would be directly at odds with the defense argument that retainer agreement was accurate, even though it was not reduced to writing, it existed verbally and therefore was sufficient. The defense does not want that instruction in the arguments, so they can argue that these documents were actually not falsified.Another area that was contested, the intent to defraud, what does that jury instruction look like? Prosecutors want a very broad definition while defense attorneys want to show that actually the intent to defraud has to relate to a pecuniary or property interest, not just a general intent to defraud with respect to the election. Another area, what does in furtherance of another crime mean? Intent to commit that other crime. So all of these different areas, including the federal election law violations, will have to be set forth and there we're strong disagreements about the language.

Of course, black voters propelled him in 2020 and the president is trying to coalesce that support now, looking ahead to November, knowing that it's going to be a tight race. And up until this point, polls have shown that some black voters just aren't as enthusiastic, some are shifting toward his Republican rival, Donald Trump, and the biggest concern is that they don't show up to the polls at all. And so, the president is going to Philadelphia, his third time in the city this year, to try to court those voters.Now of course, this also comes on the heels of multiple efforts that have been ongoing over the course of the month. In fact, earlier this month, the president also had a multi-day stretch here at the White House commemorating Brown v. Board of Education. He also delivered a commencement address at Morehouse and has had campaign stops in Atlanta, Georgia. Taken together, you can see how the campaign is really trying to make inroads with this block, this voter block. Now, of course this also comes on the heels of the campaign taking a more aggressive strategy on the Trump trial. Just yesterday, we saw the Biden campaign outside of the courthouse where those closing arguments were happening in the Trump hush money trial case with also Robert De Niro. This was a pretty dramatic shift from where the campaign has been, but it describing that decision earlier this morning, Biden campaign comms spokesperson said that this is essentially them trying to seize opportunity. The media was there. This is an opportunity for them to draw that stark contrast between President Biden and Donald Trump. And so, we anticipate seeing perhaps more of that as they try to drive home the message that Donald Trump poses a threat to democracy. More of that today in Philadelphia.",

Priscilla Alvarez at the White House, thank you very much.Turning now to Texas where utilities say some 450,000 customers are without power after severe weather battered an already storm-weary state. Heavy rain turned roadways, look at that, into rivers, leaving drivers stranded. Just so much water there. The storms unleashed hurricane-force winds. You can see this plane was blown away from its gate at Dallas Airport just from those gusts. And a teenager was killed when heavy winds caused the house he was working on to collapse. CNN's Ed Lavandera joining us now from Garland, Texas. I mean, it's just astounding to see the damage and the impact. What are you seeing? ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it has been relentless. So the line of storms that blew through north Texas, all the way down into Houston, just wreaking havoc everywhere. This line of power lines was put up overnight after it has been knocked over. So here in the Dallas County area, we still have about 200,000 customers without power. The number statewide is just under 450,000 now, but seems like this is kind of playing out everywhere. But you still have the confusion and the chaos that's caused by intersections with power out and that's causing delays on the roadways all over the area as well. So, it's something that people are still dealing with. And officials here are saying that even though the peak of people with -- the customers without power is like about over 1 million at one point yesterday. So that number has significantly dropped, but it still could be quite some time before everyone is brought back online. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
