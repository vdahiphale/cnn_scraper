The Hamas leader's death in Gaza, not by a targeted Israeli airstrike, rather seemingly coincidental run-in with some IDF reservists operating a tank during a routine patrol, according to Israeli army radio. Israel's military says their soldiers saw, quote, suspicious movements by individuals they were convinced or terrorists and they fired on a building. It was then that Israeli troops recognized Sinwar's body in the rubble. A graphic photo now making the rounds on social media showing the body of someone strongly resembling Sinwar, surrounded by Israeli soldiers. Sinwar best known for inflicting though horrors of October 7, 2023, when he orchestrated Hamas's brutal mass murder of roughly 1,200 people in Israel, including 46 Americans, the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. Around 100 of 250 hostages taken by Hamas are still believed to be in Gaza, including seven Americans, four of whom are believed to be alive. Sinwar hid from public view for the last year after the attack. U.S. officials believe he hid in tunnels thought to be seen here in this IDF handout video, moving frequently and using hostages as human shields. Here are some reactions from the region. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SUHA AL TURK, PALESTINIAN (through translator):  We've received the news at great shock because he is our leader and may God have mercy on him. Israel claims that he is one of their targets, one another after his assassination, the war will stop. But the war will not stop. BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. This is the beginning of today after Hamas. Whoever lays down his weapon and return our hostages, we will allow him to go out and leave. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's get right to our experts, CNN chief international correspondentClarissa Ward and CNN political and global affairs analyst Barak Ravid. Barak, since October 7th, Sinwar, political leader Ismail Haniyeh and two other high up commanders, deputy commander, and many others in Hamas, have been killed, eliminated. This is an addition to, of course, the around 20,000 Hamas terrorists killed or captured so far according to Netanyahu, could this be the end of the war? BARAK RAVID, CNN POLITICAL &amp; GLOBAL AFFAIRS ANALYST:  Well, it's a great question because the person who decides whether the war ends at the end of the day is the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, because he holds most of the cards. At the same time the only way that the war ends is if there's some sort of a hostage deal and those cards, the hostages are being held by Hamas and now the question is who is in charge on the other side? And I think that's the main question because even if you want to go for a hostage deal now after Sinwar is eliminated, and this is what Netanyahu knows, people say that the prime minister wants, now to move towards a hostage deal. Who do you talk? And I think that in the short term we might find ourselves in a sort of a vacuum now that it is unclear who is even the person to negotiate with.",

The question remains, though, will that off-ramp be taken?You heard Jeremy talk about the prime ministers speech earlier, and it was not the sort of speech where it looked like peace negotiations might be around the corner. He talked to about the challenges, he urged patience. I also think that this shows that this is really a pivotal moment where it is incumbent upon Prime Minister Netanyahu to really articulate what the vision is going forward as Barak just talked about, this kind of a vacuum. Yes, you need Hamas to step up and say who's taking over leadership and what the protocol will be going forward. But you also need Israel to finally articulate what the vision is for Gaza. What the vision is for southern Lebanon. And I think for all of the people in Gaza who are watching all of this play out. Who don't have any real say in matters who have been living through hell for the last year? There is at least a modicum of hope that at least this will be some kind of a transitional moment, although I will say that hope tempered by very real cynicism about what lies ahead -- Jake. TAPPER:  And, Barak, if Muhammad Sinwar, the brother of Yahya Sinwar, assumes control command of Hamas, one U.S. official tells CNN, quote, negotiations are totally screwed. The hostage families, the people who are still holding out hope that they can get their loved ones back from Gaza, do they have hope for a deal right now?",

But when you talk to people privately, there much for more frank and there is not a lot of love for Hamas. The only focus frankly of the vast majority of people in Gaza is survival, is making it through the day.And so, there is the sense that possibly could this lead to some kind of ceasefire? Could it lead to people being able to return their homes, rebuild their homes, some kind of a vision articulated as to what the future of Gaza will look like? Could it lead to an improvement in the aid situation? Just 50 percent of the amount of aid that was delivered to Gaza and September by the Israelis was delivered in October. The situation in northern Gaza continues to spiral with people, literally dead bodies littering the streets, people starving, the reemergence of polio. It's an absolute emergency and disaster. And for the people of Gaza, that and survival is very much what they're focused on. TAPPER:  All right. Clarissa Ward and Barak Ravid, thanks to both of you for your time and expertise. Former CIA director under President Obama, retired U.S. Army General David Petraeus joins us now. His book, \"Conflict: The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Gaza\", just came out in paperback. General, thanks so much for joining us. How do you predict Sinwar's death could alter the course of this war? Do you agree with Clarissa? There's an off-ramp for Netanyahu here, but he just needs to articulate what post-war Gaza looks like. GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS, U.S. ARMY (RET.):  I think there is an opportunity here. I'm not sure they're going to seize it. But first we should recognize how hugely significant this blow is to Hamas. He was not just symbolic, he was the leader overall, of course, after the political leader was killed in Tehran. So he is the political and military leader and he was the operational leader as well. So unlike, say, Osama bin Laden killed during my final time in Afghanistan, who is symbolically hugely important, but operationally not that significant, in this case, he checks every single block. Now a question is, who will succeed him will be his brother, will be someone what else? I suspect that the command control communications at this point is very decentralized. But this does give an opportunity for Prime Minister Netanyahu to say we are now going to enter a new phase of the operations in this phase, our objective is to achieve security in Gaza, which is not there now, and to provide a better life for the Palestinians who live there sequentially clearing, holding restoring basic services, humanitarian assistance, ending this really humanitarian disaster that is the lives as Clarissa -- Clarissa pointed out, for the average Palestinians, and creating a situation in which they don't want Hamas coming back. They don't want Palestinian Islamic jihad stepping in because they do want better lives. And I think there is an opportunity for that. And, by the way, also, to truly destroy Hamas. They're not destroyed yet. They've been decapitated. They've been degraded very, very heavily. But destruction means that they cannot reconstitute. And as long as there is no security in Gaza the security is that provided by criminal elements and remnants of Hamas. They are going to continue to reconstitute, at least in terms of their personnel even as frankly but they cannot materially reconstitute because Israel rightly has taken control the southern border between Gaza and the Sinai through which and under which, of course, the material used to flow.",

You hear Stevie Wonder tunes playing underneath there. Later tonight, she's going to rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. So how tight is the race in Wisconsin? A critical swing state? Lets bring in CNN's Harry Enten. Harry, what are the latest polls from the badger state showing? HARRY ENTEN, CNN SENIOR DATA REPORTER:  Yeah, you will always be my Cherie Amour, Jake. But let's take a look at the polling data here. All right, look, bottom line, it is so tight. You can look at Quinnipiac. You get a plus-two for Trump. Well, within the margin ever, how about a \"Wall Street Journal\", you prefer a tie. We got to tie with \"The Wall Street Journal\". How about \"The New York Times\"/Siena College poll? We got Harris up by two, you look at the Marquette University Law School poll, Harris by four. But again, we've got a range of results going on here in the Badger State. It's just a very, very tight race. Of course, for me, one of the real questions I have is what are the polls are actually going to be any good this time around. Because if you look in 2020, what you see in the final polls in Wisconsin, you saw Biden up by eight, the actual result was Biden by a point. I'll note, I rounded that number up. I think it was 0.63 percentage points. So the question is, are the polls actually going to be right this time around, or are they going to, again, underestimate Donald Trump? If so, Donald Trump is in a very strong position in the Badger State. But here's the thing that we do now and that is Wisconsin is so pivotal, Mr. Tapper. Chance they win the election if they win Wisconsin for Kamala Harris, if she wins Wisconsin, 82 percent chance he wins the election for Donald Trump. It's an 88 percent chance if he wins the election because the bottom line is, for Kamala, the state of war constant is more pivotal than it is for Donald Trump. It's part, of course, that Great Lake wall. And one last thing I will note, Mr. Tapper, let's talk about La Crosse, because La Crosse and the adjacent counties in 2020, look at how tight it was. 65,000 votes for Donald Trump, 64,000 votes for Joe Biden. The bottom line is Kamala Harris right now is in lacrosse because it is a pivotal swing area. If one candidate blows the other one out and La Crosse and the adjacent counties, pretty good chance they're going to win the election. But my guess is based upon the polling, we're going to continue to look at a very tight race in the La Crosse metropolitan area because it is very much emblematic of the state at large.

One, because even though there may not be a lot so of persuadable voters watching Fox News, there are voters who have never seen her speak, who don't know what she I can real life, who don't -- who basically are getting fed that she's stupid, that she's dumb, that she does, that she has cognitive problems. And so -- it's for her to sit there and say, hey, look at me, I don't have these problems, but also to say it makes something that the former president wont do. I think that that no matter how the interview went, have could have went totally, totally terribly, which I don't think I think she'd actually did well, it could have went totally bad, but just her being there is a high mark.
