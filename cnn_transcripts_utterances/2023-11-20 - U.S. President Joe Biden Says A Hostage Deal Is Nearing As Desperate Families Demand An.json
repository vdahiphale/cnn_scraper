Tonight, U.S. PresidentJoe Biden says a hostage deal is nearing as desperate families demand answers from Israeli leadership about their relatives being held by Hamas. The very latest on this developing story. Also ahead, premature babies in Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital are finally evacuated and arrive in Egypt. I'll speak to one of the aid groups that made this unbelievable mission happen. And he once wielded a chainsaw at campaign events, but now Javier Milei is Argentina's president. We'll look at how he's planning to execute bold plans for the economy. And tonight, U.S. President Joe Biden signals a deal to get the remaining hostages out of Gaza could be close. He was asked repeatedly at an event today marking the Thanksgiving Holiday later this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Al-Shifa Hospital, this video shows whatthe IDF claims is Hamas militants leading hostages into the hospital. Now, just to be clear, CNN cannot independently verify the contents of the video, but it's part of a wider case the IDF is now making to a global audience after sending troops in to raid the hospital last week. Israel says that Hamas has long operated a command center from the compound, something Hamas and hospital officials deny. The IDF has been releasing evidence to support that claim over the past week, including the video of what it says is a newly exposed tunnel shaft at the complex. Though, even that information doesn't definitively prove the larger accusation that Hamas has been operating from within the hospital grounds. Meanwhile, more than two dozen premature newborns who were being treated at that same hospital have now crossed the border into Egypt. The hope is that their lives can now be saved by more stable treatment outside of the war zone. As Eleni Giokos reports.

So, the first mission on Saturday was to make this assessment, and we, the team, the team on the ground met the exhausted health workers and scared patients, which asked for this evacuation. So plans were immediately made for the 31 babies to be transferred which happened yesterday, again, in coordination -- collaboration with the Palestinian Red Crescent. It was of course, sad to see from the 30 -- because there were 33, and two died actually in the night from Saturday, on Sunday. So we were able to get them to a Al Hilal and Emirati Hospital in the southern Gaza, where they were very well received. And some of those -- many of the babies were in serious conditions, infections due to lack of medical supplies and in possibility actually to continue infection control measures in Al-Shifa.

And of course, that is also a claim backed up by the United States and its intelligence services as well. What this evidence, this video evidence does show is at least -- and CNN hasn't been able to confirm that this tunnel is indeed within the medical complex as you saw Oren at the site. We've been able to geolocate the video of what appears to be a drone going into that tunnel before it reaches that longer -- going into the shaft rather before it reaches the tunnel. And when you see the video from inside the tunnel, what you see is very typical of a Hamas tunnel. That kind of curved shape of the ceiling inside the tunnel, and then you reach a door, which Israeli officials say they have yet to open, because it may be booby trapped. So, this is certainly the most extensive evidence that the Israelis have provided so far to backup their claim that there is some kind of a tunnel - - Hamas tunnel infrastructure below Al-Shifa Hospital, but it is not yet proof of the farthest extent of the claims made by the Israeli military.",

We're entering, you know, into the 21st month of this war which has become a war of attrition, essentially, a stalemate. And that's what General Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine's commander-in-chief told the economists some weeks ago that they need advanced weaponry to make those in-roads. This counteroffensive that has been going on for the past four months just has not yielded the results or that beautiful breakthrough that they had hoped for. So Lloyd Austin, coming today, it reaffirms America's support. And as you say, he said the U.S. is with you and we will remain for the long haul, and that what happens here matters to the world. You mentioned that assistance package of $100 million, really, it's a drop in the ocean when you consider what Ukraine needs. A long laundry list of weapons, ammunition, you know, air defense systems, drones, and obviously that was a conversation that was had today.

They fired Sam Altman, he was the co-founder and really the biggest voice in A.I., not just in OpenAI, but actually really in the sector. He's probably the most vocal spokesperson for the sector in terms of regulation and everything else. Now, why they fired him is up for debate, really, because we don't have much detail from the board themselves. But the weekend involved really just so much controversy, particularly from investors like Microsoft who didn't like the idea that this was not communicated with them. They want to see Sam Altman leading OpenAI, but by the end of the weekend, that didn't seem to be happening. So, this morning, we found out that Sam Altman and his cofounder Greg Brockman, who resigned on Friday in all of this, had both been hired by Microsoft, the biggest backer of OpenAI. And we sort of thought that maybe that would draw a line under it. A new CEO, the third CEO in three days was appointed today as well, Emmett Shear from Twitch. And yet, that is not the end of it, because according to this letter, 500-plus employees of a company that only has around 700 to 800, could be resigning if Sam Altman doesn't go back.",

But I mean, what -- Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion, Google bought YouTube for $1.7 billion, Microsoft could eventually acquire OpenAI for absolutely nothing, but their paychecks, which I'm sure Sam Altman -- one assume quite big. But let's just talk about this very clearly, because I do think it's about something far bigger than OpenAI. It's about the future of artificial intelligence, the speed of progression in how this is researched and given out to the general public. And it doesn't look like there's some kind of ideological battle going on between the board and perhaps the leadership of OpenAI as well. Where do we think this ends?

Does regulation need to catch up with AI before it is pushed out to the world and monetize, and perhaps, this was the reason Sam Altman was pushed out, because he's very much trying to find ways to monetize all of the products, including of course, getting billions of dollars from Microsoft in all sorts of multi-year partnerships. So that's at the heart of this debate, and what happens next, I think will be really interesting. We're seeing a splintering at the top. A handful of A.I. companies control this space, control the debate, and are at the forefront, really, of all sorts of regulatory talks with politicians, with regulators around the world. And now we're seeing a splintering. So do we see OpenAI slightly being consumed by Microsoft? An acquisition that might never be allowed to be -- take place.

When President Biden releases information, I think he's just trying to assure the Israeli public and the people who are pro-Israel in the United States that the United States is doing everything in his power to secure a release of the hostages. I'm not sure how much influence the United States actually has over Qatar or Hamas, when the United States is not willing to call out Qatar as a state that supports terrorism, which it is, but U.S. has interest in Qatar, like a huge army base there. So, it's very difficult. And all these third players have their own set of interest in their own ways of working. I think we need to look a lot closer at the Egyptian track. The Egyptian intelligence has a much more direct line to Gaza, they sit next to Gaza. They communicate with Hamas, they communicate with the Islamic Jihad, as well. They're involved in these negotiations. A lot of attention is on Qatar, but there's more than just Qatar going on here.",

Is there something positive though that the hostage families can glean from this and that how valuable these hostages remain and that these negotiations wouldn't be taking place? One has to presume if the Israeli officials didn't believe that they were still alive that Hamas didn't believe that they had something to negotiate over, particularly giving the fact in this role and understood.",

He has to know that atthe end of this war, he will probably not be alive. So, one would ask why is he negotiating? Sinwar has promised since the day that he was released from prison in the fleet exchange in 2011 that he would vacate the Israeli prisons from Palestinian prisoners. He would bring them all home. This is his holy mission in his life as long as he lives to secure the release of those prisoners. And that's why it's important to him. The Israelis have all kinds of working assumptions of what Sinwar wants. Some people think he just wants to survive. That's not what I think. But it's all guesswork. We don't really know.",

Thank you.Now, Argentines have made their choice for president and it's clear they're hoping for drastic change. Really almost all the votes counted, far-right Libertarian, Javier Milei, has become the country's new president-elect. It will now remain to be seen whether the eccentric political outsider with make good on his radical campaign promises among some of the most controversial, eliminating the Central Bank and scrapping the country's currency in favor of the U.S. dollar. Milei argues these measures will help tackle inflation which is at a staggering 142 percent. It's probably a lot higher, one of the certainly in the world. His campaign has drawn comparisons to that to former U.S. President Donald Trump, who's already congratulated Milei on his victory. I want to bring in Stefano Pozzebon who's following all this from Bogota. Stefano, given what the people are going through, the poverty, the triple digit inflation, it's understandable why they'd want radical change. But dollarization, which we have seen from smaller countries in the region, let's be clear, is an option to introduce some degree of stabilization because you effectively use U.S. policy. So, when their rates go up, effectively, Argentina's rates will go up and down and vice versa. But it doesn't automatically mean growth, and it doesn't automatically control government spending either. This is the key surely.",
