We're learning that President Biden is expected to speak soon about the Supreme Court immunity ruling that delivered a serious blow to the January 6th criminal case against Donald Trump. Stand by for new reaction to the historic high court decision that Trump has immunity for official acts he took his president. We're breaking it down, what it means for Trump's prosecution, the 2024 election and for the power of the presidency.All of this coming as the president is scrambling for ways to try to ease the growing fallout from his debate performance that is widely viewed by Democrats as a disaster. Stand by for new reporting on the president's strategy and the panicked finger pointing within his party. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Wolf Blitzer off today. I'm Pamela Brown and you're in The Situation Room. And we began with breaking news on President Biden set up to speak tonight about the Supreme Court's ruling in the Trump immunity case. Let's go right to CNN's M.J. Lee at the White House. What are you learning, M.J.? M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Pam, we've just learned in the last five minutes that President Biden will be giving remarks here at the White House addressing the Supreme Court's ruling on the question of presidential immunity. This is so significant, of course, because this is the first time that the president will be giving remarks ever since he returned to Washington, D.C. after Thursday night's debate. And importantly, we are learning that this is going to be a pooled event, meaning that only a select number of reporters will be in the room. We don't know, of course, whether the president is going to be in the mood to answer any questions from reporters. Of course, we know that our colleagues will be prepared to throw questions his way. This could be, Pam, the first time that we get some fulsome answers from the president about his political future ever since last week's debate that, of course, has set off so much turmoil within the Democratic Party. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): I'm with Joe Biden. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): It's not about performance in terms of a debate. It's about performance in a presidency. SEN.

We're just finding out about President Biden speaking tonight at the White House in the wake of this historic Supreme Court ruling. But it's not just what he's going to say tonight. It's going to be everything else. It's going to be analyzed as well in the wake of his debate performance last week. How does he come out tonight and allay some of those concerns? DAVID CHALIAN, CNN POLITICAL DIRECTOR: Well, the first thing, certainly everyone's going to assess how he seems physically, mentally, everything like that, no doubt, Pam. But also, is he going to take a question? Because, you know, the White House says he's coming out to make a statement about the Supreme Court ruling. While that's an interesting news of day topic that I'm sure everyone would like to hear the president of the United States on, it's not actually the first question on people's minds right now about Joe Biden. It's about the state of his candidacy for reelection that is top of mind. And so I'll be curious to know if they are going to sort of entertain, if the president is going to entertain a question, knowing that it will be about his debate performance and what it means for the campaign going forward to allow him this opportunity if obviously all the reporting suggesting he wants to sort of grind through this problematic moment and remain the nominee of the party if he gives sort of the assurances that he's fully in that mode and pressing forward, no doubt about it, kind of thing, if he wants to give that supreme confidence that we saw the day after the debate in Raleigh, North Carolina, my guess is he probably will seek for an opportunity of that. But they've set this up as a statement about the Supreme Court, which shows me exactly they want to be on the contrast with Trump every day. They don't want to be talking about Joe Biden, not about his debate performance, not about anything related to just Joe Biden alone. They want the president to be on contrast with Trump day in and day out.",

And then, look, I'm of the mindset he should take a question tonight. He should have a snappy, good response, take a question, you know, show people that he's engaged, that he's loose. I would argue he shouldn't do a long, extended press conference tonight that will ultimately wind up being about him. He wants to drive the message back to Donald Trump.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Presidents have to be given total immunity. They have to be allowed to do their job. PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): The Supreme Court partially siding with former President Donald Trump in his ongoing January 6th case, ruling that former presidents are entitled to some immunity from prosecution for official actions but not for private conduct. In the 6-3 opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts writing for the majority, at least with respect to the president's exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. The president enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the president does is official. The president is not above the law. The high court, though, leaving it up to lower courts to determine which actions are official and, therefore, immune. Roberts writing, other allegations, such as those involving Trump's interactions with the vice president, state officials, and certain private parties, and his comments to the general public, present more difficult questions, meaning District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing Trump's January 6th case, will need to decide whether Trump's pressure campaign to get Vice President Pence --",

That's confusing. It's going to require months, if not years, of litigation to sort out.

But the other thing that Chief Justice John Roberts noted in this opinion today that could be very important to the case here in Washington is saying that the official acts, what it does count as an official act cannot be used to bolster accusations related to unofficial acts.

Thank you for coming on, Senator. I first want to get to what we're learning tonight about President Biden speaking from the White House in the wake of this crucial ruling from the Supreme Court. This will be a controlled environment. President Biden could very well be using a teleprompter tonight. We don't know if he's going to take questions. Given that, do you think this will do anything to temper the fears about his fitness many Democrats and members of the public, frankly, are expressing? SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN (D-PA): Well, I don't think one debate really means too much. I don't think a press conference or anything really means much. You know, Joe Biden has a career of 50 years in public service. He has been a great president. He has done a lot of great things, you know, against a credibly bad situation, whether it's the pandemic or whether it's the economy and all of those other issues, inflation and all those things, and the president has done a great job. So, I don't think one kinds of a press conference or anything's going to change much and I'm proud to be a Joe Biden all-in kind of guy. And I don't think it's going to change much one way or the other.",

It says 72 percent of registered voters think Biden doesn't have the mental or cognitive health to serve as president and equal numbers say he shouldn't be running for president. You're strongly supporting President Biden, as you just pointed out. So why are almost three quarters of voters wrong here?",

But Joe Biden has made his case over the last four years and things (ph). That debate is not some kind of defining thing anymore than I've said that Trump being convicted is a defining kind of situation. That's the way the Republican wants as well, too.

You know, I'm not really worried about that ruling today. I'm not actually surprised by it given the makeup of the Supreme Court. But stop -- you know, don't elect, you know, criminals. And then it's not really an issue you have to be worried about. And you don't have to worry about with Joe Biden. And Joe Biden is our guy. And it's going to be a stark choice, you know, Joe Biden or Donald Trump. It's going to be close.I've been saying that same thing for the last eight years, you know, Trump or Clinton, Trump-Biden in 2020, or the same thing again in '24, it's going to be close, and I do believe Joe Biden is going to win. And like I said, it's not going to be easy. But I don't understand why there's other Democrats losing their minds over this and this. It's -- one debate does not define anyone.

And you have people like Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin saying, there have been very honest and serious conversations happening within the Democratic Party following Biden's debate performance. What do you know about those conversations? Do you think those conversations should be happening? FETTERMANAnd let me just say this too. If you think you're a friend of the president there, that you're -- you know, you don't say that, you know, on national television, or you don't put that in the nation's biggest paper. You reach out in private. But if Joe Biden doesn't call you up and ask your opinion, you know, then maybe you're not the kind of close friend that you might think you are. But Joe Biden has the right, and he's earned that right to have his support, and he's been a great president throughout all that. I would take Joe Biden any day over the kind of a terrible president who's now demonstrated he's immune to all the criminal behavior that he is now up to trial for now. But it comes down to that choice that we have right now in November. Whose side are you, chaos and revenge or a good president who's done a good job?

What does the president need to say tonight, do tonight, not just about the Supreme Court ruling, but to reassure Americans that he is fit to be president? And do you think he needs to take reporters' questions? REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): Well, I, you know, I don't know what he needs to do because the decision really is radical. It's extreme. And I think he probably needs to explain why that's the case. I'm sure he'd like to take questions. I'd like to hear that as well. But I think the focus ought to be on Donald Trump and what this means for the rule of law. I mean, basically, the court, while saying it was limited immunity, in fact, said for the core functions of the presidency was absolute immunity. And, for example, core functions are acting as the commander-in-chief, making appointments, pardoning, and they cannot be questioned in any way. So, I mean, that's radical. That's extreme. It's a big departure from historical norms. And I know people have criticized Justice Sotomayor for saying, you know, SEAL Team Six. But if you take the majority's opinion at face value, they said, if a president acts with his core duties as commander-in-chief, nothing he does can be questioned. He has absolute immunity.",

He had a bad debate, but that doesn't undercut the fact that he's done a lot as president and especially if you contrast his decency and his agenda that focuses on the well-being of the American public, with Trump who really is a radical, who says that he intends to terminate parts of the Constitution whose focus totally on himself.
