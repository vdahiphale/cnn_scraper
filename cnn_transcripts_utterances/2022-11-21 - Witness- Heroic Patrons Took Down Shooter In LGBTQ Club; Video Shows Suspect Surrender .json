Now, they want to build a base, establish a permanent human presence and then someday go on to Mars.So this is a very different program. Today we're getting our first taste of it.

He allegedly shot and killed five people, wounded nearly 30 others. The police chief said the suspect had an AR-15-style rifle, handgun on him, weapons he purchased himself sources say. Reportedly he was also wearing a military-style flak jacket. Two of those killed were bartenders. Daniel Aston had just moved to Colorado to be closer to his parents, his parents told The Denver Post.

And the suspect - well, two sources have told CNN that records show that he bought those two weapons himself which has led many people to ask why, how was he allowed to because he had one other very significant run-in with law enforcement last summer, summer of '21. [15:05:05] He was captured on security camera video turning himself in a long negotiation with the police, turning himself in because his mother had called 911 to say that her son was threatening her with a bomb and other weapons. That video shows him turning himself in. Now, charges were not pursued and perhaps that is why there was no issue on the back - any background checks. There was no red flag warning when he went to buy those weapons. The charges we are told will be formally levied against him once he has been released to the - from the hospital. He was, of course, injured when those one or two patrons of the club just rushed at him, subdued him used his own handgun to hit him and stop him killing any more people. Guys, back to you.",

But it's important to note that five people lost their lives, so those murder charges are going to be by and large the top end charges in this case. Bias motivated crimes at the top end are class four felonies. First degree murder charges are class one felonies. So there's a big difference in potential sentences there.

So if people are watching and they realize, hey, I didn't talk to the police, but I was actually in the club when that happened.

Sarah Ellis, thank you so much for joining us.So what happens when safe spaces like Club Q are closed? Where can people in the LGBTQ community go to feel safe and congregate? SARAH KATE ELLIS, CEO &amp; PRESIDENT, GLAAD: Yes, that's a tough one. We've seen over the past several years too more and more LGBTQ safe spaces closed down just after COVID and whatnot. So they are getting smaller and smaller. But as a community, we always have pride month, and we always do find places and spaces. But I really think that it shouldn't be on us to figure that out. When I feel as though that space was taken over by hate, discrimination and that is a direct response from the rhetoric, from these politicians that we've been seeing rhetoric does lead to violence. And we have been - we're seeing a 12-year high in hate crimes, 41 percent increase in hate crimes against the transgender community. And we see a direct line between that and what our politicians are saying on the airwaves and how they're pushing for over 300 anti-LGBTQ bills this year, so far, bills that don't need to exist, bills that are taking away our rights, that are policing our body. And then on top of that, I want to say, when we look at these social media companies that go unchecked, and take that hate, take that disinformation and spread it like wildfire, because they make money off of it.
