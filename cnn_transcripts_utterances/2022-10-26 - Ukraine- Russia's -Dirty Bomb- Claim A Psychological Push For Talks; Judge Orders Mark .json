But there is nothing normal about what's transpiring right now. Are you watching this closely, and are you worried about any miscalculations at all here?MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, that's the problem is miscalculation. The beauty or -- not the beauty. I apologize. The advantage of a nuclear weapon is in its deterrence. That's why the Soviet Union created so many back in the '60s and '70s. Why the United States had so many. China was off to the side, they were to have very few at all. So, you needed to de-escalate all of that. The deterrent factor is what makes nuclear weapons systems effective. You use the nuke, you lose the deterrence and now the lid is off the jar and there are almost limitless possibilities. Most of those are horrible, horrendous. They should be avoided. Of course, this is incredibly troubling. Calm heads need to prevail. Open dialogue is essential. So, that's why it's essential the president talked, that the Secretary of Defense talk with his counterpart Shoigu, et cetera. Everybody at multiple levels needs to be communicating to put a personal face on this.",

They are -- they're particularly interested in learning what Meadows heard and saw during some of those meetings that happened in December, 2020 as the former president was trying to figure out way to stay in power despite losing the election. In particular they were trying to come up with ways to prove that there was vote fraud in Georgia to be able to turn that election there. That is of keen interest to this grand jury.We know that Meadows was on that one phone call where Trump was talking to Brad Raffensperger in Georgia trying to find the exact number of votes that he needed to be able to win Georgia. And he also went down to Georgia to sit in on an audit that was happening in one of the counties there. So, there's plenty of witness that Meadows certainly had, and that the grand jury would want to know as part of their investigation before the end of the year. Of course, Meadows has said and his lawyers have said that they're going to appeal this ruling from this judge in South Carolina -- Victor and Bianna.",

And it's really consequential because the two witnesses that we're talking about, Pat Cipollone who was the former White House counsel, his deputy Patrick Philbin, again, they were major witnesses. They were pushing back against these vote fraud claims by the former president. And they appeared before the criminal grand jury, the federal criminal grand jury here in Washington, but they declined to answer certain questions because of the former president's claim of privilege, executive privilege and attorney/client privilege.Now what the Justice Department is doing is asking the judge to compel them to come back and answer certain questions about their interactions with Trump. How this goes, guys, I think it, you know, portends very, very, very largely for the criminal investigation by the Justice Department. Because if they can get some of this testimony from these two men, these two top lawyers in the White House, you can bet the prosecutors want to get questions to Mark Meadows and some of the other witnesses -- Victor and Bianna.

Try to limit to that. We're at about 1.1 now. 2.0 is when things get really dicey in terms of tipping points, like ice sheets collapsing, maybe methane bombs in the Arctic.Well, now we are on track to get 2.1 to 2.9. The upper end of scale would make vast swaths around the middle of this world uninhabitable. And you're seeing the effects here at 1.1. I'm covering the Mississippi River which is at record lows which has jammed up barge traffic, which will affect agriculture or economic stories for next couple of years to come. At the bottom of the world, we're now hearing they're going to officially list the emperor penguin as an endangered species because the ice, the sea ice there is melting so rapidly there's nowhere to lay eggs or raise chicks. Krill, their food source, is being affected by warming waters down there. So, the warning signs are really everywhere, no matter where you look.

He fired off this letter directly to the Fed chair. Warning that: For working Americans who already feel the crush of inflation, job losses will make it much worse. We cannot risk the livelihoods of millions of Americans who can't afford it. Joining us now, is CNN's Matt Egan. So, Senator Brown, is not the only lawmaker who is taking a shot at the Fed.

      "sentences": "Well, Victor, Bianna, we have obviously heard criticism from the left of the Fed. Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken Jay Powell to task over this risk of causing a recession. I think what's different here is that this is coming from Sherrod Brown who actually supported Jay Powell's renomination to lead the Fed. And I think this speaks to this growing concern in Washington over just how much the Fed is doing to try to squash inflation.I mean, before June, the Fed hadn't raised interest rates by three- quarters of a point since 1994. As you mentioned, now they are on the further verge of doing that four times in a row. It's sort of unthinkable. Let me read you a key line from this letter from Sherrod Brown. He wrote, quote: I ask that you don't forget your responsibility to promote maximum employment and that the decisions you make at the next FOMC meeting reflect your commitment to the dual mandate. Now lately, the Fed has been laser focused on the price stability part of that mandate. And that makes sense because prices are anything but stable. Brown is saying, we need you to also remember that you are supposed to have a very strong jobs market. In the concern is that the Fed is going to be so focused on inflation that it forgets about jobs. Victor and Bianna, I do think that if the jobs market starts to slow down in the coming months, which a lot of economists say is going to happen, then we are going to hear more lawmakers come out and share Brown's criticism there.",

Both Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet are seeing their share price sharply lower today. They both reported weaker than expected results. They are still making gobs of money, just not as much as they had been. Google, their core ad business barely grew last quarter. YouTube ad revenue actually outright declined.This is further evidence that companies are starting to hunker down as they prepare for a potential recession. Microsoft also, they reported their weakest quarterly sales growth in five years in large part because PC sales have slowed down. And that is a reflection of some of the concern from consumers there. And I think that investors broadly are worried we might hear more of the same when Facebook owner Meta reports quarterly results in the next few minutes here.",
