If you're just joining us, here are our top stories today.U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris is set to sit down with Israeli War Cabinet member Betty Gantz in the coming hours. The meeting comes amid an urgent U.S. push for more humanitarian aid in the temporary ceasefire in Gaza. Later today, lawmakers in France are expected to vote on adding abortion rights to the country's constitution. The measure is widely expected to pass. French President Emmanuel Macron scheduled the special congress at the Palace of Versailles. Women's rights groups are planning to gather in Paris to watch the vote on a giant screen. Anti-abortion activists have scheduled a protest ahead of the vote. A volcano and an uninhabited part of Ecuador's Galapagos Islands is erupting, spewing lava into the night sky. The eruption started late on Saturday, but the government says there's no threat to visitors to the island. But geologists believe this eruption will be more powerful than previous ones in recent years. Ukraine's president says defense forces have shot down seven Russian military aircraft in the past week alone, and 15 over the month of February. Volodymyr Zelenskyy says Russia is launching aerial attacks meant to kill as Ukraine's defense forces struggle with a significant shortage of artillery. He's pleading for U.S. military aid now. Meanwhile, six people were injured in a Russian missile attack in eastern Ukraine on Sunday. This police video shows a heavily damaged school in one of the towns that was hit. President Zelenskyy says 12 people have now died from a Russian drone attack in Odessa overnight on Friday. He says rescuers spent all day on Sunday digging through the rubble, recovering bodies and searching for survivors. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh shows us the aftermath. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Hundreds of mourners flocked to his grave in Moscow on Sunday with many laying flowers.Navalny died last month in a Siberian prison sparking accusations that he had been murdered. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in his death. The outpouring of support comes as Vladimir Putin is set to secure another six-year term in an election with no real competition.

Somewhere underneath those petals is Alexei Navalny's body. But the one thing you mentioned, Max, is we have not heard at all from the Kremlin referencing the funeral or offering any condolences from the Kremlin at all.That's not different. We don't -- It's very expected and is very much within the Kremlin playbook. And in the last few minutes, we've heard from Dmitry Peskov, again, President Putin's spokesperson, who has said: We haven't said much on the topic and we believe that we won't have anything more to say. The messaging from the Kremlin here, Max, is it's really clear they are aware of an election coming up for them where they will be -- President Putin will be looking to secure another term in office. And I think that they don't want to rock the boat at the moment. They don't want to draw any more eyes towards Alexei Navalny's final resting place than is completely necessary. They feel that they have allowed people to get some steam off their chest, but they haven't broadcast it on state TV or anywhere within Russia of any particular note. But within all of this, there is the key message, though, from the people of Russia, that despite the oppression that Vladimir Putin has put on his own people, not being able to say goodbye properly to Alexei Navalny, detaining people in the days after he was arrested, not being able to speak out openly and critically against the war, that within all of this, there is a subliminal message beneath that -- metaphorically within that mountain of flowers, that you may be able to take the opposition figure away from people, but his message and what he stood for will continue to be there -- Max.",

The summons is in response to a leaked conversation between top- ranking Air Force officers discussing a possible transfer of long- range Taurus missiles to Ukraine. The conversation was posted online last week by the head of Russia's state broadcaster. German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said the timing of the leak and the quick reaction suggested a certain, quote, choreography that he suspects is part of a Russian campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BORIS PISTORIUS, GERMAN MINISTER OF DEFENCE (through translator): The incident is clearly more than just the interception and publication of a conversation within the Air Force. It is part of an information war that Putin is waging. There is no doubt about that. It is a hybrid attack aimed at disinformation. It's about division. It's about undermining our unity. And accordingly, we should react to it with particular prudence, but no less determinedly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Neighboring Asian countries in the region, they're upset because of the talk out there, the allegations that Singapore paid up to U.S.$3 million a show to get an exclusive deal to bring Taylor Swift and her Eras tour to Singapore.Today we heard from Singapore's culture minister who addressed the Singaporean parliament on the controversy, and he said that the grant is not as high as speculated. Now, there is a timeline to this story, so let's take you back to what happened last week. So a lawmaker in the Philippines called on his country to put the pressure on Singapore for an explanation behind these grants. And this is what we heard from Joey Salceda. He said, quote: This is not what good neighbors do. And he goes on to say: It was at the expense of neighboring countries which could not attract their own foreign concertgoers and whose fans had to go to Singapore, unquote. So anger among lawmakers in the Philippines, but allegations also made earlier in Thailand. In fact, from the very top, from the prime minister of Thailand who spoke out at a business forum in Bangkok mid- February. And he was the one who made that allegation. He said that Singapore paid Taylor Swift up to $3 million a show allegedly on condition of exclusivity rights of a Singapore-only arrangement in Southeast Asia. And Salceda also added this comment. He said, quote: If I'd known this, I would have brought the shows to Thailand, unquote. Now, we did reach out to Taylor Swift's concert promoter, and we are still awaiting comment from them. But we did hear from Singapore. And Singapore said, yes, it did grant Taylor Swift a grant to perform there, but it did not confirm the exclusivity arrangement. And today, its culture minister made new comments about the grant. Let's bring it up. This is what Edwin Tong said. He said: There have been some online speculation as to the size of the grant. I can say that it is not accurate and not anywhere as high as speculated, unquote. Also, he cited confidentiality reasons. That was the reason why he couldn't reveal the size of the grant or the conditions of the grant. Now, this week is the big tour happening in Singapore, the last leg of her Asia tour. Taylor Swift is playing six sold-out nights to some 300,000 fans there in Singapore, again, her only stop in Southeast Asia. So Singapore is getting a huge economic boost here. So huge, in fact, according to one economist at Maybank, he estimates that 7 in 10 concertgoers are coming into Singapore from overseas and that they're spending up to U.S. $370 million in Singapore on hotels, food and entertainment.

We know how that turned out. It ultimately turned into a PR disaster.But Singapore, using grant money, the exclusivity arrangement still not clear, the amount of money also still not clear. They're not revealing that data, but they did manage to bring in Taylor Swift for what appears to be an exclusive arrangement, the only Southeast Asian stop on her Asia tour.
