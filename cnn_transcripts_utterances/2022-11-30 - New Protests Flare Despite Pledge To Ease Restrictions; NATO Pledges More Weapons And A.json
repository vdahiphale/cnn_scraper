Why some Iranians are cheering on the team that beat them and a lifetime in the making a daughter reunited with her parents 51 years after being kidnapped. China's promise to ease up on some COVID restrictions hasn't been enough to keep protesters off the streets in a number of cities right across the country. I mean, look at that. That was the scene in northeastern China as crowds pushed back COVID police in hazmat suits with those big white barricades. Protesters in the southeast means meantime marched through the streets chanting lift the lockdowns. Police are also stopping people on the streets and on public transit, checking mobile phones and even calling people to find out if they're protesting. Now all this comes is China's top health officials are pledging to ease some COVID restrictions to reduce the impact on people's daily lives. For one thing they say lockdown should be lifted as quickly as possible after outbreaks. Now people around the world are demonstrating in solidarity with the protesters in China. Some gathered outside the Chinese Consulate in Toronto, Canada on Sunday, students at Harvard University in Massachusetts held up placards reading freedom of speech and free China on Tuesday. And in Hong Kong demonstrators carry pieces of blank white paper to symbolize censorship. The White House says protesters in China should not be harmed or intimidated.

You look at how defenders typically, it favors them because it slows down the movement in snow in mud, in rain. All of this certainly moves and slows the movement across that region.When you factor in 10 million people are in the dark you are without power, without source to heat that really makes this sort of a pattern that we're experiencing that much more dangerous. And of course, high pressure to the north, clockwise flow around it means winds and airflow is coming in from the northern reaches that are much, much colder. So over the next couple of days, we expect these temperatures to far -- fall far below normal for early December, which is essentially going to set the stage here for another round of dangerously cold weather. Notice the forecast lows in Kyiv, six below, three below in Kharkiv just towards the east there. So these temperatures running, but three to five degrees below seasonal averages and it just gets colder inside the next seven days. I want to show you that divide here in temperatures because off towards the western half of Europe, milder temperatures are expected but work your way into Ukraine into portions of Russia. It is an entirely different story with temperatures here really free falling over the next couple of mornings in the afternoons. One below to three below. Typically these temperatures should be about a one below across areas of Sumy to the north. Temps by this time next week are going to be as cold as four degrees below zero. With cold temperatures, you're talking about increasing the stress out were not only across the cardiovascular system. But of course a long term exposure to cold weather also reduces your ability to fight off any sort of infections. And that's why these sort of patterns lead to a lot of fatalities if they're long lived and unfortunately, it's just the beginning here with winter, still about three to four weeks away.",

And it seems to still be the case. Right? As you look at the coming days, it is very likely that they are going to continue with the police presence. We've already started to see that. Our teams on the ground have reported that that they started to see just more and more police officers physically showing themselves. Not to mention, you have the heavy surveillance infrastructure which is in place. So the cameras and the eyes that are always watching you. But then what's interesting with China and how the government will handle certain things is that there are relief valves it seems. I saw this with for example Dr. Li Wen Young (ph) when he passed away. There was a rocking of what felt like potential toppling of the government even some would say, you know. It's not like there was an instability that was growing there. And then it quieted down because it seemed in a strategic manner the government would allow certain valves to let off steam. Certain individuals and certain topics. Now this is much more widespread than what we saw from Dr. Li Wen Young's passing. And it was certainly more widespread than what we saw with the original Shanghai lockdown in the spring. The one I lived through.

And so he has stuck to it and state media has reiterated that it is scientific. That they stand by his approach in all of this. And so to do a reverse course and kind of try to move away from zero COVID in any sort of immediate manner, seems highly unlikely. What we could see and this is what seems to be the more likely route, is that there will be some easing of certain restrictions in certain places. And you're starting to see that be communicated in certain state media where they're saying for example in Beijing not to block buildings. They're saying not to lock down entire compounds like ours was. It's just one building for example has a positive case. So they are trying to show that there is perhaps an easing in some regards. However Paula, one of the things that we know from Wuhan early on is that there will be a scapegoat in all of this. And it is likely going to be somebody at the local level or individuals at the local level who will be blamed for a lot of this.
