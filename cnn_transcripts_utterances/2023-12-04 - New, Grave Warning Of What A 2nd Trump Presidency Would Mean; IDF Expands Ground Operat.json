New urgency in the chorus of concern now for what a second Trump presidency could would mean, including for more and more members of the Republican Party about the Republican front runner. Former Reagan official, Robert Kagan, calls this a Trump's second term, a quote, clear path to dictatorship in the United States. And former speechwriter for George W. Bush, David Frum, he put it this way, instantly would plunge the country into his -- into a constitutional crisis.Liz Cheney, former Republican member of Congress said just this morning that if Trump wins, he'll never leave. So what's Donald Trump's response to all of this? It's not me, it's President Biden that democracy should fear. Let's get over to CNN's Kristen Holmes, once again. Kristen, hearing from Liz Cheney this morning saying that if you vote for Trump, it could be the last election you ever get to vote in. These -- what is behind this urgency we're now hearing from more and more Republicans?",

And so what you are seeing is these Republicans who do not support former President Trump coming out and talking about what a Trump 2025 agenda or a second term would look like.And that really has been Joe Biden's biggest argument against another Trump term. He has said that if Trump was to be reelected, that it would be a threat to democracy. He essentially, just to remind our viewers, is facing charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election, one of our democratic institutions. He has also questioned the legitimacy of all of our elections, even at one point called for the termination of the Constitution. But now he is saying that it is actually Joe Biden, that is a threat to the country. And he's using an argument that he's used before, saying that the four indictments that he has been currently charged with are all because Joe Biden is using his position as president to weaponize the Justice Department and take it out on his political opponent being Donald Trump. Listen to what he said this weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Joe Biden is the destroyer of American democracy. And it's him and his people. So if Joe Biden wants to make this race a question of which candidate will defend our democracy and protect our freedoms, and I say to Crooked Joe, and he is crooked, the most corrupt president we've ever had, we will win that fight and we're going to win it very big.

In fact, he actually has said that he would put the entire Justice Department underneath presidential control, effectively making the executive branch more powerful and giving it unprecedented levels of power.Now, the other thing I want to talk about is what Donald Trump outlined for his second term agenda, should he be reelected. And that was about health care. Now, I know this is a big pivot here. But it is critically important towards a general election, should he be the nominee, he has continued to attack Obamacare. This is something that is actually giving Democrats fresh ammunition as they go into this potential general election rematch between Trump and Biden. They like the Affordable Care Act. And actually most of America, if you look at the polling likes the Affordable Care Act. And it also has accelerated plans for Biden to start campaigning on what he would do in a second term when it comes to health care. We have some of that reporting here from our colleagues, Arlette Saenz over at the White House, but preparing health care measures that he would aim to pass in the second term would include expanding Medicare, drug price cuts, making enhanced federal premium subsidies permanent and expanding Medicaid. Clearly here, they want to be running on health care. Again, it is a favorable program here in the United States. It is not something that they want to run away from. Republicans on the other hand, they don't want to touch that with a 10 foot pole.",

I think there's been a growing realization that this is the person likely to be the Republican nominee. But this is not the same candidate, I think from 2016 and 2020. This is someone who has escalated that sense of rhetoric and is now promising policies to really put these things into action.My colleagues who have been focusing on Trump 2025 really lay out three areas where he would really shift in comparison to what the Trump we knew as presidency, that goes to kind of weaponizing the Justice Department kind of as we heard that those sort of drain the swamp, fill the bureaucratic jobs, with people who are more supportive of Trump, but it also goes to expanding military powers for immigration, and most importantly, just the general expansion of executive power. This is a president who's really pushing to really unify power in the executive branch and really go after kind of checks and balances that have grounded American democracy for a long time. So although it kind of feels like a stale, a presidential race that might feature Biden versus Trump again, I think that's a mistake. This is a different Donald Trump.

This was all about him getting revenge on his perceived political enemies. I do think that voters are paying attention to that. They were paying attention to that also in 2022, because when I was out in states, like Michigan and Georgia, a number of voters, some swing voters, Democratic voters said that they were very worried about what they were hearing in terms of election lies. And the President has continued that, essentially -- the former president has continued that essentially saying that if he were to lose in 2024, that the entire system will have been rigged. The only way it isn't rigged as if he were to win again. So I think that despite the fact that, yes, the economy is going to be important. Yes, health care may be important.

And many of them see his presidency as having been stymied by Congress by checks and balances, and really look at this version of Donald Trump as someone who can, quote unquote, finish the job, but doing so of going outside of the kind of norms of legislating that I think we have seen consistently.And so I think Congresswoman Cheney is correct to kind of call that out, because that's the evidence that we have seen from Donald Trump since day one. He's not someone who is kind of going to be deferential to democratic norms or to checks and balances. But the important thing about this Trump campaign is they've actually been very strategic in terms of infusing the Republican Party with a lot of state party officials that are supportive of his every move. And so not only do you have kind of Donald Trump at the top of the ticket, who is pushing these policies, but you have a Republican Party, that from top to bottom is still his. And so at this point, you really can't count on that kind of internal check from the party to really push back on him. And I think that's what Congresswoman Cheney is really isolated.",

And this new video just into CNN from Khan Younis showing a two-month-old baby being examined by doctors, his father is saying he was injured during a strike today.The little boy was born on the second day of the war, living his entire young life in a war zone. His father says they are from the north and evacuated to Khan Younis thinking, as they were told, it would be safe but quickly found nowhere in Gaza is safe. CNN's Ben Wedeman is in Jerusalem for us.

There were a lot of strikes on villages and towns to the east and to the north of Khan Younis. Now, it's worth noting that of course, that the Israelis advised the inhabitants of Northern Gaza to move to the south, where they presumably would have been safe. But that clearly is not the case.And of course, many of those are people who left -- who fled to the south are crammed into U.N., schools that have been converted into shelters where the sanitary conditions are very bad. We've heard for instance, from the spokesman from UNICEF who says that there are approximately 400 people to every single toilet. And that's if there is a functioning toilet. Also overnight, we know that Deir al Balah which is in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, south of Wadi Gaza, which was sort of the dividing line over which Israel told Palestinians to go to. The last functioning bakery in Deir al Balah was destroyed overnight. In fact, we've been seeing video of local people just ransacking that bakery looking for flour, cooking oil, in fact, even wood that they can use to cook their food and to stay warm. So I think if Israel is going to really ramp up its incursion in the south of Gaza, we're going to see despite what the U.S. administration advise the Israel's -- not the Israelis not to do which was incur huge numbers of civilian casualties. It almost seems inevitable that that's going to be the case. Sara?",

One of the missiles that was launched against these cargo ships was actually a ballistic missile. So the potential to really cause a lot of damage and casualties, but thankfully, it did not. But in addition to all of this, the rebels, the Houthi rebels, they also launched drones that appear to be heading towards the USS Carney. And that, according to U.S. Central Command, required that the warship shoot those drones down. So clearly things really escalating in the region yesterday, and the U.S. said, U.S. Central Command said in a statement that quote, the attacks represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security that have jeopardized the lives of international crews representing multiple countries around the world. And they also said really notably here that they have every reason to believe that these attacks while launched by the Houthis in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran. Now, the Central Command statement went on to say that the U.S. is considering all of his options for response here. Importantly, the U.S. has responded to attacks by Iran backed groups in the past. But clearly that has not deterred these groups from continuing to carry out these strikes on U.S. and allied and coalition partners in the region to date. John?",

WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, I think it means that U.S. deterrence needs to be stepped up. Iran knows that we the United States don't want and we made it very clear, we don't want a widened conflict in the region. So taking advantage of this by having their proxies do various things that are provocative knowing that the United States are believing that the United States won't respond directly against Iran.
