At a press conference earlier today, Austin reiterated U.S. support for Israel. He said he discussed the future of Gaza, though, and the protection of its civilians with Israeli leaders. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LLOYD AUSTIN, U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE:  So we will continue to stand up for Israel's bedrock right to defend itself. And we will also continue to urge the protection of civilians during conflict and to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. That's important as Israel fights to dismantle the Hamas terrorist infrastructure in Gaza. And it will also be crucial for our work with our allies and partners after the fighting stops. (END VIDEO CLIP) SANCHEZ:  Remember, Austin's trip comes just days after Israel's military says it shot and killed three Israeli hostages in Northern Gaza after misidentifying them as threats. CNN's Natasha Bertrand is following the latest developments from the Pentagon. But, first, let's go to CNN as Jeremy Diamond, who's live for us in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, Israel's now sharing new details about how this went down, the deaths of those hostages. Walk us through what you're learning.",

It goes as far as 50 meters underground, and it's part of a 2.5-mile network of tunnels. It does not cross from Gaza into Israel. But it did come out about a quarter-mile away from the Erez crossing, which is one of the main crossing points between Israel and Gaza, which is where Hamas terrorists attacked on October 7. They attack that crossing, and used it to get into Israel and attack some of those border communities. It's not clear that this tunnel was used on October 7, but it is an indication of the extent of Hamas has resources and its abilities to build out these tunnel networks, hundreds of miles of which exists, according to Hamas leaders. Now, interestingly, the Israeli military actually says that they secured and -- they discovered in secure this tunnel weeks ago. It was only over the last couple of days that they actually chose to reveal it to the public, which is some indication of where they want to shift the spotlight, especially as there is mounting U.S. pressure over mounting civilian casualties in Gaza. Clearly, they are choosing this moment now to reveal this tunnel and put the focus back on that.",

But he said a number of times in his remarks, very subtly, that the U.S. does see this campaign operating in different phases. And he mentioned more than once that the next phase could potentially be that more limited scope of an operation that perhaps will not lead to the high number of civilian casualties that we are seeing right now. Yoav Gallant, who is the Israeli defense minister, he was not necessarily on the same page. However, it was a very nuanced kind of back-and-forth. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Behind the scenes, we have been reporting that U.S. officials have been putting pressure on the Israelis to transition to a more surgical, targeted approach, ideally by the end of December, but perhaps by early January, because of the mounting international pressure and condemnation on Israel's campaign in Gaza that has killed so many civilians, guys.",

And they're not going to stop until they do that.Commanders expect losses. There's going to be the collateral damage of civilians, and what happened to those hostages is going to cause the tactics to change on the ground, the rules of engagement, perhaps get the message out to try to figure out a way where hostages can signal IDF soldiers. But when you're on the ground, face-to-face in what is the most difficult combat operation, that's urban operations there within such a built-up area with so many civilians, of which Hamas hides behind, it -- it wasn't a good expectation that they were going to get 100 percent. So, to your point, the tactics will change, but I don't think the strategy is going to change a bit.",

But, again, like I said, commanders expect losses. They don't want -- they recognize that they're losing the propaganda war. I had reports of the Gaza Health Ministry reporting 20,000 deaths. Who knows whether that's right or not. I mean, there's no one that really understands. We can't take anything that's coming out of that side as the truth. So I think that it's not that it's lip service. I think that they're doing what they can to try to maintain the high ground in order to, again, defeat Hamas on conventional terms. They'd have to get some kind of surrender. Hamas is trying to drag Israel down to their level, fight this behind civilians, and make it look like Israel is killing civilians. Israel is trying to propagate it on what are using the wars of law and land warfare.",

I think the challenge there is, those senior leaders are surrounded even by more civilians, and they're not necessarily in Gaza. They're throughout the world. That's going to take special operations. Those are those surgical things. Look how long it took for us to try to find Osama bin Laden. I mean, so I think that is something they have to be very, very careful with. And if you talk about the Hamas soldiers hiding behind civilians, those Hamas leaders are hiding behind layers and layers of civilians. They're with their families.

The influx is creating a humanitarian crisis that's overwhelmingnearby towns and also straining the resources of cities far from the border.

In the first two weeks of December, there are more than 37,000 apprehensions in the Tucson Sector alone.

If he's campaigning about passing more restrictive immigration policy, and his allies wind up backing them in this sort of compromise bill, doesn't that deliver a win to the White House? RAJUAnd Donald Trump undoubtedly will come out then in that case and rail against it. That would make it much harder. Even if the Senate Republicans, Senate Republican leaders get behind this deal, Senate Republicans are a part of this deal, that would make it much harder, in particular, getting this through the GOP-led House, where Donald Trump has enormous influence, including with members of the Republican leadership, which just raises a lot of questions here. But even if a deal is reached in the Senate, they're able to get something through, can it pass the House, where Republicans could rebel against it? Some of those hard-liners told me that they will not support a bill that compromises from the GOP's hard-line position, a bill that passed earlier this year known as H.R.2. Senate Democrats say H.R.2 should go nowhere. Donald Trump, in a lot of ways, his rhetoric goes further than H.R.2. So it shows you the real challenges in getting things done, and not to mention members on the left, progressives, in particular, are raising serious alarms of the concessions the White House is making for more restrictive border policies, expanding expulsion authority, and the like, which shows you the very difficult and narrow path to get a deal that can become law -- guys.",

President Trump said that migrants and illegal immigration was poisoning the blood of this country. And, obviously, when you talk about Nazi rhetoric, it's similar to the writings of Adolf Hitler, when he mentioned poisoning in regards to foreigners coming into Germany at that point. So those are the correlations that experts are looking at on this front. But what is clear is, we're a month away from the Iowa caucuses. And this wasn't just a turn of phrase. It's something that he has said repeatedly. He did so an early October as well. So it seems to be part of at least some sort of strategy to make sure that this is what voters are hearing from him in this final run-up. But it wasn't just that. He also framed what would potentially be a general election between him and President Biden. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  Joe Biden is a threat to democracy. He's a threat. Even Vladimir Putin -- has anybody ever heard of Vladimir Putin? -- of Russia says that Biden's -- and this is a quote -- politically motivated persecution of his political rival is very good for Russia, because it shows the rottenness of the American political system, which cannot pretend to teach others about democracy.

Separate -- while it's not a direct response, Nikki Haley's campaign did just come out with an ad saying that she wants to leave behind the chaos of the past, which many have looked to as being a reference to people like President Trump and comments like these. So we're going to continue to see sort of where these candidates paint the lines of where they stand on these particular issues. But, clearly -- and Haley, for one, is someone who has been searching in places like New Hampshire, for example, and are hoping to capitalize on some of the pitfalls that someone like the former president has, despite him having amassed this lead, at least as far as what polls have shown, over what has now been months.
