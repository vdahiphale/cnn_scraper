But what Trump does is he plays the rep, whenever there's accountability, he tries to make it look like that'll be bad politics for the people imposing accountability, even when it's a matter of law at a party that allegedly believes in law and order.The argument that the candidates are making in private in their campaigns are saying, \"Hey, see, we told you he'd be a chaos candidate.\" Obviously, this is more chaos. You're going to really nominate someone who couldn't be disqualified from the ballot who's already under indictment, all these further unknowns. Yes, there's some short-term rally around Trump impacted could have.

So it's -- it's part of this idea of justice under the law. I also think it's part of this argument that some of the -- one of the dissents, or actually several of the dissents in this case have pointed out is that the due process clause has not been followed in the -- in the way that this has been executed. With that being said, I think the other argument to be made is how do you hold someone accountable for their participation in an insurrection which everyone saw. And in fact, at every single level of this case that we've, you know, that we've seen up to this point, the one thing that has been in agreement is that Donald Trump did participate in an insurrection, that he tried to overthrow democracy. I think there is, you know, the real point of contention is going to be, does he have the right to essentially a trial by public, as opposed to a court handing down a decision on these issues?",

And the people decided, and he tried to overturn the results of the people, so keep that in mind.Second thing is, in his second impeachment, a majority of members of the House of Representatives and Senate said he was guilty of insurrection, that was the charge inciting an insurrection. They did not hit the constitutional threshold for impeachment in the Senate to convict, but majorities of both houses said he had committed insurrection, incited insurrection. That could be relevant going forward. I think it shouldn't be relevant. And so just, you know, all the legalisms around this stuff. Keep in mind, the bigger picture the constitutional principle, and we are in unprecedented territory. Yes, that's because we've never had a president trying to overturn an election before.",

So there are two sort of sets of questions the Supreme Court would -- would weigh. And there's some procedural ones that are mentioned.But first, just on the pure substance, the question of did he engage in an insurrection? You know what the 14th Amendment says it covers individuals who have engaged in some way in an insurrection and how is that defined? Donald Trump has not been convicted of insurrection. But the lower court judges have said that, you know, this would apply -- apply to the conduct from January 6, 2021. The other question, though, and it came up in a lower trial court judge in Colorado heard the case, does this section of the 14th Amendment even apply to the president? That's a very real substantive question. And then to go to another procedural issue, Poppy and Phil, who -- who is it that exactly decides whether a certain name is on the ballot or not? Here, there's a presumption that it is the state officials in Colorado because that's how they've -- they've assessed this. But, you know, there are some arguments that could only be Congress assessing that. So the Supreme Court will have some threshold issues of, you know, timing, and who can actually bring such a case, but then also very serious, substantive ones having to do with, should Donald Trump even be covered by the 14th Amendment section at issue here?",

You know what, I keep hearing is, at this point in 2019, no one knew who -- no one knew what COVID was. Trump hadn't been impeached yet. So a lot is going to change.

They think that Biden has been consistently underestimated, not just during his time, as President, you know, all you have to do is look at recent elections, or, you know, the midterms, when everyone assumed that Republicans were going to have this big wave, and then Democrats overperformed, with Biden as president.But if you look at the 2019 to 2020 experience, a lot of them look at what's happening now and say, you doubted us, then we won that primary, we won that election, folks get on board. This is, you know, we know what we're doing here. That briefing that I wrote about, you had a number of the top people from Biden world, talking to people who they used to work with their, you know, these Obama administration and Obama campaign alums, and essentially trying to run through the game plan here. Listen, a lot of people on the Obama team said, \"Fine, we get it. It's not going to look very good for a while, but eventually it will.\" But a lot of them walk away saying, \"I get it. I'm not questioning this specific strategy.\" But are you really mean to tell us that there's -- there's nothing else. There's nothing else you can do right now.

Democrats weren't doing that which they will this time. But the other, you know, fundamental thing is he's the incumbent now. He's the president, he has to run on his own record.Now, there's not really like a consensus view of how to message on the age question. How to even message on the question of the economy, which, you know, they say, listen, that all the big numbers are going well. But there's a real divide even within his world over, do we just go around and tell people the economy is getting better. Or as Biden himself often likes to say, do we need to acknowledge to voters, we get it. we understand that you're hurting right now. So there's not a really easy answer here. But he typically have a reelection campaign. You know, there have been other reelection campaigns where the incumbent is not looking so good approval rating wise, and then does come back to it, and just look at Obama himself in 2012, look at Bill Clinton. But a typically for that they're really betting that this race is not just going to be a referendum on Biden on the incumbent, it's really going to be a stark choice.
