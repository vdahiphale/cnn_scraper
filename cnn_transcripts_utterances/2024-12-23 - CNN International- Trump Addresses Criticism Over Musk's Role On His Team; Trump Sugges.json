Obviously, Trump will control the awesome powers of the presidency.But, I think beyond the politics, this gets to a very serious point about the huge influence that Musk, the world's richest man, who has billions of dollars of contracts from the U.S. government, will play when he has Trump's ear during the next presidency. He has, after all, been with Trump pretty much all the time since he won the election. He'll be heading this Department of Government Efficiency, which will be able to get rid of myriad regulations and rules which affect U.S. corporations, including his own.

That doesn't seem to be greatly a concern of Trump's.So, this whole question of the origin of the war is very important. It's interesting. Last week, the President-elect was saying that the war was going to be a tough one to solve, and I think he is correct, notwithstanding his previous pledges to end it within 24 hours, if he becomes the President. There is going to be some hugely consequential diplomacy in the early months of the new administration. That's not just going to be about ending the war in Ukraine, but the entire relationship between the United States and Europe is going to be bound up in this U.S. relations to NATO. Trump is going to demand, I assume, massive spending hikes on defense in order to get the Europeans -- or in order to stay involved in the Ukraine situation from the U.S. point of view. So, it's going to be very interesting to see what unfolds strategically beginning in January.",

He entered into the courtroom wearing plain clothes, but he was shackled at his wrists and at his ankles. He had two plain clothes officers escorting him arm in arm down the center aisle of the courtroom. And then, when he was seated at the table, there was a wall of officers around him. So, very hard to actually get a glimpse of him. You had a better shot when you could see him on the camera. And this is the first time in about a decade that they have allowed the broadcast of any proceeding in New York State Court, something that they had done at the request of media organizations. So, in the hearing, very briefly you just heard from Mangione sayingthat he was not guilty to these charges, and then they were talking about the case, as you saw his lawyer making her concerns on the record about the publicity in the case, about the perp walk with Mangione exiting the helicopter, walking down that long pier in New York City, and that was when he was going into federal custody, because he was charged last week with federal charges, including murder and stalking, in addition to the state charges that he was in court with today. So, his lawyer already teeing up this issue of the fighting jurisdictions, and that was something that came to a head as well when the judge asked who has primary custody of Mangione. He is currently in federal detention, and the state prosecutor said he believed that they did, because federal prosecutors said that the state case could go first, the judge saying, well, then he should be in state custody, but there is a lot that they have to work out to figure out where he is exactly going to be held, as he is awaiting trial on both state charges and federal charges in the shooting of the UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.

Other than that, it was just a big show.I think that the feds took custody of him to prevent an extradition hearing and all the discovery that would go with it. When feds arrest people outside the district, they're charged. They just do a removal hearing, and the judge only has to decide, yeah, he is wanted back in that district and send him there. And I think they wanted to get him back quickly, and I think that's the way the feds got involved.

As you pointed out, he was arrested in December 2018. He wasn't released until years later on August 2024, along with Evan Gershkovich, The Wall Street Journal reporter, both of whom the U.S. had determined were wrongfully detained.And I should note this look at Whelan's life in prison comes from our fantastic reporting from our colleague Jenny Hansler over at the State Department, who received about a dozen phone calls during Whelan's time in prison, as well as four handwritten letters. And that's where we get this look at Whelan's time inside of a Russian prison. He told her essentially what it was like there and what he would do to pass the time. Every morning, he would wake up and sing four national anthems. He held U.S., British, Irish and Canadian citizenship, and he would start his day by singing those national anthems. He would then try to write letters to not only certain journalists, including Jenny Hansler, but others as well as a way, not only of focusing in his mind and giving him something to think about, but also, of course, as a way of keeping his story out there and making sure it remained a cause, not only for the administration, but also for Americans in general, so they simply wouldn't forget about him as he spent time in prison. Of course, there were very, very difficult moments. He said he was excited to see that Trevor Reed and Brittney Griner were being released, even though it was difficult for him to not be a part of those deals. And over his time there, of course, he had some low and some very difficult moments, wondering if his case wasn't making any progress, if there was any progress at all. He did have the chance last summer, in August of 2023, to speak directly to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and he warned that he believed he was running out of time, that he wouldn't survive to see his elderly parents. His beloved dog had passed away while he was inside a prison. So, all of this is what he had time to think about, certainly lots of time, spending five and a half years inside of a Russian prison. Conditions, he said, deteriorated. The prison hospital was known as, quote, \"the bone yard\", because of the complete lack of medical care that was provided inside of that so-called hospital facility. Food was about as bad as it gets, and that's how he had to keep himself going for all of these years, until essentially the last bit of a period when there were six months of very quiet diplomacy between the U.S., Russia and about a half a dozen other countries to make that prisoner swap happen that allowed Paul Whelan to be a free man to come home for the first time in five and a half years since his arrest. An absolutely incredible story, worth reading all of it online, a look at Whelan's time inside a Russian prison, Jim.",

Our colleague, Jenny Hansler, would see on her phone a call from a Russian number, and she immediately knew after the first one that is who it was and what he was there to talk about. The calls ranged from six minutes to 30 minutes. The letters, four of those, ranged from one page to six pages. So, of varying lengths and in different degrees. He was able to share what it was like. He said on some of those calls for his burner phone, he was -- he was inside of a very small room, and other prisoners would give him cover to make sure that nobody was coming.When it was an official phone call, he says he believed he was being listened to, but the Russians essentially were at least somewhat OK with some of those official phone calls, and that, from his perspective, helped keep his story out there and that joyous moment of him coming home.",
