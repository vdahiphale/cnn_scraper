Now, could he have slipped across the border before they started doing that? That's possible because those borders are pretty close by but you don't to speculate on that. What advantage that he does have is that he's from this area. He knows this area very well. We do have some information from law enforcement sources that he had mental health issues, and that he spent time in a mental health facility this summer. But he does have the advantage of knowing the area, and of course, he can probably hide out. There are a lot of wooded areas around here. I just covered a manhunt in Eastern Pennsylvania for an escaped convict there who was caught in September and there were a lot of wooded areas, farmland areas. This area is not dissimilar to that areas. There are a lot of places where this man could hide, but they have brought a lot of assets to bear here for law enforcement. You've got the FBI, the ATF Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Marshals, in addition to the state police in the local police, tracking him. This is hundreds of officers tracking him. They've got some advantages, too. They've got canine teams, they've got air assets with heat detection capability, they're very good at this kind of thing.

Let's go to CNN's Jim Sciutto who is in Israel for us. Jim, interesting that the longer this ground invasion doesn't happen, the more we're hearing from government officials really talking about what to expect. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT:  Well, it's interesting because it may be that the ultimate ground operation could be different than originally imagined. Seeing this operation in the last 24 hours that the IDF also released video of, where they went into the north, carried out a few attacks, and then left again, it's possible that you see a series of attacks like that going forward, and that could amount to ground activity in South Gaza. It's also possible that the offensive we saw today, or rather the operation we saw today, was laying the groundwork for something bigger but it's not clear because we do know that U.S. officials, military officials that are advising Israel have, if not advised against, at least spoken of the risks of a large-scale ground offensive there using U.S. experience from its own operations in Fallujah and Iraq in the 2000s, which were deadly, took many, many weeks, with enormous losses. And advising for something that looks a little bit different, that is a combination of airstrikes and special operations raids. It's not clear. It's not clear what Israel has decided on.

I don't think you're supposed to see that in real life. Over 10. At least I knew there were shots. And then when I got on top of the bowling machine, it was a lot of ruckus back there.

So, did he go into the woods? Did he steal a boat or have one waiting? Where did he come out on the other side? That is unknown right now. And of course, did he have another car or find access another car because that could put him in the direction of the Canadian border where immigration, customs enforcement, as well as customs and border protection have all been notified, all have his picture, or it could put him south or west.

Over the summer when he was at Camp Smith, a New York National Guard training center, he went through an episode where superior officers learned that he said he was hearing voices. He was having thoughts about hurting soldiers. He was becoming unglued and they gave him a command referral, which is one without a choice, to a military hospital where he underwent a two-week psychiatric evaluation and observation where he was released after that period of time. And then we don't know much. We don't know what happened between September and October and the shooting other than he returned to Maine where he has a large piece of land, maybe a thousand acres, and where he legally possesses these weapons.

So, if we have time, we'll get to your thoughts on why or when we could see any more ownership from Prime Minister Netanyahu on this tragedy.

He's basically laying a vision. No one, certainly not President Biden, certainly no Israelis think this is feasible in the foreseeable future, meaning weeks, months, even a year. But here's the silver lining here. Because of the magnitude and the scale of what had happened, it, you know, it moved tectonic plates in the Middle East. And here comes the President of the United States and is basically saying, guys, this can't go on. So, I'm not saying the two-state solution is viable or workable or attainable, but you have to think about the so-called proverbial day after.
