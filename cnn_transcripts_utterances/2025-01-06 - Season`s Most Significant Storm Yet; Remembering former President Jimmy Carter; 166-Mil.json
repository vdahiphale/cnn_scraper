Hewas smart enough and tough enough to receive an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy. Just after graduation in 1946, he married Rosalynn Smith. His naval career took him from battleships to the new nuclear submarine program, but when his father died in 1953, he left the military and returned to Georgia, where he spent the next two decades running the family peanut farm business, and slowly and steadily beginning a political career that saw him elected governor of Georgia in 1970.",

Not everyone in Washington was happy to see him.Early on, Carter was accused of presidential micromanaging, of excessive attention to detail. That mastery of details enabled Carter to negotiate the Camp David Peace Accords, a deal between Egypt and Israel that led to a peace treaty ending decades of war between their countries. His most difficult presidential days came after Iranian militants took dozens of Americans hostage in Tehran in late 1979. They were held for 444 days, and eight U.S. servicemen died after President Carter ordered an elaborate rescue attempt that failed. The Iran hostage crisis was only one of the challenges that confronted President Carter. He and Rosalynn founded the Carter Center, in part to promote peace, democracy, human rights, as well as economic and social development all over the world. Carter monitored elections for fairness. He went to North Korea and Cuba and met with leaders usually shunned by the U.S., including representatives of Hamas, the Palestinian organization both the U.S. and Israel have branded as terrorists. In autumn of 2002, Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The culmination of an incredible career as a world leader and as a citizen.",

The geological time period divided into the Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous periods is known as what era?Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic or Cenozoic? Ding, ding, Mesozoic era is your answer. Also known as the age of dinosaurs that lasted between 252 and 66 million years ago. Researchers say they have made a major discovery straight out of the Mesozoic era. Hundreds of dinosaur tracks that are around 166 million years old. Let`s go to the U.K., where our Samantha Lindell takes us to the site of the dig as scientists work to preserve the tracks and tell us what they have learned about the giants that left their marks long ago. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SAMANTHA LINDELL, CNN DIGITAL CONTRIBUTOR (voice-over):  The footprints you`re seeing now are 166 million years old. Researchers say it`s the most important discovery of dinosaur tracks in the U.K. for over 25 years. DR. EMMA NICHOLLS, OXFORD UNIVERSITY, MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY:  So, these footprints we`re talking about are 100 million years older than Tyrannosaurus Rex, which is mind-blowing. LINDELL (voice-over):  Five tracks made of approximately 200 dinosaur footprints were discovered in 2023 by chance at the working quarry.",

      "sentences": "So, over seven days, we coordinated 100 people to excavate these footprints and what we uncovered was just incredible.The footprints at the site are from at least two different types of dinosaur. A huge herbivorous dinosaur called a sauropod. Those are the ones with the very long necks and the very long tails, like Brachiosaurus or Brontosaurus. Those footprints are 90 centimeters long, the largest ones. The other type of track, the fifth track, was made by a carnivorous dinosaur called Megalosaurus. So, the great thing about what we call trace fossils is that it shows us dinosaur behavior. We`ve calculated the speeds that they were walking and they were walking at the same speed. They were both walking at about three miles per hour and that`s actually the same speed of an average adult human. LINDELL (voice-over):  The trackways lie across the working quarry, so they`re not safe for the public to visit. But scientists are figuring out how to preserve them so that people can see the dinosaur footprints in the future. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
