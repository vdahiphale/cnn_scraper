Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news. NATO calling an emergency meeting after NATO member Poland was hit by what Poland just moments ago confirmed was a Russian-made missile. Two people were killed. NATO Secretary General Jan Stoltenberg, will chair the emergency gathering tomorrow morning. And President Biden, just finishing a call with the polish president, the call happening just before midnight, Warsaw time. The readout that we have showing that Biden offered full U.S. support for the investigation and reaffirmed the United States' ironclad commitment to NATO. The situation, an urgent one. These are pictures of the missiles impact today. It left behind the crater you see here and killed two. It happened here -- I will show you on the map -- a village, just four miles from the border of Ukraine. This is our first view that CNN filmed at the scene because our Matthew Chance is there. Where that missile hit at the site, I'm going to talk to Matthew in a moment. The situation is moving very quickly as we speak. Poland's president, saying he may invoked article four of NATO, which allows for any NATO member to consult with the entire alliance if, and I quote, it's territorial integrity, political independence, or security has been threatened. And the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy tonight sending this plea to Ukraine's allies and NATO. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  Hitting a NATO territory with missiles is a Russian strike against collective security. This is a very significant escalation. We have to act. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CBS News recently reporting that nearly 5,000 of the U.S. Army's 101st airborne division deployed to Europe for the first time in nearly 80 years. They went just miles from Ukraine's border according to report, and the United States now has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland. A missile hitting Polish soil, could be a major moment in this war. And if this was deliberate, article five of NATO treaty is clear. Quote, the parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all. Well, we are covering this development story tonight from all angles. Phil Mattingly is traveling with President Biden in Bali.

Even before news of what happened in Poland actually got to them. When that news arrived, Jake Sullivan, as you saw picture there with the president and the secretary of state, was briefed on that information. They spoke to his counterpart in Poland. And very quickly thereafter, they briefed the president directly. As you noted, just a couple of hours ago, the president spoke directlyby phone with Polish President Andrej Duda and in that phone call, the president received a briefing on the investigation up to that point from President Duda. He promised that the U.S. would give its full support and assistance for any further investigation, and also, as you noted, reiterated the ironclad commitment to NATO as it currently stands. It is something that he did on the ground in Poland in March, where he said very unequivocally that Article Five of the commitment to NATO was something that was an unbreakable bond. The president also spoke with Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, as you noted. On Wednesday, there will be an emergency meeting of the ambassadors to figure out the next stops. One thing we don't have any definitive conclusion on yet from the U.S. side is what exactly happened here. Officials tell me they're being very methodical, very cautious. They understand the states. They understand just how significant this moment could be. It is, to some degree. I want to be very careful as they move through this process. However, it is likely, you saw on that photo, the president's national security is here. Anthony Blinken, the secretary of state, the president both have events this morning. We will see what they have to say. The president is supposed to head back to D.C. in just about four or five hours. So, if he speaks, he will need to speak before them. We will see how this plays out over the course of the next couple of hours.",

The context is that across Ukraine, they're about 100 missiles fired today by Russia across all of Ukraine. And that context is obviously crucial.Do you think that the missile that landed in Poland, that hit in Poland and killed two people, came from Russia? LT. GEN. BEN HODGES, FORMER COLMMANDER OF U.S. ARMY FORCES IN EUROPE (RET.):  Erin, I think that -- I'm taking my lead from the Polish government. They have been so professional and measured and they are the ones that obviously are the victims here, so the fact that they have responded like this, I think says something. There is no doubt that this was a Russian missile, but was it intended for Poland? That's -- that's the question. What I would imagine is more likely is that this is the results of a successful Ukrainian intercept of the muscle and so, just the physics would have taken it further into Poland. The real question is, not only why is Russia continuing to go after civilian targets in Ukraine. Why would there be so reckless as to go after one that is so close to the Polish border? A NATO country, an E.U. country, and this is why I think it is reckless when we talk about, we should negotiate with Moscow, because of things like this.",

Poland tonight increasing its military readiness as Ukraine has been under mass attack today. Explosions reported in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih and other key cities.Ukrainian officials saying about 100 missiles were fired in Ukraine in the past 24 hours, with more expected. The missile attacks targeting critical energy infrastructure. Residential areas far from the front lines also hit by the barrage. The strikes, a stunning shift just days after Putin suffered a major battlefield setback and Ukrainian troops reclaimed the crucial city of Kherson. I want to go straight to our senior international correspondent, Sam Kiley, who was on the ground in Kryvyi Rih. And, Sam, you know, all of that contest of what we are talking about in Poland and NATO tonight comes as where you are was under mass missile attack throughout the day. What are you seeing on the ground? SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we've had periodically very loud sirens here. We had detonations either of outgoing anti-aircraft missiles are incoming missiles. It's a very long ridden shaped city, some 50 miles long, I understand. So, not all of the impacts are very visible or audible to us in a close sense. But across the country, it has been perhaps the heaviest level of bombardment, particularly by these cruise missiles. Long- range precision guided missiles by Russia. Possibly it has been seen throughout this war, certainly since the last round of major bombardments at the beginning of October. Some 10 million people have been rendered without electricity as a result of the bombardment, at least at the worst time. Of course, urgent repairs are ongoing. Those bombardments would come on top of, as I say, back in October, targeting critical infrastructure, which also therefore applies affects water distribution but, heat, of course, an attempt by Russia to break the civilian back of the country so that the military efforts start to fall apart. That's because, as you rightly point out, Russians have recently lost a very significant Kherson City which was the only regional capital they captured. It also controls the headwaters of the water supply, the freshwater supply to the illegally annexed Crimea. So, it's been a very widespread bombardment. In Kyiv, they killed two people, residential buildings were hit. And no doubt, really, in the mind of the president here, that these were Russian missiles fired into Poland.",

So, why he's doing it? It's a mystery. You can't really see that political advantage except for to get out in front of any other potential candidate or to get out and front of any potential indictment. Remember, this comes as he's facing serious criminal investigations, obviously in New York, at the Justice Department, both for January 6th and the classified documents he took out of the White House, and the case in Georgia.

I'm a block from CNN, and the police have blocked off the area for some reason, so I couldn't get in. Listen, every Republican I know is deeply frustrated by the president and what he's doing. Not only are they frustrated, I really do think the reason he's doing this is because Ken Griffin, the billionaire, decided to throw his weight around DeSantis, after so many of the major donors of the party said they were going to sit it out. Suddenly, you have what happened on election night. He's trying to get out there. The problem is, this is called panicking. And when panics in this way, it tends not to work out for him.

Some Republicans, many Republicans, in fact, are saying it's time for the party to move on.

But frankly, with last week's elections, it was clear to me, that particularly among independents, and they make up the balance; they decide the winners in a lot of these elections. They saw his speech last Monday night in Ohio. They witnessed a good number of the candidates that he supported around the country. They got a lot of attention. Many of them were deniers. They didn't win. And I think there were a lot of independents that said, I don't really want to go down that path again. He's hurting the party. He's going to be a significant player whether he's in or out. That's for sure. He's raised a ton of money already.
