Listen, it's about expanding the coalition, right? You know, early on, Kennedy had both, you know, some Democratic votes, some Trump votes. And now, you know, with Biden dropping out of the race, you saw a lot of Democratic votes that Kennedy was receiving sort of fleet. So he was -- you know, Kennedy was about to become a spoiler for Trump and that he got together with President Trump and he said, let's put a coalition, let's expand it and let's travel the country and make our case. And I think that's what you saw today. It was the first step. I think we're going to see more and more of it. And it is pretty, pretty significant in the sense that, you know, Kennedy ran as the outsider in this race. He was very much the outsider in this race. He was kicked out of the Democratic Party.

He was an alternative when Biden was running against Trump and people didn't want to vote between two old guys who they didn't like, and so RFK Jr. was able to get into the race and able to make some noise initially. Independent candidates, as you know, when it gets to election time, their vote total usually goes down to from where they were polling. RFK Jr. wasn't going to make a big difference in this race.

And so, right now, at any given time, Gallup has pointed out that roughly 80 percent of Americans support abortion rights in certain circumstances. Even in the most liberal of circumstances, progressive circumstances, unrestricted abortion rights, it's at roughly about 35 percent. There has never been more support in this country since Roe v. Wade for support for abortion, and now you have Donald Trump, who most people hold responsible for the overturning of reproductive choice, front and center.

This was an effort we had -- we had, probably a dozen photographers all around the venue and it's very difficult to move. And I was in the center position in a buffer area which was directly behind the family in front of the stage. And as the vice president was introduced and walked on the stage, her nieces were holding up handmade drawings that they had made. I couldn't see what they were, but they were holding those up. And, you know, we're working really hard to make a photograph that gives you something a little different that you don't see on T.V. and gives you some context and shows, like a reaction to the family and the people in the audience. And we're under very tight deadlines to try to get our pictures out and everything is moving very quickly. So, I made those images and I took a break. And I think I turned around to take a picture of Nancy Pelosi and Governor Newsom who were right behind me.

And I think it's, you know, there's no mistake that as she's delivering that speech and as her grandniece is watching her, she's delivering it 60 years to the day from when Fannie Lou Hamer delivered her speech to the Credentials Committee at the Democratic National Convention.

It matters if Joe Rogan goes on his show and says, hey, I actually think RFK, Jr. is someone that we should be listening to and supporting. I endorse Donald Trump.

About 56 percent of Republicans say they're very proud to be an American, 34 percent of Democrats. So, I mean, I really think for the survival of our nation, we do need to be patriotic. That being said, Mark Twain once said, \"You should support your country. Patriotism means supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves it.

Democrats have always been patriotic and have always run patriotic campaigns. This is not something new. Republicans have just used this and weaponized patriotism against Democrats because when Democrats speak out about certain issues, Republicans try to vilify them. So, one of the best comments I saw at the convention was by Governor Wess Moore of Maryland who said, loving your country does not mean lying about its history.

We can say, I love America. And we can also say America can be better, that the vision that we put forward is one of America, an America that is far more inclusive, one that is about freedom, one that is about having the ability to do these things. One of the things that I was really struck by was the story that he tells over and over again where he says that his grandfather was run out of this country by the KKK. And he says that I will never come back. And he says, knowing that he was like, I became the still became the first black governor of Maryland. I enlisted in the armed forces and I fought for this country because I love this country.
