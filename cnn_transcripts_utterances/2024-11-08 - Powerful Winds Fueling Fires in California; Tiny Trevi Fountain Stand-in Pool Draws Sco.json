Your answer here is the Roman Empire, building the first aqueduct in 312 BCE and constructing the waterways throughout Europe, North Africa, and Asia Minor. One of the most popular tourist destinations in the world was actually built at the endpoint of an ancient Roman aqueduct. The Trevi Fountain in Rome, Italy draws millions of visitors each year. And the 262-year-old landmark is getting some much-needed work done. Officials are restoring and cleaning out a decade`s worth of mineral deposits, grime, and junk stuck in the fountain. It`s all happening ahead of the 2025 Vatican Jubilee, which actually begins on Christmas Eve this year. CNN`s Barbie Latza Nadeau talked to some of the tourists there. Take a look.
