Officials there in Torrance, California, not providing a great deal of information to update us on what took place there in Torrance this afternoon, but we understand, from talking to our sources, that law enforcement officers with the L.A. County Sheriff's Department were able to enter a white cargo van earlier this afternoon. That is believed to be connected to the Monterey Park mass shooting that happened last night.Let me go to Camila Bernal who is on the scene there for us. She was just listening into that press conference. I guess the one useful thing that was said there, and of course, totally understand that they want to, you know, reassure people in that community that things are safe, and that, I suppose is the purpose of that news conference, which is all well and good. But the useful thing that came out of that news conference is that they did announce there's going to be a separate press briefing later on this evening here on the East Coast, but later in the afternoon for you there on the West Coast. It sounded as though he said 4:30 in the afternoon, so that's 7:30 East Coast time where L.A. County officials will be -- is that right, Camila -- drawing some sort of connection or at least laying out to the public what took place in Torrance and how it relates to what took place in Monterey Park. What more can you tell us?",

County Sheriff's Department, they are not going to speak out. They will not have those confirmations for us.The one thing, though, that we did learn is that all of these agencies were connected. That that is how they were able to locate the white van because of the information that they received from the sheriff's office and that is why Torrance Police was able to stop the van. That is the only thing, essentially, that we learned from this press conference. That they did stop this white van, the Torrance Police Department. Now in terms of how it is connected, that is what they want us to wait and hear from the L.A. County sheriff. That is expected at 4:30 local time. You mentioned 7:30 Eastern Time because we're still waiting for that connection. We have heard from sources that have told CNN that this is connected. That this is, in fact, most likely the suspect in this case. And what we were told is that this white van was stopped and as it was stopped and they were giving that driver directions to get out of the van, there were at least one shot that was heard, and those sources believe that the man inside the van killed himself. And now we are waiting again for that confirmation from authorities, but that is how we got to this standoff with authorities here. That is how we got to the SWAT team and the helicopters and the many, many agencies that were involved in this massive operation. We were here for hours watching all of this happen, as authorities were telling us, essentially, to wait, because this was such a big operation for them. So many different agencies and so many members of different law enforcement agencies and of the SWAT team. We watched the drones, we watched as these SWAT vehicles surrounded that white van and eventually were able to enter that white van. Again, it appears that the body is still inside of that van, but we are waiting for confirmation from authorities. And we'll have to wait until 4:30 local time to get some of those answers -- Jim.",

Much more on our breaking news right now. As we have been discussing, throughout the afternoon, a tense standoff in Torrance, California, is now over. If you missed this footage from earlier today, it was quite the scene when police tactical units confronted a vehicle believed to be connected to last night's mass shooting in Monterey Park, California. Police, as you can see in this video right here, surveyed the van with an armored vehicle earlier in the afternoon and then officers went up to the vehicle later on in the afternoon, approached the van matching the vehicle subscription, description, and then broke that window and then went inside the vehicle. You can see the footage right here. This happened at about 4:45 this afternoon here on the East Coast, when officers broke that passenger side window and then opened up the side door of that van to search the inside of that vehicle. And it was at that point when officers discovered somebody slumped over the driver's side steering wheel of that van. Since then, we've seen investigators combing over that scene, trying to determine whether or not there was anything useful inside that van. And as we just heard from Camila Bernal, just a few moments ago, officials have announced another press conference coming up in about 90 minutes from now, scheduled for 90 minutes from now in Monterey Park, California, at the city hall there, near the scene of that mass shooting. Now, we also want note, police did approach a second van. We did tell you about this earlier this afternoon. They approached a second van a few blocks away from the standoff. Just to clarify all of this, the sheriff's department says they are working to determine if the driver of that white van has anything to do -- or if that van at all has anything to do with the first van that we told you about earlier this afternoon. We're waiting to find out if the driver of that first van is this person. The suspect that L.A. County officials put out earlier this afternoon. They believe he is responsible for opening fire on a Lunar New Year Celebration, killing 10 people, injuring 10 others, at a dance studio in this predominantly Asian American community, about seven miles outside of Los Angeles. Let's go now, if we can, to CNN's Natasha Chen. She is in Monterey Park for us, near the scene of that terrible, terrible tragedy. Natasha, what more are you learning at this hour?",

So there are still so many celebrations throughout the region, throughout the country today. Today is the actual new year. Yesterday was New Year's Eve.And so the sheriff tried to encourage people earlier as a public statement to say, you know, please, still, continue to do that. It is safe for you to do that. And one person we talked to said, you know, I guess, yes, I will still go, but it's important that these kind of incidents remind people to please be safe and be vigilant when you're out there. Another person spoke to the media this morning, saying that in his 15 years plus, in Monterey Park, he's never seen anything this violent. And that he supposes you can't avoid such incidents like this, even in safe communities anymore. And he also said that America's gun problem is out of control and that it's best not to go to too many public spaces now. So that's on the minds of these people here, which is, unfortunately, very similar to what so many Americans have thought following incidents of mass shootings like this for far too long -- Jim.",

Juliette, you've been with us all afternoon. You know, when this press conference comes up at 7:30 -- excuse me, 7:30 here on the East Coast, 4:30 on the West Coast, there's a lot of questions that need to be answered. I mean, first of all, we need to definitively hear from authorities whether or not the deceased individual in the driver's seat of that white cargo van that you're seeing some helicopter footage from KABC earlier this afternoon, whether the driver of that van is indeed the suspect.

It is the beginning, it's a way to define the year, as I'd said earlier. A friend of mine whose honors that day reminded me that the day and the night is to celebrate and set the tone for the year. And that's why they're so celebratory. And to have this happen is just devastating in ways that are greater than the fatality number.

It's interesting that the Torrance Police Department did offer just a tiny bit of information that Camila Bernal picked up on earlier on this evening. And that is that they did stop this vehicle. And they are the ones who I guess initially encountered this white van that we're looking at right now before the tactical officers went into it hours later and did what they're doing on screen right now. But how were they able to track down this person in such a densely populated area as Los Angeles County? I assume there's information sharing that goes on and it's quite extensive.",

They probably used surveillance video from a variety of locations. They may have probably did get a license tag. You know, there are a lot of white cargo vans. That's the most common color of the cargo van. So they probably had a license tag.They put out a BOLO, be on the lookout, which would go out regionally, and officers heard that and were on the lookout for a white van with a particular tag. That's what I'm assuming happened. And fortunately, they were alert enough to see it, call it in, and take the appropriate steps to stop the van. So, you know, that's something with information sharing, which is critical. There are a lot of avenues to do that. Obviously, in the old days, you used to call it a flash message, now it's called a BOLO, be on the lookout, but there's a lot of technology that can be applied to try to zero in on individuals. So, fortunately, it worked. I mean, we're very fortunate that they're resolving this as quickly as they were able to. And I would think, at the press conference, we'll find out whether or not the incident in Torrance is related to Monterey Park. I'm pretty sure that it is, but that's when we'll find out for sure.",

Obviously, now, they are looking to try to determine a motive.They may or may not have that information at this next press conference. If they do, then perhaps they will reveal what that is. But the investigation has just moved into another phase now. I mean, you have the tactical part of it, which is what we watched earlier today with the SWAT teams securing the van and so forth, but now you have the investigators taking over forensic examination of everything inside the vehicle. I mean, those kinds of things taking place. I don't know if this person had a home. If so, they'll be executing warrants to see what they can find there. Looking at that van, it looks like the person was living in that van for at least, you know, for a period of time, anyway. But there's a lot of information now that is going to be coming out, I think, over the next day or two, about this particular case. You know, you asked earlier about, how do you reassure the public. I don't know how you do it anywhere, to be honest with you. These mass shootings keep happening over and over and over again. And it's going to happen again. It's just a question of which community is going to be impacted. So there's only so much you can do to reassure the public. You know, you have these large events that take place. There are vulnerabilities that are there. It's just an unfortunate reality of what the world we're in today.

The \"L.A. Times\" is reporting that the person found slumped over in a white van in Torrance, California, is dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The van was believed to be tied to the shooting and was at the center of an intense standoff that got resolved earlier today.It is not clear if that person who died is the suspect authorities believe is responsible for the Monterey Park shooting. We're waiting for information from law enforcement officials on that. Joining us now is CNN's Natasha Chen. Natasha, I know you'll be following this press conference just coming up in Monterey Park in about 30 minutes from now. You've been providing us with live reports all day long. What more are you hearing from the community there? CHEN: Jim, we don't want to lose sight of the fact that there are people mourning the loss of loved ones right now and that there are still people injured who are in local hospitals. In fact, I spoke with a friend of someone who was at this party last night. This person is still looking for that friend and so this just goes to show that there are people perhaps to their family and friends still missing and unable to be located. So that's got to be just the most horrible feeling that these people went to a celebration to have a good time for, you know, the biggest holiday of the year for them and that they did not come home. So a lot of people still searching for answers. The very basic answers for some people of where is my friend? Where is my relative? Where is my loved one? And then of course, the bigger questions of why this happened. And so if we're just looking behind us here, that scene that you see behind us, the FBI mobile unit, that's near where the business was. This happened shortly after 10:00 p.m. local time and the sheriff did mention there was a second incident where they believed the suspect is the same person, went to an Alhambra dance studio where people there tackled and wrestled with him and took over his weapon. The sheriff would only say that it was not an assault rifle.
