Tragically, survivals -- survivors of sexual abuse are often repeatedly victimized and re-victimized over and over and over again by having nonconsensual images of themselves on social media platforms. There was a NCMEC study that pointed out there was one instance of CSAM that reappeared more than 490,000 times after it had been reported, after it had been reported. So, we need tools in order to deal with this. We need, frankly, laws in order to mandate standards so that this doesn't happen, so that we have a systematic way of getting rid of this stuff, because there is literally no plausible justification, no way of defending this. One tool, one that I think would be particularly effective, is a bill that I'll be introducing later today, and I invite all my committee members to join me. It's called the PROTECT Act. The PROTECT Act would, in pertinent part, require websites to verify age and verify that they've received consent of any and all individuals appearing on their site in pornographic images, and it also require platforms to have meaningful processes for an individual seeking to have images of him or herself removed in a timely manner.

One and different from the issue of child safety, but just in the broader contextof Section 230 and how to handle tech companies and the content on their sites and platforms, is a big focus for Donald Trump and a lot of conservatives is censorship. They very much think that these tech platforms have been unjustly targeting conservatives and limiting free speech. And so, in a different sense, he actually said many times that he wants to change laws, revise Section 231, to make it harder for content to be removed from these sites that maybe are labeled misinformation that Donald Trump has argued in the past, is not misinformation or disinformation. But also, I think something that actually Democrats may agree with on this is making it easier for sometimes the tech companies to be held liable. Those are some things that Donald Trump has talked about. And I mentioned this. But, he also, I remember, last year, when he was laying out a platform for potential changes, if he were to be President, he laid out what was called a digital Bill of Rights. So, I just wanted to pull it up, so I got this right, which would basically force government officials to get a court order before taking down online content and inform users if their content is being restricted or removed.

And we saw a little bit in that exchange where they were pressing the CEO of Discord, for example, said like, we don't have an algorithm, like, we don't decide.
