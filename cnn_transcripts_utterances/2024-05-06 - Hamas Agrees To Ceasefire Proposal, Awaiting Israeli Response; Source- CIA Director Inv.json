Right now, they're on a lunch recess.We're also following major breaking news out of the Middle East right now. Hamas has agreed to a ceasefire agreement proposed by the governments of Egypt and Qatar. We are now waiting for an official response from the government of Israel. Some important context here. This development comes after Israel ordered Palestinians in eastern Rafah, southern Gaza to evacuate just ahead of what was being describe as a limited Israeli military operation in Rafah. A source familiar with this operation tells CNN the intention was exactly what we're seeing now, to put a lot of pressure on Hamas to agree to a new ceasefire deal. I want to bring in CNN global affairs analyst, Kim Dozier, who's joining us. Kim, first of all, what do you think we're hearing from -- why do you think we're hearing from Hamas but still awaiting official reaction from the government of Israel?",

Hamas has blinked. It seems to have agreed to something. Now, we just have to figure out what. But this is the hope for the hostage families that at least 33 hostages might get out in the first tranche. It is also a hopeful sign for the people in Gaza, especially those people in Rafah, injured kids, et cetera, who are living in tents. It's going to be very hard to move them to the area that the Israeli Defense Forces have specified, which is on the coast near the sea, according to various WHO and other organizations trying to provide aid there. It doesn't have good sanitation or water supplies. So anything that delays that military operation, from their perspective, is a good thing. Let's just hope this really is legitimate. And a reason to hope for the future.",

So they say they are reviewing this and they are working out a response, which obviously is what we are awaiting to see what happens here.Alex Marquardt, thank you for that reporting on the U.S. role. Let's go to CNN's Nic Robertson, who is in London. Nic, I know that you have been speaking to your sources as we learn that Israel is reviewing this, which is not at this point a dismissal. They are looking to see what Hamas has agreed to here. What are you hearing?",

      "sentences": "Yes. And I think it's worth, when -- when we try to sort of analyze what's happening here, it's not just that Hamas and Israel have positions on this.There are things that Qataris want out of the deal. There are things that Egypt wants out of the deal. And obviously, things the United States wants to see come out of the deal as well, as well as other regional players. So there are many hands that are sort of shaping the way this moves along. And the mediators, like Egypt and Qatar, have quite a significant role to play. They talk directly to the parties involved, the parties, Israel and Hamas, and Hamas and the United States. They don't talk directly to each other. So they have a role and they have an influence and they have a way that they can help shape events. So the source that I've been speaking to, tells me that what Ismail Haniyeh, the political head in Doha of Hamas, is agreeing to may not be the entirety of what Israel wants. But the source is also indicating that there may still be something that could be added onto this, let's say, an amendment or something, that could be added on to this current discussion that could push it over the line. And if we go back just a few days. over the weekend, we were talking about the potential for a framework agreement. And if that framework was agreed, which did seem to come close and then didn't, that there would still be days-worth of talking to get through the details. Now is the hitch over part of the framework? Is the hitch over part of the detail? We don't know. But what I also understand from this source was that, over the weekend, as part of these negotiations, there was pressure on Qatar to provide some guarantees of some unspecified sort to try to help get the deal through from the original Egyptian proposed framework. So perhaps part of those discussions that we're learning that Bill Burns has had now with the Qatari prime minister, a really influential figure obviously in the negotiations himself, as well as separately with Hamas, the Qataris being the interlocutors there, of course, has potentially built a bridge for that part of the problem. And maybe we've just -- the ball has just moved a little bit. And now there may be this amendment that is yet to come. But I have to say this is unclear. And I think the sources that I'm speaking to don't have the complete picture. Again, I come back to that point, that everyone who's trying to -- (CROSSTALK)",

And we believe a military operation in Rafah right now would dramatically increase the suffering of the Palestinian people, would lead to an increase in loss of civilian life, would dramatically disrupt the delivery of humanitarian assistance, all of which is coming through. I'm actually not going to say all but the great majority, which is coming through Karam Shalom or Rafah and is being distributed inside the Rafah area. If you think about what it would do when you have people moving north to places where internal distribution lines are not currently set up and you're going to have to try to re-establish those in the middle of conflict in Rafah, we think that'd be very difficult, if not impossible to do.
