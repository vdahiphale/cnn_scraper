The gut check of North Carolina and Georgia obviously came through for them.And now we are told Donald Trump is on. He is making preparations to head over here to the convention center. This is where the official watch party is. And Anderson, we saw aides preparing a teleprompter on stage, heightening the lectern and the microphone to make sure it's ready. So a clear sign that we do expect to hear from him when that happens remains to be seen. And Kristen, obviously, as we've been looking at this, you know, Trump is famously very superstitious.

He pulls ahead and again you're going, you know, we cross past midnight to where we are now after 1 a.m. Pretty much a straight line across. Meaning what? She's not narrowing the gap as more votes come in right. Which you're trying to come back. It's pretty simple to look at at home. So there's those two there. And let's come over to the biggest of them all, the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Closer -- you see it right there, it's closer. But she opened up a big lead early on, that's the early votes. You see what happens then essentially, welcome to battleground Pennsylvania. They are just running in a straight line across. But the red line has stayed on top all the way across. That's close -- 51 to 48. But you know that's close but she needs it to narrow even more. Just a different way to look at it is just to see you're trying to find the trajectory. And is there any possibility that it's going to close and at the moment there's no evidence that those lines are coming closer together. Closest in your home state, the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. But again Donald Trump at 51 percent 191,000 votes ahead with 94 percent reporting in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. I just want to go back in time at the beginning of the night, I said, she's the variable, her first time on the national ballot as the presidential nominee. He was the constant. Not in my lifetime. Three elections in a row. The same Republican nominee for president. Well, Donald Trump getting 50 percent, 51 percent right now in Pennsylvania. You know, in 2020, he was at 49. In 2016, he was a 49. Trump was the constant right. The question Democrats always said Trump can't get to 50 in the battleground states so you have to eliminate the third-party candidates and just get above him. Just get above 49, get 49.5. Well, Trump tonight blew that part up at least where we are right now because he's above 50 in Pennsylvania. He's above 50 in Michigan where he was at 48 again. And you go back to 2016 -- 48. Trump was a constant. Except this year he grew, he grew or he's growing, anyway. We don't have the final numbers right now, but he's above 50 there. And then in battleground Wisconsin. I won't go back and forth again through it again. But he was a 47, 48 -- 2016, 2020. And there he is above 50 percent with, again, this state decided by 20,000 votes, two elections in a row. Donald Trump is ahead by 125,000. This state won by Joe Biden last time by 154,000 votes -- a big win for the Democrats here. Then the Democratic governor wins in 2022. The Democrats may gain in the legislatures. Democrats think Michigan is growing in their favor. Donald Trump's 243,000 votes ahead with 69 percent. Still some room there, maybe to see it happen. That's the one with the most outstanding vote. And Anderson, as I throw back to you the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, so critical to Trump cracking the blue wall, flipping the blue wall in 2016, his biggest disappointment when he lost it in 2020 -- still won't admit he lost it in 2020. And now you see in 2024 again with an 80,000-vote win for Joe Biden last time. Donald Trump, with 94 percent of the vote counted, Anderson. Up by 191,000 votes in battleground Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania outstanding in so many ways. Donald Trump has 50.9 percent of the vote. Kamala Harris 48 percent of the vote. Donald Trump with a 193,000-vote lead there with an estimated 95 percent of the vote counted in that great commonwealth. In Michigan, the Wolverine State, Donald Trump, 52.2 percent; Kamala Harris 45.9 percent. Donald Trump with a 253,000 plus vote lead with 71 percent of the estimated vote in the great state of Michigan. In Wisconsin now Donald Trump 51.3 percent; Kamala Harris 47.2 percent. Donald Trump leading by more than 121,000 votes with an estimated 90 percent of the vote counted in Wisconsin. John King those are the three blue wall states.

He is overperforming his 2016 and his 2020 performance in one of the states that is trademark to the Trump movement when you look at all that red in rural areas. So that's Pennsylvania.And you're looking -- well, let me just -- before I leave it, you're looking at, you know where's the math, right? Where's the math? Is it at all possible? I would say it's very improbable. But the votes, most of the votes that are outstanding are in Democratic areas. That's a fact. However, the percentages of those votes and the number of those votes that would have to come in to overcome 193,000 again, I'm not going to say impossible, but I'm going to say highly improbable as you look at that. So then you move over to the next one, the state of Michigan. This one is now up 71 percent. it was 63 percent the last time we looked at it. I think it was right here. Lapeer county just came in 70 percent for Trump, 69 percent for Trump. Modest-sized county. It's in the middle -- about it's about 23rd of 83 counties in Michigan. You see right there, you know. So again, the counties, the more votes that just came in that drove the percentage reporting up, right. If you're Harris, you're trying to catch up before that gets to 9,900. The new votes just came in and helped Trump. 253,601 again in Michigan. This was a big win for Joe Biden in 2020 -- 154,000 votes. It's a bigger win at the moment for Donald Trump, 253,000 votes in battleground Michigan. That's a big deal. Then we move over to Wisconsin. We're at 91 percent and Donald Trump is 120,000 votes ahead. That is 100,000 more votes than decided the state of Wisconsin in both of the last two presidential elections. It was 22,000 in one -- 20,000 in the other, it's 120,549 at the moment. 91 percent. So you look again, is it possible for the Democratic votes out there? This is where they're missing, the biggest -- the biggest basket. There's some good Trump circles here too. So if you look at that again I'm not going to say impossible. We have a decision desk that does that work for me -- us, for us, for you. I'm going to say that's improbable just looking at the math again with a lead that big. And we'll see how it plays out. I do want to show something. We're looking at Donald Trump above 50 percent nationally. You're looking at Donald Trump at the moment winning the popular vote, which he has not done in his prior two runs for the presidency by 5.1 million votes. So I just want to show you something. How is he doing that? Well, he's obviously overperforming what he did in 2020. That's sort of a simple duh when you think about it. He's winning. So he's obviously overperforming 2020. These are states where he's outperforming himself by 3 percent or more. That doesn't matter as much to me. Why don't I get to -- I want to get you to some of these counties. So you look at these places, Jake, we talked about this earlier. New York, you are looking at that. All throughout New England -- Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts -- he's you know, he's performing better than he did in 2024. But I want to look -- remember the last couple of weeks in his campaign, where's Nikki Haley? Why isn't she with him? Why is he demeaning the vice president calling her stupid? Why is he beating up on Nancy Pelosi? Why is he so dark on immigration? Why isn't he trying to reach out to the middle, to the suburbs. Why -- he's going to repel people away? Well, guess what? If you come here. Well, let me start here in Arizona. He's not winning 60 percent of the population in Arizona, lives in Maricopa County. She's leading in Maricopa County. Donald Trump is not overperforming in Maricopa County but look where he is overperforming, in Republican areas. The big conversation has been you know, well, he got 2016, got more votes in 2020. There are a lot of Democrats saying there can't possibly be more Trump voters out there in rural America. Well, yes, there are. He's over, you know, smaller counties, Apache County here, only 6 percentage, too. So more votes coming in from here. And then you come over here, you know, Navajo County and down here in the southern part of the state, Yuma County 64 percent of the vote. Again, you think oh, boy. But, you know, that's double. That's almost double. When you look at the raw vote count there. So how does he do it, right? So that's just -- that's Arizona. You come up to Nevada. Again, it's not in Clark County. That's Vegas and the suburbs around it. But in these other places that's -- you know, the end of the campaign when everyone is obsessed about why is he only talking to his base? Well, he was talking to those people and they turned out and he overperformed in a lot -- in a lot of Republican counties. Most of the places he overperformed dramatically. This is by 3 percent. You'll see suburbs where he -- well, that'll be something were talking about in the weeks -- days and weeks after too, by 1 point or 1.5 points. This is 3 percent or more, right? So when you look at this, don't think about California yet. Let the votes be counted.",
