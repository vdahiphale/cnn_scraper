The Florida Governor and likely presidential candidate drew a line in the sand when he told Fox News that he doesn't think protecting Ukraine is vital to U.S. interests. Instead, he called it a territorial dispute and a distraction from bigger challenges here at home. This morning, some top Senate Republicans are pushing back. Listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARCO RUBIO, (R) FLORIDA: Well, it's not a territorial dispute in the sense that any more than it would be a territorial dispute if the United States decided that it wanted to invade Canada or take over the Bahamas. SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: To say this doesn't matter, to say that war crimes don't matter. He's going to go beyond Ukraine, Putin. If you don't get that, you're not listening to what he's saying. This is the chance to stop Putin before it gets to be a bigger war. And China is watching. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's according to a new report from the Alzheimer's Association.Joining us now with more on the explanation behind this is CNN's Senior Medical Correspondent, Elizabeth Cohen.

So let's take a look at what this number looks like. 2023, 6.7 million people ages 65 plus in the United States with Alzheimer's dementia. By 2050, that jumps to 12.7 million. That is a huge jump in such a short period of time.We talk about the implications of this. We need more geriatricians in this country to help take care of these folks. We also need better treatments. There are two drugs out there that are quite new that try to -- that really sort of change the course of Alzheimer's, not just treat the symptoms, but actually get to the underlying biology. But there are a couple of issues. One, there's a lot of debate about exactly how well they work, and there are some side effects. In addition, they are super expensive. There's an excellent chance that someone's insurance is not going to pay for them. So more drugs in the pipeline. Hopefully they will work well, and hopefully they will not cost a ton of money.

It's not because your doctor necessarily can give you a drug that your insurance will pay for and that will work well.

Now, I'm not saying that these companies should be going as far as Elon Musk. I mean, he's made such drastic cuts that there's now some pretty serious problems with the product.

With Mark Zuckerberg saying, these cuts yesterday mean that flatter is faster and leaner is better. That is the new mantra in Silicon Valley. HARLOW: I just don't know if it's safer. I mean, a lot of those cuts at Twitter came in, you know, some of the safety and monitoring departments.

This new version that's being introduced today, ChatGPT-4 has about a 90% chance of passing the bar. It also can take images and output text.Now, Poppy, that's new. In the previous version, you could put in a text query or a question and get text back, but you couldn't use an image to get text back. And that's just a game changer for the use cases of this technology. You could take your phone and scan a picture of a sales presentation and they could, within seconds, put an output summarizing what that presentation said. Major implications for business but to your point about safety, there's also a lot of challenges about what this means for misinformation.",
