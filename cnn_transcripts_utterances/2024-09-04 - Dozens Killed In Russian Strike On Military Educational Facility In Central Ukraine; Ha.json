Two ballistic missiles striking the academy within seconds of each other, putting much of the building damaged and destroyed. Rescue crews searching through debris. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Russian scum, in his words, would be held accountable. He also pleaded for more air defense systems from the US. In a statement, President Biden did not directly answer that that request, but did say, make no mistake, Russia will not prevail in this war. The people of Ukraine will prevail, and on this tragic day and every day, the United States stands with them. Fred Pleitgen brings us very latest now from Kyiv. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNTIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Parts of the military educational facility almost completely destroyed. Dozens killed here. The Ukrainians say when two Russian ballistic missiles struck, leaving those on the ground with no time to get to bomb shelters. More than 200 were also wounded and a nearby hospital damaged. Ukraine's President irate. ZELENSKYY (through translator): The Russian scum will undoubtedly be held accountable for this strike, and once again, we urge everyone in the world who has the power to stop this terror. Air defense systems and missiles are needed in Ukraine, not in the warehouse somewhere. Long range strikes that can defend against Russian terror are needed now, not sometime later. PLEITGEN (voice-over): Russia has been accelerating its aerial bombardment of Ukraine, cities and infrastructure, a massive barrage aiming for the capital Kyiv early Monday, just as children were gearing up for the first day of school after summer break. One of the places damaged a management college. ANASTASIYA, STUDENT (through translator): I got up and it had already started to boom. We ran out into the yard near the dormitory. We heard something flying and something being shot down. PLEITGEN (voice-over): On Sunday, more than 40 people injured after Russian air strikes on the northeastern city of Kharkiv, responders desperately trying to save the victims. There's an ambulance on the other side, the photographer says. We won't be able to carry him there, she answers. While Ukraine's air defenses often take down Russian missiles, the consequences can be devastating when they don't. The strikes on Poltava were one of the deadliest single attacks since the start of the war. We were on hand when a ballistic missile annihilated a funeral wake in eastern Ukraine in October of last year, killing 59 people and 46 were killed in Dnipro in January 2023 when a heavy cruise missile blew a giant hole into an apartment block.",

And Poltava, you know, wasn't at the top of the list, and it might be now, but it wasn't.

I think what they're saying, what Israeli citizens now understand is that the two bills that signed for the war by the Israeli government, the destruction of Hamas and the return of the hostages, are mutually incompatible. Most Israelis have lived for the past year under the illusion thatthey are at the very least commensurate, and to some extent complimentary the death of these six hostages, which was entirely preventable, the understanding that they died right there and then and not in some far away country, which is the way most of us think of Gaza. I think that death has snapped the illusion that the strong Hamas brings the hostages home. So at the very least, there's distrust of the government. There's no profound sea change as far as what Israelis are thinking. They still think of war as the only possible option. But there's major distrust of the government, a lot of anger, a lot of confusion. I think that should be leveraged towards gradually taking the Israeli government's executive authority away from it, stripping the Israeli government from any option of actually doing something obstructive, as it has done so far.

The Justice Department has rewritten the allegations though, and because they filed the new indictment, he has to have a new plea entered. The way Trump is doing this, though, is different than the last time. Before he appeared in-person in court to tell the court he was pleading not guilty, but now he's doing it on paper. He doesn't want to have to appear in court. There is a hearing where his attorneys are going to be going before Judge Tanya Chutkan in the district court in D.C. on Thursday of this week. And so they're hoping that this piece of paper where Donald Trump has signed with his name in big black bold letters saying he's pleading not guilty, that that would be sufficient.

So just explain, you know, some of our viewers may not understand just how valuable, how important that sort of interference would be for the communist regime in Beijing. LONDON: Well, it's important enough, John that they paid her several million dollars over the course of at least about eight years from what we can see in a very robust 65-page indictment. China's concern obviously is relative to Taiwan and the rest of the world's relationships.
