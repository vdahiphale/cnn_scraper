Welcome to \"CNN Tonight\".The search is still going on at this hour for that submersible that went missing Sunday with five people on board. Rescuers spent the day scouring an area twice the size of Connecticut after hearing banging sounds this morning. The Coast Guard says they remain hopeful but, of course, the odds are getting steeper. Five people trapped under water in the dark and freezing cold with oxygen running low. In just a moment, I will speak with a man who is scheduled to be on that excursion but canceled his trip over safety concerns. One of his friends, though, is on board. Plus, in political news, Donald Trump is the GOP front runner for 2024, of course, but Chris Christie is trying to change that. We will show you how Christie's radical honesty approach is working, and can he convince fellow Republicans to do the same? My panel has thoughts. But let's begin with the ongoing mission to save five people trapped on board that missing submersible somewhere in the North Atlantic. CNN's Jason Carroll is live in Boston with some of the Coast Guard searchers are based. Jason, what does this search look like at this hour? JASON CARROLL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, the Boston Coast Guard has -- the Coast Guard here in Boston has made it very clear, Alisyn, that this is still very much a search and rescue mission. They want to make that very, very clear. But, you know, there are some headways here. I mean, you know, you are talking about the timing here. The time is most definitely running out. That is first and foremost. But, you know, family members, those who have been watching this for quite a long period of time now, are hanging their hopes on some of those noises, those noises that were detected. You remember they were first detected yesterday when you had this research plane, this Canadian research plane flying over the area, dropped a sonar buoy down, and then the so-called banging noises were detected. That was yesterday. Again, today, when speaking to the Coast Guard, they are telling us more of these noises were found. When I asked the Coast Guard, the head of the Coast Guard out here, the captain, I said, what more can you tell us about these noises? And he said, look, we just want to make it very, very clear that we don't know what the noises are. And so, what they've done is they've taken all that acoustic data, they've sent it to the U.S. Navy for analysis. And so, once they get back that analysis, they will have a greater sense of what those banging noises are. But you talk to the experts and they will tell you, look, these noises could be any number of things. I mean, the ocean is a noisy place. It could be sea life. It could be the titanic metal settling. It could be other vessels that are out there. So, these are some of the dynamics that they are looking at. But because they have detected some of these noises, the so-called banging noises, they have sent extra resources into that particular area where they are searching. What are those resources look like? Well, we are talking about some of these remote operated vehicles, ROVs, which are manned with cameras so they can go below the surface and search at deeper depths. So, those are being taken into the area. But, once again, time now running out. We are looking at less than 10 hours by some estimate in terms of how much oxygen might be left there on board. But again, the Coast Guard making it very, very clear this is still a search and rescue mission, and they're sending all resources into the area. Still a little bit of hope. Alisyn?",

We know about the air support out there, things like the Poseidon, capable of scanning for submarines, that is above the water, obviously, the ships out there on top of the water, all of them have some ability to reach in and figure out what is going on below the water.But when you start getting really deep, you start talking more about things like this, these probes that they can drop down. They can listen for things going on. And particularly, if you start talking about things like side scan radar, they're able to go down and actually take sonar pictures of the bottom of this. You may remember this from the Malaysian air flight that became lost and all the searching there. These this type of thing there. What can you do with this? Well, if you can get pictures in this manner, then you can say, well, we do identify something here, and it helps you actually go after a target. How good can these pictures be? Well, sometimes they can be really quite astonishing. They can show a lot of details and look for other things before. None of the pictures we are showing of this is from the site, by the way. If that happens, then you go back up, and that's when you start going to the robotic devices we are talking about. For example, from France, the Victor 6000, very deep diving, this can go to about 20,000 feet. It's a remarkable craft. It's got robotic arms on. It could cut loose this sub, if they found it down there, if it's hung up in some way. It can take a lying down to it. They can hook it to be pulled up. It can shoot video of it. This can be remarkable work. But, but really important here, it can only do that work if it knows where to go to do that work. And we are not to that point yet. We still don't know where this submersible is at this point, if it's intact. We just don't know any of that information. And everything that I have described here takes time. And that is what is running out. There's just so much ocean out there. And this is such a small craft. And it's in this three-dimensional environment. It is just a tremendous, tremendous challenge. Good on them for getting all these extraordinary assets out there to do this. They are all, though, poise for that moment when one of them figures out where it is, and then the race is on to see in these dwindling hours if they can save the people there, if they are still surviving.",

Bear in mind that they aim for 3,800.There were a few other things. I brought up the issue of certification with the company. It became obvious that they -- it became obvious to me that they did not seem to want to get certification, that they were going to call this an experimental sub and not certify for one dive (INAUDIBLE) multiple dives. That was outside of my risk envelope. Also, certain parts seemed to be, to me, to be off the shelf, maybe not ideal for the situation. I didn't like the small thruster motors on the outside and the cabling.

It could be snagged on -- it could be snagged on the Titanic wreck. It could be just dropped on the ocean. We don't really know what the situation is. I would not want to get into speculation. It is not fair on the family and friends of those who are involved to speculate on these things. And I think also, you know, the blame and why, we've got to leave this.

And who is that alternative? Right? And to your point about all the candidates being boring, I can think of two candidates in the history or in last 30 years that haven't been boring, and that's Trump and Obama. Right?

So, there's so much material that they -- that they -- that they can only sort of gingerly attack on is crazy to begin with.But also, they echo his own talking points at the same time they criticize him. They say, you know, the DOJ can't be trusted, but this indictment is very serious. The indictment came from the Department of Justice. If you are going out there and you are trying to tell voters they should take seriously what is in the document, you don't lead by echoing Donald Trump's that you shouldn't believe any of this stuff that comes from the government. I think Christie deals with this well where he basically says, you know, you want to get mad at the prosecutors here. Trump is the one who did these things. He focuses on the substance of what is in it, whereas the other candidates, they all want to echo these stories that are essentially excuses for Trump to basically say, don't listen to what the Department of Justice says.

The \"L.A. Times\" follows this one student, Elijah Calderon, after a yearlong training program at Los Angeles Trade-Technical College. He is poised to earn about $105,000 annually as a power lineman. Once he becomes a journeyman in three to four years, he stands to make about $165,000 and potentially much more with overtime.They compare that to the median annual four-year after graduation income for a Stanford University political science major, $75,000, a UC Berkeley sociology major makes about $64,000, and UCLA history major, $47,900.

It just means it takes time to be able to do it.Humans are really resourceful about how they deal with incidents, how they deal with events, and they become ingenious about how to recover from it.
