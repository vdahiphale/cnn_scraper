Folks want to hear from the Fed, they're going to slow down interest rate raises. They want to see the economy is slowing because then the rates are working but not too much that it's going to be like dipping into a recession. So, I mean, we don't know where it's all going to land. But what do we learn from the latest figures both interest rates, jobs data, retail, et cetera.",

      "sentences": "I know you're sort of illustrating the sweet spot that the Fed has been trying to get to with all of these conflicting and complicated head winds and tail winds in the economy. So let's start to get some retail sales, what we saw today. These are November retail sales, not adjusted for inflation, and they were the weakest in about a year. And you could see how that reverses from a very strong October.A couple of things happening here. Auto sales were down. A lot of different factors because of that. Again, I said these are not inflation adjusted so all of those markdowns you saw for the holiday weekend, holiday shopping weekend, that means that could dampen -- even as people are buying a lot of stuff, it could mean that the retail sales number is dampened a little bit here. And we're seeing that people are shifting how they're spending, right. They focus on the important stuff first and they're shifting more toward experiences and away from goods. So all of that is at play here. At the same time, you get these jobless claims figures and they unexpectedly fell by like 20,000. So just 211 first-time unemployment claims. You guys, before the pandemic, this would have an unbelievably amazing number about how strong the job market is. So this is something to watch here. The Fed is predicting by next year you're going to have a 4.6 percent unemployment rate so the Fed is saying higher interest rates, they'll eventually start working through here, and you'll start to see layoffs rise and layoffs rising will take some of the heat out of wages and take some of the heat out of the labor market that is spinning off all of this inflation. So the Fed has raised interest rates now seven times this year. There was down shift yesterday so just about half a point. I mean, still that's a big rate hike, right, but at some point the feeling is in 2023, the U.S. economy will start to slow and more gradually move out of this too hot post-pandemic period that we've been living through.",

Let's take a look again at that number that you just said. Ome 14 percent of cancers were caught by screening. That means that the other ones were caught when someone had symptoms and then went in to get checked. Of course at that point someone is much further along. You obviously in most cases way prefer to have it caught earlier. Let's take a look at the four main cancers where there are screenings available. Breast cancer, only 61 percent of breast cancers were caught by screenings. That is actually lower than I thought. I thought mammography would catch a lot more that. Cervical cancers, 52 percent, are caught by screening. Colorectal cancer, 45 percent and lung cancer 3 percent. Now, as for why that 14 percent number, why is this true, why isn't that higher? There is a couple of reasons. One, we don't have screenings for a lot of cancers. You saw those four that we do. But there is unfortunately quite a few that we don't. And so we need to get better diagnostic tests out there. The other problem is that often people don't get screening. They don't know about it. They are scared to have it. They're scared it's going to hurt or be a problem. They don't have access to screening. There are all sorts of reasons and so that obviously needs to be improved as well -- Erica and Jim.",
