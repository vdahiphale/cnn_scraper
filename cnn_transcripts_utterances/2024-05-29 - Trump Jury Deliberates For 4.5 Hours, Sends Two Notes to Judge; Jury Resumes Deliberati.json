Now, the day ended with the buzzer, which signals the jury wants to communicate going off once, then again, the first time to say they wanted four pieces of testimony read back to them. The second to ask the judge to reread them his instructions. Unclear so far whether that means the whole thing or selected portions of it. The testimony they want is from David Pecker, the former National Enquirer publisher and former Trump lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, some of it dealing with the arrangement for Pecker to act as the campaign's eyes and ears for potentially damaging stories. They'll hear that tomorrow morning. The judge dismissing them, then staying with attorneys for both sides to try to hammer out exactly what will be said.

For that, let's turn to CNN's Shimon Prokupecz in Lower Manhattan.So talk about security preparations. SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME AND JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: So, Anderson, we're outside the courthouse here in Lower Manhattan. So the barriers have been out here. This is actually the street where Donald Trump - this is where he goes in every morning, through the side door here into the courthouse. And you could see here - we're going to turn around here, Anderson, many of the barriers are out here already. This barrier here in the middle of the street was just added today in anticipation of the verdict. This is where reporters generally assemble. This is where all the live shots are done. The one of the biggest concerns here is just what goes on opposite here in this park. This is where the protesters will gather where supporters of the former president and then also the people who are against them. So one of the things that's going to be happening here, once the NYPD, once the city gets word that there is a verdict, we expect them to surge more officers into the location. They're trying to do this quickly as far as we know, but things sometimes take a little time because their concern is the longer once there is a verdict and the longer it takes to announce that verdict, more attention could be brought to this location and more people will gather and so they're trying to avoid that. So once there is a verdict, they're hoping to be able to get it out and get it read quickly. But right now, the security here certainly is much different than what we see during the day. There's a lot of barriers and there's certainly a number of officers out here. The Secret Service is protecting the former president. There's also concern for the jurors as they leave once the verdict is rendered. That is the court security. Those are the court officers. They provide security to the jurors and to the court staff.

But if I was sitting in on the jury selection process and listen to the questions during voir dire, looked at the jurors, listened to their responses, and then in my mind thought this could be a pretty fair juror for my side, for the defense. They might be the kind of juror that's that hangs a jury or that argues and argues to keep things going.And then I saw someone signs, maybe I'd be feeling pretty good about it. But I would say that a few nods or an acknowledgments, a low form of that, I don't think you can read too much into that. COOPER: Philip, it's fascinating. You were a juror on a very high profile trial in 2009 in New York. Brooke Astor, a big socialite philanthropist in New York. Her son had been charged with bilking her out of millions, along with an attorney of his. I mean, it was a long, long trial. Take us inside the jury room, what was it like? PHILIP BUMP, SERVED ON NYC JURY IN HIGH-PROFILE 2009 ASTOR CASE: Yes, I mean, the - before we got to deliberations, the jury room was the boringest place on earth, right? You just sat there and you waited for the lawyers to do their thing in the courtroom and have the judge resolve issues that we weren't privy to, right? The important thing, I think, for people to remember is the jurors don't see everything everyone else sees, right? So then when we got to deliberation, we weren't even allowed to talk about the case. Of course, you can't do that until you get to deliberation. So eventually we got our jury instructions, went to the room, the door closed. And that's when it really began for us, right? And so we spent 11 days hashing out the details of these charges. When I hear people talking about how people were acting in the jury box, you don't know what you're going to do until you get into that jury room. You may go in thinking, you understand what the case is all about. I certainly went in thinking, oh, I think, you know, we can find this way and that way.

This after reports in \"The New York Times\" questioning his impartiality. The Times revealed that an upside-down American flag was flown above of an Alito home after the January 6th attack. In today's letter, he says he was not even aware of the upside down flag until it was called to my attention. As soon as I saw it, he says I asked my wife to take it down, but for several days, she refused.He also responded to a second Times report about this flag flown above another home last summer, the 'Appeal to Heaven' flag dates to the revolutionary war. But more recently, it's been associated with Trump supporters. Today, Alito wrote, \"I had no involvement in the decision to fly that flag. My wife is fond of flying flags. I am not.\" I'm joined now by Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, one of the authors of a Congressional letter demanding his recusal. Appreciate you joining us Congresswoman. First of all, what do you make of his response, essentially doubling down on blaming his wife? REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL, (D-WA): I think it's outrageous, Anderson. This is a supreme court justice, the highest court of the land. He had an obligation to, I believe, recuse himself, but at a minimum to provide response to members of Congress about his actions and he really didn't do that. I mean, this letter is -- it's ridiculous on so many levels to say, well, I didn't know about it. Then I tried to ask my wife to take it down, but she wouldn't take it down. But hey, by the way, none of that matters. This is a justice who is going to weigh in on cases that are about our democracy, about the press -- the former president's participation in an insurrection. And to say that it has no bearing, that his wife was flying, not just one, but two flags is really disturbing. The reality is Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson recused herself from a case on affirmative action in Harvard because she felt that there was a chance that it could lead to a sense of impropriety. Justice Alito and I would say, Justice Thomas in the same category are really slashing and burning the integrity of the supreme court and I think it's extremely troubling, and it means that Justice Roberts has to step in and actually establish enforceable mechanism to hold these justices accountable for a code of conduct that, right now, has no such thing.",
