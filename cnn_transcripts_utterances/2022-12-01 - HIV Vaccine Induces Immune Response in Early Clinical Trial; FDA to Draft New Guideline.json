So it was done on a small group of volunteers.And I spoke with one of the researchers just moments ago. She said they are doing another phase-one study that's currently under way. But these early results are promising. And here's why. The researchers looked at 48 healthy volunteers. Half of them were given the vaccine as a two-dose regimen. The others were given a placebo. In the vaccine group, some of the participants were given a low-dose regimen, some were given a high dose. But overall, almost all of the participants in the vaccine group, except for one, showed vaccine- induced broadly neutralizing antibodies. Now, again, these are rare antibodies that the researchers were specifically looking for. And this is a sign that this vaccine regimen could potentially offer some protection against HIV infection. [14:35:05] Again, early results, phase-one study. The researchers are doing more research in this space. But they say that this evidence, this data suggesting that this vaccine could induce an immune response, specifically these broadly neutralizing antibodies, that's an important step forward and that's what's exciting here -- Victor?",

      "sentences": "Right. So I will say currently the FDA guideline says that men who have sex with men should wait three months after sexual activity to donate blood. That's what could potentially change.The FDA is considering, instead of targeting a broad group, they're considering instead, asking potential donors to submit questionnaire responses to kind of gauge individual risk. And instead, they're going from this broad requirement, they're considering changing it to looking at a more individual-based risk assessment. Many people say that that's more so based on science. And right now, the policy appears to be based on stigma. And it's based on this long history that you see here of the FDA's blood donation guidelines. In 1983, for this demographic of men who have sex with men, they were banned from donating blood. And then, in 2015, that changed to a 12- month time span after sexual activity to donating blood. And then you see here, in 2020, that changed to three months. That was during the pandemic when we didn't have many blood donations coming in. So that could change again. We're keeping a close eye on this space to see if the FDA will, in fact, change its guidance -- Victor and Alisyn?",

And that Jerry Jones photo is one of those moments that our people, black people have been through in America. And I feel like, as a black man, as a black athlete, as someone with power and a platform, when we do something wrong or something that people don't agree with, it's on every single tabloid, every single news coverage. It's on the bottom ticker. It's asked about every single day. But it seems like, to me, that the whole Jerry Jones situation, photo -- and I know it was years and years ago and we all make mistakes. I get it. But it seems like it's just been buried under like oh, it happened, we just -- we just move on. And I was just kind of disappointed I haven't received that question from you guys.

He earned that. He did those things. He was a grown man who willingly participated in that. In the same way that Jerry Jones now -- if you read the \"Washington Post\" story and read the answers he gave, and that is a part of a series about black coaches in the NFL and how Jerry Jones and other people have not done enough. The answers and responses that Jerry Jones gave to what he did at 14 are not good enough for the amount of power a man has, who owns, you know, one of the most-wealthiest and richest sports franchise on this planet. If you're going to be the owner that is more popular than your team, then what comes from that is answering questions like this. And the answers he gave to the \"Washington Post\" and the great journalists who wrote this story were not good enough.",

Because if you are not seen that often, you ask stupid questions like that. Stupid questions like that come out of your mouth because it is novel to see two heads of state in the same room.
