A number of headlines there, that the gunman found with two handguns as well additional magazines. The police say that those guns were purchased legally, though not registered.They recounted, as you just heard there, a number of previous encounters with police, including an arrest in 2019 for carrying a concealed weapon. Also notable, Erica, he did say that he was found with two bus tickets on his person, potentially they did not say where they were to, but potentially significant given in his letter, he spoke about the possibility of going to other location. We will await more information on that.",

So, in terms of that note, I think it's interesting that he said maybe there's a motive in what we saw, but we can't confirm anything just yet. We know what some of the words were in that note. We know that there were locations. How do you, though, based on your experience, how do you read that note?",

I talked to Mary Ellen O'Toole, the renowned former FBI profiler, who said that is not unusual for a person who is a loner, who is a nobody to want to create this note, this aura that would give him power and create fear if he went on to hit one or more of these targets and left that note saying there's this army of 20 and I'm in command of it.But other parts of the note, people hate me. They made me what I am today, a killer. No one noticed me. Why do they have me? I am a person. So, he is feeling isolated. He's feeling alone. He's very angry. And when you consider that he did this shooting, escaped the scene, intended to escape the scene and had a potential list of a dozen other targets where he held some grudge against each one of these places, the employment agency, the store, the fast food place, the church, and eight magazines fully loaded with 9 millimeter ammunition, two guns, 50 other bullets, there is a good possibility, a good possibility that he intended to carry forth more shootings until he was captured.",

She is trying to do a broader and, quite frankly, more vague message of the generational change than she is wanting to get into a policy debate on day one.And I understand that strategy, except that when you come out of the gate, one of the things you want to do is to have a rationale for your candidacy that you can start to explaining to Republican primary voters as to why you are the best of all of the Republicans to be the nominee. I would just note, you noted she is trying to have it both ways on something like Donald Trump and January 6th. She says two things can be true except for in the media. Well, I think one of the things that this campaign is going to test except, maybe the voters, too. Maybe Republican primary voters are either looking someone to be in the sort of Trump camp or to really try to move the party on from it. And we will see.
