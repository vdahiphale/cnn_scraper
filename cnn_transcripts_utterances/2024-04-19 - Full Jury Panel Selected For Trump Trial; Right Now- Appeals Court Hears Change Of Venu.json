This hour, we're going to go all in on this case, dissecting the next steps. How long can the prosecution hold out and keep its witness list out of the hands of Donald Trump and his defense team. Also this hour, in an ordinary move, some 165 House Democrats came to the aid of Republican Speaker Mike Johnson, drawing the ire of hardline Republicans in putting Johnson even close closer to potentially losing his job.

Today, Judge Merchan seating five more alternate bringing the total number to six. Yesterday, of course, a full jury of 12 were seated, made up of seven men and five women. And total of 18 needed for the trial to begin. Now, Judge Merchan now holding a Sandoval hearing, what's known as a Sandoval hearing. That's going to determine whether the prosecution can ask Trump if he testifies about certain aspects of his legal past, including the E. Jean Carroll defamation case in the civil fraud judgment handed down earlier this year. Now, Trump attorneys are fiercely pushing back. The outcome could factor in whether Trump decides to testify at all later in the trial. So he said he was going to do. We start off with CNN senior justice correspondent Evan Perez, who joins me now. Evan, let's talk first about a San -- what would a Sandoval hearing actually is. For people who don't know, what's happening right now inside the court?",

So one of them things they want to do is to impeach his credibility as a witness before this jury.And so, what's going on right now in this hearing, does that is still ongoing? Is the defense is pushing back on every single instance that the prosecution wants to bring up. You pointed out, not only the E. Jean Carroll ruling, right. One of the things that they got into a big back-and-forth over is the prosecution wants to be able to cite the earlier civil fraud judgment against the former president. And one of the things that they're -- but the defense is saying is that, look, that is a civil proceeding the standard of evidence, a standard of -- that you need to prove for the judge to rule in favor of the prosecution is much lower. It's just a preponderance of evidence as opposed to a criminal trial where you have to have beyond a reasonable doubt -- doubt. And so defense is saying that's just not fair. And so is they're pointing out that if you do that, then we should be able to bring in some of the various problems as Michael Cohen as a witness as well. And so, that's going back and forth. The judge saying we're not going to mix apples and oranges here as part of his decision-making in this. So, this is -- we expect it's going to keep going for at least another hour.",

It's extremely different, obviously prosecuting a former president.

These jurors without question, I could be under a ton of pressure and I think this morning we saw the emotion come out of some that underscores that these aren't just kind of random unnamed individuals. These are real people and this is something that you can't even fathom unless you're one of those jurors. How does that affect this case, Jeremy? JEREMY SALAND, FORMER PROSECUTOR, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: It's extremely problematic and I've said multiple times, there's the Donald Trump who was the innocent until proven guilty, and if proven guilty beyond reasonable doubt in that courtroom. And deserves the same due process and the same presumption of innocence at any one of us have. And then there's a Donald Trump outside that courtroom who says a lot of very vitriolic and frightening and aggressive things that gives pause, be very gentle and nice, the potential jurors. We know that about the judge we know that about prosecutors and witnesses, and it has a really negative and frightening impact on those potential jurors who are scared potentially to say, I don't want to be a part of this process. I don't want to be subject to scrutiny. I don't want the media talking about me and my family. I don't want people showing up at my house or saying things about me online. So it's very -- again, I use the term frightening repeatedly because it has a way to taint the jury. It's not good for the jury to have that constant agony or angst. So the best thing Trump can do and Judge Merchan can do.

I don't necessarily subscribe prior to that view. What you want people who are smart enough to understand some things which might be a little complex, meaning this is not a hush-money case. This is about whether or not these records are falsified and those elements and whether or not there was an effort to conceal a separate crime.So you want people who are smart enough to grasp that and take themselves out of this and look from the outside in and say, well, did the -- did the did the prosecution prove their case and not holding to some unrealistic burden? And you want those jurors who also are going to not concerned with the lawyer who are jurors, not to impose their beliefs, but follow what the judge says, an understand that there's going to be a witness here. For example, Michael Cohen, but not just Michael Cohen, who is admitted to lying, who has been convicted of crime and say, I can still be objective. Yes prosecution, I'm going to hold you to the burden, but no criminal defense. I'm not just going to side with you and say because Michael Cohen, for example, has a criminal record, I can find him credible. So I think they've done a good job. And to Stacy's point, this is a fairly mundane group, at least on the six alternates, but they've done a good job to find jurors who appear to be smart enough, engineers, attorneys, a teacher, to follow the law and be above and beyond.

One would be, for example, if it was in front of the judge and he could summarily say you have violated my the conditions of whatever I set forth and I can make a decision now. And then the second, like we're seeing here, is it's not in his presence. And then we have that hearing. And Donald Trump has a right to protect himself and respond to them and it has to be proven it's beyond a reasonable doubt. It can be a civil or it could be a criminal. Here, it would likely be criminal because it would be to punish him for his actions as opposed to making someone hold, for example, up to $1,000, up to 30 days in jail. I think the judge is delaying it, not because he doesn't think it's important, but I think because there's other practical things that we get bogged down with, you must be saying to himself, we're not going to move this case forward and you have to get this moving.

What's the difference? It's worth its weight in gold and publicity just to get these statements out, to get a couple of thousand dollars a hit -- fine from the judge.Judges have put people in jail for contempt of court. But that's not going to happen here. It's unlikely. I mean, that would just bring extra scrutiny onto the judge in the middle of the trial. I don't think that's realistic. But there has to be some way to stop Donald Trump from doing this and respect the process the trial process -- and if any judge is capable of coming up with a formula for that, I believe it's Judge Merchan. He is such a no-nonsense judge who takes control of his courtroom. We saw the way he moved jury selection, along at the speed and the pacing, no nonsense again.

He's saying, you're not go -- I don't want you to relitigate things -- decisions that I've already made. For instance, they wanted to -- there's a discussion right now about the \"Access Hollywood\" tape. The judge had said you cannot play that tape, but you can make reference to it. And so the Trump team is trying to have another go at that discussion. And so that's, you know, one of many things that apparently the Trump team wants to try to bring up again, and the judge is having none of this. He seems quite -- quite annoyed that he believes they've tried to go back and essentially revisit decisions that he's already made. And so a look at the end of this, the judge says that he is going to go back and look to see whether earlier statements he made, whether he was inconsistent but he's trying to shut down at least some of this discussion because he believes he's already made some rulings that address these questions.",

DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT &amp; 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We just had another hearing and the trial starts on Monday, which is long before a lot of people thought. The judge wants to go as fast as possible. The history's not from my research. And this is really a concerted witch hunt, very simple. Everything you heard, this is a witch hunt by numerous judges, Democratic judges. You take a look at Engoron. He's a whack job. What he did was a disgrace. It's being reviewed by the appellant division, and I hope they do justice because everybody's looking. And nobody no business is coming into the city. None whatsoever. They're looking at that case. That case is a threat to democracy, frankly, what took place with the A.G., A crooked A.G. Letitia James, who campaigned and the fact -- who campaigned with the fact that I'm going to get Trump, I'm going to get Trump. That's all she said for two years. And it's -- people don't want to see this stuff. We have violent criminals all over the streets of New York and nothing happens. So even when they catch him, they let him go. No bail, no bail whatsoever. So this is just a concerted whether it's Judge Kaplan with a person I have no idea of (INAUDIBLE) suing us, and I had no idea who this person was or this judge or if you look at Engoron, where he said that Mar-a-Lago, whichever was worth a billion or a billion and a half dollars. He said it was worth $18 million because that suited his narrative. But what -- what's happening in this city and all over the country, but what's happening in particular in this setting, some very good, but way, some are very fair. Those are really the cities that are thriving. But what's happening here with me judicial system is an outrage and all over the world, they're watching it and all over the world, they're saying that this is a giant witch hunt to try and hurt a campaign that's beating the worst president in history. Biden is the worst president in the history of our country, beating him a lot, and this is the only way they think they can link, but it's not going to work. Thank you very much, everybody.

Plus, in an appeals court, a request for interim stay of the criminal trial was denied.Back with me now, Stacy Schneider, Manhattan criminal defense attorney, and Jeremy Saland, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office. Stacy, in terms of what we heard from the president after court adjourned, you're making very clear that he believes the judges and several of his legal issues were clearly targeting him or out to get him, given everything that you've seen over the course this week, do you have the sense that there is a political tilt to what the president is dealing with in the courtroom behind me?",

He just came from a Sandoval hearing which is its where the prosecution in the presence of the judge and the defense counsel lays out all your prior bad acts through your lifetime that they're aware of and he's had to listen to them site all those things, all the cases and trials and problems he's had that he's railed against in the press. He's now had to listen -- listen to that up close and personal.And the moment he came out was just before that happens. And I think that statement and was not his typical railing about this as a political witch hunt, but more his own emotional response to what he just heard. Defendants coming out of a Sandoval all hearing are not pleased. It's just the nature of the hearing. It's kind of the worst preview of what could come if you take the stand.

I mean, he was so very specific about the judges that he's had issues with in his cases, cases he's lost, cases he's had issues going forward.I think, Jeremy, to that point, is this a one-off because as Stacy's laying out, this is a tough -- Sandoval hearing is where you're hearing the worst possible things that could be coming at you if you testify or is this just a signal of what's going to be coming, as things get underway on Monday. JEREMY SALAND, FORMER PROSECUTOR, MANHATTAN DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE: I think this is going to be typical Trump response and I'm looking down at some notes and I apologize. But he said what's happening with the judicial system here is an outrage. I think if you care about law and order, you care about justice, his behavior is outrageous and its incredibly destructive to the criminal justice system. And it's single-handedly dismantling it. And you'll look at what things he says and as a prosecutor. It kind of excites you a little bit because he's lying. And why do we know he's lying, he says about he didn't know -- no idea about E. Jean Carroll and Judge Kaplan. Well, we know you knew about E. Jean Carroll because you were found responsible for some sort of ugly sexual abusive behavior towards her, you're found for defaming her. He says, going on about A.G. James, Attorney General James and Judge Engoron. He just cant control themselves and all that comes from that man's mouth is damaging not just to his credibility, but sets him up for further violations and giving all sorts of evidentiary fodder to prosecutors. And it dumbfounds me that his attorneys, who are incredibly experienced are not proverbially grabbing him by the collar and say, Mr. Trump, Don, you've got your certainly or political issues here in terms of your campaign. But we have a court proceeding, a criminal one, where if you are convicted, you are going to be a felon forever, it doesn't get expunged. He may never see a day in jail, but a felon forever. And if that's what's outrageous -- that's what's outrageous.",

And give the jury an opinion about how awful he is. And the next thing I'm going to do is open up and explain to the jury what Donald Trumps life was like before he ran for president. He was an international celebrity. He had people coming to him all the time for money. And that I'm going to show the jury that this situation was nothing different from something he would already take care of. It had had nothing to do with his election prospects. And that you should really understand who Donald Trump is as a person and how he's operated for his entire life.

This is not going to be a salacious, sexy, hush money case. This is a falsifying business records case. We're going to break it down to its essential elements. We're not going to make it something that it's not. We're not going to allow and were going to preempt Donald Trump and his team for taking this on the sideways that it shouldn't go. I'm overwhelmingly confident that Josh and Chris and those guys who are overlapped with are ready to go. They've been ready yesterday, the week before and they're not going to get distracted no matter what happens outside that courtroom, they are staying the course. These are Morgenthau guys who've gone for Morgenthau, to Vance now to Bragg, they've been around the block. [16:55:03] Chris was in the homicide investigations unit as a chief.
