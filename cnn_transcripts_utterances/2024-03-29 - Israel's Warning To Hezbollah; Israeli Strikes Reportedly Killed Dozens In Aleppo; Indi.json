Anywhere and everywhere, Israel promises to pursue Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria, and beyond, as Israeli strikes reportedly killed dozens in Aleppo. India's A.I. alarm Prime Minister Narendra Modi's warning on fake content and the need for more protections as the nation's A.I. development accelerates. And an eggstraordinary shock that's leaving a bitter taste. Cocoa prices are soaring and chocolatiers are in meltdown. That story and plenty more coming up. But first, we begin with Israel's defense minister vowing to pursue Hezbollah fighters anywhere and everywhere. It follows airstrikes on Friday by Israeli forces in both Lebanon and Syria. Syrian state news says, attacks near Aleppo led to casualties among both civilians and military personnel. The IDF says, the alleged deputy commander of Hezbollah's rocket and missile unit was killed in strikes on southern Lebanon.

Donald Tusk was speaking to the German newspaper Die Welt about the threat posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. He said, I know it sounds devastating, especially for the younger generation, but we have to get used to the fact that a new era has begun. The pre-war era. I'm not exaggerating, it's becoming clearer every day. That warning comes as six journalists working for independent media outlets in Russia were arrested within a span of a few hours. That includes Antonina Favorskaya, who filmed the final court appearance of Alexei Navalny. She's seen here with Navalny's mother a few days after her son's death. Russia's investigative committee has accused Favorskaya of extremism, the same charge levied against the late opposition leader. And it's also one year since the U.S. Journalist Evan Gershkovich was first jailed in Russia. His newspaper, \"The Wall Street Journal\", making a powerful statement Friday on the absence created by his arrest. The headline reading, his story should be here, a year in Russian prison, a year of stolen stories, stolen joys. Stolen memories. Gershkovich was accused of spying, which the journalist, his paper, and the U.S. government strongly deny. Gershkovich trial was recently extended for another three months. It's yet one more delay, but U.S. hostage experts believe it could offer a window for negotiating his release. That's because once a trial begins, it's often actually harder to then make a deal.

LYNNE TRACY, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO RUSSIA:  This verdict to further prolong Evan's detention feels particularly painful as this week marks the one-year anniversary since Evan was arrested and wrongfully detained in Yekaterinburg for simply doing his job as a journalist. The accusations against Evan are categorically untrue. They are not a different interpretation of circumstances. They are fiction. CHANCE (voice-over):  But incarceration behind the walls of Lefortovo prison in Moscow is a grim fact. U.S. officials say they're negotiating with Moscow for his release, even the Kremlin confirmed this week contacts on a prisoner swap are continuing.

It will be ramped up fairly soon. As we, zoom into the wreckage here, we can show you there is another crane. It's kind of leaning to the left there. It's just beyond the wreckage of the bridge there. You can kind of see it. Our photojournalist Harlan Schmidt can train his camera into that crane there. That is not the Chesapeake 1000. That is another crane that was brought here. But we're told that several heavy cranes are being brought. A couple of them are already here. And we -- part of the really arduous task of removing this debris and all of this wreckage is that I think, as you just mentioned, they've got to remove just the metal that's draped over the bow of the ship first. All of that, according to the governor, weighs about 4000 tons. So, they've got to excavate figure out which parts of that they can remove and then get it off there. And what we're told by the Army Corps of Engineers is that really massive crane that's called the Chesapeake 1000, that's going to be doing a lot of this work, it can lift about 1,000 tons at a time. So, that means it's got to cut just the debris on the ship into four different pieces, at least, in order to remove that. Now, we talked to another mechanical engineer from Morgan State University, Dr. Oscar Barton. he said, really, what they've got to do first is excavate and survey all of this area first and figure out what the biggest pieces are, where they are, and how they're going to cut it up into pieces. They're going to have welders do that, and then they're going to have these massive cranes come in and remove all of these pieces. And that -- again, that's just the debris that is on the ship itself. Then it's going to take days and weeks to remove the other wreckage that is all around there. Now, General Scott Spellman of the Army Corps of Engineers says he thinks that process could take weeks as far as opening the channel. Now that's a fairly optimistic viewpoint, but once they get all the assets here, they can kind of expedite that process. But again, this is painstaking. It is very dangerous work as well because the divers -- because the water conditions, and you can see the water is very rough behind me. The wind has really kicked up today. The divers have really not been able to go in very much over the past couple of days. They're going to allow them back in when the conditions permit. But this time of year, Julia, the weather is really kind of touch and go. It's very cold, windy. The water is murky. It is very dangerous under the surface.

We will see spots here in the orange. That's 150 millimeters, so about five inches of rainfall coming down here just in the next 72 hours. But temperatures are very mild, 23 Celsius for you in Tokyo for later on today. It does cool down for Monday, but still you're going to be above normal. Even all of these numbers are above normal. From Wuhan all the way down toward Hong Kong, temperatures there in the upper 20s to almost 30. Here's Tokyo. We go 23, 24 Celsius, so then you're above 70, 72 degrees there. Cooling back down to 17, but that's still above where you should be this time of year. Now, turning our attention to a big storm coming into California, and we don't need another one here. It has been plenty wet with this El Nino pattern that we've had all winter where many spots have already seen flooding. We've had mudslides and more in the way of two to four inches of additional rainfall coming down here, especially in the transverse mountains there, north of L.A., that's where the heaviest rain will be up into the Sierra, that's where the heaviest snow will be. Take the snow because that doesn't really run off. It will later on this year when it melts, but it's a slow runoff. So, that's a helpful rain, a helpful freshwater solution here. There are your flood watches for all of L.A. And then the snow in the higher elevations could see at least two to three feet of snow with winter storm warnings posted. Something else that's going to go on, we're going to see winds about 100 kilometers per hour, 50 to 60 miles per hour here across all of the Southwest, even into places like Flagstaff, well away from the low-pressure way out there, but that will blow sand around and we'll get a dust storm. Probably not very healthy air out there either if you pick up those fine grains of sand. We'll take the rainfall here across parts of China, that's where it's coming in.

So, what's the secret? Coach Sasaki tells me it's not about the power in the arm, but in the mind. H. SASAKI (through translator):  I think the most important thing is to not blame others or to make excuses. Once I stopped doing that, my life changed. And the other thing is to set a firm goal. MONTGOMERY (voice-over):  And of course, practice, practice, and more practice. Practice. Still, Sasaki has a way to go before reaching the heights of Ohtani, his dad tells me. H. SASAKI (through translator):  I'd never seen such a level of athleticism before. From the moment they joined the team, I knew they would be tremendous athletes once they got stronger.
