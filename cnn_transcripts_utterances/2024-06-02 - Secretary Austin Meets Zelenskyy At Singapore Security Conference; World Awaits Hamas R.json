I'm Alisyn Camerota, in for Fredricka Whitfield today.We're following several major developments around the globe that will present challenges for President Biden at home and abroad this week. First, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Singapore today. Secretary Austin reiterated, quote, unwavering U.S. support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's war. We're also awaiting word on Hamas's response to a new ceasefire proposal with Israel as detailed by President Biden on Friday. The president is expected to address these and other global challenges when he visits France to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the D-Day invasion of Normandy. CNN's Natasha Bertrand and Priscilla Alvarez are tracking all of these stories for us. So, Natasha, you're in Singapore. What happened at the meeting today?",

That Zelenskyy has really been pushing for and has said as pretty much a game changer because of the fact that its going to allow them to actually hit Russia where they are launching these attacks right across the border inside Russia. But, ultimately, you know, this was an opportunity for Zelenskyy to come, to meet with Asian leaders here in Singapore, and importantly to try to secure a meeting with Chinese officials, the Chinese are an extremely important international actor here when it comes to the war in Ukraine because according to the U.S. and the U.K., they are actively supporting Russia's defense sector, which in turn is fooling, of course, the war in Ukraine. So Zelenskyy wanted to meet with Chinese officials here in Singapore, but he was rebuffed. He told hold reporters earlier today that he sought out some meetings with them to try to get them to come to a peace summit that Ukraine is trying to organize here in the next two weeks and Switzerland. But that they did not make any commitment to do so. And in fact, he did address Chinas support for Russia and he said that that is only going to make the war in Ukraine last longer. We should note that Secretary of Defense Austin, he also met with his Chinese counterpart on Friday and he discussed this very thing with his Chinese counterpart of the fact that the us believes that they are supporting the Russians. And importantly, he raised the idea that there could be consequences if they continue to do so. He said that the international community will be forced to take, quote, further measures if the Chinese do not stop supporting Russia. But for now, it does not seem like the Chinese are very receptive to those calls and importantly, they have denied even now, providing any kind of support to Russia as something of course, the U.S. and the U.K. say is completely at odds with reality -- Alisyn.",

So they wanted to hold off until after the fact this executive action is expected to be a measure quite reminiscent of one in the Trump era in the way that it clamps down on unlawful border crossings.Now, again, we anticipate that this could be announced as early as Tuesday. Mexico would have to have some level of buy-in to execute this order like they have on many other border security measures. In fact, the U.S. has really credit in Mexico and part for helping drive down the lower border crossings that we are seeing now. So this election is important, but it also comes at a critical time for the U.S. as they themselves grapple with migration in the hemisphere. And he really looked to Mexico to help them with that.

These are the places where four for people who are outside the district, perhaps you're visiting from out-of-state these are this is where were seeing the most delays because there seems to be see some problems are getting the polling stations proper working order. And now so because if people are getting desperate, they know that there's a limited number for ballots that they all want to vote in most places, we seem to have seen more people than ballots, usually between thousand, 1,500 ballots in these places, we saw lines were longer. So there's a lot of enthusiasm and they're hoping that these day goes peacefully. The violence that you mentioned was in the mind the voters and officials, they started they open the session of the national elections institute with a moment of silence to remember, they about 200 people who were killed during this process. So it is a very important issue for the voters in Mexico. And you mentioned, Mexico could have its first female president, something that is not the driving force for voters, but they say that having a female representative country is also good for the image of this nation.

Claudia Sheinbaum has stated that she wants to continue with her predecessor's, currently the current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, foreign policy, which is really start a paranoia, sort of an imperialist view of the U.S. and it has really inhibited security cooperation between both nations, although they have been able to strike several agreements in terms of stemming migration coming from Mexico southern border to the U.S. southern border.
