      "sentences": "Well, Sara, we just don't know what's going to happen in this investigation if it picks up again. But it is being fought over still how much investigators can access these Scott Perry text messages. It's been in the courts for a long time.And actually, the judge here in Washington, D.C.'s federal court, Judge Howell, she illuminated what these text messages were in an opinion that was under seal confidential two years ago, and now we're just getting a glimpse of it because of an unsealing briefly that happened yesterday. What these text messages are between Scott Perry and others, top administration officials, including Jeffrey Clark at the Justice Department. We knew the gist of them, that Perry wanted to find ways to try and help Trump after the election. But now we're getting the exact wording, specifically his texts to Jeff Clark at the Justice Department at a time that Trump was considering installing Clark as Attorney General. Perry wrote, POTUS seems very happy with your response. I read it just as you dictated. Clark responded to him, I'm praying. This makes me quite nervous and wonder if I'm worthy or ready. And then Scott Perry, the Republican Congressman responds, you are the man. I have confirmed it. God does what he does for a reason. So, the representation here is that Scott Perry, a member of Congress, is coaching an administration official to try and help Trump and also is acting as somewhat of a go between Jeff Clark and Donald Trump at a really crucial moment after the election. We will have to see if these text messages come into play at the upcoming trial of Donald Trump as well. Sara.",

We knew a lot about what these exchanges sounded like generally, but now we know that this attorney, Jennifer Little, had been very clear in warning Donald Trump that you got a subpoena to return classified records to the federal government now that you're no longer president and you must comply. You've got to comply were the words that \"ABC News\" reported, Jennifer Little told investigators.We also know that Evan Corcoran, another for -- attorney for Donald Trump, was very strong in his warnings to the former president. You've got to turnover what you have. Not all of those documents were turned over. They were later -- several were later found in an FBI search of Mar-a-Lago. And it's very possible that both Jennifer Little and Evan Corcoran could be called to testify against him -- Donald Trump in that upcoming trial scheduled for next May. Sara.",

She's the attorney, isn't there this thing called attorney-client privilege? The answer is, yes. But prosecutors were able to show, at least at the grand jury level, that they were entitled to break through that attorney-client privilege because they showed something called the crime fraud exception.Meaning, if the communication between the attorney and the client goes to some crime, some ongoing crime, then you can use the evidence. So, Trump's going to still get to contest that. But to me, it seems clear that this is, this is going to come in and Jennifer Little will be a witness at this trial for the prosecution.",

And the question is, well, look, Donald Trump has been charged federally and in Georgia for this, among other things. Jeffrey Clark, on the other side has been charged in Georgia, and he's named as a co-conspirator, not charged, but named as a co-conspirator federally. Scott Perry, nothing. Nothing. Is it because he's a member of Congress? Maybe. But let's remember, members of Congress have gotten special treatment throughout this case. Go back to the January 6th committee. Six of them, Including Scott Perry got subpoenas. Scott Perry and all the others, Jim Jordan, McCarthy, completely ignored them. Other people got held in contempt. Other people got prosecuted.

Florida against California. That's right. Governor Ron DeSantis will square off with Governor Gavin Newsom and they'll do it in Georgia. The 90-minute spectacle will be moderated by \"Fox News\" host Sean Hannity.Let's discuss all this with CNN's Chief National Affairs Correspondent Jeff Zeleny. So glad to see you, Jeff. Unusual for a presidential candidate to debate someone who has not declared that he is making a run for the White House, although there's a lot of speculation. What is the point of this? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, look, Sara, the point of this is for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis to have an hour on \"Fox News\" to a conservative audience to make his point that he would be the strongest Republican presidential candidate. This has been in the works for months and months. And at the time it seemed, when this was first settled on early summer, I believe, it seemed sort of strange because at that point the Florida governor was riding far higher in the presidential polls than he is now. Now, he certainly is not. His campaign has retreated. All of his hopes basically are hinging on Iowa. But his campaign now believes that this is still a great opportunity for him to, again, have that conservative audience to go after what he believes is a liberal governor in California. Now, Gavin Newsom actually is on \"Fox\" quite often. He's on Sean Hannity quite often. He likes to spar in these settings. But for the Florida governor, it's actually probably riskier than it seemed several months ago because he, certainly his campaign is weaker than it was. So, they will be facing off tonight, and to make it all even more interesting, in Georgia, as you said, which is one of the nation's top battleground states. So, look, look for immigration to be talked about and many other matters. But for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, it's simply a time to try and get his name and face out there when there aren't any other Republicans, at least, on stage.",

They did not do it. They were not able to get it done, even when Republicans were in control of the House. And there's a new ad out that you're seeing there on screen, that President Biden's campaign is putting out, really reminding people what would happen if Obamacare, if the Affordable Care Act went away?So, this is something that has really changed over time. Of course, initially a decade or so ago, the Affordable Care Act was not popular. Now, it is much, much, much more popular because it has widened the access for health insurance for many Americans. This ad also points out that the Biden administration has lowered the cost of prescription drugs. So, this is an issue that most Republicans would have preferred have gone away. But Donald Trump has decided to revive it. Talking about repealing Obamacare again, and it's really caused shock waves throughout the Republican Party. So, now this is going to be an issue in the campaign, and the Biden campaign is certainly seizing upon that.",
