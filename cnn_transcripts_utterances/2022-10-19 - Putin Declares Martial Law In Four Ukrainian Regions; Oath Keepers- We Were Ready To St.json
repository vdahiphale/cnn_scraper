Security Council almost unanimously by a massive majority rejected Russia's illegal annexation.",

      "sentences": "Yes, look, there's a real reality of that happening here because what Russia is doing is forcing the civilians out of Kherson, strategic town, important for the Russians, but they're losing territory.Ukrainian officials say the Russians are whipping up hysteria by saying, you know, you're going to get shelled in your houses. The Ukrainians are going to blow the dam. They're going to flood your river. It's your last chance to get out. You have got to get out. But look, one other part of the conflict when you analyze this has Russia really cared about the Ukrainian civilian that are caught up in the war. So many of them have been killed by Russian forces. They're bombing them here every day. So, there's a real level of skepticism about what the Russians are saying here. They -- the reality is there's a potential they could use these forcibly evacuated civilians as human shields as cover to pull back their forces. T heir military general says they're losing territory. The civilian commander there says his moving his civilian command to the other side of the river. It looks very much like Russia is preparing to pull its troops out and what safer way for them to do it than hidden among or at least with the cover of civilians who are being forced out, and by the way, the civilians there woke up to a text message this morning telling them to get out. By the middle of the day, that text message had turned into martial law which meant the army was in control, and we don't know what powers the army has if somebody says, no. I would like to stay in my home. If I have a choice, I want to stay. Well, under martial law, that could be a very ugly picture.",

      "sentences": "Well, there are some interesting things going on here. The first thing is the martial law that's been declared by Russia inside the so-called annexed area of Ukraine, the Donbas, Luhansk and Donetsk, that's just sort of silly.I mean, you can't really impose any type of law, martial or otherwise if you don't actually control, you know, the levers of government in the territory itself. It's quite clear that inside of that portion of Ukraine that the Russians have tried to take and annex that they don't control it. So, it's almost more of a domestic thing. It's being able for Russians and Russia to say, look, we control those areas and so we can do martial law there. What really interests me though is oblasts, these regions that surround the areas where the war is going on in Ukraine. The decoration of martial law inside Russian territories. And we oftentimes say, why does -- you know, you'll hear me say, there's no rule of law in Russia, but then something like this happens. I think what's really going on in this location is that, you know, the military just needs to be able to take over from the local governors. And say, look, we are now running these areas of Russia because they're concerned about sabotage and paramilitary operations coming from Ukraine. So, it's kind of a complicated -- different situation for different martial law areas in and outside of Russia.",

That's certainly true in those areas that are inside of Russia that are bordering on, you know, the war that's going on in Ukraine.So yes, that's a tacit I think admission that the Ukrainians might get behind the front lines, they might get into that part of Russia and conduct, you know, blow up bridges and things like that. So yes, I think it definitely is a tacit admission that there's some weakness on the Russian side, which of course, we know from the military activities.",

Of course, now his 16-year prison sentence.They've said they have had those discussions with folks from the Saudi Embassy here in Washington, D.C. this week. It had those discussions with Saudi officials over in Saudi Arabia, and they've also brought that up as soon as they found out that Almadi had been detained -- that was last year. Of course, he was detain when had he arrived in the country in November of last year and he has been sentenced, as you guys said, to 16 years in prison. We heard from his son just last night on CNN talking about the fact that he has been told his father has been tortured while he has been in that prison cell. He has not been able to talk to his father at all while he has been in prison. And he is calling on the State Department to declare his father's wrongfully detained. So, that's something that we'll watch for because if that is given to Almadi in this situation, that would essentially galvanize the U.S. government to really work actively to try and secure his release. And of course, we should note, this comes at a very a contentious moment in U.S./Saudi relations with president Biden calling out the Saudi's for what he says is being on the side of Russia due to their recent OPEC oil production decision -- guys.

      "sentences": "CNN's chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is with us now. So, there are two new studies reinforcing the benefits of sleep. Let's start with duration and what they say about how long they say people should sleep and the importance of it.DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean the magic number that you hear a lot is getting at least 7 hours of sleep. And I think I would tuck that in the back of your brain in terms of what is the right amount. What was interesting about the study, though, this first study they followed 8,000 people for 25 years and they started at age 50 and they were perfectly healthy 50-year-olds. And they wanted to see what happened to people who weren't getting enough sleep -- five hours or less on average. And what they found if you were 50 and not getting adequate sleep you had a 30 percent increased risk of developing significant chronic diseases, not just one but several diseases over the next several year. The risk went up even higher if you're still sleeping poorly at 60 and even higher if you are still sleeping poorly at age 70. So, this was a pretty long study that actually looked at this, which I found really interesting. The second study showed a lot of the same things but also found for Americans in particular about 63 percent of people are getting inadequate sleep. This is a real problem. In fact, the American Heart Association always has their healthy seven lists of things you should do to try and avoid heart disease, biggest killer of men and women. They now added number eight to that list, which is healthy sleep. So, you know, tons of study out there about sleep but long studies now showing the long term impact of poor sleep.",
