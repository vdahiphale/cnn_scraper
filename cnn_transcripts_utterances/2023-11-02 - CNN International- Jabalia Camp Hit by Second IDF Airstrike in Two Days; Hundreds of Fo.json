It's Thursday, November 2nd, 8In northern Gaza, Israeli air strikes struck the Jabalia refugee camp for a second time in two days. Local hospital officials say at least 80 people were killed, most of them women and children. UNICEF says more than 400 children have died each day in Gaza since this war started. Meanwhile, we're waiting to see if more foreign nationals are able to cross the border into Egypt today. People have been gathering there in hope of getting through. For the first time since the war began, the Rafah border crossing opened Wednesday to several 100 foreign nationals, including aid workers who'd been stuck at the border for days. CNN's Clare Sebastian is covering all of these angles for us from London. Clare, what are we hearing about what could happen at the Rafah border crossing today?",

      "sentences": "So the expectation is that more foreign passport holders will be allowed through. The U.S. certainly said that it expects to see more in the coming days. We're hearing this morning from the Egyptian Foreign Ministry saying that it's working to evacuate about 7,000 foreign passport holders from around 60 countries from Gaza. So it seems that the efforts are still ongoing.We did understand when this deal was brokered that it did cover anyone holding a foreign passport that wanted to get out of Gaza. But I think what we saw on Wednesday, which is of course the first day, the first time that anyone bar less than a handful of hostages, had actually exited the Gaza Strip since this conflict began. Is that it's cumbersome. It's slow, it's difficult. Egypt wants to vet everyone that's coming in, because, of course, concerns about sort of a broader influx of Palestinian refugees and because of the demand that was part of the negotiations from Hamas that the injured Palestinians that were evacuated and those ambulances that you saw on Wednesday should include some of its fighters. That demand was of course rejected. But tensions are extremely high. It's very fluid as well. We hadn't expected to see any Americans leave on Wednesday, but a couple of them did. So things are very up in the air. We're monitoring closely what's happening at that border, but of course at the moment we're seeing crowds gathering, people gathering there, but no movement as of yet.",

      "sentences": "It's significant. This is sparked, I mean, there was already international alarm about what was going on in Gaza, which is complicated things for Israel, certainly in the wake of those Hamas attacks in southern Israel. Now, we've seen another surge in the wake of these two strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp. We've seen Jordan recalling its ambassador to Israel, along with Chile and Colombia. Bolivia has cut off diplomatic ties. We even have the UN Humanitarian Office saying that they believe that these attacks could be -- they're concerned that they could be disproportionate, that this could amount, they say, to war crimes. Which is obviously a very serious allegation.And I think it's not just about the high death toll. If we look at the fallout within Gaza. We don't know exactly how many were killed, certainly in that first strike. But that this is very seriously impacting the health system as well. We're hearing overnight that the Gaza Indonesian hospital, which is the one that's closest to the Jabalia refugee camp, they're saying that their main generator stopped working. That hasn't shut down the whole hospital, but it's taken out of action several key systems, ventilation systems in the operating rooms, the refrigerators in the morgue. The so you can see that mass casualty events like this can have a serious impact on that already immensely strained health system.",

      "sentences": "Look, I think that that initial attack was shocking in its method of execution in a sense of, you know, the introduction of forces from the air using those paragliders and the fact that it managed to catch the Israelis by surprise. But when you look at Hamas's actual military capabilities, they're pretty much as we anticipated in the sense that there's about 20 to 40,000 troops there. They are largely equipped with small arms. In other words, you know, sort of rifles, machine guns, assault weapons, that sort of thing as well as rocket propelled grenades.They also have obviously large numbers of battlefield missiles and rockets that they can fire at Israel. And I think probably the most concerning thing for the Israeli Defense Forces going into Gaza would be things like IEDs and mines and the ability of Hamas to use the dense urban environment defensively with snipers and rocket propelled grenades and anti-tank guided weapons to catch the Israelis in narrow streets. So I don't think that we've underestimated Hamas dramatically in terms of what they can do, but it's the environment, the operational environment and the tactical situation that the Israelis are finding themselves in that I think is quite challenging.",

I mean, how much more difficult does that make it for the Israelis, particularly because hostages might be stored down there too? So in terms of methods of attacking the tunnels like flooding or blowing them up, it makes it far more difficult.",

      "sentences": "Exactly. So you know, the Israelis can't go in and essentially flood the tunnels, you know, with some sort of substance to flush the Hamas forces out because they could then put -- place hostages at risk. They can obviously collapse tunnels where they know for sure there are no hostages. And they've done that with air strikes and artillery strikes. But in some cases, the Israeli Defense Forces will have to actually gointo the tunnels, and that's certainly more likely to happen the deeper they get into Gaza itself -- into Gaza City in particular. They may actually have to go into those tunnels and fight from tunnel to tunnel to force the Hamas terrorists out or to kill them. And I think that will be really challenging because the nature of the tunnels -- and we've seen them on TV -- as such that they would be ideal for booby traps and IEDs and mines and so forth. So you know, it's a dangerous environment for the IDF as well.",

I mean by taking those hostages and a significant number of them and then spreading them over a large area rather than concentrating them in one area where they can be rescued in a style similar to the Entebbe raid in by the Israelis in the 70s. By spreading them across that tunnel network, it makes it much more difficult for the Israelis to use force decisively. If the hostages weren't there, if they had been rescued, or if they simply hadn't been taken, I think the Israelis would be moving far more rapidly and much more ruthlessly. But they have to think about the hostages. They can't ignore that fact.",
