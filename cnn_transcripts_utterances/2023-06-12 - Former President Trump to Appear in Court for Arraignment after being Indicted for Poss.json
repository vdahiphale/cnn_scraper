We're told that they're also keeping a close eye on the Proud Boys group, because apparently, there has been some communication between group members about traveling to Florida, though it is important to note that we're being told right now that there is no indication of any specific or credible threat.

She was confirmed by a 56 to 21 vote in the Senate, including 12 Democrats who voted \"yes.\"Now, as you said, if people recognize this name, it's because she was involved earlier, after the August search of Mar-a-Lago. Donald Trump went to court and asked for a special master to review the documents for privilege or any other issue before they went over to DOJ. That case went to Judge Cannon. She gave Trump the special master. But then DOJ appealed and the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected, reversed her in pretty staunch terms. The 11th Circuit wrote that Judge Cannon had, quote, improperly exercised equitable jurisdiction. Let me translate that. It means she went out of her lane. She did more than she's allowed to do as a judge. And the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote, the law is clear, we cannot write a rule that laws any subject of a search warrant to politic government investigations after the execution of the warrant nor can we write a rule that allows only former presidents to do so.

Or DOJ can make a motion and say, judge, this is a little awkward, but we think you ought to recuse yourself, and here's why.Could there be a potential conflict of interest? First, there's the point that she was a Trump nominee. We've never had this before, because we've never had a president capable of appointing federal judges as a defendant. My suspicion is that's not going to be enough. Or they could say you had that prior ruling, but usually giving a prior ruling in favor of somebody and then getting reversed is not quite enough for a conflict of interest, but we'll see.

Assume, for example, for the sake of discussion that Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, fill in the blank, should be indicted, should be prosecuted, and the failure to do so constitutes a double standard. Just assume that for purposes of discussion.Now look at this indictment of Donald Trump. Do those people who make that complaint say, therefore, the answer is not to prosecute Donald Trump? That the response to a double standard is to move to no standard at all? Absolutely not. You know, Republicans used to believe that not prosecuting criminals led to more crime. The answer here is take the politics out of the decision, and in this case, proceed with the prosecution, and do the same for anybody else who does anything even remotely like it.",

I think it's critical for those who seek to be the Republican nomineeto tell Republican voters the truth about this indictment. I wish the RNC could e-mail a copy of the indictment to every registered Republican in the country, and I'd simply say, I'm not going to make a lot of arguments with them, just read the indictment and ask yourself, if the government can prove what they allege here, shouldn't this man go to jail?",

Let's go.Does anybody think Donald Trump's really going to do that? I hope the Justice Department really does try for a speedy trial, because frankly, the sooner it goes to a jury, and we find out their answer, whatever -- whatever that answer is going to be the better for the country.
