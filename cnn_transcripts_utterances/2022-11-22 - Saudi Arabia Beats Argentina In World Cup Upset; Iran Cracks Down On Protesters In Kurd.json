      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, a World Cup upset of historicproportions. What Saudi Arabia's win against Argentina means to the Middle East. Then Iran's crackdown is turning Kurdish cities into war zones as the regime tries to stamp up protests. And then later, landslides are complicating search and rescue in Indonesia where more than 200 people have died after an earthquake. But first tonight, it is one of the greatest upsets in World Cup history as underdog Saudi Arabia beat Argentina who are among the favorites to win as you all know, the whole tournament. The Saudis are so overjoyed that the king has declared -- I kid you not, Wednesday, a public holiday. Well, coming into the tournament, Saudi Arabia were ranked 51st in the world. But they defied the odds, securing a 2-1 win of Neil Messi's Argentina. Argentina did start strong. Messi gave Argentina the lead from that penalty spot as you saw there. Argentina netted three more times in the first half, but each attempt was ruled out for offside. Well, after the break, the Saudis scored twice in five minutes to stun the team ranked third in the world. Really a game of two halves. Our Becky Anderson is on the ground in Qatar covering all the World Cup drama for us. She joins me now live. And Becky, so good to see you. Look, this was a major upset. There's no way about it, no other way to say it. I was glued to the tele on the train. How special was this with Saudi Arabia?",

Let's remember that this is the first World Cup ever to be hosted in this region of the Middle East and the gulf. And for the people of this region, this is absolutely huge. So today's matchup between Saudi Arabia which is pretty much the team in this region, which has the most storied history when it comes to the World Cup. They competed in six. Their match-up between them and Argentina was always going to be a big deal. But what it delivered was insane, sublime, and frankly, unbelievable on so many levels. Have a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANDERSON (voice-over):  Sometimes, the beautiful game is just that. A game. And then there are days when it is so much more than that.

In a statement, the club thanked him for his contribution across two spells at Old Trafford, as you can see there. And said the departure is by mutual agreement. Frosty relations if you remember between player and club came to a head early this month when Ronaldo gave an interview in which he said he felt betrayed by Manchester United and stated his lack of respect for Manager Erik ten Hag. Ronaldo issued his own statement in the last half an hour or so, saying he loves the club and quote, \"that will never ever change, however, it feels like the right time for me\", he says, \"to seek a new challenge.\" While his next club is uncertain, right now, he's at the World Cup with Portugal and they take on Ghana on Thursday. Want to leave the World Cup now and take you to Iran because Tehran is targeting Iranian-Kurdish groups in northern Iraq. PAK, the Kurdish -- Kurdistan Freedom Party says Iran launched a new round of missile and drone strikes on Tuesday on the group's military base across the border. Iran's Revolutionary Guards claim they are targeting, quote, \"terrorist groups\" who are supporting the protest movement back in Iran. Jomana Karadsheh is following the story for us and joins me now. And Jomana, you and I have spoken about the crackdown in predominantly in Kurdish areas.

From lining the mall with the South African flag to rehearsals for the royal carriage procession. A special menu for Tuesday's state banquet has even been designed. South Africa's national flower carefully being recreated out of sugar. The British monarchy shares a long and complex relationship with South Africa, a former colony and enduring Commonwealth nation and Britain's biggest trading partner on the African continent. But beyond royal relations, this will be an opportunity for the British government to strengthen its own diplomatic ties with South Africa. JAMES CLEVERLY, U.K. FOREIGN SECRETARY:  The fact that we are welcoming the president of South Africa for His Majesty the King's first ever state visit, I think should be read as our enduring commitment to the continent. BASHIR (voice-over):  Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will also be looking to cement his own relationship with the South African president. With ambitious plans to, in his words, \"turbocharge investment and economic growth in South Africa.\" Trade between the two nations is worth more than $12 billion annually.

He was there with his daughter and her boyfriend, 22-year-old Raymond Vance. And Raymond was murdered in that club. So he's a hero. He's a victim. He's lost friends. It's terrible. You heard him mention there a young man. At that point we did not know the young man's name. So the two of them got to the suspect, got him on the ground. This young man was at the suspect's head. So Fierro told him, get the AR away from him. Get the rifle away from him. This man started kicking the suspect in the head. We now know who he is. He is a U.S. Navy Petty Officer Thomas James and he was injured. He's in the hospital right now. The Navy says that they hope still that he will make a full recovery. There was also, Isa, a third hero involved here. So once Thomas James, who was injured, kind of drifted away, Fierro recruited somebody else who was walking past wearing high heels.

As for the suspect, we hear he will soon be released from the hospital. He's not talking to police. His mother is not talking to police. We have learned that he changed his name back in 2016 just before he turned 16 after some online bullying. We don't know if those two things are connected. In terms of the investigation, the police say they're not going to be giving us any updates in the next few days. They say that there is a judicial proceeding underway that's outside of our control.
