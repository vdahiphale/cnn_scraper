      "sentences": "Yes, Jim. So there are political and practical ramifications here. Let me start first with the practical, there are 40 million student loan borrowers who are eligible for this program, 26 million of them have already applied, 16 million had been approved for up to $20,000 in debt forgiveness.But the thing is right after they were applied and were approved, lower courts actually blocked this program. So if the Supreme Court continues to knock down this program, millions of students will not be eligible for student loan forgiveness. However, the Biden administration has said that if the Supreme Court approves this program and lets them move forward, that students will be eligible for that debt relief starting 60 days after a decision comes down. Now for the political implications of this, the Biden administration is arguing that they are justified and have the power to put this program into place under the Heroes Act. That statute actually gives the education secretary the power to waive or modify loan provisions if there is an emergency. And the Biden administration has said that this ongoing COVID pandemic is that emergency and justifies this relief. However, as we've seen from this court, they are very skeptical of this argument. This court has already blocked the administration multiple times when it comes to their COVID argument. They actually blocked the eviction moratorium for rental payments, and then they blocked a testing or vaccination program for large employers. So this is a court that is very skeptical of the Biden administration pushing these programs because of COVID. This is a court that is also very skeptical of agency power. So another -- that'll be one argument here that the Biden administration will make, but another argument that will be presented is a bit technical, it revolves around whether the parties in this case, the six Republican states that are suing also two individual students, whether they even have the power to bring this lawsuit. And, guys, that will be the argument that the Biden administration is really banking on here, because if the Supreme Court finds that these parties don't even have standing to bring this lawsuit, they could knock this case out, allow this program to go forward. But a lot here is on the line. We've got borrowers, advocates rallying at the court behind me, because millions of students are sort of on hold now in limbo waiting to see if up to $20,000 of their debt will be forgiven. Guys.",

And both of them sort of have complicated standing arguments, the borrowers in particular, because even if they win, these are two folks who borrowed money, right, and did not get their loans forgiven. Even if they win, they're not going to be benefited because the program will be done away with, right? They can't ever recover money. So it's just standing is a really tricky thing here in this case.

You have red states ultimately challenging the question here.Look, the law -- and Jessica Schneider talked about this at the beginning of the segment, the law is quite clear on the matter which from the Heroes Act, which is that if there is a, quote, national emergency, which was declared on March 13th, 2020 by former President Trump, then the secretary of education can take steps and actions there.
