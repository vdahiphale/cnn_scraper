Please welcome White House Correspondents' Association's President, Tamara Keith.TAMARA KEITH, NPR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT AND CO-HOST: Ally of the people has a nice ring to it. Thank you, Governor, and welcome to the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner. For the first time since 2016, we have both the President and the Vice President here, as well as their spouses. Their presence is a statement and endorsement of the importance of a free and independent press, even if they don't always like the questions we ask or the way we ask them. Now, acknowledging that this is an entire evening dedicated to celebrating journalism and the White House press corps, I am also here to tell you that it isn't about us or the celebrities who are here, though, thank you for your support. Thank you very much for your support. As the governor said, as weird as this event is with politicians and glamorous famous people and totally unglamorous journalists all gathered in the same room, there is something uniquely American about the fact that we can all be here together. And then, these reporters can go out on Monday and do stories about these very same politicians that pull no punches. When we're asking questions in the Oval Office under the wing of Air Force One or in the briefing room, we are standing for the American people. Our responsibility to the country is woven into the fabric of the nation, enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution. And we take that responsibility seriously. But, not so seriously that we can't have a little fun tonight and laugh at a few jokes, including some at our own expense. So, welcome to the nation's biggest celebration of the First Amendment and the important work of bringing an inquisitive spotlight to those in power. Up first to present the WHCA awards, please welcome ABC News White House Correspondent, Karen Travers. [21:35:00] KAREN TRAVERS, ABC NEWS: Good evening. I am honored to present this year's WHCA Awards to several incredible journalists, some of whom are also wonderful colleagues of mine on the White House beat, journalists who bring the years of wisdom and experience, sharp insights, and tenacious reporting every day to their beats. The Aldo Beckman award for overall excellence in White House coverage is named for a former association president, the late Chicago Tribune Correspondent Aldo Beckman. This year, the award goes to Matt Viser of The Washington Post. The judges said Matt Viser stood out among his competitors for work that went beyond the humdrum of covering the managed events of the presidency and the White House. Viser captured the spirit of Joe Biden, particularly with stories about the President's brother and how his Catholic faith influenced his strategic vision of the office. The WHCA is pleased to give the Aldo Beckman Award to Matt Viser. The WHCA gives out two awards for reporting under deadline pressure, one for print, another for broadcast. This year's print winner is Jeff Mason of Reuters. The judges said, based on a tip and working his sources, Jeff broke the news of a White House solar initiative late on the Sunday night, hours before the administration announced on Monday morning. The speed of just reporting had an impact on the markets and led to multiple other news outlets citing his piece before the official White House announcement the following day. Please welcome the winner of the Deadline Award for Print, from Reuters, Jeff Mason. And now the broadcast award. This year's winner is Phil Mattingly of CNN. The judges said Phil Mattingly of CNN was ahead of the competition and the official White House announcement in breaking the news and the details of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's planned trip to the White House in December 2022. Phil led CNN's coverage of Zelenskyy's visit, including asking both Zelenskyy and President Biden questions at their joint press conference that elicited deeply personal and newsworthy responses. Phil's 16 live shots in a 24-hour period combined scoops, context and depth. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Of the winning photo, the judges said Doug Mills expertly captured an unscripted moment with President Joe Biden as he emerged from the shadows to celebrate the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 at an event on the South Lawn. The image is striking for its composition, symmetry, and use of light. The President's expression and posture intensify the atmosphere with a sense of gravity, as you, the gazing marine honor guards, who frame him. Let's congratulate New York Times photographer Doug Mills. The WHCA partners with the University of Florida to present the Collier Prize for State Government Accountability, which is designed to encourage coverage of state government, focusing on investigative and political reporting. For their series about the spectacular failures by the State Bar of California to regulate and enforce the integrity of lawyers in the state, this year, the award goes to Harriet Ryan and Matt Hamilton of the Los Angeles Times. The university said the series showed the bar's failure to prevent a trial attorney from using client settlement money to buy his wife $750,000 diamond earrings, and his mistress, a sitting appellate court justice, a $300,000 beachfront condo. It also showed that disbarment rates for blackmail lawyers are nearly four times more than those of their white peers. Their reporting resulted in reforms, government investigations, increased transparency and new legislation. Please join me in congratulating Harriet Ryan and Matt Hamilton of the Los Angeles Times. The Katharine Graham Award for Courage and Accountability, named in honor of the legendary Washington Post Publisher, goes this year to Josh Gerstein and Alex Ward of POLITICO. The judges said POLITICO's efforts to report, verify and publish the draft Supreme Court opinion reversing abortion rights and the organization's follow-up work exploring the consequences of the decision were globally historic and groundbreaking. It flipped the long-standing belief here in Washington, D.C. that nothing leaks from the Supreme Court. Here was journalism about a ruling that has had a profound and immediate impact on tens of millions of lives. Take a look. (VIDEO PLAYING)",

What you're really doing here in this ballroom is funding scholarships for the next generation of the fourth estate.Over the last 10 years, the WHCA has given out nearly $1.1 million in scholarships, and leveraged another $1 million in additional aid to aspiring journalists like Julia Benbrook. In 2021, while a student at Northwestern University, she won our Deborah Orin Scholarship. Tonight, she is here as a Washington Correspondent for Spectrum News. Yesterday, we had 28 of this year's scholarship recipients meeting White House Correspondents Weijia Jiang from CBS, Zolan Kanno-Youngs from the New York Times, and Sabrina Siddiqui of The Wall Street Journal. They heard from Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, a strong supporter of press freedom, and the daughter of a journalist. And they got an on-the-record briefing from Karine Jean-Pierre, sitting in the seats we hope these students will someday occupy. (VIDEO PLAYING) Me and other members of the White House press corps, spent most of yesterday with them, and let me tell you, these scholars are much more impressive than any of us were at that age. These amazing young journalists are here with us tonight. If they come to talk to you, give them a job. Now, with our students, please stand up and let's give them all a round of applause.",
