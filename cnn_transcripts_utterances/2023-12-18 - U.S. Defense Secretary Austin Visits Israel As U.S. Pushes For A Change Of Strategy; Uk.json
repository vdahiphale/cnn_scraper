His trip comes amid mounting international pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu to stop the bombardment of Gaza. We have the very latest for you. Then, Ukraine struggles to make progress on the battlefield as U.S. and EU funding is stalled, what that could mean as Russia's war grinds on. Plus, a CNN investigation into an American charity and its links to anti-LGBTQ laws in Africa. That is coming up later. But first, this evening, the U.S. Defense Secretary says he did not come to Israel to dictate timelines or terms for the war on Hamas, but he is urging greater precautions to minimize the catastrophic loss of civilian life we are seeing in Gaza. Lloyd Austin visited Tel Aviv today, meeting with top officials including Prime Minister, as you can see there, Benjamin Netanyahu. Austin says U.S. support for Israel's security is unshakable, pledging to continue providing weapons for the war. He also discussed how Israel could transition from high intensity operations to more precise and surgical strikes, a sensitive subject after President Joe Biden accused Israel, if you remember, of indiscriminate bombing.

Let's get more on all of this, and bring in our Will Ripley who joins us this hour in Tel Aviv for more. Will, good to see you. Let's start with what we heard there from Lloyd Austin. He talks of Israel transitioning, well, to a less intense phase in the war. What does this mean in practical terms, and how soon will this happen?

A plea for help written with leftover food, saying, help. Three hostages, and yet, all three of them were gunned down. It raises questions about how the IDF forces are acting as they go, you know, door-to-door, and these combat operations on the ground in Gaza. So, what it's really doing is, it's intensifying pressure on the Israeli prime minister on the government here to secure the release of around 120 hostages that remain in Gaza. But I can tell you the sentiment on the ground is people overwhelmingly want to see this job done. They want to see Hamas rooted out and destroyed because they feel if that doesn't happen, Israel will only fall victim in the future to yet another horrific attack. So the horrors really are happening on both sides. The horror here on October the 7th, and the ongoing horror in Gaza. And as it is so many times as we see history repeat itself, a sad, bloody cycle of violence once again playing out here. And the children and the civilians and the innocent people caught in the crossfire as they have been so many times. Isa.",

Hospitals are also increasingly coming under attack including them sheltering displaced civilians. And I want to warn you our next report has some very disturbing scenes. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SOARES (voice-over): Sheer terror inside southern Gaza's Nasr Hospital, an artillery strike has just hit somewhere in the building. With the power cut, people inside rush with flashlights and mobile phones to try and find where and who has been struck. Here, they find her, wrapped in a blanket is the body of 13-year-old Dina Abu Mosem(ph). She had been recovering from an amputation at the hospital following a previous strike in Khan Yunis, according to the Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health in Gaza. Weapon remnants found by her bed were consistent with an Israeli illumination shell, a weapons expert told CNN. CNN reached out to the IDF, but is yet to receive a response. In the destroyed grounds of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, another heartbreaking goodbye. This hospital had been under siege for days by Israeli troops who claimed it was operating as a command and control center for Hamas. They withdrew from Kamal Adwan on Saturday, saying in a statement, quote, \"their activity in the area was completed\", and released video of a small amount of weapons they apparently found there. According to the U.N.'s Office for Humanitarian Affairs, quote, \"an Israeli military bulldozer flatten the tents of a number of internally-displaced persons outside the hospital killing and wounding an unconfirmed number of people. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): We have been displaced, and today, they demolished buildings, killing doctors, leaving nothing behind. They haven't even spared the doctors.

They are reporting earlier in the week a white phosphorus, bullets on the ground, this is deadly serious in its most literal sense.

At command, they watch a wasteland, tree lines now bear. The dead, the injured, it's unclear if Russia treats them differently.  Another Ukrainian drone aims for a foxhole.

Still, they claim they have held hard one ground, but at a huge cost. \"As we say in the army\", he says, \"the counteroffensive was smooth on paper, but we forgot about  the ditches.
