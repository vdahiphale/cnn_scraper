And they've been trying -- the Ukrainians have been trying to stop the Russians from that invasion. And one of the ways that they do that is to shoot at military targets in Russia.

And then on the other, you have some of these tech bros or, you know, Silicon Valley latecomers who do also support Donald Trump, but clearly they are aligned a little bit differently when it comes to this immigration issue. Now, the one thing that we saw, I think a lot of people really take offense to is the way that Vivek Ramaswamy framed some of this today. I want to read for you what he posted on X. He wrote, quote: Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long. It went on to say: A culture that venerates Cory from 'Boy meets world' or Zach and Slater over Screech in 'Saved by the Bell', or Stefan over Steve Urkel in 'Family Matters' will not produce the best engineers.\" Now, I can tell you that clearly, you know, a lot of people on the far right took issue with this. We saw people like Laura Loomer, Ann Coulter, Mike Cernovich, the conservative pundits. I can go on saying that, you know, Americans are also, you know, well-suited for a lot of these jobs. Why do we have to rely on foreign workers? Now, the one person we haven't heard weigh in on all of this is Donald Trump. But, of course, he's going to have to address this at some point once he is in office. He's also been kind of ambiguous on this issue in the past. We know that under his first administration, you saw H-1B visas decline as well as at one point actually be delayed or stopped altogether.

And every time that I've seen that message tested with Republicans, it does quite well.Right now, there's a sense that the illegal immigration in our country is out of control, and therefore that needs to be the first priority. And so there is a real reluctance to embrace greater legal immigration I think until that first issue is considered a little more under control. But everything I've seen suggests that Republicans quite like the idea of America being exceptional, America being a place where the best and brightest want to come, where people are sending their best to come here. So I think that ultimately Donald Trump has more credibility on the issue of immigration than almost any other Republican out there. If there's anybody who can probably bring these two sides together, it's him. And there is some constituency in the party for being the place that brings the best and brightest from the world around, as long as Scott said, it's not being abused.",

I want you to listen to what his attorney told Pamela Brown on CNN earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) TIM PARLATORE, PETE HEGSETH'S ATTORNEY: The allegations of misconduct are going to be easily disproven. The fact that earlier in his life, when he was a young recent combat veteran who came home and dealt with the demons by drinking too much, you know, that's not -- you know, that's not uncommon. A lot of us went through that, you know, I went through that. A lot of my friends went through that, and a lot of us, like Pete, have overcome that. And he's been able to overcome those demons. So that which drove him to drink is not driving him anymore. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Are you concerned at all that the federal health officials are downplaying the threat here?LAURIE GARRETT, AUTHOR, \"THE COMING PLAGUE\": Well, first of all, I think you need to know that there has been human to human transmission for more than 20 years of the H5N1 virus. I have personally been in on the ground looking at outbreaks in northern Vietnam, in Bangladesh, in southern China, and in every case, what has happened is an individual acquired the infection from an animal, typically a wild bird or a chicken, and then transmitted it to their caretaker, to a loved one who was very intimately with them as they were ailing, perhaps dying. And I also tracked an actual wedding in Vietnam, where the virus spread among the wedding party, and there were no live chickens present. No live birds. So that remains an outstanding mystery. Nevertheless, we have reason to be concerned in north America because great barriers were put up by the Bush administration when the first big mutation happened in 2005, that made the virus transform from just an Asian bird flu virus into one that transmitted into a far broader range of birds and made it up into Siberia, over into Europe, and threatened to come to the United States via Alaska. And so the Bush administration went all out on trying to come up with surveillance up in Alaska and a bird flu plan. Unfortunately, over time and subsequent administrations, as the bird flu failed to actually materialize into a terrible epidemic, everybody let their guard down. Meanwhile, this virus has appeared and killed all sorts of mammalian species. It's no longer by any means just a bird virus, 24,000 sea lions alone died of this virus at this time last year between Argentina, Peru and Chile. So we've had early warning and we haven't responded. Now we have a case of a recombinant form in Louisiana and a case in British Columbia, similarly, a recombinant form both produce severe illness in the individuals, and the alarm buttons are starting to go off in America.",

First of all, Phil, thanks for having me here. Look, I think there is concern, certainly, among public health officials both in and outside of government. We don't know the risk of this having sustained human to human transmission. That's what we worry about for causing a pandemic. But we know plenty to act now. We know plenty to up our game on detection, to up our game, on testing to make sure we have enough vaccines for Americans so that if the if the virus mutates further and starts spreading more easily, we can actually halt its spread and protect people. So we know plenty to act and predicting exactly what the virus is going to do three, six, 12 months down the road is very hard business, but preparing is not. And that's what we got to be doing.",
