Just ahead, the U.S. Senate unveils a bipartisan border security bill designed to send more aid to both Israel and Ukraine. But is the deal already dead on arrival in the U.S. House?America's top diplomat heads to the Middle East for the fifth time since October, looking to ease tensions amid growing fears of a widening conflict. And California grapples with extreme weather as heavy rain and strong winds bring power outages and potentially deadly flooding. Good to have you with us. And we begin this hour in Washington where U.S. Senators unveiled the details of a highly anticipated border bill on Sunday. It could dramatically change U.S. immigration law for the first time in decades. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he will take the first procedural step today. But before the details even came out, House Speaker Mike Johnson signaled that the bill would be dead on arrival. The $118 billion bipartisan package would empower the U.S. to significantly restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. It also includes critical aid for Ukraine and Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden says he strongly supports the deal, adding, quote, \"The United States Senate has done the hard work it takes to reach a bipartisan agreement. Now House Republicans have to decide, do they want to solve the problem or do they want to keep playing politics with the border? I've made my decision. I'm ready to solve the problem.\" More now from CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, who's following Joe Biden on the campaign trail.",

Of course, it's an important state as the president stares down November, one that he only narrowly won in 2020 and especially important as polls show a close contest nationally between President Biden and his Republican opponent.Of course, all of this. happening as news broke of a deal that was struck in the Senate that would address the U.S.-Mexico border. Only minutes before the White House releasing a statement saying the following, quote, \"For too long, going back decades, the immigration system has been broken. It's time to fix it.\" It goes on to say, \"Now we've reached an agreement on a bipartisan national security deal that includes the toughest and fairest set of border reforms in decades. I strongly support it.\" Now, of course, White House officials had been involved in these ongoing talks to make major border policy changes. They include in this deal, for example, a new emergency authority that would give the president the ability to shut down the border if certain metrics are met while also expediting the asylum process. Now all of this is still up for debate and the Senate leader Chuck Schumer plans to set up a floor vote this week. But already House Speaker Mike Johnson is coming out against it saying that even if it were to reach the house it would already be dead on arrival. Meaning that the future of this deal is still very much up in the air. Priscilla Alvarez, traveling with the President, CNN.",

This will be Blinken's fifth visit since the October 7th Hamas attacks in Israel. He plans to visit Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Qatar, Israel and the West Bank. Meanwhile, two U.S. defense officials tell CNN that weekend airstrikes in Iraq and Syria destroyed or damaged 84 of 85 targets. The strikes were retaliation for the drone attack that killed three U.S. soldiers in Jordan.And as we get a look at the aftermath of the strikes, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan tells CNN that more action is coming. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  We are still assessing the battle damage. Our CENTCOM, Central Command, is looking at the capabilities we reduced and the casualties that were incurred. The president was clear when he ordered them and when he conducted them that that was the beginning of our response and there will be more steps to come.

A Houthi official says the group will quote, \"meet escalation with escalation.\" (VIDEO PLAYING) U.S. Central Command released this new video of the strikes in Yemen. It shows missiles launched from two U.S. destroyers and fighter jets taking off from the USS Eisenhower. And in Gaza, Israeli airstrikes killed dozens of people over the past 48 hours. A doctor told CNN at least 14 Palestinians were killed and many others injured when Israeli strikes hit a mosque in central Gaza on Sunday. And on Saturday, an Israeli strike killed at least 17 people in Rafah. The Hamas-controlled Palestinian Health Ministry says at least more than 27,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the October 7 Hamas attacks. Journalist Elliott Gotkine joins us live with more on the situation. Good morning to you, Elliot.

      "sentences": "He does have a very full intro, doesn't he, Rosemary? And as you say, this is his fifth trip to the region since the October the 7th massacre by Hamas. And he's got a pretty familiar looking entree and he's got four broad objectives. One at which we just heard the Houthis discussing about escalation being met with escalation is to try to prevent any further escalation of the Israel-Hamas war, which of course is very much focused on the Gaza Strip, but tensions still remain incredibly high on the border with Lebanon, with the Iranian-backed proxy of Hezbollah and Israel continuing to exchange fire.Israel, in fact, saying over the weekend that since October the 7th, it's hit more than 3,400 Hezbollah targets in Lebanon and more than 50 Hezbollah targets in Syria, saying that the aim is to disrupt the supply and the flow of weapons from Iran to its proxy in southern Lebanon and also partly in Syria as well. So that's one of his objectives, but the others all revolve around the hostage talks. Now we were talking last week about a kind of framework agreement being reached between Hamas and Israel via the mediators of Egypt and Qatar. This would allow for the release of some of the 100 hostages who abducted in the Hamas-led massacre of October the 7th and have been in captivity now for more than 120 days in exchange for roughly three times the number of Palestinian prisoners in the first phase. There would be a six-week pause in fighting as well. And then we are talking about subsequent phases, which would see the release of IDF soldiers and then bodies that Hamas took into the Gaza Strip or people that it killed in the Gaza Strip as well. But it seems we're in a bit of an impasse there because Hamas still seems to be insisting that Israel not only cease fire, but that it withdraws completely from the Gaza Strip before it will agree to a hostage deal. Israel, for its part, is saying that it won't do a deal at any cost. We heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu last week talking about he would not be releasing thousands of terrorists in order to do a deal. And everything revolves around that, because also in Blinken's entree, or his objectives for this trip, is to get a humanitarian pause in the fighting and to get more humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. But of course, those things cannot happen really without a hostage deal. So, he's got a very tall order to achieve if he wants to go back to the United States with anything of substance. Rosemary?",

We've had a lot of reports of those downed trees, downed power lines.This gentleman is leaving his minivan in a flooded area. The Cal Fire person has offered him a ladder to get out of this situation. It has been very difficult for a lot of these rescues to take place because the water continues to rise. This is occurring, or this has occurred, about 25 miles to the south of San Luis Obispo. All right, we take a look at this. You see there's a marginal risk, pretty much northern and central California. We get into Southern California, different story. Now the main portion of this atmospheric river, that moisture that's moving in off the Pacific, this very warm, very copious amounts of moisture, this is being thrown onshore in Southern California now. As I mentioned, 24 to 48 hours, this is going to be continuing. Very little let up. And for some of these coastal communities extending from Los Angeles County, Ventura County, Santa Barbara County, San Luis Obispo, we are looking at maybe four, maybe nine inches of rainfall. I saw that one report for Pasadena, possibly nine, almost 10 inches of rain is forecast. Well, very few days in these high-risk flood areas, very few days out of the year do they ever see that. But they account for almost 90 percent of the damage done. So, it doesn't take very much, but we go into Monday, we start to see that really high risk of excessive rainfall pushes further towards the east, so in areas right around Pasadena. That's why that was the report of perhaps as much as 10 inches of rainfall. This is a dire situation. In Malibu, they're saying that those canyon roads leading out of Malibu, impassable. You can't travel on them. That's one area. But this is going to happen all across Southern California. So please be aware. Take this seriously.
