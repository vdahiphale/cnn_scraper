And I pose this question to them, is this something that he could abide by? And obviously, no one in Trump's orbit can really tell him what to say, what not to say. He doesn't listen to that kind of advice. It's something that they kind of skirt around often.They'd rather, he didn't say anything at all, they'd rather that he didn't speak to reporters going into the courtroom or post late at night on Truth Social. But obviously, that's the reality. We know this well by now of Donald Trump and who he is and what he does. What I think is different here is that we're seeing him face consequences for that for the first time. And showing it, it's different when you're walking into a courtroom and saying something than just simply posting it online or complaining about something. The line that his attorneys have tried to walk is that he has a First Amendment right. He has this right to free speech, that he is able to kind of make these arguments and make his own defenses. And the judges here, I think we should note, they've all gone to great lengths to stress that they do agree with that, that he does have a right to defend himself, to plead his innocence in these cases. But what they say he doesn't have a right to do is attack the prosecutors, attack the judges, attack the clerks of the judges and that's what Trump has been doing. And I've asked when - earlier this month, when he was going after this clerk, the one that's sitting to Judge Engoron's right. I asked people why and it was something that Trump had read online about this clerk, had seen this photo of her with Sen. Schumer who I can guarantee you is taking pictures with thousands of New Yorkers, Wolf, and people across the U.S. And they said that he had seen that and that he believed she was partisan. Obviously, there's no basis to that. He made much more ugly insinuations in his post that he had on here. But it wasn't something that anyone on his legal team or his even political team thought was a good idea or thought was wise and yet he has continued to do so. Even walking into that courtroom today, knowing that this gag order is imposed, he still managed or still went on to complain. And they tried to claim he wasn't doing it. The judge clearly saw that differently, Wolf.",

We're going to watch this unfold as we're watching what's happening in New York unfold, what's happening in the Middle East unfold. There's a lot of breaking news happening right now. But Mike Johnson, the Republican representative from Louisiana, is now the Speaker of the House. He's been sworn in, 51 years old, elected to Congress in 2016 and sworn in 2017. Not many years in the House of Representatives, but he is now the Speaker of the House. Let's listen in. REP. ELISE STEFANIK (R-NY): On behalf of the House Republican Conference, we are unified and so proud to have elected Mike Johnson as speaker of the People's House. As many of you heard and the American people heard, I meant every word that I said on the House floor. I've had the opportunity to work with Mike Johnson as vice chair and I was so humbled and honored to nominate him. Mike epitomizes servant leadership. He is humble, but he is strong. He is well respected not only across this conference, but across this great nation. And we know the stakes. We know that we were sent here on behalf of the American people to serve as their voice, to stand up for them, to push back on the failed far-left agenda of single-party Democrat rule led by Joe Biden. So we are here unified in strength to reopen the People's House, and I'm so excited to turn it over to my colleague, Tom Emmer from Minnesota, our whip. REP. TOM EMMER (R-MN): Thank you, Elise.

He sounds a lot like George W. Bush. He is very conservative, but he's not confrontational and he's not combative. That presents a communication challenge for the Democrats, because they want to paint them as an extremist. And at least in his initial remarks, he was talking about common sense conservatives. Now on the issues, Mike Johnson is even to the right of George W. Bush. Now, George W. Bush won the presidency twice, it's a long time ago. The question is where do we go now? I'm going to call this an irony to be polite, since we're in the first hour of the Mike Johnson's speakership, but he's now third in line to the presidency. He talked about the founding fathers and he talked about the founding fathers saying it was the obligation of everyone who came after them to take good care of the American experiment. He voted to derail the American experiment. He led the effort with - he led Donald Trump's fight in the courts to get the House Republicans to subvert a fair and free election. And so how does he - can he ever get out from under that legacy? House Republicans don't care that he's under that legacy. Donald Trump lost the presidency. Republicans did not perform as well in the midterm elections in 2022, because the swing voters of America care, they see it as a farce.",

This is an extraordinary team that has been assembled here to serve the American people. Steve Scalise represents so much in our home state of Louisiana. One of the things he truly represents is perseverance and hope. And as he was talking here just a moment ago, I was reminded of the Scripture that says suffering produces perseverance, perseverance produces character and character produces hope. What we need in this country is more hope, that the people have lost their faith in our institutions, that their faith is at an all time low. And one of the reasons they've lost it is because the Congress over the years has not delivered for the American people well enough. We're in the majority right now. We've gone through a little bit of suffering. We've gone through a little bit of character building and you know what it's produced, more strength, more perseverance and a lot of hope and that's what we're about to deliver to the American people. We are going to speak - we're going to speak with clarity and conviction and consistency to the American people. We're going to tell them what we're for, what agenda we're pursuing and why it is best for every American, why it will give them more liberty, opportunity and security. We're going to speak to that clearly, we're going to act consistently and we're going to exhibit two things here, trust and teamwork. And this group will deliver for the American people. I said it in the chamber and I will say it here, we're going to govern well and I think the people are going to be very pleased with those results. We're so grateful, I'm so grateful and so humbled to have gotten a unanimous vote on the floor by all of my colleagues here. We went through a lot to get here but we are ready to govern and that will begin right away. You've all heard me talk a lot today and I'm not going to belabor the point because the sun is bright and it's too warm for the fall. But I'll say this, we're going to dispense with all the usual ceremonies and celebrations that traditionally follow a new speakership because we have no time for either one. The American people's business is too urgent in this moment. The hour is late, the crisis is great, in America we hear you and we are reporting again as I said in there to our duty stations. That will begin in just a few moments. This entire group is going to go back to the House floor and we are going to pass our resolution and support of the nation of Israel, our closest ally in the Middle East. You're going to see an aggressive schedule in the days and weeks ahead, you're going to see Congress working as hard as it's ever worked and we are going to deliver for the American people.

One member, Mark Green, just told me moments ago that this has been a traumatic few weeks, but they just want to move on from this endless bickering within the GOP that has left this chamber paralyzed.But Mike Johnson, they're not answering any questions from reporters about any of the issues that are on the agenda, how he plans to confront some of the key questions as he assumes the speakership. They will come right away. These three weeks, it may just sound like just the three weeks, but it really completely distracted from their party's agenda, their efforts to legislate, their tactics, none of those things that typically happened in a normal congressional week could happen because they were meeting behind closed doors, squabbling, bickering about this leadership crisis that they caused. And, ultimately, now that is on Johnson's lap to figure out how to avoid a government shutdown. He did put out a letter to his colleagues earlier today laying out the general agenda for the next six months, talking about how the timeline where they could move particular bills. But it was really light on a number of details, and it did not include how he would deal with the key question, Israel aid and Ukraine aid. The White House and Senate Democrats and Senate Republican leaders want to tie those two issues together, viewing them as essential. But there's widespread opposition within the House GOP conference to doing that. So how will Johnson confront that first key test? He has not answered that question also. How will he avoid a government shutdown by mid-November? Will he try to move a short-term resolution to keep the government open? It sounds like, according to reading the tea leaves and some of the language from some of his colleagues here, even some on the far right, that they will allow him some opportunities, some ropes, some leeway to keep the government open for a short period of time. But it's still uncertain what concessions he might seek from Democrats and the White House on that, which could provoke fears once again of a government shutdown if those issues are not resolved. So huge issues confronting Mike Johnson on the policy side, on the political front, as they try to make it sound like they're on the same page, but just simply still a lot of division about the policy and the tactics. And also notably Kevin McCarthy, the former speaker not at this press conference, as he is now out of his job as speaker, leaving the speaker suite, but was notably not here. A lot of McCarthy allies still very angry about everything that happened in the last few weeks.

Some members in the far - on the far left of the Democratic caucus have not signed on as co-sponsors of that bill. Will it have unanimous support? Will it have some opposition? That would be one thing to look for, but undoubtedly that will pass with significant support from both sides of the aisle as the Senate and the House try to send a message that the United States is behind Israel, and Johnson wants to put that issue on the floor. But still unanswered, though, Wolf, the aid to Israel. That is going to be - that has actual real significance in terms of the money and the battle and the war in Israel.

No.\"Now, just yesterday, the direct questioning by the New York Attorney General's office of Michael Cohen was all about fudging those financial statements to the benefit of Donald Trump while he worked for him. So, again, this is what the cross examination is doing. They're trying to catch him in a lie. It appears it's very possible that he did. And so, the president is angry about this and wants the trial to essentially end. That's what his lawyers are arguing for with this judge. So, again, we're still trying to get this information, but it does look like there is some flip-flopping going on that has angered the president, and he has stormed out of the courtroom making that statement.

It seems like what he's saying is, I'm pleased that my attorneys just did a good job on cross- examination of Michael Cohen, and I'm confident we will win. That remains to be seen. To be sure, his lawyers have been aggressively cross-examining Michael Cohen and exposing certain inconsistencies and certain biases on Michael Cohen's behalf. But that doesn't mean Donald Trump wins the trial. The verdict will be up to the judge considering the weight of all the testimony. And Wolf has, to the other point, about the gag order. So this was really an unusual event here. The judge had issued a gag order about three weeks ago after Donald Trump posted some inflammatory comments about the judge's clerk. And the judge issued a very narrow gag order. It said, you cannot talk about my staff. Well today, Donald Trump said or just recent - just yesterday he said critical things about the person sitting to the judge's right. And so the judge said, well, I think you mean my clerk there. That violates my gag order. Trump said, no, I meant Michael Cohen, the witness, who's on the other side of the judge. And so the judge ordered Donald Trump to take the stand a few minutes ago. Donald Trump took the stand and said, I meant Michael Cohen. And the judge said, I don't believe you. I find you non-credible.
