      "sentences": "Thank you very much. Let's start right now.Well, first of all, there is angle of this debate over federal workers and cutting or moving the workforce out of D.C. That we have not talked about. And that's the potential impact on black wealth. Now, the wealthiest majority-black counties in the country are right in that Washington metro area, Charles County and Prince George's county in Maryland. And the proximity, it's not a coincidence. The median annual household income in Charles County is $116,882. In Prince George's County, it's close to $98,000, far above the national average of $80,610. That's all according to the census. Federal work has long been a ladder to the middle class for millions of Americans of all races, but especially black people. Historian Frederick W. Gooding, Jr. has studied it. His book American Dream Deferred focuses on the period of 1941 to 1981 when the mantra in a lot of black families was, \"Get yourself a good government job\". And he writes about how the government allowed blacks more access to higher paying professional jobs at the time, certainly more access than they had before World War II. And he adds that such unprecedented access to economic opportunity prompted Gloucester Current, a former top official of NAACP, to fastidiously call the federal government the largest civil rights organization in the country. Now, today, black people make up close to 19% of the federal civilian workforce. In the private sector, blacks are 13%, which is closer to the percentage of the overall population. Now, I'm not laying all this out to champion the federal government as some great equalizer, right? There are disparities in management and at the higher ends of the pay scales. And we know what's happening with DEI. But this is the context that we should all have when politicians and Musk and Ramaswamy debate massive cuts to the federal workforce. It's going to impact every family of a federal worker that it touches, regardless of race. But as the saying goes, and it applies here, \"When white folks catch a cold, black folks get pneumonia.\" The co-leaders of this proposed advisory commission called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, were just on Capitol Hill this week. They're pitching their plans to members of Congress. And a key part of Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy's mission statement is. \"DOGE intends to work with embedded appointees and agencies to identify the minimum number of employees required at an agency for it to perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions.\" But here's what you could call some cold comfort from Ramaswamy this week to federal workers who could face firing because this wasn't. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VIVEK RAMASWAMY, Co-CHAIR OF PROPOSED \"DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT EFFICIENCY\": Because this wasn't about that wasn't really about ringing the biggest source of cost saving anyway gives us a lot of latitude to be able to treat those workers and their families in a respectful way, in a way that doesn't leave them in a lurch that might even be, by private sector standards, generous in transitioning. I think those are opportunities to both demonstrate respect to the individuals while saying that you, the individual federal worker, you're not the bad guy. But the existence of the bureaucracy that involves too many of those federal workers, that is what we're up against. And I think if we're able to separate those two things, we're going to be successful in doing this in a respectful but also aggressive manner. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The original name had long been denounced by Native Americans as a slur, but when the name was dropped in 2020, so was the logo.

We are all about the logo and the return of the logo and utilizing that opportunity, you know, to benefit Indian country.

Just give me what is it for the viewer. CONSTANCE RICE, FORMER MEMBER, OBAMA TASK FORCE ON 21ST CENTURY POLICING: Victor, thanks so much for having me. Great question. Consent decree is basically the Department of Justice saying we found deep seated problems that are a pattern of practice that warrant federal oversight and they warrant a court. And what the federal consent decree does is it's a contract. It's an agreement that the police department says, okay, we're going to, instead of being sued, we will agree to enter this agreement and we'll go to monitoring and we'll make the changes that are listed in the consent decree. So it's basically a drop down menu of changes in training, changes in deployment, in sort of mindset. It goes through all of those sort of surface changes for a department to be able to get out of the pattern and practice of the abuses that the Department of Justice has documented in its report. BLACKWELL: And so if the consequence is risk suit filed by the federal government against, let's say, the Memphis PD, what's your interpretation of what we heard from the chief of police and the mayor this week that said, yes, it's serious, but we're not signing that contract?",

It's because I think that the level -- the diagnosis isn't deep enough. It's kind of like sending someone with brain cancer to the hairdresser. A consent decree can take care of the surface stuff. It can't take care of the mindset and the mission.

The Indianapolis Recorder shared an account of what some saw when the USS West Virginia was struck by the Japanese, \"The ship's captain was hit and according to the article, two other officers and a Negro mess attendant stayed with the captain. The mess attendant was firing a heavy machine gun when the captain was dead and the three tried to leave the bridge, they found the lower part of the ship cut off by fire. The officers tossed a line to the bridge of adjoining ship and went over this line hand by hand, the last just making it as flames snapped the line.How the mess attendant got away, I don't know, but he did.\" This same edition of the paper also reported on the request by the NAACP President for President Roosevelt -- identified man. The NAACP pointed out that his heroism is especially noteworthy in view of the fact that Negro volunteers are accepted only as mess attendants by the U.S. Navy and give it no training as gunners or anything else. It is the African American press that would go on to discover the name of that Negro mess attendant, Doris Dorie Miller. Miller would go on to receive the Navy Cross in 1942. He was the first African-American to receive the highest medal awarded by the Navy. And in 2020 he was the first African-American to have an aircraft carrier named after him. Only former presidents have that honor now. And there have been many monuments and tributes to Miller in between. The nation's highest military recognition, though, is the Medal of Honor.
