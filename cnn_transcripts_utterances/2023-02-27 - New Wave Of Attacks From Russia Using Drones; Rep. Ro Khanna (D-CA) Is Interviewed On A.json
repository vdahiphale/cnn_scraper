And as you say, as those conditions on the ground worsen, those images geolocated by CNN that showed the conditions around Bakhmut, pretty grim with mud and floods in some areas, making those roads pretty well impassable.What Ukrainian authorities and President Zelenskyy has said tonight is that things are getting more and more challenging. What we're seeing over the course of the day are a series of intense attacks in several different parts of the frontline, but it is that battle for the town of Bakhmut that gets worse and more intense by the day with Ukrainian officials describing it very much as the epicenter. There have been, today, hundreds of artillery barrages and rocket strikes by the Russians as they try and encircle the town, and specifically the areas of settlements to the west of it. And desperate pleas on the part of the Ukrainians once again that they need more weapons. One Ukrainian commander asking once again for those F-16s that Washington has so far side they will not be sending to Ukraine. But also pleading desperately for more ammunition saying, look, it's pretty simple, with every shell that arrives, every piece of equipment that we get, it is another Ukrainian life that is saved, be it military or civilians. But it is another -- it is another life saved. And this, of course, is that battle to hold that as it gets more desperate. Ukrainians have said, look, we will defend it as long as we can, but not at any cost. That cost is going steeper by the day, Jake.",

I believe that they may have already been trained on F-16s just in case.The reality is that we are always kind of going slowly and incrementally and unfortunately driven a bit too much by fear of escalation. Vladimir Putin is not going to necessarily use a nuclear weapon if we provide fighter aircraft to the Ukrainians. They already have them. This of course would mean more capable aircraft and more aircraft in general for the Ukrainians. It will allow them to break through Russian lines. It will give them air cover for their troops on the ground. It will allow them to strike longer distances.

The defense resting its case this hour in a trial that really was supposed to take three weeks, where double that amount of time. At this point, they closed out with three different witnesses, the final being the younger brother of Alex Murdaugh, John Marvin Murdaugh.And they obviously use this as a humanizing effort where he talked about the pain that his family has been through. But he also discussed the days after the murders, talking about those interrogations that his brother and that the family went through, interviews they did. And he did something we've seen defense witnesses do, a theme here of painting a messy and incomplete investigation and crime scene response. He talked about finding, in his words, pieces what's left of Paul, who of course was shot and killed along with his mother, Maggie Murdaugh, back on June 7, 2021. That is testimony that we have heard from other witnesses who were there at the crime scene, who noted that it wasn't fully secured. But we also heard from these two expert witnesses that the defense brought on. One a pathologist and the other a crime scene expert while they tried to refute testimony that we'd heard from state witnesses and law enforcement witnesses earlier during the trial about how they may have been killed, the direction of the bullets and the shots that may have been shot at them, as well as something that has been, again, a bit of a theme here from the defense. The fact that there was maybe more than one shooter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
