The U.S. says there have been alarming signs of a growing cooperation between the two countries. Russia's defense minister visited Pyongyang in July in an effort to buy artillery ammunition for the war in Ukraine. U.S. officials tell us there are major worries about what North Korea could then ask for in return and that Pyongyang wants technical help not just for its satellites, but also nuclear-powered submarines. CNN Senior International Correspondent, Will Ripley, joins us now from Taipei. A Kremlin spokesman has just given some details on this trip. I wonder, what does the Kremlin say, what does the U.S. believe about what Russia is asking from Ukraine and what it expects to give in return.",

If Vladimir Putin actually has to go to Kim Jong-un of North Korea, a global pariah no longer standing on his own, because Putin's right there in the same boat after his unprovoked war in Ukraine. And essentially, Putin asked Kim for weapons, the Russian military being exposed for its battlefield deficiencies, needing things like artillery and ammunition that Kim Jong-un is sitting on a huge stockpile of.And, of course, Russia has ballistic missile knowledge, decades of institutional knowledge and experience and know-how that Kim wants as he continues to grow and develop his own nuclear program. So Kim Jong-un not only continues to build up this legitimacy, if you will, sitting down with major global figures - of course, this all began, as you know, Jim, with the former President Donald Trump. Even though that diplomatic effort fell apart, Kim Jong-un certainly learned his lessons. And now he is riding on the exact same train that he rode to Hanoi, Vietnam, came back empty-handed after the failed summit with President Trump, and he's heading to Russia under very different circumstances, potentially securing a valuable deal with Russia. They get cash for those weapons, cash that North Korea desperately needs and perhaps even more valuable. They get information and technology to continue to perfect these intercontinental ballistic missiles that they're testing at a dizzying clip, Jim.",

We believe that they are doing things that help Russia along, but they are not doing anything that the Russians - providing anything that the Russians can shoot at the Ukrainians.   North Korea has got a big stock of arms that is useful for that. Andthe Russians probably think, not without reason, that there is some justice in this because the United States arranged quietly to get 650,000 rounds of artillery to Ukraine from South Korea. They had to do it through a complex swap mechanism, but they did it. So what we're discovering is that the way the Korean peninsula armed up on both sides with artillery for a future war, if there ever was one between North and South, is actually exactly the kind of arms Ukraine needs.",

In other words, the group that looks at how and when you might have to use nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula if the South was attacked. They already run military exercises with South Korea.

And as you said, CDC's group of outside advisors meets tomorrow to make specific clinical recommendations for who should get this updated shot. And then the CDC director is expected to sign off pretty quickly after that and then these vaccines could start going out really within the coming days in pharmacies and other health care settings.And so some things to know about this updated COVID booster. It's been cleared for people ages six months and older, for people who are at least five years old, the recommendation is wait at least two months from your previous COVID vaccine shot. For people under five, it really depends on how many vaccines you've had and when you got them. This targets a strain of the virus known as XBB.1.5, which is one of the recently circulating strains. And the FDA cleared vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, which are both mRNA vaccines. There's a third maker, Novavax, which is not yet cleared, but is expected to be potentially sometime in September. That would offer a different technology known as a protein-based vaccine. And Boris, this approval comes as we are in a bit of an uptick of COVID cases right now. Hospitalizations are about 16 percent higher in the most recent week for COVID. This is really an uptick that began in early July and we're still in it right now. And so we're going to see what the CDC advisors say tomorrow about who specifically should go out and get their boosters. But this has been cleared for everybody over six months of age. Boris?",

But if you look at the perimeter and just how this search has grown and grown and grown, I think that tells the story of - the reality of the story of where police believe Cavalcante is.It started out as a two-mile radius just south of the Chester County Prison, which is only a few miles away from us right now. Now, we're at this point where there really is no perimeter. Police are saying, we believe that Cavalcante is in Pennsylvania. We believe Cavalcante is still in Chester County. But the reason, at least publicly, they're saying that they believe those two things is because they have no evidence to suggest yet that he has left. But make no mistake, the last sighting of Cavalcante that has been confirmed was back on Saturday night when they caught him on that ring doorbell camera. And that was after Cavalcante broke out of the near-to-here, near-to-the-command post perimeter that had been established for many days. He was caught on that ring doorbell camera after he stole a dairy farm delivery van, drove it more than 20 miles away from here to the Phoenixville area and then he was trying to solicit help from other acquaintances of him. Now, interesting new bit of information we learned from this press conference, the police say that these were not friends of his. These were not people that Cavalcante, as far as they know, have been in regular conversation. They said it's been quite a few years and they say that that - they, meaning police - say that that means that he's getting desperate. He is not able to reach close friends or close acquaintances. He has to reach out to acquaintances from years ago. But Jim, I want you to take a listen to what Lt. Col. George Bivens, who's been leading this investigation of state police, what he said about why he believes Cavalcante is still in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

These makeshift camps have been set up for those impacted by the earthquake who lost their homes.But earlier today, we were further south to one of the villages, which is more remote, more severely impacted by the earthquake. And when we got there, we spoke to people who told us that the rescue teams and the humanitarian relief teams have only just arrived today. Over the last three days, many of these families have been digging through the rubble with their bare hands, desperate to find loved ones buried beneath the destruction. We spoke to one family waiting desperately as the search and rescue teams combed through the rubble in silence, of course, waiting to hear a noise, waiting to hear the voices of their relatives. And they told us that this has been a complete disaster. They have lost everything. One woman telling us she has lost 19 members of her family in this disaster. And, of course, this is just the beginning. Many of these areas are too remote to reach. This was one of the villages that have - that had their access blocked because of the roads, because of the damage sustained as a result of the earthquake. They are very high in the mountains, small villages. And as you can imagine, the infrastructure there is not set up for this kind of response. We are, however, beginning to see teams reaching these - those locations now. We have seen several international teams, in fact, including teams from France, Spain, Qatar, as well, on the ground there, some from the United Kingdom, providing that urgent relief. But when we spoke to rescuers on the ground, the message that we heard from many of them is that this is becoming a recovery effort.
