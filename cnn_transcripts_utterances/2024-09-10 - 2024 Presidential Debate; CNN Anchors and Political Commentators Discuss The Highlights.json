I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people. He knows that. He's trying to, again, divide and distract from the reality, which is, it is very well known that Donald Trump is weak and wrong on national security and foreign policy. It is well known that he admires dictators, wants to be a dictator on day one, according to himself. It is well known that he said of Putin that he can do whatever the hell he wants and go into Ukraine. It is well known that he said, when Russia went into Ukraine, it was brilliant. It is well known he exchanged love letters with Kim Jong Un. And it is absolutely well known that these dictators and autocrats are rooting for you to be President again, because they're so clear they can manipulate you with flattery and favors. And that is why so many military leaders who you have worked with have told me, you are a disgrace. That is why we understand that we have to have a president who is not consistently weak and wrong on national security, including the importance of upholding and respecting in highest regard our military.",

The leaders of other countries think that they're weak and incompetent, and they are, they're grossly incompetent. And I just ask one question. Why does Biden go in and kill the Keystone Pipeline and approve the single biggest deal that Russia's ever made? Nord Stream, too, the biggest pipeline anywhere in the world, going to Germany and all over Europe. Because they're weak and they're ineffective. And Biden, by the way, gets paid a lot of money.",

And that's not who we are as Americans. Let's understand what happened here. I actually met with Zelenskyy a few days before Russia invaded, tried, through force, to change territorial boundaries, to defy one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I met with President Zelenskyy. I shared with him American intelligence about how he could defend himself. Days later, I went to NATO's eastern flank to Poland and Romania. And through the work that I and others did, we brought 50 countries together to support Ukraine in its rightist defense. And because of our support, because of the air defense, the ammunition, the artillery, the javelins, the Abrams tanks that we have provided, Ukraine stands as an independent and free country. If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. And understand what that would mean, because Putin's agenda is not just about Ukraine. Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known, which is NATO, and what we have done to preserve the ability of Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians to fight for their independence. Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe, starting with Poland. And why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch.",

And as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone, in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.But, let's understand how we got to where we are. Donald Trump, when he was President, negotiated one of the weakest deals you can imagine. He calls himself a deal maker. Even his National Security Advisor said it was a weak, terrible deal, and here is how it went down. He bypassed the Afghan government. He negotiated directly with a terrorist organization called the Taliban. The negotiation involved the Taliban getting 5,000 terrorists, Taliban terrorists released, and get this. No, get this. And the President at the time invited the Taliban to Camp David, a place of storied significance for us as Americans, a place where we honor the importance of American diplomacy, where we invite and receive respected world leaders. And this former President, as President, invited them to Camp David, because he does not, again, appreciate the role and responsibility of the President of the United States to be Commander in Chief with a level of respect, and this gets back to the point of how he has consistently disparaged and demeaned members of our military, fallen soldiers, and the work that we must do to uphold the strength and the respect of the United States of America around the world.",

And we don't want this kind of approach that is just constantly trying to divide us. And especially by race.And let's remember how Donald Trump started. He was a -- land, he owned land, he owned buildings, and he was investigated because he refused to rent property to Black families. Let's remember, this is the same individual who took out a full-page ad in The New York Times calling for the execution of five young Black and Latino boys who were innocent, the Central Park Five. Took out a full-page ad calling for their execution. This is the same individual who spread birther lies about the first Black president of the United States. And I think the American people want better than that. Want better than this. Want someone who understands as I do, I travel our country, we see in each other a friend. We see in each other a neighbor. We don't want a leader who is constantly trying to have Americans point their fingers at each other. I meet with people all the time who tell me, can we please just have discourse about how we're going to invest in the aspirations and the ambitions and the dreams of the American people?

I've made very clear my position on fracking, and then this business about taking everyone's guns away. Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away. So, stop with the continuous lying about this stuff. As it relates to the Affordable Care Act, understand, let's just look at the history to know where people stand. When Donald Trump was president, 60 times, he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, 60 times. I was a senator at the time, when I will never forget the early morning hours when it was up for a vote in the United States Senate. And the late, great John McCain, who you have disparaged as being -- you don't like him, you said at the time, because he got caught. He was an American hero. The late, great John McCain -- I will never forget that night -- walked onto the Senate floor and said, no, you don't. No, you don't. No, you don't get rid of the Affordable Care Act. You have no plan. And what the Affordable Care Act has done is eliminate the ability of insurance companies to deny people with preexisting conditions. I don't have to tell the people watching tonight. You remember what that was like? Remember when an insurance company could deny if a child had asthma, if someone was a breast cancer survivor, if a grandparent had diabetes? And, thankfully, as I have been vice president and we over the last four years have strengthened the Affordable Care Act, we have allowed for the first time Medicare to negotiate drug prices on behalf of you, the American people. Donald Trump said he was going to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. He never did. We did. And now we have capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month. Since I have been vice president, we have capped the cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000 a year. And when I am president, we will do that for all people, understanding that the value I bring to this is that access to health care should be a right, and not just a privilege of those who can afford it. And the plan has to be to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, not get rid of it.",

I believe in what we can do together. That is about sustaining America's standing in the world and ensuring that we have the respect that we so rightly deserve, including respecting our military and ensuring we have the most lethal fighting force in the world.

I'll tell you, I started my career as a prosecutor. I was a D.A. I was an Attorney General, United States Senator and now Vice President. I've only have one client, the people. And I'll tell you, as a prosecutor, I never asked a victim or witness. Are you a Republican or a Democrat? The only thing I ever asked them, are you OK? And that's the kind of president we need right now. Someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first.

Before the debate, Trump supporters expressed hope that the former president would stay focused on issues such as in inflation and immigration.And that did appear to be a struggle for Donald Trump, perhaps too often, most notably when he invoked what authorities in Springfield, Ohio or - is-- are saying is just false debunked meme that Haitian migrants are stealing and eating pets. He said that on the debate stage tonight. And if illegal immigration is the most important issue to you as a voter, he did talk about it aggressively but Vice President Harris' supporters have got to be pleased with her performance this evening which was focused on and A, telling voters that she cares about them and she has a plan for them and over and over baiting Donald Trump into talking about crowd sizes and court cases and Nancy Pelosi and Russiagate and grievance. And he took the bait almost every time, if not every time. He cited Fox hosts as fact-checkers. He invoked Hungarian strongman Viktor Orban as a character witness. It was like a 4chan post come to life. He really took her bait almost every time. If you're a fisherman, as I struggle to be, you would be lucky to have your bait taken so often. Instead of focusing on Trump filling in the blanks for those voters unfamiliar with her, he focused on stuff as if he was the incumbent. I'm not sure Harris necessarily did enough to fill in the blanks that undecided voters might have about specifics about her plans but there's no question Democrats have to go good tonight about the trade of Biden for Harris who showed herself to be a strong candidate. She delivered a strong message and yes, she prosecuted the case against Trump. She started the debate, she began the debate approaching Donald Trump, shaking his hand at the podium, kind of forcing him to shake her hand, introducing herself.

She -- the very first answer that she gave was about her economic policy where she talked about the $50,000 that they want to put out there for small business owners, that they would get in a tax refund. I thought that was incredibly important because they clearly know that there were a lot of things that they put out on economic policy. Not all of them were received well. That one was received well.
