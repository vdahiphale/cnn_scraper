They estimate the five people trapped onboard have less than 40 hours of oxygen left.The crew was on a mission, a tourist mission to visit the wreckage of the \"Titanic\" tens of thousands of feet below the surface, two and a half miles, in fact. CNN's Jason Carroll following live from Boston. I guess one of the challenges here is that some of the assets involved in this search are not even on site yet and yet you have a dwindling oxygen supply. What's the latest on getting all these pieces into place?",

The Coast Guard put their best foot forward and said there is a vessel out there at the site where the submersible went down.This vessel is equipped with an ROV, a remotely operated vehicle, machinery with a camera located on it as well. So as it's heading beneath the surface, it can try to search for this, for the missing submersible. Again, with just 40 hours of breathable air that's left. Within the past hour, when the Coast Guard was giving its briefing, I asked Captain Jamie Frederick, look, let's say you had located the submersible below the surface, and let's say you had all the resources you needed at surface level to go down there and get it, would 40 hours be enough even if you had all that? Here's what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CAPT. JAMIE FREDERICK, U.S. COAST GUARD: Obviously, getting salvage equipment on scene is a top priority. Unified Command is working through that to prioritize what equipment we can get there. There are ongoing operations right now via the U.S. Navy and TRANSCOM to get equipment staged and get it on scene. I can't give you an exact timeline of when that's going to happen. What I can tell you is there's a full-court press effort to get equipment on scene as quickly as we can. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that meant our gas mileage got worse, and our fuel ability to get to the airport in South America was right on the limit. Like we were just barely able to make it. And he stayed perfectly calm. He was one of our pilots flying the airplane. So he's had enough experience in these different flying missions and other missions that he's done that he'll be able to stay calm. And they know, I'm sure, this rescue effort is an incredible armada. By the way, thank you to the U.S. Coast Guard and Navy and Canadians and commercial vessels involved. I really think if they can be rescued, they will. The rescue effort is just so strong. So he's going to be able to stay calm. And I hope those five folks down there can.

For eight years, we've been asking, when might something that happens to Donald Trump in the news actually affect his numbers. This is something to watch. I'm not suggesting we're there. I'm suggesting we're seeing this little bit of softening. He's still got a 21-point lead. His favor numbers, another data point in this poll that is telling a story. You just saw he's at 60 percent favorable among Republicans and Republican-leaning Independents. But in May, he was at 77 percent. His favorables are down 10 points. His unfavorables, as you can see there, are up nine points. That's not welcome news for Donald Trump.

It's unclear what the U.S. can do at this point to deter any activity because the Chinese/Cuban partnership in terms of intelligence sharing in terms of economic ties have been growing over the last five or six years. There's two tracks they're taking at this point to try to minimize the impact this can have on the U.S. The first, of course, is basic diplomacy. Talking to Cuban officials, talking to Chinese officials to figure out any type of way for the relationship to be tamped down. And the second is counterintelligence issues, something that the White House spoke to earlier with John Kirby, national security council official. Saying, look, we have our ways of protecting our intelligence, of protecting our infrastructure from being exposed to any kind of Chinese spying or any kind of Chinese military activities.
