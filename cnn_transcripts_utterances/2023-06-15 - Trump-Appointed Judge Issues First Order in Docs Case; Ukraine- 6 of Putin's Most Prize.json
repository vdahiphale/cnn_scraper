Plus, a story you'll see only OUTFRONT, a graveyard of Russian missiles. Ukrainians collecting downed missiles, analyzing Putin's deadliest weapons and what they found, may surprise you. A special report. And where is Melania and Ivanka in the family? Trump's 2024 campaign is anything but a family affair. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, no recusal. Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, and is now presiding over his classified documents case, issuing her first order since Trump pleaded not guilty, a sign that she has no plans to heed the calls to recuse herself. Judge Cannon, ordering both parties to start the process of obtaining security clearances for their lawyers, by tomorrow. It comes as there are mounting questions about Cannon's record in past cases. The judge, who was appointed by Trump in 2020, has little experience overseen criminal trials. And according to \"Politico's\" Kyle Cheney, who reported extensively on Cannon's record, the most common cases that that she has handled as the judge, has been for what's called re-entry of deported aliens. These are routine matters that have nearly all resulted in plead deals and sentences, ranging up to 1.5 years. In fact, according to \"The New York Times\" analysis of the Bloomberg law database, of the 224 criminal cases assigned to Cannon, as we said, four of those only went to trial. And of those four, it was only 14 trial days in all. There is one fraud case, though, according to \"Politico\", that Cannon has been overseeing for the past year and a half. And they are so there are significant parallels to the Trump case. So, we're going to have much more that with Kyle in just a moment. But above all, it is Cannon's decision, of course, to side with Trump last year, in this very case. That is leading many to fear that she will be sympathetic to Trump. In September, she granted Trump's request for a special master, to review the sensitive documents seized at Trump's Mar-a-Lago home. Trump immediately posted a quote, remember, it takes courage and guts to fight a totally corrupt Department of Justice and the FBI. The reality, of course, is that Cannon's decision was overwhelmingly derided, and quickly overruled by a conservative appeals court. Evan Perez is OUTFRONT live in Washington, to begin our coverage tonight. And, Evan, obviously we've got this order today from Judge Cannon. It's significant, right? She's been assigned, we've heard nothing. Today, we get an order. What is it, what does it mean for the case?",

So she's done very little criminal trial experience, you know, only four trials overall that she's handled as a judge, and only four trials as an assistant U.S. attorney, by the way, as a prosecutor.So, her resume is very thin, and now she is taking on what could be one of the most complex cases ever, and so it's really going to be quite a learning curve.",

But I also think there's another reason why Democrats may want to take a beat before complaining too loudly about Judge Cannon. And one of them is that the Justice Department decided to bring this case, not only to Florida, but they checked the box on the forum that gave Judge Cannon a pretty good chance of getting the case. She was one of just fewer than a handful of judges in the northern part of the district, that could have gotten this case. So, clearly, the Justice Department decided to do that for a strategic reason. And, I think at the end of the day, we don't know how it will turn out.

That's one of the exact issues that we expect to rise in the Trump case.So, for all of the talk about how little experience she has, she's actually been shepherding this other case through, that may end up giving her some seasoning and some very precise parallels to what we are going to see in the Trump litigation.
