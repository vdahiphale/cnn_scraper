We are not getting any answers or any readouts on how this is going.But it's finally been this moment. It's been a long time coming. And last week, a federal judge had pushed this along because Trump had wanted to delay the deposition because there's some issues that are out on appeal. And the judge said, look, you know, this has been going on for a long time. He said Trump used many delay tactics and he said he cannot let him, he should not let him run out the clock. One of the big factors is that both Trump and Carroll, in their 70s, and so are other witnesses. The judge is saying time is of the essence. It was originally set to be brought in 2019. One of the questions today is, what will Trump say? Carroll had her deposition on Friday. And the judge, you know, as I said, he's trying to move this along. He set a trial date in this for February. He is pushing this to go forward. And if it does go to trial, then we will see this testimony in-person. These depositions are kind of a preview to that. Interesting wrinkle here is, again, that appeals court decision. If they resolve it in favor of Trump, then this lawsuit is likely to go away. But that doesn't mean it's the end of this sorry because E. Jean Carroll has said she's going to sue Trump under a new New York State law that goes into effect next month. That law allows survivors of sexual assault to sue, in a civil context, those that have allegedly attacked them, even if it's years after the encounter. She has already indicated she's going to do that. The judge in this case is saying the depositions taken today and last Friday are critical for that new case going forward.",

And really, what the letter represents is that Fetterman has been making improvements but he also has lingering issues that frankly the candidate has been frank about. Here is what Clifford Chen wrote in the letter: \"Occasional words he will miss, which seems like he doesn't hear the word but is actually not processed properly. His hearing of sound such as music is not affected.\" \"His communication is significantly improved compared to his first visit, assisted by speech therapy, which he has attended on a regular basis since the stroke.\" I can attest, as someone who has covered him throughout this year, that when John Fetterman returned to the campaign trail two months after his stroke, his speech was markedly worse than it is now. You've seen an increase of events that he has done, a number of interviews that he has done. His campaign has also extra addressed the stroke more forcefully. He put a campaign ad out a couple of days ago seeking to humanize the impacts of the stroke. [14:40:00] And obviously, this is all leading up to that critical debate that John Fetterman and Mehmet Oz will have next week in this key race. It's arguably, undoubtedly the most important Senate debate that these two folks will have, but also arguably the most important Senate debate in the entire country next week. Now, obviously, Dr. Oz as we've documented before has used this stroke and Fetterman's recovery to kind of question his health, question his fitness for the job. John Fetterman in response to this letter put out kind of took issue with that saying, \"Unfortunately for Dr. Oz, I'm ready to serve and continue to get better every single day.\" This is a race that has been tightening over the last few months. Over the summer, John Fetterman had a larger lead. We've seen in recent polls this is a close race between Fetterman and Oz and that debate should be key.",

So, medical services, food, recreation. There's television, free Wi-Fi, telephones to make international call, laundry and the like. And 90 percent of the staff here is bilingual, so they'll be able to do a very good job of helping folks who only speak Spanish. And there's going to be an intake process. So when asylum seekers arrive here, they'll be tested for COVID-19. And if they test positive, they'll be in these trailers outside this main large tent to be isolated for as long as necessary. If they are negative, they then have the opportunity to meet with a resettlement officer. That's someone who will help them figure out what their next destination will be, and how to get there.
