We are talking about five additional pages of classified documents that were found at President Biden's Wilmington home on Thursday night. This is according to Richard Sauber. This is the special counsel to the president. He says that he went over to the Wilmington house with DOJ officials to hand over one classified document that had been discovered on Wednesday and it is at this point that this group discovered the additional pages with classified markings.

That one argues that a case against Trump, quote, will probably not be brought no matter how many side-by-side charts are created to distinguish between the known allegations against Trump and the (INAUDIBLE) so far unknown culpability of Biden. It goes on to say, according to the latest Gallup data, 45 percent of Americans that identify as Republicans or leaning towards the Republicans, 44 percent Democrat or lean in that direction, the Justice Department serves them all and its credibility rests on being perceived to play fair.

It's really a separation of powers violation, to come in in the middle of an ongoing investigation and essentially try to disrupt it by, I guess, what they want to do is make public what's going on in the investigation.One of the very sacred things about our criminal process and the investigative process that the Department of Justice engages in is that it's not supposed to publicly pillory people or facts that are under investigation. The job is to investigate, figure out what the facts are, figure out if there's a case to be brought and then bring it and then talk about it. But you don't do it while you're investigating.

Finland is saying that they are considering doing the same. So, the significance of this move for Ukraine and western support for Ukraine, because without western support, Ukraine would not be in the position that they're in now and that support has to continue or they're going to fall behind.",

To provide the tanks, they need German approval.Now, the Brits have okayed the provision of 14 Challenger II tanks but you can't do much with just 14 tanks. So, I think what we're trying to do is nudge, push the Germans along to approve the re-export of tanks and provide their own. But that said, the bigger picture is this. Again, we need to get out of the stalemate, this war of attrition and allow Ukraine to get on the counteroffensive. Just the last few days, we've begun training hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers at an American military base in Grafenwhoer, Germany, another important factor.",

So, we know that some that were recovered of the 300 at Mar-a-Lago were top secret, right? We saw the markings. It also turns out that some of the Biden classified documents that were mishandled, not stored correctly, were also top secret. It included some intelligence memos. It included topics like Ukraine, like Iran, like the U.K., memos from President Obama to Biden and Biden to Obama, calls with the British prime minister, on and on.I thought it was notable that yesterday on ABC, Adam Schiff, a Democrat, former chair of the intelligence committee, didn't rule out that national security could be compromised as a result.

The circumstances are different, though, Mr. Secretary. Do you think one hinders the other or one affects the other?",
