Let's get right to what America is talking about. Hell has officially frozen over tonight. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who Democrats have spent decades calling evil, and Darth Vader, he says he is voting for Kamala Harris. In a statement, he says there is no greater threat to the republic than Donald Trump, and that he can never be trusted with power again. Meanwhile, Cheney's daughter, former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney, endorsed Harris earlier this week, and here she is today slamming Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) L. CHENEY:  Every opportunity that Donald Trump gets to show the American people who he is, he pretty clearly -- and, look, his running mate is doing this too, I mean, you know, this is my diplomatic way of saying it, they're misogynistic pigs.

Here we go with Donald Trump.And so I do wonder, Geoff, if Trump were to lose in November, will there be a reset of the party, ideologically speaking? I'm not convinced of that. ALLISON:  I think we're probably in the phase of the last two-party system. Maybe it goes on to 2028. But I think across the political spectrum, people are really finding different political homes. So, I think maybe in the Republican Party, there's not a revamp of MAGA. MAGA stays MAGA, and then there is a more moderate conservative party, but I also think on the left, green party candidates that run every four years are not what I'm talking about, but parties like the Working Families Party that work very hard and have real infrastructure in New York and are doing in different places.

The party, the Republican Party today is expanding to include people like Tucker Carlson and all the things that he represents. And we've talked about this earlier in the show. Tucker Carlson had this, you know, Holocaust denier, essentially, on his show earlier in the week. We also know that J.D.

We believe if you don't like an idea and obviously, you know, the Holocaust was a terrible tragedy and it's something that we have to make sure never gets repeated again in this country. The best way I think to ensure or never gets repeated again anywhere in the world, certainly in this country or anywhere else, the best way to ensure that doesn't happen is to debate and push back against bad ideas.

Tucker said something stupid. The right thing for J.D. would have been to say, hey, you know, Tucker, let's be abundantly clear, Hitler was one of the most evil people in the world, in our history world. And anybody that comes and says anything differently is somebody that, you know, we shouldn't take serious.

It was not overconfidence. It was a statement of relief that we had a candidate we could believe in to get the party to rally behind.

It's so interesting to even have this conversation because I remember when RFK Jr. was fighting to get on the North Carolina ballot and some sort of like pro-Trump groups were trying to help him do it. And now all of a sudden, he wants off and parts of the system are trying to facilitate that. But this is going to be an interesting fight when voters are supposed to be voting right now.",

He was never a Democrat, all of his family members will tell you that. His whole purpose is to make sure that Donald Trump wins. And he will do whatever he has to do, whether he gets on the ballot or gets off the ballot, and the Republican Party will support him doing that.He should not be considered as a serious factor, except for the fact that he may be able to shave half a point here, half a point there, which would be just enough to win in the battleground state. That's all they care about. They don't care about RFK's views. They just care about how they can manipulate this guy to become a terrorist.",

So, now there's no longer a protest vote, you know, and so, it's a good thing that RFK is off the ballot.You know, that's the system he wants. I'm glad that we were getting him off the ballot he's getting off.

Can you maintain two to help you get over that hump of 10,000-vote loss from 2020? That's going to be the big question for the Trump campaign.",

And that is how confusion is disseminated in communities. That is how misinformation starts. That is how you start to see narratives that our system is not working. When you let politics play into the role of when people should be able to start voting, follow the rules. He was on the ballot. He wanted to run. He decided he doesn't want to run, then he should have made a better decision six months ago, but disenfranchising voters right now is not right. I",
