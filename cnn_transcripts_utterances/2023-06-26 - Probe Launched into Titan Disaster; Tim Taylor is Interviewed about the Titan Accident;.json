Yesterday, the Coast Guard announced what's called a marine board of investigation. Its highest level of probe. The effort will include collecting debris from the sea floor, conducting interviews and also reviewing voice recordings that are available. All of it will be used to determine what caused the tragedy and also offer possible recommendations for further action.CNN's Miguel Marquez is in Newfoundland with more on all of this. Miguel, this is not the only investigation that's happening at the very same time. How will all of these pros work together?",

At least six investigations, four different countries, the TSB, the transportation Safety Board, the Canadian agency, will probably be doing the heaviest lifting. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the British and the French Marine Accident Agencies, they'll be involved. And then the RCMP, Royal Canadian Mounted Police here, sort of the national police, will look for any possible criminal activity or concerns with this investigation across all those investigations. All of them will be sort of managed by international norms and laws so that they can all sort of cooperate together.But, in the meantime, the Polar Prince that took the Titan out to sea, it is now ported in its home port, at its home dock, the Horizon Maritime. It was across the harbor at a coast guard dock for the weekend while they were doing some investigating. The wife of Mr. Dawood and his son, the wife and mother of two people who died on that Titan, spoke out about the last time she saw them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, they're going to have to rely on imagery and technology. I'm not sure what payloads are loaded on the - on the boats that are out there, but they especially payloads like light armor, which is a laser scanning, as well as high definition 4K imagery cameras. Not all ROVs are set up with that. So, it's kind of a specialty item. So, if they can put those assets on these ROVs, they can actually scan the debris area and do photogrammetry work basically with enough high definition image and enough scans they can reconstruct the whole thing in a - in a digital world. And so they can then start piecing things together in a digital augmented reality or reality type thing and see if they can - they can get any clues.",

In the '70s there were lots of accidents, so they solved that with some really, really good methods and practices within the industry and had a stellar record.This is an example of someone step aside those processes and certifications. And (INAUDIBLE) the way I look at this, it is a consumer affairs problem now. A consumer -- consumer protection. So, someone has taken a technology and is marketing it as a ride. They're using organizations to help sell those rides. And people believe that it's all been vetted and safe because people that are selling it to their members or to their - to their clientele base or whoever these adventure people are there, they have to be aware that if they are helping third-party vendors take advantage of their clients or members, an you're going to -- there's some responsibility here. So, I really don't think it's an industry thing as much as it's a consumer's affair and protection issue. But, again, you've got multiple countries, multiple jurisdictions, multiple rules.

The attack left 11 worshipers dead in a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018. The jury found the killer guilty of all 63 counts against him, including 22 capital charges. That jury will now decide whether the killer should be sentenced to death. Brittney Griner has been named as a starter in the WNBA all-star game. Griner is a two-time Olympic gold medalist.

And that's why Putin decided to make this deal, a deal that makes Putin, in fact, look very weak because within, you know, 12 hours of saying that Prigozhin was committing treason, he had agreed to the dropping of charges against Prigozhin, and to his safe passage to another country.And, again, I think Putin did that because, one, he wasn't sure that his military would rise to the challenge of stopping Prigozhin, and, two, because, again, he realized Prigozhin has a certain popularity in Russia.",
