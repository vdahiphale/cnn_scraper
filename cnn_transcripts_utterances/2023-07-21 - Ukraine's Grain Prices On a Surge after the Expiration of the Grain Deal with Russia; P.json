Now officials say Russian missiles went after grain infrastructure overnight, destroying more than 100 tons of food in the process. Two people were injured during those attacks and it all happened after this.(VIDEO PLAYING) Air raid sirens went off in the city of Odessa, but Ukraine's air force later gave residents the all clear. Meantime, the U.S. says its cluster munitions supplied to Ukraine have been used in battle. The U.S. National Security Council says they're already having an impact on the battlefield. Now, night after night, Russian attacks have taken a toll on the Odessa region and other parts of southern Ukraine. CNN's Frederick Pleitgen has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FRED PLEITGEN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Search and rescue crews trying to save lives after another round of Russian air strikes in southern Ukraine. Moscow's army claiming they're hitting military targets. The Russian armed forces continued retaliatory strikes with sea and air-based high-precision weapons on workshops and warehouses with unmanned boats in Odessa and Chornomorsk, the spokesman says. But the Ukrainians say the Russians are targeting civilian infrastructure. One person was killed and several wounded when a missile hit this building in the port city of Odessa. The mayor, irate. Another terrorist attack by nonhumans on the peaceful city of Odessa, he says. Look at what they're doing. This is a nursery. There's a kindergarten nearby. Others desperately hoping their loved ones might be found alive. They're searching for my grandson, this man says. From the recording it seems he went down to the basement. They're trying to dig up the rubble. Ukraine's air defenses were only able to shoot down about a quarter of the cruise missiles Russia fired, Kyiv says, Putin's military using some of its heaviest naval missiles designed to destroy warships and even aircraft carriers. There is no possibility to shoot them down because we understand what kind of missiles they are, how fast they fly and their trajectory, the spokesman for the Air Force says. Ukraine says it needs more and better air defense capabilities from the U.S. and its allies, or the authorities here will be able to do little more than try to save victims from the rubble after the attacks.

It is also a fundamentally different kind of weapon, that's because cluster bombs or cluster ammunition essentially break into maybe a hundred or around a hundred smaller bombs that can scatter over an area about the width of a football field or so. And because not all of those little bomblets actually detonate the even with the U.S.-made cluster munitions the dud rate as they say is little over 2 percent which means that. There are bombs that are similar to landmines left over which can obviously cause a hazard in the future to civilians This is why the UK and other countries in Europe have banned their use the Americans and the Ukrainians have not.John Kirby, the national security, from the National Security Council in the United States, speaking for the White House, said yesterday that the Ukrainians have started to use them appropriately, meaning, we presume, not on civilian targets. He also says that it is having an impact on Russian defense formations and maneuvering, in his words. Of course, we also know that there is evidence that the Russians have used them in the past, though they deny it.

They've actually limited the visiting hours at the Acropolis because of the extreme heat and so it is very serious. And we've also seen fires as well across portions of Greece, very close to Athens as well. The excessive heat across the U.S. has been very real as well across the deep South and even the Southwest.

So that has had an impact, of course, on the workers, the ones that we see the Acropolis going on strike, the garbage collectors in Italy. This is starting to have a real impact on the ability of people to do their jobs and therefore on the social unrest that you're seeing breaking out in some of these countries as a result. It's just too hot to function and yet everybody needs to try and continue to do so.

They've been speaking of a 20 to 25 percent rise in admissions in so many of those cities that had been under extreme weather alerts, people coming in with symptoms of dehydration and not just the elderly.

There are now warnings here in France, but also in Spain, of those forest fires that we'd seen last summer causing so much devastation and that have started once again in Greece. Again, huge fires that they're struggling to keep under control and that could be just the beginning of another season of wildfires spreading across Europe. What you're also seeing here right now, Paula, as a result of that very hot weather and colder weather coming in from the north, this is what we've been warning of, extreme rainfall, extreme hail storms in parts of the Venetia region of Italy. There have been injuries caused by the size of these hail storms that are more like tennis balls than they are like golf balls, really extreme conditions caused by the meeting of those two weather fronts. And yet it is the parched conditions that are causing the most concern, as I say, due to continue next week on what is already parched. Earth.

But it was Mamlaki who took out, or took part rather, in the really offensive, inflammatory actions of stepping on the Quran yesterday in that event that was held just outside the Iraqi embassy in Stockholm.This event differs greatly than the one that occurred last month also by Mamlaki that triggered a wider reaction during that event again last month he actually burned pages of the Quran. It took place outside one of the biggest if not the largest mosque in Stockholm and it occurred during Eid al-Adha one of the holiest if not the holiest holiday for Muslims and there was also a lot of political factors at play at the time. Turkey stepped in with condemnation last month, looked willing to threaten or put it at risk. Sweden's bid to join NATO. Now that bid has already gone ahead so that's no longer an issue, a factor on the plate, but absolutely there was huge reaction to again what was essentially a one-man demonstration. We saw those protests in Iraq the night before the event outside of the Iraqi embassy in Stockholm where hundreds of protesters stormed the Swedish embassy in Baghdad, but that was also triggered yet again by other political factors. Shia cleric Muqtad al-Sadr taking a stand, taking offense to the actions in Stockholm and galvanizing his supporters, as he was so well known to do, to that embassy just in the hours before the event. But yes, absolutely, I think for now we've seen the reaction from Iraq with the recalling of its charge d'affaires from Sweden, ejecting the Swedish ambassador from Iraq. We'll see if there's more there, but regardless the structural issues remain, Paula. In the West, of course, there are no blasphemy laws as there are in many other Muslim countries.

That is the language here.The Kenyan opposition is specifically crying foul. They're accusing the government of heavy-handed policing tactics and using some language which is not accidental. The Kenyan opposition has called some of the reported deaths and beatings and police brutality as crimes against humanity. They're calling them specifically a genocide in the making. And that choice of language is deliberate because after the 2007 election, President William Ruto was accused of crimes against humanity. He was tried at the International Criminal Court, but those cases collapsed for lack of evidence. So the reintroduction of that language here is an attempt to try and paint these in a much larger context by the Kenyan opposition. What do you see here for instance an armored water cannon track that we've seen in use in some neighborhoods often in people's homes where children live and it's had some major impacts on them. Those are some of the policing tactics that have been criticized in this three days of protests. They began as a fight against the legitimacy of the government of President William Ruto, then conveniently these very unpopular tax hikes came in and the opposition has hitched a wagon on that and now they've fully become anti- government protests that have plunged this East African nation into this major crisis.

So I think now going into the World Cup it's keeping that belief and just knowing that we're good enough and we're able to make an impact. DAVIS (voice-over): They started the 2019 tournament with a whopping 13-nil win over Thailand and are aiming to make another statement in the July 21st opener against Vietnam. JULIE ERTZ, U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM: They're going to get our best. Our team is focused on one game at a time, not looking past anything, giving the utmost respect to whoever our opponent is that we're going to give our best on any day that we have to play. And I think that's our sole focus of the team. DAVIS (voice-over): The U.S. women's national team have been synonymous with dominance. They've won four of the eight Women's World Cups ever played. That drive to be the best is ingrained in the team's culture and there's no plan to change that now. MEGAN RAPINOE, U.S. WOMEN'S NATIONAL TEAM: The goal is just always winning. That's all that matters. That's like our secret sauce is just this like insatiable desire to win and everything else comes after that. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They have won huge matches internationally. And for New Zealand to beat the Norwegians, I don't think many people saw that coming. What a boost for their chances. And of course, what a, just a terrific shot in the arm to start a tournament that probably doesn't even need it because of the support, the interest, the excitement, the ticket sales, TV ratings. But if it needed any extra boost, Paula, clearly that was provided by the great way that New Zealand started this tournament.",

And for those who haven't seen a lot of women's soccer, which, you know, that's hard to believe there are people that still haven't, Sam Kerr is one of the greatest ever.Right now, the word is that she will miss at least one more game with this calf injury. That is not good. But if she can really come back and finish the group play and then presuming Australia moving on, that would be, they would be able to salvage something. But the disappointment was palpable. Here they are, they're packed into that Olympic Stadium over 70,000. And of course, she is their hero. She is the biggest name in Australia in women's soccer. And she can't play. And I think that certainly was, you know, certain. It was the complete opposite of the joy of New Zealand, the fact that Australia didn't have its star. But they can still get her back, and if they can, then I think she becomes one of the great stories of this World Cup in the sense that how good is she going to be, how much can she play, and the drama there I think will be not only on the field of play, but off the field of play.",

But the one thing that they're going to be trying to do is have the referees actually tell people what's going on and announce the decision and explain what they're doing. So I'm all for that.I think over the years, soccer in particular has been a sport quala that is kind of, we kind of been waiting, you know, what's the answer? Was that, you know, was that fair or not? I think anything where you can use video going back 30 years, maybe more, where the NFL was trying to figure out should they have instant replay. And the great Don Shula, the coach of the Miami Dolphins actually told me at an NFL meeting, he said, if every fan sitting at home knows more about our game than we do, we need to use instant replay. And I would say the same here. You've got incredible technical ability now to find things out and double check and make sure you're making the right call. The stakes are too important now, not only for, of course, men's soccer but women's soccer. You have to get it right. So I'm all for it even as obviously some of the purists wonder and we'll see how it plays out over the next few weeks.",
