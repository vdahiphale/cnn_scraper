Zelenskyy is going to be meeting with members of the Senate later this week and he is going to be laying out what he calls the \"Victory Plan.\" But to me, the critical thing we need to do is make sure they have the weapons and are in a position of strength if this turns into some kind of negotiated settlement.",

At the end of the Trump administration maximum pressure sanctions brought the Iranians to their knees in terms of their economy, but also really limited their ability to export oil. They had about $4 billion in foreign reserves by the end of the Trump administration. President Trump and Harris come in. They essentially don't enforce those sanctions. And now the Iranians have about $80 billion in foreign reserves. Guess what they're doing with that? They're funding and training, and equipping the Houthis, Hezbollah, Hamas, and deterrences collapse. And we're seeing that chaos in the Middle East all over. I actually -- I mentioned this to the president. You need to reimpose those Trump sanctions. He said he was interested in doing that. He told me to work with Jake Sullivan on it. They won't do it, and that's -- by the way, that would be a bipartisan move if they did that. The United States senators, Democrats and Republicans, want to reimpose those sanctions.

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, this is a sweeping show of support for Kamala Harris and her vision for the economy. It comes from more than 400 economists and former policymakers, many of them veterans of Democratic administrations, including officials such as former Biden economist Brian Deese, Obama economist Jason Furman. Another veteran of the Obama administration, Penny Pritzker. Allen Blinder who is the number two at the Federal Reserve, and he served in the Clinton administration.Also some notable academics such as University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers, and Claudia Golden, the Harvard economist who last year won the Nobel Prize in Economics. Now, as far as why they are backing Harris, it's because they believe that she's got the better vision for the economy. They describe this as a stark contrast between failed trickle-down economic policies that benefit the few and the policies that provide opportunity for all. A key line in this endorsement, the economists say that it is a choice between inequity, economic injustice, and uncertainty with Donald Trump or prosperity. Opportunity and stability with Kamala Harris. Now, in particular, the economists argue that the Trump agenda could reignite inflation. Just to remind people what we're talking about when we say the Harris agenda. Now, she has called for raising taxes on the wealthy, corporations, expanding the child tax credit, boosting small business, and also trying to address the affordability issue by building more houses. But also, she's calling for boosting demand by providing $25,000 downpayment assistance. Pretty important that the supply comes before the demand there. But as you mentioned, all of this comes as they try to convince voters that they have the right vision for the economy. Trump, today, going to Savannah, Georgia to pitch his economic vision and talk about tax policy. Harris, tomorrow, going to Pittsburgh. So these two candidates continue to try to convince voters that it's their vision that's going to be right. And remember, the economy -- it's the number one issue for voters.",

What happened with Ryan Routh is prosecutors wanted to keep him in jail pending trial -- keep him detained and convince the judge that they have enough evidence to do so even though he hasn't been formally charged. They were successful in that. And they also revealed during that hearing that they do plan to charge Ryan Routh with heftier crimes -- specifically, potentially attempting to assassinate Donald Trump. Now, this is not a charge that we have seen yet. It has not yet been through a grand jury. Right now, Ryan Routh is only facing two possession of firearm criminal charges and waiting for what happens with that indictment. But that is a really significant development in this investigation. One of the things the prosecutors are doing here is they've collected a lot of evidence about Ryan Routh. What he had in his car. Many cellphones, including one that showed how he had been looking up getting from Palm Beach to Mexico potentially after this apparent assassination attempt to make on Donald Trump's life. They also found he had been -- they had located that he had been around Mar-a-Lago for a month, essentially stalking Donald Trump. And there was a witness that he gave a box to before heading down to Mar-a-Lago. That box contained a letter and in that letter Routh was writing specifically the words \"this was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump, but I failed you.\" The witness opened the box after he was picked up by the cops on September 15. Routh, in that letter, said he also wanted to offer $150,000 to whoever could \"complete the job.\" He was mad about Donald Trump's handling of relations in the Middle East. This is only part of the evidence that prosecutors say they've gathered about Ryan Routh and only the sort of evidence they thought they would need to show right now to keep him in jail, which they are going to be doing.

Donald Trump, for years, has tried to undermine mail-in voting and early voting, kind of conflating them both in some ways, and he's doing that again. Yesterday, he called early voting stupid and raising doubts about its security, though he told supporters in April -- he said mail-in voting and early voting are good options. And then earlier this month he accused Pennsylvania, without evidence, of widespread mail-in ballot fraud.Other than, without evidence, creating doubt what impact do these mixed signals have on voters in your state?",

It's perfectly safe. It's secure. Republicans have won, Democrats have won. There's a paper ballot. We have a long ballot with lots of initiatives. People like to research them in their homes before they cast their vote. We also make early voting available. So if you lose your mail ballot or you don't trust mail ballots you can vote early, a week or two before the election at one of the many early-voting sites. And if you don't do that -- if you really want to vote on Election Day, we make that available too. So voting should be easy for the American people to exercise their right. Grandparents and great-grandparents have died to defend that right in war, and it's up to us to make it count.",

The voluntary 45-minute workout initially sent nine players to the hospital with a dangerous condition that can be life- threatening.Joining me now is CNN's Meg Tirrell. Meg, what is this condition? What happened here? MEG TIRRELL, CNN Yeah, Sara, this sounds like this really mysterious occurrence. Fifty members or so of this team participated in this workout last Monday. Over the following days a few of them started to feel ill. And as you mentioned, nine of them ultimately were hospitalized. Three are still in the hospital. They were diagnosed with a condition known as rhabdomyolysis. This is a relatively rare muscle condition where the muscles start to break down and sort of leak their contents into the bloodstream. This can be very dangerous and can overwhelm the kidneys and affect other organs. In really severe circumstances it can lead to the need for dialysis to help with this. And so we know that those three are still in the hospital. The university says this was after a Navy SEAL graduate -- somebody who had just participated in a training program with the NAVY SEALs ran this training. We don't have details about exactly what this involved in terms of the training, but the university says they have appointed an outside investigator to look into all of this and really figure out what happened here that contributed to so many of these players getting injured, Sara.",
