The IDF says the two men were rescued after an intense gun battle with their captors. We are told Israeli Special Forces hugged and protected those hostages with their own bodies as they came under heavy fire. Israeli air strikes pounded targets during the operation. Hamas claims the overnight strikes in Rafah killed more than 100 people. The city is now home to more than half of Gaza's population. Hundreds of thousands of civilians have been seeking refuge here with nowhere else to go. There is mounting international concern that an Israeli ground offensive could again be coming soon.

And it really, again, just shows the stakes of civilian casualties, particularly in Rafah, where there are 1.4 million people, more than a million of them displaced. Many of them have been displaced from homes elsewhere in Gaza. This is a point of last refuge, if you will, for them. They say they have nowhere else to go. So, it will put a lot of focus and attention on the civilian cost of military operations inside of Gaza and pressure on the government here, not just from President Biden, but we've heard from Egyptian authorities. We've heard from Saudi authorities, UAE as well, all saying there will be serious consequences for Israel if the civilians cannot be protected.

He got Republicans and Americans to stop caring about America and what democracy should mean. And in this instance, he got, you know, the patriotic, you know, military-loving far right to stop caring about national security. And to stop caring about our servicemen and women, our troops.
