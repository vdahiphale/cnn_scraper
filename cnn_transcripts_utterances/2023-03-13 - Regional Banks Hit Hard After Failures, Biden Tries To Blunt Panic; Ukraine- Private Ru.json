Will more banks fail, and how safe is our money?Plus, Russia's military falling apart. Soldiers revolting against commanders, calling themselves sacrificial lambs, as the battle between Russia's army and the private military Wagner group spills out into the open. And hundreds of migrants trying to storm the U.S. southern border. Frustration with Biden's policies boiling over. This is the U.S. boarder you're looking at and we'll tell you what's happening there. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, bank crash. Stocks of dozens of regional banks across the United States plunging to record lows today. The situation so volatile that trading had to be completely stopped, halted for roughly a dozen of those banks. Here's just a few to show you what happened in the hours they were even opened for trading. First Republic Bank, 66 percent lower at one point. Western Alliance Bancorp, 60 percent lower. PacWest, 34 percent of its value gone. First Horizon, about a quarter of its value erased. It was a head-spinning turn of events, and it's all in response to the swift collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday followed by Signature Bank over the weekend. Stocks diving even after the Biden administration and the federal government took extraordinary steps to calm Americans by assuring depositors that those two banks that they would have access to all of their money. And President Biden tried to ease fears trying to prevent more runs on more banks. (BEGIN VIDEOI CLIP)",

Because banks are truly the arteries, the veins, the capillaries, they are it for America's capitalist economy, which is the biggest in the world. And the speed of the bank failures and the fear of more of them has totally shocked that system that, body. Economic analyst and OUTFRONT regular Jim Bianco pointed out today that the yield on two-year t bills has seen the biggest three-day drop since right before the 1987 stock crash. Now, at that time the Dow dropped more than 20 percent in a single day. It was the singlest one- day stock decline in U.S. history. Now, fast does not need to be precedent, but the frightening reality is that the underlying fundamentals of these banks may not matter because what does matter is human nature. Still, with all this technology and all of these regulations, a bank run is ultimately driven by fear and panic. And the former Congressman Barney Frank, a board member of Signature Bank, which failed over the weekend, and by the way an instrumental figure in the financial regulatory reforms that came out of the 2008 great recession and banking crash, told \"Bloomberg News\" that if the federal regulators had made assurances on deposits on Friday, that bank would've survived. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) FORMER REP. BARNEY FRANK, SIGNATURE BANK BOARD MEMBER:  We at signature we're in good shape. In fact, given what the fed and what the FDIC announced today, if that had been announced on Friday, we would have had no problem at all. And I think you see when the sale comes that it's a fundamentally sound bank. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "You talk about panic and contagion, the fears that were certainly drawn out over the course of the last several days. Treasury Department officials, financial regulators keenly aware of that reality, and while they have been watching bank stocks, particularly those regional bank stocks get hit throughout the course of the day, one senior treasury official I was talking to said keep an eye on what's actually happening underneath right now. That's what officials have been keenly focused on and just a continuous array of phone calls with regulators inside some of these financial institutions with bank CEOs as well.What they have been watching is the outflows of deposits. That's what created the biggest concern, the biggest risk in the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is that these regional banks, these mid-sized and smaller banks would have significant deposit outflows, and therefore would be in a very similar position. What this official says is over the course of the day, they have seen those outflows or heard anecdotally those outflows are starting to slow. And they feel like that is a good sign that perhaps what they put in place are very dramatic emergency effort on Sunday are starting to work. According to this official, Erin, the thing we were targeting was uninsured depositors, feeling as if they weren't protected. The scale and breadth of what we did has sent that message that they are in fact protected. Now, you combine that with the Federal Reserve lending facility that was also set up, that's providing liquidity to these same banks that are getting hammered by the market right now. They have seen signs that that is also starting to take effect, take hold as well. So those are positive signs. They acknowledge they are not out of the woods by any means. The risk that is very real has not dissipated in a dramatic manner. But they feel like those are positive signs. At the same time, White House political advisers, Erin, are bracing for a very real political fallout. Everything you've seen from the White House and the president today is trying to get in front of that, try and address that. They feel like they have a message and that this was a necessity. They believe they delivered on that. We'll, obviously, have to wait and see as the days come forward whether or not that's actually the case.",

We've got a $23 trillion banking industry. One had $200 billion. Another had $100 billion of assets. This is just, you know, imposing -- keeping to the deposit limits, which are there in law and clearly disclosed, would somehow create systemic risk, that, I think, people found a little desettling. So I do think, you know, you can end up creating problems that you're trying to avoid by not being very careful in communication.

We basically kept the system we had, got a little more capital in the system, a little more liquidity so the rules improved a bit. But it was basically the same system that has continued to grow and morph. A lot of that's been fostered by accommodative monetary policy keeping interest rates so low for so long, encouraged borrowing, encouraged corporate debt issuance. These are all things that these big banks do to make money. So, that -- there are a lot of different -- monetary policy also had a role in increasing concentration size in these institutions. So it is what it is. I do worry now though that if the regulators start saying, okay, so everybody say over $100 billion now, we're going to protect their uninsured deposits.
