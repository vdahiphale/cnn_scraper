We are following the latest developments in the Middle East following the Israeli airstrike in Lebanon that killed Hezbollah Leader Hassan Nasrallah, concerns about a wider war in this region and a possible Israeli incursion into Lebanon.In recent hours, Israel conducted new airstrikes in southern and northern Israel and Eastern Lebanon killing at least 10 people, according to the Lebanese state news agency. That's on the heels of a series of strikes that reportedly killed more than a thousand others over the past week. But the U.S. says Israel is also moving troops to the border with Lebanon, a possible sign of preparations for a limited cross border incursion. Israel says that ground operation is only one option that it is considering. Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, was killed in an airstrike on Friday. But the group says it will not stop fighting while Iran is threatening to deliver what it says will be a crushing blow against Israel. A former Israeli prime minister told CNN earlier, he believes this is an opportunity for Israel. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Hellyer is a good friend of this show, is a Middle East Studies scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a senior associate fellow at the University Royal United Services Institute for Defense and Security Studies. His analysis and insight is extremely important, and he joins us today out of Athens, Greece, just 24 hours then after the world learned that the head of Hezbollah is dead. Assess where things stand in the short term, both from the Israeli perspective, if you will, and indeed from the Lebanese. And we can talk further about Hezbollah specifically after that. H.A. HELLYER, MIDDLE EAST SCHOLAR, CARNEGIE ENDOWMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE: Thank you so much, Becky, always a pleasure to be on your show. So, I think what we see at present, there are a number of questions that need to be answered. First, what happens in terms of any further Israeli action vis-a-vis Lebanon? You already mentioned further Israeli strikes, but these are airstrikes. They're not ground forces. And I think we have to expect the very high likelihood of Israeli forces actually invading with ground troops in the south of Lebanon over the coming hours or a few days. Certainly, when it comes to statements out of the United States, I think we haven't seen at least in the last two or three statements a continued emphasis on calling for a ceasefire. Rather, the emphasis has been on we stand by Israel, we stand ready to protect Israel and defend it and so on. So, I think that we have to read into that, unfortunately, that there would be a further escalation involving ground troops. When it comes to the wider configuration of power in terms of retaliations and so forth, I'm not terribly enthusiastic about the prospect of further escalation as a result of Iranian reprisals. But I also don't think that they're highly likely at this present moment in time. On the contrary, what we've seen over the past couple of days is an expression of exasperation, of frustration. And I think of, you know, a feeling of betrayal from within Hezbollah rank and file that Iran hasn't actually come to its aid and defense. And I think that that's likely to continue going forward. I don't think that they have the capacity to engage in a widespread reprisal without causing huge damage themselves. And I don't think that the regime is interested in doing so.",

      "sentences": "So, the scope, I think, changes because I think what you also have to keep in mind is that, over the past year, some things have been planned well, well ahead of in advance. Other things get planned much later in the game, when, for example, Israel went into Gaza a year ago. I don't think the plan was immediately at the very outset of the ground invasion was to separate the north from the south and put in settlements in the north of Gaza and retake Rafah completely and so on. Whereas today, if you ask me about the likelihood of reinstalling Jewish settlements in the north of Gaza, I'd say it's quite likely in the short to medium term. I wouldn't have said that a year ago.When it comes to the south of Lebanon, there is no way to, quote/unquote, secure the south of Lebanon for the north of Israel without a permanent occupation in the south of Lebanon. And that's simply not sustainable. But it doesn't mean that the Israeli forces won't move in and won't do that because, again, the level of escalation, the type of recklessness that we've seen over recent weeks and months is a direct consequence of Israel being able to prosecute these military campaigns without accountability and without consequence. Joe Biden and his administration have said many times over the past 9, 10, 11 months, red lines about ceasefires, about de-escalation, about the importance of this and that, but they haven't actually used the leverage that is necessary in order to force that change in Israeli behavior. Israel knows that. Israel is aware of, and as a result continues in this direction.",

Well, U.S. leaders say they did not know about the strike in advance on the Hezbollah chief, but President Joe Biden is hailing the death of Nasrallah as a welcome development, stating, quote, his death from an Israeli airstrike is a measure of justice for his many victims, including thousands of Americans, Israelis and Lebanese civilians.

This is something Israel's been preparing for many years. And that as long as this paradigm continues in which they don't see much retaliation, in which the U.S. and other world powers are not pushing enough or hard enough for a ceasefire, and as long as they can keep the home front going, they're going to keep going.

Definitely, the killing of Hezbollah as well as the killing of much of the senior leadership, the pager attacks, the aerial assaults that have been going on intensively for two weeks have greatly, greatly diminished Hezbollah's capacity to make decisions, to communicate those decisions, to operate.I would say Hezbollah has lost almost all of its deterrent power against Israel. It has no defensive abilities against Israeli attacks. It has made no provision for civilians and all the civilian displacement and suffering that's happening because of the Israeli attacks. And I think both Hezbollah and Iran have limited offensive options against Israel. So, I do think what happens next is largely going to be determined by what Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Israeli government feels that they want to do. They do have Hezbollah on the ropes, which means they have Iran on the ropes. I imagine they will press their advantage, whether that includes a ground invasion or not.

And so, unfortunately, that approach continues now.And even though the U.S. in rhetoric, you know, has called for a ceasefire, the Biden administration has not put leverage and its tools. It has tools to make the ceasefire in Gaza hold. And if it had done so, then we wouldn't be in this position today. Now, Israel has legitimate security concerns on its border. But at this point, even after the killing of Nasrallah, even with a year worth of war, none of its residents are closer to getting home. The hostages are not being taken out of Gaza. And Israel's home front, an economy, cannot go on like this forever. So, Israel doesn't have a strategy or endgame beyond endless war at this moment and the U.S. is allowing it to do that.",

Yes, that might look like victory, but that's not a sustainable future for Israel. I think there is a historic opportunity here and a gathering of Arab and Muslim foreign ministers just reiterated it today in New York that there is a historic opportunity.
