Let's go back and triple check. And so then he calls the FBI. So he did, quote, unquote, the right thing after coming into possession. How the chain of custody is going to be an issue of the wrong thing. Now what? EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENTAnd of course, those four boxes that they did find, they had them shipped to Washington. They had them driven and they arrived here in Washington yesterday. So the Justice Department now and the Archives have everything that the Vice President's team is aware of. And so now we'll see what happens next. NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: And that's the key that they're aware of because this of course, happened with Biden. They found some documents, then they found some more documents. There was a thorough search of his home. They thought there were all the documents and then there was an additional search by the FBI. So what other documents could be out there? Listen, I was texting with some Democrats about this, they are in some ways happy about this. They saw the hot water that Biden has been in over this. And to now see that it happening with Pence suggests this is something that sometimes happens. Things get interspersed in with other documents. And a lot of these folks might not even know. If you are Mike Pompeo, if you were Nikki Haley, both of whom might want to run for President, they might want to start checking boxes as well.",

Joe Biden in the Senate, Vice President of the United States, now President of the United States, so it happens for people who say that they are the responsible ones, both of them. And I don't say that to be snarky, it happens. The question is what happens now if you're Merrick Garland? Because just yesterday just Republicans have been making the case and again, we could fact check this. Republicans have been making the case that Donald Trump is somehow being treatedly differently than Joe Biden. Merrick Garland says not true.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

There's many more documents proactively sent to Mar-a-Lago and then the lawyer signing papers saying they were all returned and the Justice Department finding up, no, they weren't. So the facts are different. But if you're Merrick Garland and you're trying to look at the facts and the law but also deal with the politics, as you mentioned earlier, Biden, a presumptive candidate, Trump a declared candidate, Pence a possible candidate. What does he do?CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, the Justice Department, when classified information is revealed and discovered in a place that it's not supposed to be, has an obligation to investigate both from a potential prosecutorial standpoint, but also from a national security perspective. They have to go back. They're going to have to do interviews. They're going to have to find out whether there were documents from the former Vice President Pence's locations that were taking to other locations. Did he have an office? Has he been living in any temporary locations like President Biden was at one point? And so they're going to have to go through this inquiry. They're going to have to find out what the chain of custody of documents was. And they have to conduct that investigation. It doesn't matter that he was a former Vice President, anybody else who was in this situation. And now you start to think about what about former other national security officials who had access to information because the truth of it is, is really, as far as we know publicly, this isn't something that happens a lot. These particular circumstances are, at least from my perspective as a national security lawyer, they are unusual. And so it does fall on the Justice Department to determine, working with the intelligence community where this information has gotten out, who has had access to it, and is there any harm to national security.",

For instance, in hearing about the folks that they assembled, you're just reminded once again that Donald Trump was at the center of this. He was the one calling around, trying to find the votes. He was the one trying to advance this fake elector scheme, for instance. And so we'll see what happens. I think, you know, sort of political observers always saw this case as the one that was maybe the most potentially damaging to Donald Trump's political future. And so we'll see what happens.

So they're taking some liberties there and essentially trying to say, we're not going to be a part of this process.But it's been interesting listening to the judge try to work this out today. You know, he's talking about how the January 6th Committee made so much information public, and the world is still sort of turning as an argument for why can't we have this information out here?

We're now learning, according to three U.S. officials familiar with the matter, that the Biden administration is now finalizing plans to announce the commitment of sending Abrams tanks to Ukraine.The U.S. made M1 Abrams tank, an advanced but complex system that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been asking for for months, important for a number of reasons. First, the shift in U.S. policy. Second, this is a signal, another signal, I should say, of ongoing U.S. support for Ukraine in terms of the weapons and the systems it provides. But perhaps most importantly, it breaks an apparent logjam with Germany. German officials had repeatedly said they would not send or approve the sending of their own German made Leopard tanks until the U.S. made a similar move. Although it had appeared last week, German officials were kind of softening their stance a little bit on that one, it still remained out there. So this if and when it's announced and that announcement could come as soon as this week, would break that logjam, allowing not only Germany to send Leopard tanks, but also any of the more than a dozen countries that operate Leopards. Very much giving Ukraine a direct offensive threat on the battlefield as the war with Russia enters its nears the one-year mark. Also worth noting that the U.K. has committed to sending some of its own Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine, so this is a big shift from the administration and certainly big news for Ukraine.",
