Madison, Wisconsin is now having to mourn the victims of a deadly school shooting. This one happening at a private Christian school called Abundant Life. Two people were killed. A teenage student and a teacher. Six others were injured, including two students who are still in critical condition.Moments ago, police gave us an update on the shooter. Shockingly, it was a 15-year-old female student of the school. They've identified her as Natalie Rupnow. She died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, fired before police got to the scene. Authorities are speaking with her parents, who are cooperating and have searched the home where she lived in Madison. All of this happened just before 11:00 this morning, inside a study hall classroom with students from different grades. Here's how the police chief says the call came in. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SHON BARNES, MADISON CHIEF POLICE:  A second-grade student called 911 to report a shooting had occurred at school. Let that soak in for a minute. A second-grade student called 911 at 10:57 a.m. to report a shooting at school. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It's a crowdfunding effort started by a group called the December 4th Legal Committee. Their total fundraising goal as of now, $500,000. They just might get there.The organizers alluding to the date UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was gunned down on the streets of Manhattan. But they say it's not about the violence from that day. They write, \"This is a preemptive legal fundraiser for the suspect allegedly involved in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO. We are not here to celebrate violence, but we do believe in the constitutional right of fair legal representation.\" But as for the people donating, well, some of them are full on celebrating Mangione's actions. And the donations are coming in at all sorts of amounts, from the highest at $1,300, some as low as $5. One person writes under their $10 donation, I'm quoting here, \"The shot heard around the nation. We cannot let it be in vain. You made the first stand. Thank you.\" Another person donated $500 writing this. \"I hope this entire event leads to a rethinking of the wealthy people running this country.

Quote -- \"We do not condone murder. And for that reason, we cannot condone the actions of UnitedHealthcare. Luigi was standing up to a systematized murder of millions of Americans at the hands of a broken healthcare system.\" COATES:  When you hear that, of course, first of all, I'm a former prosecutor, everyone deserves a proper legal defense and, frankly, he is presumed innocent at this point in time. They have a burden of proof that they have to carry out. But when there seems to be the equivalence drawn between gunning somebody down in the streets, and again, he is presumed innocent, but somebody gunning him down in the streets, and then the idea of a health insurance company behaving in the way that has led to, you believe, the deaths of people as well, are you concerned that that sort of equivalence is going to instigate further harm?",

Murder in the second degree, however, is preserved for everything else, and that is intentional murder.

So, I don't know that that occurred.What's interesting to me, though, is that this might be a case of what we call, and you know very well as the excellent prosecutor you were, jury nullification, right? I know it's crazy to say that. Just to explain, jury nullification is when a defendant did commit the offense but a jury excuse it. We're living in bizarre times. Have any of us seen social media? He celebrated as a hero like Robinhood. He saved the day. Can't believe it. Your last guest was speaking to that issue. UnitedHealthcare is evil. You know, these people deny claims. It's amazing.

BRIAN STELTER, AUTHOR, SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT FOR VANITY FAIRThat's the leading theory that I've heard, but it is clear that a company like Disney doesn't want to be in litigation with a president- elect about to take office.

It used to be, Laura, that Trump would file these nuisance suits against media outlets and they would almost always be thrown out. But the fact that ABC had to settle this and decided not to go to trial, it is going to embolden Trump and his allies. And no longer is this about nuisance lawsuits. This is now about a systemic effort to chill the press, to tie journalists up in knots. For example, the Iowa case, it's using the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act. It's very unlikely that Trump will prevail in Iowa, but that's not the point. The process is the point. Having to go through the motions and pay all the money for the lawyers is the point.
