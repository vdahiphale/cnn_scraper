Plus, I have new reporting for you, on Mark Robinson, tonight. The embattled Republican candidate for North Carolina governor, has just lost a big-name supporter, over disturbing comments that he once made on a porn site. And we're seeing, tonight, for the first time, the chilling words of the suspect, in that second assassination attempt, of Donald Trump, on the golf course. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Donald Trump is on the campaign trail, in Pennsylvania, tonight, delivering a mixed message about early voting to his supporters, just six weeks out from Election Day. From that stage, tonight, the former President encouraged Pennsylvanians to get out and vote early in one breath, then pushed baseless conspiracies about doing so, moments later. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Early voting begins in Pennsylvania, over the next two weeks, and we need each and every one of you to go out. Just don't take anything for granted. We got to get out and vote. You can start right away. You know that, right? Now we have this stupid stuff, where you can vote 45 days early. I wonder what the hell happens during that 45. Let's move the -- see these votes? We've got about a million votes in there. Let's move them. We're fixing the air conditioner in the room, right? No, it's terrible. What happened the last time was disgraceful, including right here. But we're not going to let it happen again. Too -- you know too big to rig, right? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Harris has been arguing, there's a lot more for those two to talk about, after she formally accepted CNN's invite, for a second showdown, exactly one month from today, on October 23rd.

It's giving me 2020 whiplash, when his campaign was wanting him to promote early voting, mail-in voting as well, during the pandemic, and then he would cast out on it. It's the same thing.He's got something, intellectually, he cannot accept the fact that you can vote early, it can be safe, it can be tabulated. He just has this very sort of arcane way of looking at it. But there's also the secondary thing that comes with Trump, which is he wants to preemptively cast doubt on the results, in case he loses. He's incapable of losing, and of accepting that he lost. So he's done that in a number of ways, just as he did in 2020. We heard him blaming Jewish leaders. He had a dig at Catholics. He cast doubt on the system. So, it's kind of twofold. He genuinely does not, in my understanding, trust early voting. But he also wants to have something to blame if he loses. [21:05:00] COLLINS: Well, and a lot of other Republicans have been critical of what he's -- his mixed messages on this, because they wanted to help them, help them in a critical Senate race that's happening in Pennsylvania.

But it is what it is, and we got to play by the rules that are set. So, use early voting, use mail-in voting, use voting on Election Day, whatever you can, to get out there, and make sure that if a 100 people plan to vote for Donald Trump, a 100 people actually get out there and do vote for Donald Trump.

He's not playing to win the actual game. He's playing to get to overtime, believing he can work the refs, and then try to win it there.

And it's not unusual, for state prosecutors, to assist with a federal investigation.But what's happening here is that the state prosecutors are designed to compete with the federal investigation, because of politics, a turf war based on politics. And that only causes problems. Fortunately, the statewide prosecutor, the one at the state level, who's in charge of the investigation, is a good guy who's not political, Nick Cox. And I know he'll do the right thing. And when the Feds are done with their investigation, they can turn the evidence over to the state. But you're dealing with a state investigation that's premised on the belief that the Feds are corrupt and compromised. And so, when the state asks for evidence and demands it, what do you think the Feds are going to do? You think they're going to willingly give it over, before their investigation is done? Not a chance. And you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.",

Remember, there hasn't even been an indictment yet. And so, this, at the beginning, not the end. And I do think the federal government, as they collect more evidence, will go ahead with an indictment that includes a more serious charge, perhaps, of the attempted assassination, of a major presidential candidate, and the attempted assassination of a former President, which can get you life in prison.

However, there was always this low-level skirmishing going on, between Israel and Hezbollah in the north coming out of Lebanon.

I mean, to what end, and how do you bring it to a conclusion?

Iran is, you know, we have been getting mixed messages from Iran, because, on the one hand, you have a president who is, of course, interested in getting the sanctions removed. And he said that publicly. The President, of course, is not the power in Iran. The power is really held by the religious leadership, and then, of course, the IRGC, the Quds Force, these military commanders. So the -- but the military commanders also understand there's a balance to be maintained, because the Iranian people don't want these continued sanctions. So, the question really is, how long will Iran support Hezbollah in a fight with Israel, and whether the Israelis can move back.
