      "sentences": "A sliver of good news for President Biden. New CNN polling out today shows him leading Donald Trump by 12 points in a potential New Hampshire matchup. That's a much wider margin. The national polls that have shown the two in a neck and neck race.Our great reporters are back to sort -- to go through all of this. And just so our viewers see, this is the head to head matchup. It's 52 for Biden, 40 for Trump, eight or so unsure. New Hampshire is a finicky state, purple state in the northeast here. Do you think this is reflective of other swing states? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, listen, I think this is probably more reflective of other swing states and that the kind of national polls we've seen don't tell us much. I think, you know, the theory of the case for the Biden White House is, you know, if it's a choice, a direct head to head matchup with Trump, it'll essentially be what we saw last go around. People, obviously, have grave reservations about Donald Trump. Doesn't help that he has, I guess, what is it, 91 in indictments at this point. Yes, there are reservations about Biden's age. That's sort of something that I think is baked into the cake in some ways. And so we see some of that. So, yes, I'm sure the White House sees this as proving what their theory is. But I will also say it's still fairly early.",

We talk a lot about how unpopular he is. He's getting 52 percent of the vote. And so to Nia's point, when it is a choice between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, what we're seeing is essentially a rerun. Biden won the state of New Hampshire by six, seven points in 2020 with 52 percent. He's at 52 percent now. He's not going to win the state by 12. Donald Trump will not end that 40 percent. It'll probably be another six or seven point race. So this feels like, again, a lot of what we're -- what we saw in 2022, which is an unpopular Biden is a problem if Donald Trump isn't in the picture. When Donald Trump's in the picture, it's a bigger problem.",

There's obviously very serious allegations against a Democratic Senator. Do you believe that he should resign from the Senate? REP. DEAN PHILLIPS (D), PROBLEM SOLVERS CAUCUS: Well, first of all, everybody's innocent until proven guilty, thank goodness, still in our country. But I'm appalled. Anybody who pays attention, I don't care if you're politics, Democrat or Republican, you should be appalled. A member of Congress who appears to have broken the law is someone who I believe should resign. I think George Santos should have resigned already. Sadly, our House Ethics process and I would argue the Senate as well is not as proficient as it needs to be. So we have to rely on the judicial system. But I'm really disappointed. And I have to say, in comparison to the President of the United States of which there is no evidence whatsoever he's broken the law and yet is being subject to an impeachment inquiry, there is evidence here. And yes, I'm a Democrat, so is Senator Menendez. But based on what I've seen, I'm disappointed. Yes, I think he should resign.",

You saw what happened just to get the speaker into his seat the first time, 15 rounds of votes. There's no heir apparent.

I'm still troubled by the polls. I'm troubled particularly by polls of Democrats who clearly are looking for an alternative. I noted very closely in those figures that a lot of Democrats still would like to see another person run, but they don't know who, which is quite telling. And I've said to everybody publicly. If President Biden is the nominee, I'm going to do everything humanly possible to ensure that he's reelected. I only am in this job right now because my daughters, the morning after the 2016 election, were in tears about their futures, and I promised them that I would do something.
