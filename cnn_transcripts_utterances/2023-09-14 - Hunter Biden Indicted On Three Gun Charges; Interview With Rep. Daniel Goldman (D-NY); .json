So specifically, what Hunter Biden is charged with is making false statements on the ATF form that someone has to fill out in order to buy a gun.And what prosecutors say was false was that he checked the box saying that he was not addicted to or using any illegal drugs, and Hunter Biden has been pretty public since writing in a memoir that he was addicted to crack cocaine. The second count that same false statement, but the statement was given to the gun dealer, and then third count is that he was charged with possessing the gun while using or being addicted to the illegal drugs. So three serious counts, and as you say, this is you know, a big reversal from what he had a deal where he would have avoided any prosecution on the gun charge if he had abided certain conditions. So what has changed since then is that, you know, there were questions there about that deal. The judge wasn't sure it was constitutional the way it was structured, and then a number of Republicans have called it a sweetheart deal. They were very critical of it. After the judge said she wasn't sure of it, she asked the prosecution and Biden's team to see if they could amend it. But then from there, the US attorney, David Weiss who was appointed by former President Trump and stayed on, he then asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to make him a special counsel. That happened and that's led us to this indictment today -- Anderson.",

There was interesting reporting in \"The Washington Post\" today, it looked at federal charges for where the lead offense is unlawful possession of a weapon from last October until last March, October 22 to March 23 on circumstances similar to this, when that charge is based on simply a statement on the application that took place only in three percent of the almost 4,000 cases that were brought.

Again, firearm by a convicted felon, easy, easy to prove, he is a convicted felon. But when you're going to try and prove something under this Statute 924, to say he was addicted at that time, and I think they are limited to those 11 days, it's going to be virtually impossible, even though he talked about it in his memoir, even though it may have been referenced in the plea agreement, which by the way, I agree, is probably enforceable. And certainly, there is going to be this argument of how can you use that information now against me. You know, I think Mr. Weiss is a great lawyer and a great prosecutor, but you can't deny that there has been some political overtones to this, because it's the only variable that makes any sense as to why this one person would have been charged with a crime that I've never heard of being charged before.",

I am somewhat concerned as they are that what changed the prosecutor's mind may have been some of the political influence. But at the end of the day, Anderson, if Hunter Biden committed crimes, he should be held accountable for them. But those crimes and that investigation should remain in the Department of Justice in the court of law. Hunter Biden is not the president.
