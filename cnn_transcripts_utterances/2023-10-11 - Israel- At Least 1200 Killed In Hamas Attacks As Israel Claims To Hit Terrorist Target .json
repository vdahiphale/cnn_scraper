It has called up more than 300,000 reservists and evacuated civilians from near the Gaza border.

So, a really complex situation. Of course, Israel at the same time monitoring what's going on in the north. We saw rockets fired from Syria into Israel over the Golan Heights yesterday. And of course, we've seen both rockets fired from Southern Lebanon and also infiltrations from southern Lebanon into northern Israel. So, Israel monitoring the border. They've called up hundreds of thousands of reserves. We're talking about the equivalent of something like three percent of the entire Israeli population has now been called up. And also, to put the death toll into context as it stands more than 1200 in Israel killed in the Yom Kippur War which began almost 50 years ago to the day in the English calendar. The death toll was only about double that amount. So, no doubt future historians will look back upon what's been happening these past few days in the same kind of bracket as previous wars that Israel has fought such as the Yom Kippur War, Rosemary.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTENATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): The Gaza City neighborhood once known as Rimal, the sands reduced to ashes. Its residents retrieve what they can, which isn't much. Israel continues to pound the strip targeting it says Hamas infrastructure. Residents in shock are asking why. I got married this year says, Yahya Al-Ahwal. What did I do? What have we done? You destroyed an entire neighborhood. He says, he never fired a rocket. In this one of the most densely populated patches of land on Earth. Bombs crashing into crowded neighborhoods, rarely differentiate between fighter and civilian. The death toll rises by the hour. While Gaza's hospitals are overwhelmed with the wounded including infants. Around 40 percent of the population of Gaza is under the age of 15, according to the CIA. The information ministry in Gaza reports that nearly 170 buildings have been destroyed and more than 12,000 residences damaged. Tens of thousands have fled their homes seeking refuge and U.N. schools converted into shelters. An oven in this bakery in Gaza City is shut down. Many of the shelves empty. Life here was already difficult. And now the future looks bleaker than ever. Gaza will take five years to raise its head after this, says Wahiba Sirswai. And after five years there will be two or three more wars. It's a catastrophe. And amidst all this somewhere in Gaza, Hamas knows where are more than 100 Israeli captive's fates unknown. Tuesday afternoon, Israel struck Gaza is only port used principally by fishermen. While at the same time Hamas unleashed a massive volley of rockets toward Ashkelon. The abyss approaches.

We would really sort of urge as you heard my colleagues saying there that all parties should end this violence now, should stop it. And we should really deescalate, not escalate. Because -- I mean, civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian are the ones that always end up paying the price. And I think in that report by your correspondent, there was a woman there saying, you know, what comes after this? Another war and another war and another war?

I mean, clearly what happened there is likely a war crime. Summary executions by Hamas militants of Israeli civilians.But we're also seeing that the barrage of rockets coming from Hamas. That also likely being indiscriminate, will be affecting civilians. And maybe a possible war crime. We're also concerned about the airstrikes that have been conducted on Gaza and the destruction of civilian buildings. So, really, we understand that we're in the midst of this. But that is why there are calls that there really needs to be a stepping back. I would expect that there are multiple efforts being made on diplomatic and political channels to try to do this.
