Mike Johnson for the last several weeks and particularly over the last day has been having a flurry of conversation with a number of Republican holdouts, people who want him to make certain commitments, some demands to cut federal spending and the like, and also to give them more power in the legislative process.But Johnson has been absolutely defiant, saying that he will not cut deals. He says that it is time to get behind his speaker to try to move ahead with Trump's agenda, trying to highlight the fact that Donald Trump did come out in support of him and saying that supporting him now would -- opposing him now would undercut their ability to move ahead in this single party rule in Washington. And just moments ago, Mike Johnson made clear that he is taking a different approach than his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, who cut a number of side deals in order to get the speakership on the 15th ballot back in 2023. This time, he says Johnson is not going to cut those deals. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  My simple message to my colleagues is make suggestions about process improvements. We're open to that at all times. But I don't make deals with anyone. There's no quid pro quo here. I don't do anything in exchange for a vote. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And some of those members are simply not there yet. They want Mike Johnson to cut deals.

So, as of right now, if we don't have concrete commitment from Speaker Johnson. I'm not going to be supporting him tomorrow, but I'm open minded.

It looks like one was a suicide in Las Vegas and the tragedy in New Orleans was a very troubled individual but acting alone.So, the initial reports of suspicion of a conspiracy or others involved seems to have fallen by the wayside upon further examination by the FBI and other law enforcement agents. I think that's reassuring the tragedy notwithstanding that we're not looking at some kind of vast conspiracy or some kind of sleeper cell doing terrorism in the United States. This was the act of a lone, troubled individual who, by the way, is an American citizen born in America, living in Texas. Donald Trump has tried to use this tragedy to promote his border security initiatives and to ding on immigration. This guy was not an immigrant, and he didn't cross the border. He was born in Texas.

There's a world in which Mike Johnson goes down on the first ballot, and a number of Freedom Caucus members, I'm watching who we call the Gaetz Eight who last Congress what voted against Kevin McCarthy on multiple ballots, where's Lauren Boebert, where's Chip Roy in this, to register that they have some discontent, but then ultimately come around on a second ballot.Mike Johnson has basically the two most powerful things he could have, the Donald Trump endorsement and simply the math. The math does not math for anyone else. He is the most likely person to be able to get the votes necessary to be speaker. And I would add to that, that I don't think Donald Trump has an appetite for Congress to waste time. He sees himself coming in with a mandate. He wants a functioning House. He doesn't want this year to kick off with a big Republican infighting battle on Capitol Hill. And I think that that will motivate some other folks. Thomas Massie is an ideologue.

He was very clear about what he wanted in terms of getting rid of the debt ceiling, and no one paid attention to him. That didn't happen.So, I do think that his hold on the MAGA world isn't as strong as before, because let's also remember, he's a lame duck president. He is not running again, he can't run again, but these folks in the Congress, in the House of Representatives, they do want to run again, and they want to win again. And so they are looking at a much different -- maybe not much different, but a different enough calculus a little bit more obvious than Donald Trump, where this could maybe not work math-wise for Mike Johnson. I do think that he probably is the best position to win. But today, the math isn't there for him 100 percent and it might not go on the second ballot. It might not go on the first ballot. It might not go on the second ballot. If this does become chaos, who knows what could happen?",

Mike Johnson was an original Freedom Caucus member. He's seen as part of the right flank. He's an Evangelical Christian who's beloved with the base of the party. And I think that actually gets him pretty far. I mean, this conference remembers the Kevin McCarthy votes. They remember all the names that they put up, the Jim Jordans of the world and others who could not get to 218.

Ryan, to you first. What more are you learning about the investigation where it stands right now? We were just talking to Congressman Gerry Connolly about this, and it sounds from what they're being told up on Capitol Hill that this attacker may have been working alone. At least that's the way things look right now. What are you hearing? RYAN YOUNG, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, that is the belief so far. And in talking to investigators, talking to FBI, they've been telling us that they are operating with that as the sole purpose right now. But let's not forget, they have other intelligence that they're still trying to work on in terms of his laptops and his cell phone. As I take a step out of here, one of the things about this, and you talk about the video and how that played out, they were able to watch parts of this crime because of the fact of all video surveillance that's on this street. This street has now been hardened because there are officers up and down this street. They have blocked it off differently than what it was blocked off before. There's been talks about the barricades that were down. Those will be improved before the Super Bowl. The big conversation about how to move this forward is making sure they're surging all those extra funds into this area to make sure that this street can stay open.
