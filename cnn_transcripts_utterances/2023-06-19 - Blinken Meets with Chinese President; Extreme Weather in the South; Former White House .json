A major question now, which ones?Here are the key points of tension, Taiwan, spying, the war in Ukraine and restrictions that the U.S. has placed on the sale of semi- conducting chips. But let's start with Taiwan. So, right now the island is a self-ruling democracy, but Beijing claims it's their territory. The U.S. has vowed to stand with Taiwan, a key trading partner, if China ever invaded. Another flash point, spying and surveillance. Blinken's trip was delayed four months after the takedown of this Chinese spy balloon. Remember this? It was caught flying across the U.S. Then there's Beijing's close ties with Moscow and the question of whether China would provide lethal aid in Russia's war in Ukraine. And finally, Beijing's anger over U.S. efforts to limit the sale of semiconductor chips, chips that are a technology that's in everything from smartphones to cars. China's growing dominance in that industry, a major concern of the Biden administration. CNN national security correspondent Kylie Atwood live for us in Beijing.

One of the readouts from a meeting that the secretary had here made clear that Chinese officials made demands when it comes to Taiwan. They said that is the area that presents the most pronounced risk to U.S.-China relations.[09:05:04] The secretary of state said at the press conference that he made clear that the U.S. has concerns about China's provocative actions when it comes to Taiwan. And the United States doesn't, right now, support Taiwan's independence, but they don't support either side taking unilateral actions that could upend the status quo currently. Now, there was progress, forward movement, on another topic, and that's an issue of synthetic opioids, which, of course, is a major killer of Americans back home. Fentanyl, the precursor chemicals for fentanyl, largely come from China. Secretary of state said that the two sides agreed to stand up a working level meeting on this, a group that can actually address this issue to stem that flow of those chemicals into the United States. And on Ukraine they also addressed the war in Ukraine. The secretary said that Chinese officials once again said that they are not going to be sending lethal aid to Russia to be used in that war but they're still watching Chinese companies incredibly closely.",

This, obviously, a somewhat difference in status there. And so that was an indication that, in fact, Xi Jinping did want to put a floor on the relationship.But I think as Kylie described there, and as we heard from Secretary Blinken during the press conference, it was sort of a mixed score card. The fact that they agreed to work together on a couple of issues that they did not specify is good. The fact that they couldn't get something as basic together as communications during a military crisis or another spy balloon incident, that's bad because that's how accidents happen. And the big fear, John, is that these two powers, as their relationship has been spiraling downward, get into some kind of accident in the air, in the sea that triggers a real crisis.",

And he described how Wang Yi had basically sought an apology from the United States for shooting down the Chinese spy balloon over American territory. Well, that's not a great start.He did better this time. Though it was interesting that in the statement that the Chinese issued, Wang Yi said, let's avoid hyping the China threat theory. So, in other words, they're pretty unhappy with this sensibility in the U.S., which is probably likely to get worse as we get closer to the presidential election, that China is a looming threat.",

So, we are monitoring these storms very closely. This is an updated probability map from the Storm Prediction Center. And this came out just literally moments ago. I was working with my producer to update this map. You see that shading of yellow. This is the probability of a tornado today. That encompasses southern Alabama, Mississippi and the extreme western sections of the Florida panhandle. So, Mobile, Alabama, for instance, you have a 5 percent probability of tornadoes anywhere around a given point that you select within that area. And that's because we still have these kind of outflow boundaries from the thunderstorms that are ongoing across the south. A few stronger thunderstorms now impacting the Tallahassee region. This now coming into the CNN Weather Center. Latest update, severe thunderstorm warning for Tallahassee.
