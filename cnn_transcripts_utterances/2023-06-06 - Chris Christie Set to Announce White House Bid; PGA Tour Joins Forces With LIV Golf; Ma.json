That's been captured on surveillance. They also want to know if they have all of it. Are there any gaps? Did anyone try to withhold some of the footage from that? We know, from our reporting, that some witnesses going before the grand jury, including the Trump Organization's head of security, have been asked about this very issue, which is why something that sounds maybe a little silly, it takes on a really a serious tone when you think about it in the context of possible obstruction.",

This has been the seat of this investigation. But in order to charge, ultimately, a crime, you have to have a connection between where you charge it and the alleged crime that you are charging. And from the outset, there were questions about whether a case against the former president or his associates could be brought in Washington, because the connection here, of course, would be that many of these documents belonged to the Archives, to the government seated here. Also, many of them were removed from the White House, though I will say it's a little complicated because Trump was still president when he left the White House. So, from the outset, there have been questions about whether D.C. was the proper venue. We know they're going to hear from at least one witness now down in Florida, but it's unclear at this point if they're going to try to bring maybe some charges down in Florida, some in D.C., or what exactly they're doing.

They thought they could cut this problem at the root and that, if they turned the Saudi entity, if they turned LIV Golf into a money loser, then maybe they would get bored, or maybe they would just turn their attention somewhere else. Well, that's not going to happen. The Saudis have money on a different level on the PGA Tour. They could afford to keep pumping money and money and money into LIV Golf and to keep offering guys more and more money. The PGA Tour couldn't just do that. They don't just have a fund of $600 billion to start funneling to their players. So they had to go deep into the reserves. They had to -- some people suggested they borrowed money to fund their tournaments this year. They had to ask their sponsors for more, and I don't know if they thought that was sustainable. So, at a certain point, you have to deal with the facts on the ground.

You will remember that, after the gruesome murder of Khashoggi, the -- of course, an American resident and a Saudi citizen and dissident, that there was an effort to try to make sure that MBS was frozen out. That pretty well ended last year when President Biden went to Saudi Arabia in search of an oil pricing deal, among other things, that he did not get.

They still are a significant human rights violator and so forth. But it's not much of a sanction, when you see them move from buying off individual players to buying into an entire league.
