I have obtained the 2019 confidential report that was done by a private security consulting firm, Interfor International, that called for the immediate installation of permanent barriers, the goal, preventing the type of truck-ramming incident that killed 14 people last week.But Interfor International says political bickering and infighting compromised security and the immediate improvements it recommended. In this report, it said -- quote -- \"Throughout Interfor's time with the various players in the French Quarter, we were privy to palace intrigue and accusations of agendas and we were repeatedly reminded of each group's red lines lurking around the corner to immediately render any proposal or initiative dead in the water, no matter how insignificant in reality.\" And joining us now to discuss this, the CEO of Interfor International, authored that report. Thank you for joining us. So, Don, I have obtained this confidential report. I have read through it. Look, today kicks off the Mardi Gras celebration season and the city is asking for federal help to ensure that they can ramp up security and keep revelers safe. But the backdrop after reading this report makes you wonder about the political dysfunction. What was the level of political dysfunction your firm encountered in 2019?",

I mean, there were so many disparate groups and shareholders and stakeholders that have a role in driving the French Quarter, so, specifically, the French Quarter, not New Orleans in general. So it was quite glaring to see how many different groups are fighting for the dollars and the policing dollars to protect this 1.1-square- mile piece of land. So it was quite jarring.",

The fact that the assailant was able to just scoot around the police vehicle and then right over a closed wedge barrier is shocking. The point of the wedge barrier -- and even if they're not operable, you can manually open those in most circumstances. So it should have been open in allowing any vehicle to be stopped. The fact that they -- it wasn't, I don't have an answer for that and I can't address that. But it is pretty shocking. So it shouldn't have happened. I mean, quite frankly, if the concern was that a vehicle can get around it, then you use two police barriers or vehicles. And as we know now, the city of New Orleans does have Archer barriers, which are the smaller barriers, which could have been put in the street to mitigate this type of attack. It should have been stopped at the corner of Canal and Bourbon.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Pam, so this adds to a lot of growing evidence in looking at what the connection is between fluoride added to water and the neurocognitive impacts on children in particular, looking at this through the lens of I.Q.Now, what this government study did is essentially look at the available evidence, more than 70 different studies done around the world. Most of them were done in China none were done in the United States. And what it found is a correlation between higher levels of fluoride and drinking water and a negative impact on I.Q. When they looked at the total amounts of fluoride in kids' urine, in their pee, essentially, what they found is that for every increase in one milligram per liter of urinary fluoride levels, they found a decrease of about 1.6 I.Q. points. Now, it's important to note, though, in the United States the recommended level of fluoride in drinking water is about 0.7 milligrams per liter. And that is much lower than the levels that they were looking at in this -- in these dozens of studies. And so there were two editorials published alongside this study in \"JAMA Pediatrics,\" the journal, and they had completely opposing views about what we should do with this information. On the one hand, one editorial said, this is enough to reexamine our public health recommendations around fluoride in drinking water. On the other hand, one study said, well, this doesn't tell us anything about the lower fluoride levels in water commonly used in our systems here in the U.S. and so we shouldn't do anything. So, Pam, this debate continues.",

Vice President Kamala Harris, as vice president, will preside over the role of -- over the joint session in her role as president of the Senate overseeing the public count of her own electoral defeat. And this is what elected officials have been doing for most of the history of these United States, carrying out the electoral vote certification, whether their won or their side lost. It is a formality, but it is integral to democracy. It was tradition, until it wasn't. What happened on January 6, 2021, of course, looms large over this day. The contrast between what we saw then and what we're about to see now could not be more stark, with the former and future President Donald J. Trump the center of all of it.

And, of course, four years ago, it was anything but serene, never mind the feel of the place, but one of the many differences was there was a vice president who was getting pressured to overturn the will of the people. This time, we are going to see a vice president who herself was on the ballot to be the -- have the highest office in the land. And she's going to have to be part of the ceremony, oversee the ceremony that is constitutional that makes her loss certified. And I was in the Capitol, in the House chamber four years ago, when Al Gore had to do -- excuse me -- 24 years ago, when he had to do that very thing. And, Manu, as I bring you in -- Manu Raju is, of course, here on Capitol Hill as well -- I remember how difficult, Manu, that moment was for Al Gore. You could feel the tension in the House chamber then. People were very angry. It was a different situation. And I will tell you that I was told that Al Gore and Kamala Harris have spoken since the election. We don't know what they spoke about, but you can only imagine they have a lot in common.",
