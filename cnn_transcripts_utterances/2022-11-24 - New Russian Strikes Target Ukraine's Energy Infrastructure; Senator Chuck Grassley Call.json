So Ukraine's energy minister says that Russian missile attacks they targeted generation facilities, caused for the first all four of the country's nuclear power plants to be shut down at the same time. They've been deliberately attacking a whole range of civilian infrastructure here. I mean, they've been doing that since the beginning but frankly they're escalating them as they lose ground on the battlefield.I mean, is that what this war is becoming as Russia is stymied on the military end of things, that it's just in effect punishing the Ukrainian people?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Exactly. That's exactly what's happening, Jim. And this is part of a deliberate Russian policy and a deliberate Russian strategy of actually prosecuting the war on the backs of the civilian population of Ukraine. So what the Russians are doing is a very systematic approach, ever since General Surovikin became the new commander of Russian forces in Ukraine. He has basically done a little bit of what he's done in Syria, and that is a deliberate, targeting process against the civilian infrastructure. And of course the Russians are quite familiar with Ukraine's infrastructure because they built a large part of it during the days of the Soviet Union.",

Right, I mean, that is deliberate.A particular threat has been to the nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia for some time. And that's been deliberate as well, too. I mean, those attacks are out there. Is the plant still at risk of a nuclear accident and is that part of the Russian plan as well, holding that threat in effect over the Ukrainian people?",

So in other words, what the Russians are doing is they're holding this plant hostage, and by extension that entire region around the Zaporizhzhia plant is being held hostage so the Russians can perhaps gain some leverage in terms of keeping territory in the south, making it more difficult for the Ukrainians to advance.The Ukrainians, of course, took Kherson and they were able to do that in a very systematic fashion. It took them a while but they still did it and they did it very well. So what the Russians are doing is they're holding this plant hostage. And the risk is very high of in essence a nuclear accident or a nuclear incident that would potentially render that entire area useless for several decades.",

What they -- you know, what we need to do in an effort to close the skies, as they say, the real idea would be to give the Ukrainians not only what they've gotten so far through things like HIMARS and other systems like RST and others like that, but what we need is, we need a system of integrated air defenses, really integrated air missile defenses just like Chairman Milley of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has mentioned.What we really need to do is get that in place. They should have been in place really at the beginning of this effort, but that's -- you know, that's something that, you know, of course we cannot make a redo on that. But the big idea here is that they need an air defense system that allows them to take care of every threat, whether it's drones or cruise missiles, or other threats as they come toward them.",

This includes the chief information security officer and the head of integrity and safety.These are critical roles at Twitter that now remain unfilled. So yes, it begs the question, you know, who is minding the store there? Who's keeping an eye on digital security? Who is actually, you know, protecting Twitter against the possible threat of a cyber security incident? It really begs all those questions.

KOSIKproblems that Twitter is encountering in these lay-offs. That includes massive lay-offs at its headquarters in Africa where Elon Musk is being accused of discrimination in the way it's paying out its severance. At its Africa headquarters, Twitter laid off all but one employee. There are about a dozen at that office. But now everybody is gone. And that physical office has actually only been open four days. And the employees there are saying that Elon Musk deliberately and recklessly flouted Ghana's laws in trying to silence and intimidate them after they were fired. They said that they were not given severance pay which is required by Ghana's labor laws and also based on their employment contracts. And they claim that they weren't informed about next steps, next steps that were given to employees laid off in the United States and Europe -- Jim.",

Right, it means you have more money to spend on other things, if you're not spending a few hundred bucks a month or whatever it is on your student loan payments. It means you have money to spend on clothes, housing, vacations, et cetera. Good news for you.The problem is that collectively, if you are sending, you know, lots and lots of Americans effectively 100 bucks a month or at least you're reducing their student loan payments by 100 bucks a month, collectively that is inflationary. And this is always the challenge with a lot of these policies that can be popular for those receiving them, but when put together, you know, increased demand. So that's the challenge here. And I think the Biden administration had even kind of acknowledged that before when they had previously forgiven the student loan, some of the student loans, and said, OK, well, in exchange for that we're going to resume monthly payments. Overall, that won't cause inflation. Now we have the reverse and it probably will be modestly inflationary.",

That's part of the reason why we are the world's reserve currency, why Uncle Sam enjoys such low interest rates that the government has to pay on treasury bonds and such.And so you could see interest rates go up in the future.

That will probably cost somewhere around $40 billion. You also have interest rates going up.
