And the expected release of more hostages today. My colleague Kaitlan Collins is live in Tel Aviv. And we'll have more from Kaitlan in just a moment.But this morning we are monitoring the situation in Gaza and Israel. This is day two of this negotiated four-day truce. And now we're watching for the release of the hostages being held by Hamas they're expected to free 14 Israeli hostages. That's according to an Israeli source and exchange, Israel is prepared to release up to 42 more prisoners today. CNN has learned that no Americans are expected to be released today. Under the deal, Israel is freeing three Palestinians from jail for every Israeli hostage allowed out of Gaza. A Palestinian official a warning of what they call a possible crisis in the deal. They say Israel is not following the terms of the prisoner release deal. 13 Israelis, 10 Thai citizens one Filipino were in that first tranche of captive freed from a Gaza. This video was released by Hamas and CNN we should say had no control over this content. Four children were among those released in the first exchange. This video shows a family reuniting with their two and four-year-old daughters. Officials at the Children's Hospital say they're in good physical condition. But of course, we know there could be some scars that we do not see as the emotional toll of the last 50 days becomes evident. The truce also allows the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. A trucks filled with essential supplies are lined up this morning at the Rafah border crossing. CNN is covering the developments Arlette Saenz, Larry Madona Oh, Jeremy Diamond are live for us but we begin with CNN anchor Kaitlan Collins. So let's start with the expectation, Kaitlan, and good morning to you. The next release of hostages, what do we expect it?",

      "sentences": "Yes, good morning, you guys. What we do know at this point is that those who's loved ones are expected to be part of day two of this hostage release. They already know that because the Israeli government has essentially, when they've gotten the list, they check it, they vet it, and then they make phone calls to these families to let them know that it is going to be their loved one that is coming home on that day that it's expected to come home. They add a major caveat, of course, that they are still in the hands of Hamas, and they can't make any guarantees because there is zero trust between Israel and Hamas, even though day one seemed to unfold as officials had hoped it would, they know that there are going to be difficulties each day. And I think that is something why no one's super competent every day when they get this list of what it's going to ultimately look like at the end. They want to wait for it to happen.And of course, the families that are also getting the call that it is not their loved ones that are coming home, some of them have been incredibly hopeful. And as we've now learned that no Americans are expected to be on this list for the second day. That's obviously disappointing news for the White House because they had been anticipating that Americans would be in this first group of 50 to be released. And of course, they still certainly could. But they'd certainly been hoping that they would be in the first day or two. They didn't have any guarantees that they would. But obviously learning that news is something that White House officials likely already knew given there were no U.S. officials or U.S. families that were notified about their loved ones coming home. Of course, this is all a tenuous deal. It's very fragile and delicate even though day one did go well. We are tracking all of it closely to see how day to unfolds. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Kerem Shalom near the Gaza border, where Jeremy, we saw a lot of activity yesterday, but I want to start with CNN Arlette Saenz who is learning new details about the Americans who are still being held hostage in Gaza. Arlette, what are you hearing from officials this morning on their reaction to the news that no Americans are on this list?",

We still -- we know that Israeli officials have been clear that they are maintaining a few different potential options, keeping those options open for the flexibility of this negotiation of this of this deal of the release of these hostages. But yesterday, what we saw was this camp Shalom crossing which is right behind us. That is where Israeli hostages took their first steps back on Israeli soil after being freed by Hamas. They were freed by Hamas initially inside the Gaza Strip released into Red Cross custody before being taken to the Rafah crossing in Egypt. From there, they then traveled to the Kerem Shalom crossing, where they then were able to enter Israel.And then they traveled along this road here right behind me to get to that air force base where they were able to make their first phone calls to their family members, get medical evaluations and eventually be flown to various hospitals in Israel, where many of their family members were actually waiting for them. What we also saw was right over here, we had helicopters actually landing here, those I'm told, were there in case effectively in case any of these hostages who came out had a medical emergency or were deemed to injured or ill to be taken by car to a hospital and instead would need an immediate medical evacuation to a hospital. My understanding is those hospitals -- those helicopters that landed here, did not actually end up taking any of those newly freed hostages to where they came from. But this is still a very, very fluid situation. I mean, yesterday offered the hope that everyone was able to keep up their end of the bargain that the process actually worked to get those hostages out of Gaza into Egypt and subsequently into Israel. But this is still a very delicate situation. As you know, Kaitlan, just a little bit ago, we heard from a Palestinian official who said that there is a possible crisis in the deal because of what he said was Israel not releasing prisoners of the Palestinian prisoners, by length of time that they had served effectively suggesting that Israel had not maintained its end of the deal fully. We've asked the Israelis for comments on that haven't received anything yet. But that just shows you how fragile the situation is. And officials have been very clear. This is a day-by-day process. And there are a lot of variables, a lot of potential bumps in the road that could emerge and so they are very mindful of that as we approach the hour when the next hostages could potentially be released.",

Because there's one checkpoint of the Egyptian side, there's another checkpoint where the Israelis get a search what is coming into Gaza before it's dispatched to maintain, and they insist to maintain the humanitarian infrastructure in Gaza. So out of this train, and 40 trucks, the Egyptians tell us they have about seven fuel trucks and another for gas trucks. But the Israeli coordinator of government activities in the territory says they have about four food trucks for fuel trucks and for cooking gas trucks to small discrepancy data we're trying to figure out.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [08:22:08] BLACKWELL: Well soon, a second set of hostages taken by Hamas is expected to be released in exchange for Israel freeing Palestinian prisoners. And today's expected release comes after a successful exchange yesterday. 39 imprisoned Palestinians are now free. This is video from the West Bank. It shows the jubilation from supporters rejoicing at the prisoners homecomings. But for some the joy of the freedom is tempered by the suffering in Gaza. Hamas authorities in Gaza say that more than 14,800 people have been killed by Israeli attacks since October 7. CNN is Nada Bashir joins us live from the West Bank.

We've been hearing from security officials here on the ground who have told us that these verses were carrying some of the detainees and prisoners who were held in Israeli prisons southeast of Haifa. And of course, as we saw yesterday, that process is expected to follow a similar pattern once again where those detainees and prisoners will be held here at the offer prison for some time. They will undergo checks by the Red Cross before they can be released. But of course that release is dependent on the safe evacuation of those hostages inside guards are currently held by Hamas that agreed number as part of the chase. That is certainly what we saw take place yesterday.Once we have that confirmation of the release of those hostages, we began to see prisoners and detainees held here being transported that. Those who live or are from the occupied West Bank are expected to once again be transported over the Petunia checkpoint was just a couple of 100 meters to my right and that is where we saw many people gathering yesterday as part of their celebrations, welcoming the return of those prisoners. And we are expecting 42 detainees and prisoners to be released as part of that truce agreement yesterday. As you mentioned, we thought 39, including 15 children and the majority of those who were released yesterday were detainees held under administrative detention meaning no charges laid against them. No clear legal process. So of course, that is a huge point of contention more than 3,000 Palestinians are believed to be held under administrative detention at this current point in time. And as we saw yesterday, there was certainly a huge amount of relief, and certainly some jubilation over the return of those 39 detainees and prisoners. Take a look. 08:25:03 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

But as we know that list, the majority of those listed weren't children, some as young as 14, many of them again held under administrative detention, no charges laid against them. But amongst the charges that were listed, throwing stones and risking regional security were amongst the most common charges laid there. There is widespread concern over the number of children currently held in detention across Israel. That is a warning that we've heard from U.N. Rights experts, from Save the Children, particularly around the treatment that many of these children have faced while in detention. The hope today, of course, for many here, particularly across the occupied West Bank, is that they will see more Palestinians released and that those releases will continue over the course of the next three days so long as the terms of this truce agreements are upheld.",

      "sentences": "So according to the Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, he says that his office was made aware of the fact that that the stabbing took place, and that the 47 year old Chauvin is in stable condition at a hospital and is expected to be okay. Now Alison went on to say that of course, he was saddened to hear about what happened and that Chauvin should be able to carry out his sentence without the fear of violence and retaliation. We know that there's a stabbing took place yesterday afternoon at a medium security Federal Prison out in Tucson Arizona where Chauvin is carrying out his sentence.Now the details leading up to the stabbing are still unclear at this hour. Federal prison officials really did not give a whole lot of information about what happened other than to say that, \"Life saving measures were taken and that none of their employees were hurt.\" Chauvin is serving two concurrent sentences on state and federal charges with regards to George Floyd's murder. Again, we're told that the 47 year old is in stable condition and that he is expected to be okay. And then earlier this week, Victor, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Chauvin case this after his attorneys argued that he did not receive a fair trial.",
