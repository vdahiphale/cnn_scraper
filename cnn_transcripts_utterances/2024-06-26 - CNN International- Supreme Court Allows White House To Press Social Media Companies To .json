I'm Rahel Solomon live in New York.Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM, an important U.S. Supreme Court decision just out that could have implications with this November's election. We're live in Washington with the latest here. Plus, the clock is ticking, U.S. President Joe Biden and Donald Trump honing their strategies ahead of their debate rematch. Our panel will discuss. And I can see it, the Kenyan President says that he will not sign that 2024 finance bill. We are live in Nairobi with the latest here. We want to start this hour at the U.S. Supreme Court with a decision that could have a significant impact on the flow of information ahead of the November presidential election. The court ruling six to three that the White House and federal agencies such as the FBI can press social media platforms to remove posts that the government views as harmful disinformation. The court decided that state Republican officials and social media users who challenged the Biden administration did not have the legal standing to sue. Let's bring in CNN Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider, who joins us now from Washington. So, Jessica, lay this out for us exactly what we learned in this decision.",

      "sentences": "Rahel, I'd say that this is a big win for government officials, and not just in the Biden administration, but also for future administrations, because it will continue to enable officials in all agencies across the government to communicate with social media companies and to push those platforms to remove content that could be damaging when it comes to any range of subjects. Most particularly, this case dealt with public health information like the COVID-19 pandemic, or crucially, as we head into November, disinformation about upcoming elections.So, what the Supreme Court did in this case, they all out dismissed this challenge from Republican officials in Missouri and Louisiana. These officials really wanted to ban officials from pushing platforms like X or Facebook to take down certain content that the government viewed as wrong or misleading. And the Supreme Court dismissed this case from these officials, these are Republican officials, on standing grounds, saying they just didn't have the legal right to bring this case as Republican officials and other social media users. So, they dismissed this case. And what the majority opinion did, they also stressed that social media platforms often act independently without government input to take down some of that same damaging content that the government might raise flags about, and that also added to the weakness of this case. So, it was a six-three decision. But then, the three dissenters were Justice Thomas, Justice Alito, Justice Gorsuch. Justice Alito really came out biting and this is what he said. He says \"The Supreme Court permits the successful campaign of coercion in this case to stand as an attractive model for future officials who want to control what the people say, hear, and think.\" He continued to say \"that is regrettable\". So, Alito there really agreeing with Republican officials that in their take, the government, whenever they communicate with social media, they're being coercive when they urge which content needs to be taken down. But, for now, Rahel, government officials can continue to do that. They can communicate with social media companies. And this will be especially crucial as we head into November's election, where we might be already seeing some efforts at disinformation by foreign actors. The Director of National Intelligence just a few months ago warned in particular about China's growing efforts to exploit disinformation. So, this is a big win for government officials, because they'll be able to continue that communication with social media platforms, urging them to take things down when they just might contain misinformation, disinformation, or just misleading information.

Let's continue this conversation and bring in some more legal expertise on all of this. I'm joined now by Jeff Swartz. He is a former judge in the state of Florida and a professor at the Thomas Cooley Law School. Jeff, always good to see you. Let me just ask your first reaction to this decision six-three. So, it clearly crossed ideological lines. What do you make of it? JEFF SWARTZ, FORMER MIAMI-DADE COUNTY COURT JUDGE, &amp; PROFESSOR, THOMAS M. COOLEY LAW SCHOOL: Well, there is a couple of things that I saw, and that is the idea that people have been wondering whether Amy Coney Barrett would in some way or fashion break away from the influence of Justice Alito and Justice Thomas. I think she has indicated she is capable of doing that, and maybe as many justices over years of being on the court start coming from left or right and coming more to center. I think that Justice Barrett is a little bit more or a little bit less right-winging outside of abortion cases, and I don't think she is going to follow Justice Alito down whatever rabbit hole he is going to go down. So, I think that we got that out of this case. Yeah. I also think that they're continuing to use standing as a way of avoiding making decisions. It makes me wonder really what's going to happen with the immunity case, which may not come out by Friday. They've been known to release opinions after the term has ended. So, I'm not really counting on it by Friday, but it could happen. I think that the decision in the immunity case may entail a large number of opinions. And if it does, we can end up with a plurality opinion with absolutely no precedential value whatsoever, and that would throw things into kind of a confusion. So, I'm waiting to see what's going to happen. But, Justice Barrett really is kind of operating as an individual now.",

Kavanaugh was kind of following like Barrett in a different way. So, I'm not quite sure exactly where everything is going to land.But clearly, there is some division there in the fact that, for example, I don't know if Alito showed up today or not.

All eyes will be on Georgia tomorrow night with the historic showdown at CNN in Atlanta.[11:15:00] We are only one day away from the first U.S. presidential debate of the year. Sitting President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will make their pitch for America's vote. Mr. Biden's team wants him to stand out as a contrast to Trump based on character, based on policy. Meanwhile, Trump's advisors are encouraging him to stay focused on the issues such as inflation, immigration and crime. Our team tracking the stark contrast and the candidates' messages ahead of tomorrow night's debate. We have Alayna Treene standing by for us at our Washington, D.C. bureau. But first, let's begin with Kevin Liptak.

      "sentences": "Well, there are three very clear issues that the President, I think, wants to talk about at this debate, abortion, the threat to democracy, and the economy. Those are the things that they think that this election will be decided on. And they very much want to draw the contrast with Trump when it comes to all of these issues, because they really do believe that a lot of Americans just aren't paying attention to this election yet. And this will be a moment to put the contrast under a magnifying glass, as more and more Americans tune in.I think that the other issue that isn't necessarily at the center of this election is foreign policy. President Biden has been consumed by this for the last, well, really for the last 10 months when it comes to Israel, but when you think about Ukraine for the last two years, and it is something that I think is something of a risk for him. It's something of vulnerability. While he has been successful in the case of Ukraine and rallying the West behind Kyiv, it's something that I think his opponents are trying to paint him as overly focused on. Any President who appears more focused on issues overseas rather than the issues that are confronting Americans at their kitchen tables is always going to be sort of left vulnerable to attacks from the other side. And I think that could be the case when he hits the debate stage on Thursday night. The other issue that I think is an issue for him when it comes to foreign policy is that Donald Trump has not necessarily articulated very clear positions, particularly when it comes to the war in Gaza. He started out with some light criticism of Netanyahu. Throughout it, he has supported Israel's right to go after Hamas, but he has also called on Israel to end the war, to stop the violence and stop the suffering. So, it's not necessarily clear exactly what his positions are which, in the end, was true of his foreign policy when he was in office as well. So, it's something of an ephemeral thing for President Biden to try and pin down on the debate stage. His advisors have been preparing for foreign policy sections. Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor, was at Camp David to kind of lead the prep on this particular area. But, in past election cycles, there has been a presidential debate that's specifically focused on foreign policy. That's not the case this time around. So, I think it will be up to the candidates themselves to sort of bring this up in a way that they think will benefit themselves and benefit their appeal to the American people.",

In a letter organized by famed economist Joseph Stiglitz, the group said that it is, quote, \"deeply concerned that another Trump term would we ignite inflation.\" They point in particular to Trump's fiscally irresponsible budgets, their words, and say that the outcome would have a quote, \"negative impact on the U.S. global economic standing\" and a quote, \"destabilizing effect on the domestic economy\".Joining us now from New York is Matt Egan.

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, these are some of the leading economic thinkers, including famed economist Joseph Stiglitz and Robert Shiller, who famously called the housing bubble back in the early 2000s, and their main concern here is the impact with inflation. Remember, cost of living remains such a major pain point for Americans right now. Former President Trump says that he will help when it comes to inflation. But, these 16 Nobel Prize-winning economist, they're saying that not only would Trump's policies fail to fix inflation, it would actually make matters worse.Let me read you the key line from this letter from the economist. They wrote, quote, \"We believe that a second Trump term would have a negative impact on the U.S.'s economic standing in the world and a destabilizing effect on the U.S.'s domestic economy.\" In particular, they talk about how Trump's policies could reignite inflation, specifically because of what they described as quote \"fiscally irresponsible budgets\". They point to research, private research that shows that his policies would actually boost prices. On the tax front, remember, former President Trump, he wants to extend those 2017 tax cuts. Not only that but he recently told CEOs in a closed-door meeting in Washington that he wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. Trump is arguing that this would make American companies more competitive on the global stage and that it would help workers. But, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, they estimate that extending those 2017 tax cuts that would cost almost $5 trillion. On the trade front, Trump is, of course, advocating a very aggressive trade policy. He wants across-the-board tariffs of 10 percent, 60 percent tariff on Chinese goods. And Trump is arguing that this would really get at some of those bipartisan concerns about Chinese trade tactics. But, research from the Peterson Institute warns that this would increase cost for the typical American family by at least $1,700 a year. There is also Trump's immigration policy where he is arguing that there should be an immigration crackdown. There should be mass deportations. There is concern from economists about what that would do in terms of how many workers there are. I mean, businesses say they need more workers, not fewer. The Trump campaign, not surprisingly, they're pushing back here. They're blasting the economist, saying that the American people don't need, quote, \"worthless, out-of-touch Nobel Prize winners to know which President put more money in their pockets.\" And look, when you look at the polling, it's clear that voters do trust former President Trump more than President Biden on these two major issues. On inflation, Trump is winning by 18 points. When you look at an average of polls, on economy, he is winning by 13 points. Again, that's despite the fact that some leading economists are warning that the Trump agenda would actually make inflation worse. Rahel.",

And he has, by the way, this new ammunition, this -- the letter from the economist, the analysis that you discussed earlier about the inflationary policies of Donald Trump.And I think an important thing here is to remind the American people what he inherited. That is a fair point. He inherited an economy in shambles, and we've done better. Our economy has recovered better than any other industrialized economy in the world. Our inflation is lower than any other industrialized economy in the world, though, it's still too high. So, I think he needs to address those issues. And he has talk about what he has done. There are items beyond groceries and beyond gas, like prescription drugs, healthcare premiums, student loan debt, junk fee reform that he has done to try to put more money in the pockets of the American people.

And new statement from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow says \"Evan did not commit any illegal acts and should not have been arrested at all. This trial isn't about the presentation of evidence, due process or the rule of law. We're talking about the Kremlin using American citizens to achieve its political goals\", the statement adds. With the conflict raging in Ukraine, Russia began a crackdown at home on free speech, silencing dissidents or forcing them into exile. It's against this backdrop that Gershkovich was arrested on a reporting assignment in the Russian city of Yekaterinburg. This is video from the website of the tank factory there where Russian prosecutors allege Gershkovich acted, quote \"on the instructions of the CIA to collect secret information\", although no evidence has been made public. The trial will take place in the city, which is about 1,000 miles from Moscow, amid an outcry.",

Outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte was formally selected to replace Jens Stoltenberg as head of the Alliance earlier today. He is due to take up the post in October. Mr. Rutte is praising Stoltenberg on social media and says that he is grateful that NATO allies have placed their trust in him. Well, less than two days and counting until Election Day in Iran, and the candidates vying to replace the late President Ebrahim Raisi are making their final pitches. Happening this hour, the only reformist in the pool of six hopefuls is holding a rally in Tehran. Friday's snap vote comes amid bubbling anger across the country over the struggling economy and inflation that has sent the cost of basic goods like meat and dairy skyrocketing. Well, Kenyan President William Ruto says that he will no longer sign a controversial tax hike bill that sparked deadly protests on Tuesday. You might remember it. We covered it extensively yesterday. The President announced that the finance bill will be withdrawn, saying that he concedes to the fierce opposition to the proposal. He also expressed condolences to the families of those who died in Tuesday's unrest. In his address, the President said that six people died in Tuesday's violence. A Police reform group says that the death toll is actually much higher. Let's get more now from CNN's Larry Madowo, live in Nairobi.

For them, it's about President Ruto and his understanding of the plight of the common man, which is an extraordinary moment for President Ruto, just two years after he was elected. His campaign slogan was that he was the hustler-in-chief, that he understood the plight of the common man. And yet, he has not paid attention.

And so, that's the anger that still is running through so many parts of the country. There are some young people on social media right now calling for \"one million man\" march on Thursday, as they had initially planned to do if this bill had not been rejected, as the President has done.And the other thing you mentioned, Rahel, is about the number of those dead.
