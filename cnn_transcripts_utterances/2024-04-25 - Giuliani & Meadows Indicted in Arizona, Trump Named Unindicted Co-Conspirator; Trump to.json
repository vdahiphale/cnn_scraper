This is a live look at New York City, where Donald Trump is expected to make something of a campaign stop, a photo-op here in just a few minutes. We'll bring you any news out of that as it unfolds. It's a pretty classic scene from Trump's days as a real estate mogul in New York. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's great to have you with us. It is an incredibly consequential Thursday for former President Donald Trump and, honestly, for the country, with the Supreme Court set to hear historic arguments about whether he's immune from prosecution over the events of January 6. For Trump, he also has to face his hush money trial. That's set to resume today in New York. But first, let's get to breaking news overnight from Arizona, where numerous Trump allies are among 18 people indicted in an alleged election subversion scheme. The list includes the former president's chief of staff, Mark Meadows; and his former personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Trump himself also named as an unindicted coconspirator. The indictment includes nine counts, from conspiracy and forgery, to engaging in fraudulent schemes. At the core of those charges is this moment. It was captured on video and shared by the Arizona GOP in December of 2020. Take a look. It shows 11 members of the state's Republican Party signing a document to submit to Congress, falsely claiming that Trump won the election in Arizona. He did not. Joe Biden won Arizona by about 10,000 votes. Our panel's here: former federal prosecutor Elliot Williams; Ron Brownstein, senior editor at \"The Atlantic\"; former Trump administration communications director Mike Dubke; and Kate Bedingfield, former Biden administration communications director. Good morning to all of you. Elliot, let's just dig into this Arizona -- Arizona news because, of course, Donald Trump is an unindicted coconspirator here. But this is another example. We've seen it play out in a couple of other states, where they tried to send these fake electors to Washington. It really underscores to me the breadth of the scheme that was playing out around the election.",

You know, they're not national figures. But also people connected to the former president himself. And notably, not the former president, but still two former top aides who are as close to him as anybody else, right? Other states have chosen to do it differently, sort of only choosing to go after fake electors. Now again, some of that is based on individual state law. Some of that is conservatism or sort of aggressiveness on the part of prosecutors. It's just going to vary around the country.",
