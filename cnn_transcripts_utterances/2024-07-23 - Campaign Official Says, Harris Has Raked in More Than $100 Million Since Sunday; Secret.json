No small feat considering candidates typically spend months, right, battling for that, the entire point of the Democratic primary.Today, Harris headlines her first campaign rally since launching this campaign, and she's holding it in Milwaukee. Ahead of that, the endorsements keep rolling in. More than 40 Democratic senators, nearly 100 House members, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one senior Democratic aide calling it a coordinated drumbeat, the sound of the party uniting around the vice president. The work to find a running mate, with all of that in mind, is now full speed ahead. And CNN's Jeff Zeleny has some great reporting that the Harris campaign has asked Senator Mark Kelly, Governors Josh Shapiro and Roy Cooper to submit financial documents and family information as part of the vetting process. CNN's Arlette Saenz is in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, for us. Arlette, talk to us first about what we could see, what we could hear from the vice president this afternoon.",

Thank you so much for joining us this morning.You just heard the report there, $100 million she has raised, good morning, since Sunday, momentum is important. And Trump frankly has had momentum and excitement for months now. Are you feeling a shift in how the party, your party, is feeling after Joe Biden got out of the race and Kamala Harris stepped in? REP. LUCY MCBATH (D-GA):  Absolutely, as we just heard, over $100 million. And she's already begun to give us her vision going forward for the country. The first time that I met Kamala Harris was before I ever even came to Congress. I was an activist actually fighting for justice and for so many other people that have been lost to gun violence around the country. And she encouraged me. She gave me a vision. She gave me strength and encouragement to be able to continue to fight to make impact for change. And she has been that kind of focused person ever since I've met her. She's had the ability to be able to be centered around making America as best as it can possibly be. And so I believe that she'll continue to execute that same kind of vision that is still the Biden-Harris vision for the United States, and I couldn't be more excited about her candidacy.",

      "sentences": "That is absolutely true, John. She is staying. She made that very clear in that hearing yesterday. She was absolutely grilled. She found very few allies in that room during a particularly contentious Capitol Hill hearing. And really, John, the problem here was that she was reluctant to give answers and the few answers she did give were not satisfactory.So, for example, there were a couple of things that we did learn. We did learn that as soon as law enforcement figured out that there was a suspicious person that the Secret Service said that there were teams that were sent out to interview that suspicious person who later turned out to be the shooter, what happened with those interviews? Were Secret Service agents or other law enforcement able to get anywhere near him or why they weren't able to contact him is a major question here. The other thing that we did learn was that the Secret Service was told between two and five times that there was a suspicious person. And what the director made clear was that about five minutes before the former president took the stage, it appears that his detail at least knew that they were, as she described it, working something at the former president's 3:00 position. So if the president's looking, you know, at 12:00, at his 3:00 position, they knew that law enforcement was working something. But the problem was that they were looking at that as a suspicious incident. It did not consider that a threat until really seconds before the gunfire erupted. So, there were very few details. Most of her answers, though, John, were extraordinarily vague. She was reluctant to give answers at times kicking things over to the FBI, other times saying things that you would expect were in her purview, for example, the timeline that she didn't have solid answers yet. And this is nine days after the shooting. So, for example, members of Congress really pressed her on the specifics of the timeline. And here's a little bit from that moment where she continued to give very vague answers on whether or not she had a definitive timeline yet. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE (R-GA):  Do you have a timeline at all from any of the day?",
