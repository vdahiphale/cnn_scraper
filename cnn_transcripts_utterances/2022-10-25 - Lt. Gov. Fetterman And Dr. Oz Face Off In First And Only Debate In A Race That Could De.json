      "sentences": "Good evening.We have two weeks ago to the 2022 Midterms, the race for control of Congress in key statewide offices across the country is still changing day by day. There is no better example than the contest for Pennsylvania's open Senate seat between Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman and Dr. Mehmet Oz, whose first and only debate just got underway in Harrisburg. A few hours ago, the Independent challenger, Everett Stern pulled out of the race, threw his support behind Lieutenant Governor Fetterman. Quoting from his tweet announcing the decision: \"I'm polling around three percent, which places democracy at risk.\" It's not clear what Pennsylvania voters will make of that notion, but it is certainly one more thing for them to consider along with what they see from the two main candidates tonight in a race that could decide control the Senate and perhaps Congress for the next two years. It is true, as well, that voters nationwide have more factors to weigh than in most midterms, not just the economy or all the other domestic and foreign challenges at the moment, but things never seen before like armed civilians in camouflage and tactical gear lurking at polling places in Arizona. The candidates saying they will only consider the outcome legitimate if they win. We'll have new reporting a bit later on the alleged voter intimidation as well as a conversation with a top Arizona Republican about the threat he sees to democracy. Also, the latest polling on the issues driving voters. We begin, however, tonight in Pennsylvania. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is in Harrisburg for us. You've spent a lot of time in Pennsylvania, you know, the candidates and their campaigns well. What do you expect tonight? What should people be looking for?",

      "sentences": "Well, Anderson, the debate has just gotten underway, as you said, and one of the things first and foremost is John Fetterman, the Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, making the case that he is fit to serve in the Senate. That of course is because he has been recovering from a stroke since May, that he actually suffered days before winning the primary.He has been building his speech back. He has been building his strength back. But tonight, he'll be referring to questions through closed captioning. So, that is being explained to the audience right now. Why he is able to sort of see the printed questions and Mehmet Oz's answers. Now, this is something that has been a big issue in this Senate campaign, but I'm told it will not be nearly as much of an issue tonight. The Oz campaign is trying to move beyond that, I am told, and talk about the differences in issues, particularly crime. Crime has emerged as a central issue in this Senate campaign, as we've seen it and others across the country, but particularly here in Pennsylvania because of Fetterman's role as the Lieutenant Governor on the Board of Pardons. So I'm told that Mehmet Oz has been studying for weeks, specific cases from the Board of Pardons to talk about at the debate this evening. On the other hand, the Fetterman campaign is trying to remind voters of Pennsylvania that Mehmet Oz won this primary by attaching himself to Donald Trump. He ran to the far right of his party. Ever since that primary in May, he has been trying to move back to the middle. He's been trying to talk about working with both sides. So the Fetterman campaign also believes they have an argument against calling him extreme, but Anderson, two weeks from tonight, this race will be settled. It may take some days after that to count all the votes. But the reason this race is so important is because it is currently held by a retiring Republican Senator, Pat Toomey. Democrats now believe that they really need this seat as they struggle in other races across the country like Nevada, Arizona, even Georgia; incumbents there are in tough races. So, this race truly has become a critical piece of the puzzle for Democrats trying to hold their majority and Republicans trying to win it -- Anderson.",

So, certainly that that could help Fetterman, but the reality is, his name is already on the ballot. So that could also create some confusion. People could still vote for him if they are turned off by both of these candidates. Important to point out, a half million Pennsylvania voters, more than that have already cast their ballots and more will do so every single day here. SO the strategist I have been speaking with do not really think this has much of an effect, but in a tight race, which Pennsylvania always has, of course, Anderson.",

If John Fetterman woods, the odds flip to 75 percent that Democrats win control of the Senate. There is not another Senate election in the country, which is as important as the Pennsylvania Senate race. If you tell me who wins the Pennsylvania Senate race, I have a very good idea who wins the control of the United States Senate. And right now as we've kind of been hinting at, it's too close to call and I think that's why Senate control overall, at least as far as analysts, such as myself are concerned is too close to call.",

He has been arguing that Oz is not even from Pennsylvania, that he doesn't understand Pennsylvania voters. And to some extent, that argument actually served him pretty well, up until this point. And so I do wonder, in some ways, regardless of what transpires at this debate tonight, how much are Pennsylvania voters going to give Fetterman the benefit of the doubt, not on the issues, but just on this idea that he is an unconventional figure, and he is someone who knows the State better than perhaps Oz does.",

And you maximize the number of people who have jobs. That is probably the difficulty of finding that balance is what worries me most for the U.S. economy. I also worry that I think we're at a period of increased financial vulnerability, relative to where we were some time ago. And as interest rates rise, Warren Buffett had a picturesque example, he said, when the tide goes out, you start to see who's wearing a bathing suit and who isn't. And something a little like that is happening in the financial sector, as we have the strains associated with higher interest rates.But there's no real alternative if we're going to avoid the kind of catastrophes we had in the 1970s that caused people to lose faith completely in government and ultimately led to the really very brutal recession of 1981 and 1982, where the unemployment rate crossed 10%.",

GAP and Foot Locker say they'll no longer sell his Yeezy merchandise after Adidas this morning terminated its partnership with him. Adidas finally ended its mega deal after coming under intense pressure to take action. The company's saying in a statement that it quote, does not tolerate anti-Semitism and any other sort of hate speech. Forbes meantime estimates the Adidas deal was worth $1.5 billion and says the last bit knocks West off their billionaires list.There's a bigger concern though, namely that his rhetoric is inspiring more public bigotry with a group demonstrating in support of his comments this past weekend above a Los Angeles freeway. And an anti- Defamation League saying that anti-Semitic incidents were at an all- time high last year. The group pointed that out in a letter to Adidas last week calling on the company to split with him. Joining me now the CEO and national director of the ADL, Jonathan Greenblatt. Jonathan, do you think that Kanye West being dropped by Adidas and other corporate partners is it enough? I mean, considering the type of comments he's made. Did it surprise you that Adidas took this long?",

A few weeks ago, Adidas announced that their partnership was quote, unquote, under review. But my reaction was day after day after day when he spouted the most vicious, vile, anti-Semitic threats, spouted conspiracy theories claiming that Zionist Jews and a Jewish underground media mafia were out to get him. For me, it was Adidas, what more do you need to review? I mean, the reality is, is that in this moment, as you said, when anti-Semitic incidents are at an all-time high, when Jewish people feel truly a level of danger, this kind of rhetoric from someone with his platform, someone with his global following is dangerous.That's why ADL launched our campaign last week, Run Away From Hate. You know, I spoke over the weekend to senior leadership at Adidas in Germany, we engage their institutional investors, we sent almost 20,000 e-mails to the company. We pulled in celebrities, and I was glad that finally, finally today, they made the decision they did.",

Adidas said we won't do business with bigots. And so did Balenciaga, Creative Artists, MRC. And as you said, GAP today, if you go to gap.com, and you look up their Yeezy product line, it's gone. Anderson, it's as if it never existed.And while we've talked on your show before, I mean, I'm someone who believes not in cancel culture, but in council culture, when someone with impunity, spouting anti-Semitism, there needs to be consequences.
