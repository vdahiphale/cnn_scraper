Now we are seeing Congress follow behind.And just this bill, which would repeal the Defense of Marriage Act from 1996. That bill when it was first enacted the Defense of Marriage Act which defined a marriage between a man and a woman, that had just 67 members in the House vote against it. Today, the vote was 258 in the affirmative, 169 opposed. That means 258 members voted to repeal the law, that a fraction of that opposed just a few decades ago. Now, among the votes, 39 Republicans voted in the affirmative. You mentioned Kevin McCarthy. He is the Republican leader, of course, and voted against this. I did ask him why he voted against it. He would not say and did not respond to the question. Democrat, however, are hailing this as a historic move. Now they plan to send this the president's desk and should be signed into law within the coming days.",

Look at that. $3.33 per gallon. Also on the economic front, jobless claims ticked up slightly. If you're the Fed, that could be a good thing. CNN's Matt Egan is here to sort through it all.

      "sentences": "Well, Ana, gas prices have been on a roller coaster ride this year.Look at this chart. It is wild. It's hard to imagine right now. But back in 2020, gas prices got to as low as $1.85 a gallon. That was because people weren't driving due to COVID. President Biden took office, under $2.50 a gallon. And Russia invades Ukraine, gas prices shot up. They peaked at a record 5.02 a gallon. The fear was Russia's supply was going to get knocked offline. Thankfully, that has not really happened. Oil continues to flow from Russia. So we've seen gas prices come down. Also because of recession concerns and because U.S. supply has increased, in part, because of record releases of emergency oil. So now we have a situation where gas prices are at 10-month low. Of course, very good news for consumers. The question is. what happens next? And on that front, the oil market got a bit of a scare today. The Keystone Pipeline got shut down due to an oil spill. Now, we know that federal regulators are on scene or on their way. They're investigating. Oil prices initially shot up. WTI got up to $75 a barrel. But look at this. It's come back down. And that shows that, for now, markets are more concerned about the health of the economy than this pipeline.",

We're getting some signs that may be happening.Initial claim, new people filing for jobless claims ticked up still at a pretty low level. This number that was getting attention from economists continuing claim, the number of people filing for unemployment, up by 62,000. Let me show you what this looks like on a chart. This is actually the highest level since February. This is a sign that, even though layoffs remain relatively low, it is taking people longer to get jobs. That is a sign that the jobs market is slowing down. And we know there's been a series of layoffs including AMC networks, Twitter, Amazon. And just today Blue Apron announcing major layoffs. So I do think that the jobs market is slowing down. But it's not slowing down enough to convince the Fed to stop slamming the brakes on the economy. So we are expecting more rate hikes from the fed and probably more signals that they have to do further rate hikes early next year -- Ana?",

This is a 24-hour work stoppage that's occurring at \"The New York Times.\" And something like this hasn't occurred really in decades. Management says that they're disappointed that workers are walking out. Hundreds of workers, 11,000 workers signed this pledge to walk out. Management is disappointed because they don't believe they've reached an impasse and believe progress is still being made. But clearly the union felt the need to make a point to pressure management and so they're out here. I should note this work stoppage, it's supposed to stop after 24 hours.

So they want to talk to whoever was inside. Now, Ana, to give you context around where this House is located, it's off of a main street. It's on a very narrow road where cars are usually parked on both sides. And it leads to a dead end. So there's not a lot of through traffic, if any, in fact, it's pretty difficult to navigate and the cars that are parked in the area. They're all of the residents and the students, those University of Idaho students who walk to and from class. So if there was a car there that was out of place, would people have noticed it? Well, police aren't telling us that right now. All they're say something that they want to speak to whoever was inside that car, whether it be the driver or the occupants of this vehicle. Police are also asking for more information about the Sigma Chi party where Xana and Ethan were in attendance hours before the murder.
