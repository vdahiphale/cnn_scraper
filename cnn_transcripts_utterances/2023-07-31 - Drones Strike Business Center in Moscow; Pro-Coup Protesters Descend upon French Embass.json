Scores of people killed and that was claimed initially by the Pakistani Taliban which then denied responsibility for the attack. One of the deadliest suicide bombs in modern Pakistani history was back in 2018. It targeted another political party in Baluchistan province, and the Pakistani branch of ISIS claimed responsibility for that terrible attack. The Pakistani Prime Minister has denounced this act of violence and expressed his regrets.

The boats navigating the tight streets at times floating up to the front doors of homes to ferry stranded residents to safer ground. Officials say over the weekend more than 500,000 people have been evacuated from the region, where a powerful storm named Doksuri made landfall as a typhoon Friday after a battering the Philippines. It's since been downgraded. But officials are warning of torrential rain and hazardous flooding for any city in his path. And that includes Beijing, which has been doused with heavy showers that are expected to continue until Tuesday. Authorities have urged residents in the Chinese capital to stay indoors, and thousands of people have already been evacuated from areas with flood risks. Authorities say there could be potentially hazardous conditions like those seen in other parts of the country. In Eastern China security camera footage captured a man caught in rushing waters on a street. A bus driver stopped to help him as the breeze surrounds them. But the man is eventually dragged out of the water with the help of some people passing by. In the southern part of the country, some residents are taking stock of the damage and trying to salvage what they can from their waterlogged homes.

It's unclear if he's co-operating with the investigation. But sources say some of the new allegations against Trump were based at least in part on information Tavares provided. Trump facing additional charges for mishandling classified documents, maintained his innocence on social media, claiming his legal team voluntarily handed over the tapes to the Special Counsel and that he never told anybody to delete them.

I'm just not sure they're going to need to, because the inflation data is moving in the right direction. Now, of course, we have a long period of time, eight weeks for the Fed to really assess the inflation picture. But I do think there certainly is the potential for the Fed to hike rates, it could do that it's not afraid to do that. And certainly that could be something of a slight setback for the stock market. But again, in general, this should be a period of digestion, given the significant gains we've seen thus far this year. We do know that historically, once the Fed does stop hiking rates that tends to begin a period of positive stock market performance in the following year.

It's called Sustainable Aviation Fuel or SAF for short. LanzaJet meets this fuel using low carbon ethanol in a process called Alcohol to Jet or ATJ. This reduces the carbon footprint by more than 80 percent during its lifecycle. The fuel can be used by regular aircraft and can use existing refueling systems without modification.

One of the benefits that we have in using SAF as we pull out aromatics, which exist incrude oil based jet fuel, the aromatics that we pull out is what gives us some of the positive environmental performance. So there's a lot of work going on within the industry right now to actually approve these drop in fuels up to 100 percent. That is only a matter of time. But that's also why relationships and partnerships with the likes of Airbus and Boeing and the engine manufacturers are important to us, so that we can get to the point where we can use our fuel as 100 percent drop in fuel.",

If you think about what we're doing, we're disrupting a fossil fuel industrythat has been doing this work with fossil based jet fuel for 80 plus years. As you get new technologies off the ground as you get a new industry off the ground, as you build comfort with airlines, and with airports around the use of the fuel. There's a lot that needs to happen still. Policy does make a big difference. Here in the U.S. with the Inflation Reduction Act, it is probably one of the most monumental pieces of legislation to help get this industry off the ground. It is performance based, which means that if you do the right things from a sustainability perspective, if you have the right reduction in carbon intensity, you have a higher value in the incentive, very different in other parts of the world. Places like the European Union, they mostly have mandates. The Japanese government has recently announced that they intend to introduce a 10 percent mandate by 2030. So you have a wide range of policies that are falling into place, but absolutely critical in these early stages to help us get the industry off the ground.",

You can correct me though, if it's wrong of all the projects that you're talking about around the world. And I know it includes North America, Europe and Asia, around a billion gallons of SAF could potentially be produced. I use the stat in the introduction 95 billion gallons consumed in 2019 scale. Jimmy, how do we scale this up efficiently?",

It is actually the world's first alcohol to jet facility. This is a small plant in comparison to what's needed to be done. But it is the requisite first step as we commercialize our technology. There are many pathways ASTM, the body that I mentioned earlier, has approved seven pathways to date. You have technology that's been deployed globally that uses animal fats, oils, and greases. And it's a technology that is more accustomed to the traditional refinery environment, if you will. But that's only a pathway, ours is another pathway. We need all of these pathways to succeed on a global basis in order for us to truly make the impact that that we need to have. The United States has a goal of 3 billion gallons by the year 2030. We've committed to the White House and the administration that we can do, one billion gallons of that. But you're right 100 billion gallon target on a global basis with 2019 gallons is a pretty substantial gap. So it does require all solutions on the table.",

You know, it's,it works today, it's going to work well into the future. And as we transition into the future, we can make ethanol from other waste sources, things like municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, things that are second generation, as we call them, not just using first generation energy crops. So for us, there's a very long and bright sort of history ahead of evolving the supply chains involving the feedstock to continue to improve the carbon intensity of the fuels that we produce.",
