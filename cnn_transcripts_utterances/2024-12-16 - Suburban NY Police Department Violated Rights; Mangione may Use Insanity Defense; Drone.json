      "sentences": "The Justice Department had scathing findings into the police force of Mount Vernon, New York, because of the amount of strip searches they were doing for no reason, illegally. So, what the Justice Department found in a report after looking into this police department, for three years investigating them, that's something that the Justice Department does often, they found that the police force was depriving people of rights when they were strip searching regularly and detaining people without probable cause, doing body cavity searches.One of the examples of what happened that the Justice Department reported on was that two women, ages 65 and 75, one of whom was handing her husband a $5 bill to buy a lottery ticket, the police officers stopped them and believed that they were buying drugs, or said they must be buying drugs, searched them and their cars, found nothing, and then brought them into the police station and did strip searches. At one point told one of the women to bend over and cough. This ultimately was a situation where the detectives were lying about the pair buying drugs, and it was a regular practice in this police force to do strip searches like this. That is not supposed to be done. So since then, since 2022, when this practice was being curtailed, and the Justice Department still was looking at them, it did appear possible that they weren't completely ending this practice of strip searching in Mount Vernon, New York. But the police department did revise its policies, offer its officers training, and was working with the city on getting officers body worn cameras for when they were out in the field. The mayor of Mount Vernon, New York, says, \"we wholeheartedly support our good officers and, at the same time, will not tolerate and will punish unconstitutional policing.\" But it was the Biden Justice Department that brought this to light in a new report. And that the community is now responding to. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Luigi Mangione is currently in a Pennsylvania state prison, and over the weekend hired a high-profile defense attorney to represent him in New York. Before taking on Mangione's case, the attorney, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, was a CNN legal analyst. She suggest - and she has suggested Mangione could claim insanity as a defense strategy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO, FORMER MANHATTAN CHIEF ASSISTANT D.A.: It looks to me like this - there might be a not guilty by reason of insanity defense that they're going to be thinking about, because the evidence is going to be so overwhelming that he did what he did. And I hear what you're saying about being radicalized. I hear what you guys are saying. But as a former prosecutor in that office, I would be concerned that you have someone who was a valedictorian of his class, he was brilliant his whole life, he comes from this great family.

[09:35:07] And that's why they were fighting the extradition. And this new attorney, I think, is thinking, why even bother? Why waste our energy on that? But I think the thought that you're going to use insanity defense against this person is - is - is flawed as trying to say he didn't do it, because the insanity defense relies on the person not knowing that what they were doing is wrong. And so, covering their face, running from the scene, hiding themselves using fake ID is all evidence of what a sane person would do, knowing that what they did was wrong.",

This is coming from the Center for Internet Security. And it was a new threat assessment that they put out. And the way they put it is that the health care industry highly likely to face ongoing increased threat landscape, including targeted acts of violence, but also saying that the risk extends to non-health care sector executives as well. With the way they see it as so much support for the shooters actions that they're seeing online, they see it as a start of a movement against corporate America as a whole is kind of the threat that they see.How great do you see the risk is of copycats after this?",

There are issue based terrorists, the anti-nuclear terrorists, the green terrorists, the - the animal rights groups. They do terrorist acts that usually are not - that usually do not rise to this level. But in the 70s we had the Students for the Democratic Society in the United States. We had Baader-Meinhof in Germany and Red Brigade in Italy, and they were assassinating corporate leadership. And it was part of a communist movement back then. But it could turn out to be part of a populist movement here where companies, beyond health services, like say you had a large chemical release of - that killed people, say you had a large oil spill, things like this. People like that might be emboldened to take action like that, like we saw Mangione take.And so, I think what the - what should be done right now is the FBI should actually be looking at this as a potential specific brand of domestic terrorism, because terrorism is something directed - violence directed to make changes in politics or - or society.

There are three of these apps, FlightRadar24, Plane Finder, and FlightAware that will give you a real-time picture of the aircraft that is flying above you. And it also includes helicopters and some drones.So, they have these maps where you can look at your live location and see the planes that are flying above you. It will also give you information like their altitude, their speed, their destination, what airline it is. And this works because most aircraft transmit this data called ADS-B data, which tells ground stations and other aircraft where they are. So, these apps collect that information. And actually two of these apps, Flight Radar and Plane Finder, will let you point your camera at the sky if you see a plane and it will tell you what that plane is. And it's pretty impressive. I tried it this morning. It is very gloomy here in New York, you can't really see the sky, but it still showed me a number of the planes that are in the area.",
