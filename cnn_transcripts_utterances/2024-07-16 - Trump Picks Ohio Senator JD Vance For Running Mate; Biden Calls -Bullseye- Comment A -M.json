And you're seeing here at this convention a real culmination of that, right, just how much he has made over the party.And he obviously -- he has shifted his rhetoric, he has embraced those views, and he has made a lot of inroads with Trump and Trump's family. We know he's close to his sons. And he's really seen as someone who, to your point, can take this message now to folks in really key states. I mean, more and more, it seems like this race is going to be won or lost in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. And he is a young, energetic messenger who can speak to white working-class voters in those states.",

I mean, as best as he possibly can. Look, if you didn't criticize Trump when he ran in 2015 and 2016, you're either probably a liar or were employed by him at the time. So there -- it's just that widespread. But I think to Catherine's point, the theory of the case -- I think you're exactly right. They wanted more help in the Sunbelt -- Arizona, Nevada. That's a Marco Rubio, that's a Tim Scott play -- maybe Burgum. They focused in on those Rustbelt states. I would also expect to hear a lot about Vance's military background, especially in his convention speech. He'd be the first Marine to ever be VP or president, and the only vet among the four presidential -- or vice-presidential nominees. And I think more than anything else, what stuck out to me throughout kind of this vice-presidential search, he's an extremely effective communicator. He's willing to go on CNN, NBC -- a lot of places where my party doesn't really want to go. And not only go on there but be able to get a message out. And I think that's really admirable.",

He went with JD Vance, someone who is basically a carbon copy politically in terms of positions and policy. He didn't go with somebody like Nikki Haley, who could have really united the party politically. Remember, in some of those late state primaries we still saw Nikki Haley pull in a large number of voters.

MEGHAN HAYS, DNC CONVENTION CONSULTANT, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF MESSAGE PLANNING (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, this is -- you're absolutely right. Trump picked him because it's the future of the party for him and it's his views going forward, so it could be 12 years of these sort of MAGA extreme views. So I do think that there's a lot to note there. I do think Democrats are eager to run against him because he is -- he does embody those extreme views, and I don't think that's where the swing voters are. I think that they're more in the middle. And I think that people are generally more in the middle. So it will be interesting to see how the Biden campaign and Democrats react to Vance's views here.",

He was trying to say that as many in his party have been urging him to do to try to focus on former President Trump. He acknowledged it was a mistake to use that kind of language, but he also seemed a little bit defensive there. I think it is worth noting as he tried to say later in the interview Donald Trump mocked Paul Pelosi, for example, after he was attacked inside his own home, as well as Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, who was the victim of a thankfully foiled kidnapping plot. You know, I think it's fairly clear where kind of on balance the rhetoric stands here. I think the challenge is that President Biden seemed to be having difficulty making that case, which is what Democrats are watching for as they try to weigh -- and our John King is reporting that while this conversation has kind of moved into private in the wake of the assassination attempt it is still going on about whether or not he should remain at the top of the ticket.",

There was a lot of defensiveness in this interview from Biden even when Lester Holt confronted him about the debate performance -- did he watch the debate. He kind of went on a little tangent and tried to throw it back on Lester, kind of clumsily, by talking about Trump and his performance, and his behavior. He still hasn't found kind of a steadiness in these interviews yet for how much he's doing them in the last -- in a week or so. And you're right.

He was Bill Clinton's pollster. He is widely respected inside the Democratic Party. And John King reported that he has been sending these memos near daily to Biden's inner circle to try to show them just how dramatic, in Greenberg's view, the collapse has been.

I spoke to a House Democrat last week before the assassination attempt who suggested to me that they wanted Biden to drop out of the race but said I don't want any movement to happen until after the Republican Convention. I want Americans and voters to be focused on what's going on in Milwaukee. I want them to see what they described as an extreme MAGA Republican agenda.
