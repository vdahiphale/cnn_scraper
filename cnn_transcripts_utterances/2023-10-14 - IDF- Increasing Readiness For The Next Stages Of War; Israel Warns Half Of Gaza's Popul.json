We're targeting Hamas operatives, their infrastructure, their leaders, their logistics, et cetera. Unfortunately, there are civilians in the battlefield.

And regarding what you asked, I think that more efforts can be made by the different international organizations, by the authorities in Gaza, by civil society in Gaza to evacuate people or those that are suffering and those that aren't able to evacuate by themselves. I'll tell you that on the reverse, on the mirror image in Israel, we have evacuated all of the communities around the Gaza Strip. And we did that within two days after the monstrous terror attack on -- a week ago, on Saturday. Why did we evacuate? Because civilians should be as far as possible from combat zones. Now, not everyone had the perfect way of traveling by themselves, but civil society organized itself, got together, and people found solutions, whether it's hotels or living with relatives or finding temporary housing. In war, horrible things happen, but those who want to live find solutions. And what we are offering the Palestinians is a better chance of survival.

And we're hearing from a local Palestinian official that as these people were getting close to the Rafah crossing, border crossing point, the Egyptian authorities dropped slabs of concrete there to stop them from doing so.And apparently, what the Egyptian government is trying to do there is trying to get assurances that there will be a way to send humanitarian aid into Gaza before they allow those Palestinians and other people and many foreigners among them to cross into their territory. And let me tell you, Julia, Israel had urged people in northern Gaza to evacuate on Friday, and we just heard the lieutenant colonel, what he said. They're still doing so. They're still urging people to leave. Gaza residents are caught between a rock and a hard place, Julia, as Hamas militants are stopping civilians from moving south in Gaza. And then the IDF says that anyone coming near the border will be shot. So Palestinians are trapped, they cannot cross into Israel. And Egypt has barricaded the gates at the Rafah border crossing, the only one leading into Egyptian territory. Egyptian officials, as I said, were trying to apparently bargain trying to make sure that nobody crossed before they got the word that yes, they can send aid to the north. And among the people trapped are many Palestinian-Americans and other foreigners who, according to a local Palestinian officials, are just sitting on the streets waiting for an opportunity to flee Gaza. And let me tell you also, Julia, that after airstrikes and shelling that have lasted for a week, Israel appears on the verge of taking the next step against Hamas. It will be very likely a ground incursion to hunt down Hamas militants hiding in Gaza on Saturday. And we have reported this before. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the troops at the front line near the Gaza border. He told soldiers that the next stage is coming. Julia?",

The last I spoke to my family in Gaza was probably a couple hours ago.

The order to evacuate is prompting an outcry from rights groups, a warning, too, that Salma Abdelaziz's report contains graphic and also disturbing images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is what running for your life looks like in Gaza. An ambulance with a young girl and wounded woman inside, rocked by explosions as they attempt to flee. It is unclear what happened to the pair, but they're among the tens of thousands of people on the move, after Israel's military called on nearly half of Gaza's population, some 1.1 million people, to get south in a matter of hours. But along the safe passages specified by the IDF, utter horror. You're looking at the carnage and chaos on Salah al-Din Street, one of the designated evacuation routes. In the aftermath of explosions, families killed amid their belongings. CNN has geolocated this video and four other clips from the horrifying scene. The U.N. calls Israel's evacuation advisory impossible and a violation of the rules of war. And Palestinian officials accused the IDF of bombing civilians even as they fled. Dozens of evacuees were killed or wounded by Israeli airstrikes, according to Hamas. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. The victims are flooding into Gaza's overwhelmed hospitals, and again, it's the youngest caught in the crossfire. Nearly half of Gaza's population is children. What did the children do to deserve this? This woman says. Did they fight you? Did they fire rockets? My niece and her whole family are dead. The only survivor is a two-year-old girl. The health care system is on the brink. A complete siege, making it impossible to get aid into the enclave. And already, there's a shortage of everything. Even space in the morgue. We're keeping the dead in ice cream trucks so the bodies don't rot, this doctor says. Gaza is in crisis. Gaza needs help. For those still able to move south, this is one of the neighborhoods families are expected to flee towards, Khan Yunis, where Israeli airstrikes have wreaked havoc. This is a genocide, not a war. It's genocide, this man says. And it's an attempt to force all Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip. Finding refuge is proving dangerous and deadly.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MELISSA BELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Far from the front lines of the Israel-Hamas war, many European Jews say they're not just feeling the pain of what's happening there, but also fearing the potential ramifications much closer to home. In France, at the Great Synagogue in Marseille, a prayer is held for the people of Israel. It's a fervent prayer after reports of anti-Semitic incidents in parts of Europe, after Hamas launched its assault on Israel more than a week ago and Israel's subsequent bombardment of Gaza. MARC MEIMOUN, WORSHIPPER (through translator): First of all, it's important to be present whenever the Jewish people are in danger. Unfortunately, we're used to this kind of gathering, this kind of prayer. We're tired of it all. Nevertheless, we have to respond in unity. BELL (voice-over): France is home to Europe's largest Jewish population, as well as the largest Muslim population in Western Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron has urged his citizens to remain united, though French police used water cannon and tear gas to break up a recent rally in support of the Palestinian people, which had been banned by French officials citing concerns about public order. But there are fears of further unrest in France. 10,000 police officers have been deployed to protect synagogues and Jewish schools. And on Friday, France raised its security alert to the highest level after a knife attack at a school, the French interior minister says, was linked to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. The U.K. is also stepping up security after reports of increased anti- Semitic incidents. The Community Security Trust, a British non-profit organization that monitors anti-Semitism, says the number of incidents reported to them in the past week has increased by more than 300 percent compared to the same period last year.

In addition, officials say a rapid reaction force capable of special operations is also making preparations.

And then once they've get to a point where they've exhausted that, then you can imagine the trigger to cross the line into Gaza will be tripped.

Can we therefore assume that once this ground offensive starts that then Hamas individuals weaponry becomes the priority versus hostages, even if they hope to still find them. BUCKNER It's exactly right, Julia. And it is unfortunate to say, but I do believe that is the reality. You're not going to hold up the crossing into Gaza forever. You can't. So they are on a tight timeline. There is an absolute surge of intelligence gathering going on right now. If you think of this as a light switch, that light switch around the world of intelligence gathering agencies and everything you can imagine and the humans, the human collection, that Israel is known for, if you will, all of those things are on steroids right now. Everyone is going to do everything they can. But, unfortunately, the clock will run out and they're going to have to go in sooner than later.

BUCKNER Yes. I think obviously, you're seeing is your previous guest from Houston who has family there. The movement to the south has been chaotic. It's very difficult. As she described, it is 2 million people in an incredibly small portion of terrain. The best you can do is go where the IDF is directing you to safe zone. Follow those instructions. Know that it's going to be incredibly crowded, incredibly confusing and that you have to find and navigate your way through and find the safest place you can. We do believe that Egypt in some capacity will offer safe patch passage. That has not occurred yet. Now, we don't know the criteria and I know there's a lot of political pressure on President Sisi right now. I -- we do believe there'll be some level of evacuation, cross border into Egypt. I do think it's going to be limited though. I don't believe Egypt is ready to take on 1 million refugees and stand up camps, even if the West was to support that financially. I don't think they're ready for that. So there is a good news, bad news story, and only Egypt can make that determination.",
