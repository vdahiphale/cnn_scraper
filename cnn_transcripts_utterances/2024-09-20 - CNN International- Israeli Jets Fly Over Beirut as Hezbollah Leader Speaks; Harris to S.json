What CNN has learned about Mark Robinson's internet posts. And Vice President Kamala Harris visits the battleground state of Michigan. Her thoughts on democracy from the event Oprah Winfrey hosted. And we begin in the Middle East, a region very much on edge as Israel shifts its focus to the Northern Front and the Leader of Hezbollah vows retaliation. Lebanon's National News Agency says Israel has launched more air strikes today that after -- that after the IDF carried out one of its heaviest bombardments on Lebanon in the past year, with the IDF saying it hit 100 Hezbollah rocket launchers inside of Lebanon on Thursday. Hezbollah Leader Hassan Nasrallah condemned the electronic device attacks in Lebanon this week, calling them massacres. And the IDF says dozens of rockets have been fired into Northern Israel from Lebanon today. The UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency meeting later on today to discuss the escalating situation. CNN's Ben Wedeman is joining me now from Beirut. Ben, good day to you.

We see one body being pushed over the edge of a building by Israeli soldiers that are on the roof of that building. A foot is caught in cables before a soldier dismantles those cables, and then you see the body falling. Now there's a second body you see as well, where one soldier takes the hands, another takes the feet, and the body is swung over the edge of the building. A third Palestinian body is then seen pushed over the edge by an Israeli soldiers' feet. Now, CNN has no way of knowing for sure that these men, of these individuals, were deceased, although they do appear motionless and lifeless. Now the Israeli military has commented, I want you to listen to the statement they have given. Quote, this is a serious incident that does not coincide with IDF values and the expectations from IDF soldiers. The incident is under review. Now, under international law, militaries are expected to treat the bodies of soldiers, of the enemy soldiers or enemy combatants with respect. They're also expected to return those bodies to the families. Now the Israeli military does have a history of confiscating bodies. We've certainly seen that in the past. And the Governor of Jenin says that four of those Palestinians killed, the bodies have been taken by the Israeli military. They say the other three that were killed, they will have funerals this Friday, taking place. Now, Israel has said that they are carrying out these operations, as they call them, in the occupied West Bank, because they are trying to root out Hamas and other militant groups that have been planning or directing attacks against Israel. And we have seen since October 7th of last year, some around 700 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank.

Other European Leaders have vowed to combat Germany's new border regime. This type of action is unacceptable from the Polish point of view, Poland's Prime Minister said, after all, I have no doubt that it is the internal political situation in Germany which is causing these steps to be implemented, and not our policy towards illegal immigration on our borders.

This is the storm system that churned across the Adriatic and into the Mediterranean. This is really interesting, too. The satellite loop, the area that was most impacted by flooding was Northeastern sections of Italy, just outside of Bologna. This is all driving in moisture from the Adriatic Sea right here. And we look closely at this and water temperatures here are above average, so there's some fuel for this storm to pick up the moisture and create the additional capacity, at least, to hold heavier rainfall, and certainly it unleashed that torrential rainfall in portions of Northeast Italy. So, here's Bologna. They received 115 millimeters in the past three days for the month of September, they averaged about 68 millimeters, so we're talking nearly double their monthly average. Very impressive rainfall totals in other locations, just south of Bologna. So, this was an impactful storm to say the least.

How do you -- you know -- what -- would give us a sense of how you understand that conflict?HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Yeah. Well, it's -- tragic. The attack last October 7th on Israel was outrageous, and they had a right to defend themselves, as I think anyone who understands what happened would agree. And I've also made it clear that Hamas is a terrorist organization. Israel does have that right to defend itself, but Israel has to abide in so far as possible by the -- you know the laws of war. And this conflict has been so intractable for several reasons. I think on the one hand, you have Hamas, especially under the leadership, the continuing leadership of Sinwar that has not wanted a ceasefire. I've tried to follow this very closely. They have been betting on a larger conflict. They thought they might trigger a larger conflict. The timing of their attack, I think it's fair to say, was meant to send a message to Saudi Arabia about the potential normalization. So, Hamas is not just continuing the war because they are on their back heel and they are worried about what will happen to them, the Hamas leadership and fighters, but because they are hoping to spark something bigger. And then Israel, which has been -- you know waging a ground invasion, in large measure because of these tunnels, which I was surprised by.

North Carolina is a crucial must win swing state in the presidential race. The last time a Democratic Candidate won the state, Barack Obama in 2008. But recent polling shows a tight contest now, with Kamala Harris at 49 percent to Donald Trump's 46 percent all within the margin of error. Will turmoil in the governor's race have any impact on the presidential vote in that state this after CNN is reporting of Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson's remarks on a pornographic website message board a decade ago.

This comes as the U.S. Justice Department tries to build an attempted assassination case against Ryan Routh, the man accused of lesser charges in that incident, mostly gun related. But they're trying to also make the correlation by building a case. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is joining us live from Washington, D.C. now. Katelyn, great to see you.

They are looking at their own folks, the people who protect federal officials, including the former president, current president, vice presidents, and they are saying that they need more money. Right now, their budget is $3 billion a year, and they have about 7000 employees. They're going to be adding some more employees, but they say it's not enough. They need more money for counter snipers, investigators, armored limousines, for motorcades, ballistic glass. They need to be training more agents. All of this is being detailed by the Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowey Jr., in an interview with \"The Washington Post\" just yesterday. But he is going to also be trying to make this case moving forward at a press conference and also to Congress. We also know that Congress is looking at potentially helping the Secret Service beef up how they protect presidents, vice presidents, looking at authorizing more there.
