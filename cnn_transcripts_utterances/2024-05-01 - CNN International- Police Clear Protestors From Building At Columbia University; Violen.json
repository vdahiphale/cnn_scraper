Let's go now to the University of Texas at Austin. A local county prosecutor says that law enforcement resources are, quote \"dwindling under the strain of the protests\". There are calls for the university to initiate a compromise with student protesters. This comes after nearly 80 people were arrested on campus Monday. We've almost had been hearing today from the Mayor of the City of New York, Eric Adams, who is walking a thin line on this, trying to show support for students' rights to protest, but also delivering a stern warning to what he calls external actors. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NYC, NY): Young people are being influenced by those who are professionals at radicalizing our children, and I'm not going to allow that to happen as the Mayor of the City of New York. So, the men and women of the New York City Police Department should be proud of yourself at the request of Columbia University, after speaking with them throughout the week, at their request and their acknowledgement that outside agitators were on their grounds, training and really co-opting this movement.

And then, it takes a turn as the negotiations with the college administration meet an impasse. They seized the building in the early morning hours of Monday. And there are a couple of security people and some maintenance staff inside who called 911 and saying we're being held hostage. The university negotiated, letting them go out of the building. But then, the students held the building, barricading the front with large refrigerators, vending machines, blocking doors with chairs and other furniture.So, the university said to the NYPD, we are at that line again, where we want you to come back on campus for the second time, not just to clear that lawn, the quad, but to take back this building. It's all offices, not dorms. It's not student housing. It's basically the administrative offices for Columbia University, and they had been locked out of it. So, the NYPD plan was about, what is everything we could possibly need? What do we need to breach the barricades they put in the doors? How do we come in from above? If we can enter through the second or third floor? Do we need cutting tools? And also, showing up with an overwhelming force on the theory that if you show up with several hundred or just under 1,000 police officers, you're probably not going to have to use much force, which was there gold going in, and they said so ahead of time.",

And then, they left, and then the students came back and a second camp was set up there.So, this is about, if you're going to take ground and leave, you're going to see the return of the issue you had before. If you're going to take ground, you have to hold that ground. And I think that's where they're going now by asking the NYPD to maintain a presence there through graduation and a couple of days after graduation to see if, can we actually keep this piece of land not have any other buildings seized, and if we start to see that, let's have immediate action and rapid deployment and solve that problem before it becomes a bigger deal that's going to require a lot more people and much more drama.",

Are we dealing with a couple of hundred people in a multi-storey building, or is it just a small core group? How many people are outside the building? That number was set at a couple of hundred. But then, last night, at five o'clock, you saw another 100 coming from the north, another 100 coming from the east, converging on the campus before police were there to remove them. So, they saw this growing.Their theory was two things. One, let's estimate what is the largest number of people we think we might have to deal with there. And two, let's bring more than enough police officers to deal with that crowd, but also to set a perimeter around it, so we don't have people joining in from our flanks. And three, to be able to place demonstrators outside the campus in sidewalk areas in pens where they can continue to protest while we take back this campus. They also had to bring every kind of piece of equipment you could think of, lawyers from the legal division to watch what was going on and to make sure that they stayed within the agreed parameters. Videographers from their technical response unit to make sure that they recorded what both sides were doing during this confrontation, the emergency service unit with bolt cutters, wire cutters, things to get through those chains and to move those heavy machines, vending machines and refrigerators out of the way and to break into rooms that had been locked with chains and bicycle locks. So, the idea was bring everything you have, and if you need it, it should be there. And if you don't need it, it's there anyway.",

Now, this was the scene, as police battled demonstrators. We're going to continue to follow this and of course bring you the very latest here. We want to now go to California. Things are much calmer at the moment there at the University of California at Los Angeles. This after violent clashes erupted between rival protest groups. A video shows that police barricades were being ripped away and in some cases even used as weapons. An editor for UCLA student newspaper tells CNN that she has heard reports that pipes, tasers and pepper spray were all used. She says it's not clear how things escalated. Fireworks also added to the chaos there. Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli demonstrators threw punches, shoved, kicked each other, even swinging sticks in a dangerous campus face-off.

This is his second time in Wisconsin just this month alone. And these are two states that he won in 2016. Joe Biden won them in 2020. And they are going to be critical again. And constantly, these polls that keep coming out just show a very tight race. We have our CNN poll of polls, which shows Donald Trump and Joe Biden are within the margin of error of each other nationally. That's been the case in most of these individual state polls as well.So, you can expect Donald Trump and Joe Biden to be spending a lot of time in Wisconsin and Michigan over the coming months. We'll be watching closely tonight and over the next few hours to see how Donald Trump balances this trial and in trail presidential campaign. How does he talk about the case itself, given what happened yesterday in the hush money trial, where a judge ordered him to pay a $9,000 fine for violating the gag order? Will he violate it again?

Steve, thank you.And one of the most divisive issues in the country right now could be a major factor at the ballot box come November. New CNN polling shows that nearly half of Americans want to see federal politicians protect access to abortion nationwide, and nearly a quarter of Americans say they will only support a candidate who shares their view on abortion. Also, a majority of voters are unhappy with President Biden's handling of abortion policy. Hoping to raise that number, the Vice President, Kamala Harris, is heading to Jacksonville, Florida. That's where today a ban on abortion after six weeks goes into effect. Now, in her remarks, Harris is expected to blame Donald Trump for that band and call it a quote \"Trump abortion ban\".

Now, Florida has been an important access point for abortion, not just for people living in this state, but really across the south. There were about 7,000 abortions done in Florida every month in 2023. That's about one in 12 of abortions nationwide, and one in three in the south.We spoke yesterday with a patient here at this clinic, who is here for a medication abortion.

Now, the closest states for access will be North Carolina, which has a 12-week ban but also a 72-hour waiting period, which makes that difficult for many patients. And beyond that, Virginia, beyond 12 weeks.Of course, this is not the end of this story here in Florida. There is going to be a ballot initiative in November for voters to vote on abortion access in Florida, and we are seeing this morning really playing out in front of this clinic here are, a handful of anti- abortion protesters as well as escorts who are here at the clinic to help patients get inside.

Wade, the reality is whenever this issue is on the ballot in states, the pro-abortion crowd has won. And what he is saying here is that, look, the effort by the pro-life community for the past 50 years was to take this difficult decision out of the hands of nine unelected justices, and put it in the hands of the states. Now, it's in the hands of the states.And the current law that is going into effect in Florida was passed as the will of the elected officials of the people of Florida. And if the sentiment has changed and the idea and the concerns about abortion have changed, they have the opportunity to go to the ballot in November and vote on this issue. And I think Republicans would be better served, having a more nuanced position on this and talking about abortion limits, and not abortion bans, and making sure we educate people that laws, like the one in Florida, do have exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother, and that's an important component of this very emotional issue.",

This decision should be a no one's hands, except the hands of the woman who needs the abortion for her reproductive health, who needs the abortion perhaps to live, who needs the abortion perhaps in order to keep her reproductive health intact, who needs the abortion because she wants it. This is about bodily autonomy. This is about rights and freedoms. This is about one party wanting to take away a right and a freedom that women used to enjoy before Roe v. Wade, and the vast majority of women, who is the largest electorate in this country, saying, no, we do not want to grow up. We don't want to live in a country where our daughters will grow up with less rights than we did.

And just hours ago, Marjorie Taylor Greene announced that she was going to be -- she plans to call for vote to oust the Speaker Mike Johnson. Is this a mistake?

But, what President Biden needs to continue to do is to say two foundational things. The first one is, is that we are a country that is based on the law, and part of that law is allowing peaceful protests, underscore peaceful. So, he is saying that allowing the people who are wanting to have their voice heard on the huge, huge sentimental emotional issue about what's going on with Palestinians in the war against Israel. And he continues to do that, continues to listen to that important commentary.On the other side, he is absolutely disavowing violence, hatred, antisemitism, any kind of language that causes that. And I think the contrast with those two things, Rahel, with Donald Trump is an important one. Donald Trump, who has already said he wants to bring in the National Guard. We know how he would treat protesters, bashing their heads in, and at the same time, he is the only one of the two who has supported white supremacists, who has not only not disavowed hatred, the kind of language that white supremacists talk about, but he has encouraged it. He has encouraged it to the point where we saw on January 6, Capitol -- the Capitol rioters come in, attack the Capitol, killed police, and want to overturn a fair and free election at Donald Trump's bidding. So, I think that contrast, Rahel, is an important one to keep in mind, as we move forward with those two very critical issues that frankly are not just foundational in the country, but are foundational for our democracy.",

The Turkish Foreign Minister made the announcement, saying that his country will join the case at the International Court of Justice in The Hague. In January, the court ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent genocide in Gaza after South Africa accused Israel of violating international laws. World Central Kitchen has now resumed operations in Gaza after seven of its workers there were killed by an Israeli airstrike about four weeks ago. The kitchen said that it served 200,000 meals to Palestinians on Tuesday, and trucks are preparing to enter Rafah with enough food for eight million meals. And improved humanitarian aid to Gaza was one of the topics discussed in a meeting Wednesday between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They also talked about ongoing efforts to reach an immediate ceasefire as part of a hostage release deal. A statement by the U.S. said that Secretary Blinken emphasized that Hamas is standing in the way of any ceasefire agreement. Let's go to CNN's Paula Hancocks, who joins us from Abu Dhabi. Paula, give us a sense of where things stand in terms of a deal. We heard Netanyahu say that with or without a deal an operation into Rafah is likely. Where do things stand right now?",

He has said that he thinks that this could be done in the coming days. But, he has put the onus on Hamas. He has said that the proposal on the table at this point is extraordinarily generous by Israel, and that it is up to Hamas now to show that they want this to happen.Now, we are waiting for a response from Yahya Sinwar, who is the leader in Hamas. We've heard from another senior leader who has said that Israel will not achieve through negotiation and pressure what it hasn't been able to achieve in these months through war. So, not rejecting the deal on the table, but implying that Hamas may not be ready to accept this deal at this point. But, we are waiting for the official response through the Egyptian and the Qatari negotiators. Now, the effective deal is up to 33 hostages would be released in return for several weeks of ceasefire in Gaza. There would be Palestinian prisoners released as part of that as well. And then that would be the first stage in the hope that the second stage would see a more substantial ceasefire, and then further hostages and Palestinian prisoners being released. The U.S. officials pointing out that there has been some movement from Israel, for example. Hamas had insisted they wanted all displaced Palestinians to be able to move unrestricted, unmonitored to northern Gaza, and Israel apparently has agreed that it will allow that movement back to northern Gaza at this point. So, there does appear to be some progress, certainly more than what we have seen in recent weeks. But, of course, we have been in this position before. There have been very optimistic words issued by the Biden administration, only to be unrealized in the end. Rahel.",

OK.PLEITGEN (voice-over): While the Iranians acknowledged using Shaheds against Israel, the U.S. and Ukraine accused Iran of also giving hundreds of these drones to Russia, Moscow, using them to attack Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure. The Iranians continue to deny those accusations. The general tells me that Shaheds attack in swarms often fired off secretly from unmarked trucks like this one. Everything is pre-programmed, he says. The flight route is chosen according to the enemy's capabilities and blind spots of radars and all the elements that can help us reach the target. Well, tensions between Iran and Israel have somewhat eased after they traded direct military blows for the first time. The general warns Iran has even more modern weapons at its disposal. The only path for them is to have logical and wise negotiations with us, he says. In our defense capabilities, we don't depend on anyone. We've had good progress in this field and we will progress more. There are achievements that have not yet been talked about. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Tehran. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This comes after violent clashes erupted between rival groups overnight. A student newspaper editor said that there were reports of tasers, pipes and pepper spray being used in the brawls. Let's bring in CNN Security Correspondent Josh Campbell, who joins us now. Josh, we talked to Stephanie Elam a short time ago, who was also on campus, and she talked to us a little bit about the conversations and the questions this morning about where were police at the time. Give us a sense based on your conversations and your reporting what you're hearing.",

That is actually the major question right now, as this kicked off, these skirmishes between the protesters who are inside this encampment, and as you mentioned, some of the counter demonstrators who came. We saw violence. We saw clashes. We saw items being thrown. It looked like chemical irritants being sprayed at one point. But, as a local student paper notes that it was a quite a bit of time that passed before we actually saw the police. Now, you can see right here, as we walk over, there are law enforcement officers that are still here. This is multiple agencies. You have the California Highway Patrol. You have the Sheriff's Department. You have obviously local police.And Rahel, it's worth noting that for law enforcement, this is somewhat of a precarious situation, because as we've covered so many of these protests, we've heard protestors saying we want law enforcement to go away. But, of course, when something bad happens, who do people call? They call the police. And so, they're walking really a fine line and trying to calibrate whether their own presence can actually escalate things. But, as we saw last night, there was certainly violence here. Today, much different, a much quieter scene, and dozens and dozens of police officers here on site, Rahel.",

Now, economists expect largely that the Fed will keep rates steady yet again at this meeting. But, they're also looking for hints on the future. Inflation remains an issue, and recent data suggests that it may take extra time to get to the Fed's desired two percent inflation rate.Joining us now is the Chief Economist from KPMG, Diane Swonk. Diane, great to see you. Let me ask, we are in this holding pattern. We continue to be in this holding pattern with the Fed. We do not expect rate cuts today. What are you listening for?",

      "sentences": "Well, what we're going to be watching for is the statement. There is one part of the statement that says the Fed is sort of being cautious on when it's going to reduce rates, and whether or not they strike that and say change, because there is no doubt within the debate today, they're going to be talking about the potential, not that it's eventuality, but the potential for rate hikes as well as rate cuts. And I think in order to get a unanimous vote on that statement, they're going to have to change that part of the line. And that seems really parsing the words, but it's a much more hawkish tone from the Fed. The Fed thought that the rate cuts were imminent, and they've had to keep backing that out.We now don't think they'll be able to cut until December, if at all this year, and much of the rate hikes that were in the pipeline, still have some lags on them. So, that gives them some cushion, but they need financial markets to cooperate as well. Part of the reason we saw the acceleration in inflation we did is that financial markets front run the Fed on rate cuts in late 2023 and early 2024, and that actually juiced the economy and sort of added fuel to, where are the coolly (ph) numbers of inflation?",

The good news is the threshold to hike rates is much higher than the threshold to cut rates, because the Fed has that sort of ability to hopefully manage expectations in financial markets and get them, helping them to cool off the economy. The goal is to cool the economy without sending it into a deep freeze. And we've made an enormous amount of progress on inflation.But, what the Fed has got to be concerned about at this meeting today is that the dispersion of things that were going up in price picked up again. The number of things going up in price picked up again, after falling quite dramatically at the end of last year and early this year. And that's something -- it's no longer just whack a mole. One thing here one thing there. That more broad-based acceleration in inflation, particularly in the service sector, which can be more dependent on compensation games, which also accelerated in the first quarter. Those are things they're going to be worried about.",

Diane, let me ask you lastly, are you concerned at all -- I know, you look under the hood really closely, and you and I have talked for years now about how inflation disproportionately impacts those who are at the lower income spectrums. Are you concerned that when we look at the data, when we talk about the data, it's a broad picture, but that there may be those at the bottom of the spectrum who are not spending freely that are really suffering? Because when you look at the data sort of broadly even in terms of the labor market, in terms of consumer, things seem to be humming along.

And that is that food service and accommodation workers, they've seen a sharp deceleration in wages again, and the little bit that they regain, they're losing again. They're now seeing their wages go up slower than inflation. These are the workers that were hit hardest by initial pandemic layoffs. And I think that's important because they also tend to hit women harder with a high school degree or less, particularly women of color. These are people who are not only struggling with the already high level of prices for everything, from shelter to getting to and from work with insurance costs and vehicle costs and the cost of food, but they also have to deal with childcare.And what we're seeing is more and more people unable to work in any given month because of the childcare crisis we have in this country as well. And so, all of those things, these are workers that had their moment in the Sun, where their wages were leveled up, coming out of the Pandemic, only to find out after they're in the shadows as non- essential becoming essential workers to all of a sudden be burned by inflation. And that is one of the reasons why it's so critical for the Fed to derail this inflation because it hits those people the most.",
