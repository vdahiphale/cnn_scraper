Tonight, the U.K.'s new Prime Minister, RishiSunak sets up his cabinet and gets down to business to try to tackle what he calls, a profound economic crisis. Then Russia doubles down on its baseless claim that Ukraine will deploy a dirty bomb. What that tells us about Vladimir Putin's strategy. And then later, Adidas drops the artist formally known as Kanye West. The controversial rapper has finally gone too far. But first, tonight, Rishi Sunak, Britain's new prime minister says he'll begin working immediately to provide economic stability for the British people. Sunak was officially appointed earlier, as you can see there, on Tuesday by King Charles III, just after Liz Truss tended her resignation. Mr. Sunak is the U.K.'s third prime minister in just seven weeks, and he faces a truly daunting task ahead, as well as criticism from opposition members, who say the Conservative Party is in such disarray it's lost its mandate to lead. Max Foster tells us more about the man who is now in that hot seat. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

There's the right of the party who want stronger action on immigration, and other issues, and the appointment of or reappointment of someone like Suella Braverman who is from that group, I think is quite telling as well. And I think there were some reappointment. Jeremy Hunt; the chancellor, other familiar faces were experienced with the premier, people who have done this before in many departments.

Which I think is very worthy and noble, but it will be very difficult choices he has to make. And there's a big difference between being a chancellor in the pandemic, where you have to rightly spend a lot of money and intervene to safeguard jobs and businesses and what we see going forward, because of the dire economic situation in the U.K. were challenging decisions and unpopular decisions will have to be made. And I think part of the cabinet makeup reflects that, because you appoint your cabinet when you want to bind people into those decisions, not just have them sniping and (INAUDIBLE) to you from the back benches. So, there will be collective decisions and he will have to walk a political tightrope, because there will still be different parts of the party you are looking for different things, more investment in a certain sector of the economy, more defense spending, less intervention all the way. So, the issues haven't really changed just because the prime minister has changed, and the economic situation hasn't changed either. But we do have somebody who, I think, understands it better.

We know that Putin is also, internally in Russia, telling officials that they're not working fast enough to produce enough military equipment. And essentially, they're not working hard and fast enough to fight this war. He is losing this war currently, and it's interesting that this past weekend, his defense chief, the Ministry of Defense and the Military Chiefs of Staff had a number of phone calls for the first time in months with their opposite numbers in Washington and London and Paris, and also in Ankara.

Reduced just slightly because they are considering the time spent pretrial for Brittney Griner here, but it is still an incredibly long prison sentence. And she spoke at that court hearing today, but not from the courtroom itself. From behind bars, from the Russian prison cell that she is in. And one of the things she said, we've heard her say this in the past, is that she does admit fault. She does say that she brought this cannabis into the country, though, she says it was a mistake. She does say that she's guilty here, and she asked them for some leniency because she's saying that she's guilty, and she didn't mean to effectively do this. But there was no leniency to be found. What we are now turning to, of course, is the diplomacy. What the Biden administration can do with U.S. and Russian officials to try and secure some sort of deal, perhaps, of course, a prisoner   swap to get Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan, who is another American wrongfully detained in Russia, back home. And what we know is that, there has been a pretty regular, fairly consistent back and forth between U.S. and Russian officials on this topic. But the problem has been, when you talk to U.S. officials, it's not that Russia isn't responding, it's that when they do respond, they are demanding something that the United States just can't provide.

The familiar rallying cry of women, life, freedom, followed by some calling for the spokesperson to, quote, \"get lost\", forcing him to abandon his talk ahead of schedule. And in the holy city of Korom, another forced(ph) -- the reception for the government official. Their message, we do not want a murderous guest at our university. But the movement has also spread to the countries high schools. Young girls seen here, bravely defying the regime's strict dress code. Some even joining the call for a regime change. But just as protests continue to gain momentum, so does the regime's brutal crackdown. College students in Hamedan seen here mourning the death of their classmate, Naki Abdul Maliki(ph). According to human rights group Hengaw, the 21-year old was killed by Iran's security forces during a protest. Hengaw alleges she was beaten by a baton, sustaining injuries to her head and skull. Though Iran's semi official Fars news agency denies those reports. Another name, another life added to the growing list of those who've been hailed as martyrs, each death only galvanizing the country's youth in their growing fight for change -- Nada Bashir, CNN, London.

Especially because, they say it took down one of the leaders. They called him of the leader but he's one of the leaders of this new Lions Den militant organization, describing it as a precise and deadly blow and saying that this group, which has mostly been targeting so far security forces and settlers in the West Bank, that they were starting to plan an attack in Tel Aviv, in Israel proper. Prime minister, Israeli prime minister, Yair Lapid, today vowing to inflict severe and lasting damage on terrorism and its agents in Jenin and Nablus, which has been the militant hot spot. And he says anywhere else where terrorists' nests grow. Keep in mind, Isa, that we are just days away from the fifth Israeli elections in less than four years, where Jair Lapid would like to remain on as prime minister.",

Look, I mean, we've been feeling for weeks now, we've been talking aboutthese daily raids, how it's been the deadliest year since at least 2015. I mean this raid was the deadliest day in the West Bank for Palestinians so far this year. And I think the question is, right now, it feels as though all of this region is just a bunch of dry, really dry kindling. It's just going to take one match that will completely set this entire place ablaze to the point where we are hearing more and more people talk about sort of a Third Intifada The question is, what will be that match? You know, people have backed the Second Intifada. They say it was Ariel Sharon going to the Temple Mount, to the Al Aqsa mosque  compound, that was the spark. You know, it's always hindsight is 2020. So right now it feels as though everyone's very jumpy, trying to see, what will be the spark? Will it be an attack? Will it be a raid, like this? Will it be a political stunt like what we saw before, that will be the spark that will set this off? What's really concerning about all of this, Isa, is that it really doesn't feel like there is the political will or motivation anywhere on the Israeli side. They've got elections coming. On the Palestinian side, they have an aging and increasingly unpopular leadership in the Palestinian Authority or even on the international front. The Americans and anywhere else, everyone seems to be so focused elsewhere that nobody seems to be focusing on the very, very dry kindling here that needs to have some water to tamp it down, so it doesn't set ablaze when that match is struck.",

Sportswear companyAdidas and prominent teller agency Creative Artists are the latest to cut ties with the rapper. Fashion designer Balenciaga and Vogue publicly cut ties, if you remember, last week. Not only has West refused to apologize for the comments, he's also doubled down on them in recent interviews. CNN's Chloe Melas joins us now from New York. Chloe, great to have you on the show. Really the question is, Chloe, why did it take Adidas so long in the first place?",

I believe that Adidas had a partnership with Kanye for the past seven years. And they just said that this is going to cost them over $2 million in lost -- $200 million in lost revenue alone, just in the interim right now, not to mention how much money is going to cost them in the long term. Now you might say, well, why does it matter that they're looking at their bottom line? They're a massive company, so obviously it took them a moment to probably look through. They have a very complicated contract with Kanye. The bottom line is that they did cut ties with him and they are following suit with a long list of companies that are, including CAA, Creative Arts Agency, which are his Hollywood heavyweight agents. Gap, saying that they are going to remove all of their clothing, all of their collaboration that's currently out on shelves in stores now. They are removing it. And then Balenciaga. And he's deplatformed on Instagram, Twitter, social media, so all of this that he's built for, you know, decades, crumbling apart. And yet silence from Kanye. We've heard nothing, no type of, you know, regret, no statement, no apology yet. What could he really say? The damage has been done.",

Now without that, Forbes is saying he's worth $400 million, right? So that alone, that's a big knock to his ego because being able to say you are a billionaire in Hollywood, his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian is. And that was a big stamp for him that he used to talk about all the time. So now being worth $400 million, still a lot of money. A lot of people are asking about his music. Should you listen to his music? Should platforms like Spotify remove his music? And that's turning out to be very controversial because some people are saying, well, there are murders, there are convicts, there are people who have been accused and some convicted, where we listen to their music. R. Kelly, you know; Michael Jackson, you know, people who are controversial in the music industry. So it'll be interesting to see if Spotify, if these extreme mainstream platforms do anything, say anything. But as far as I'm aware, when it comes to Spotify, unless the music itself is inciting violence and hate but not really the individual themselves, potentially they would just do nothing.
