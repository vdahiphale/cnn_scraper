This was like, you know, one of the most outrageous things to ever happen in the history of the country and we're just now getting to a target letter? That's where we are? We're at a target letter? We still don't have been a indictment on - on the insurrection and all the bad stuff that happened before and after. So, I think, yes, we are finally, finally getting, I think, as I said before, to the stuff that was the most offensive to most Americans.I also think that Trump, I - when you listen to him, I think he's making a certain bet. We all - we keep saying, you know, this is not going to play in a general election, it's not going to play in a general election. You know, I don't know because I'm not seeing the numbers change very much with indictment after indictment. We'll see if this one makes a difference. But I think he might be playing a different game here. He might be thinking of himself as an anti-hero that can rail -- in an age of anti-heroes. And so, I'm not sure.

We're not even allowed to shoot this side. That's where the military vehicles have been passing by.But there are tour groups that are allowed. They get special clearance. And we have video of this place because, well, pretty recently President Trump -- former President Trump was there. This is the spot where President Trump actually walked across the military demarcation line with Kim Jong-un, officially becoming the first sitting American president on North Korean soil. So, even though we haven't seen security video to see what Travis King, the Army private, actually -- now how he closed, very likely he probably took a very similar path to the former president.",

      "sentences": "This issue gets into the state of the race because some of your supporters are disappointed that your campaign has yet to catch fire the way they would want in terms of polling. One Republican pollster, one who is sympathetic to you, I was asking her about your campaign, and she said she thought the issue was, you bumped up at the beginning because voters, Republican voters, saw you as a more electable conservative like Trump. Like you -- Trump without the baggage. But then they say, as you go further and further to the right on some of these divisive social issues that could alienate moderates, suburban moms, et cetera, Republican voters see you as less and less electable. What do you say to that analysis?GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL) 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, I don't think it's true. I mean the proof is in the pudding. I mean I took a state that had been a one point state and we won it by 20 percentage points, 1.5 million votes. Our bread and butter were people like suburban moms. We're leading a big movement for parents 'rights, to have the parents be involved in education, school choice, get the indoctrination out of schools. And, of course, there's bread and butter issues that matter too. Inflation. More economic opportunity. Florida's economy is ranked number one of all 50 states. We've worked hard to make that happen. Crime. You see crime in all these different communities that is now even going into suburbs and some areas. So, I think there's a lot of things. I don't think that's the reason. I think the reason is, is I was getting a lot of media attention at the time coming off the victory. I had to do my job as governor with my legislative session. And we had a great live session. We did a lot of great things. Actually things that appeal to huge majorities of the - of the population. So, I think that that analysis is wrong. But I had to do that. And so I was basically taking fire really non- stop since then because a lot of people view me as a threat. I think the left views me as a threat because they think I'll beat Biden and actually deliver on all this stuff. And then, of course, people that have their allegiances with the - allegiances in the Republican side, you know, have gone after me. But the reality is, this is a state-by-state process. I'm not running a campaign to try to juice, you know, whatever we are in the national polls. I mean I -- whatever we did in the CNN compared, whatever, it's fine. I'm definitely doing better than everybody else.",

You should definitely check that out.But, Jake, when it comes to this interview yesterday, this was a big deal. This was a significant shift it seemed like from at least the media strategy of the DeSantis campaign, in part because of what you were talking about in your questions. They needed a reset. That there's trouble in the campaign. Did you get the sense that they're in the midst of a reset when you spoke to the governor?",

I don't know that. But the timing suggests that that's true.Obviously, we at CNN have been pushing to get an interview with Governor DeSantis, as we've been pushing to get an interview with all the major candidates for months if not - if not years. But on its face it does seem to suggest he needs to -- that his campaign recognizes he needs to at least expand the audience of people he's talking to. There are Iowa caucus voters who watch CNN, who watch \"THE LEAD,\" Republicans. And they're -- it's not just die-hard Trump supporters who watch Fox or Newsmax. So, I think you have a point there. Beyond that, I mean, he is not where he would like to be in the polls right now, although he's in second place. He's certainly in a better position than anyone else not named Donald Trump. So there constantly has to be, I think if you're running the campaign, the DeSantis campaign, a reassessing of priorities. We should note, in all of these discussions about the state of his campaign, one of the most important points is his super PAC is sitting on an absolute pile of money. So, the pro-DeSantis super PAC still has time to blanket the airwaves in Iowa, in North Carolina - I'm -- South Carolina, in possibly New Hampshire, to get his message out. And we still have until January 15th before any votes are cast.",

But, you know, the -- both Donald Trump and all of his competitors are in many ways fearful of the Republican base, or at least mindful of the Republican base. And where they are might matter to many of them more than the principle of, well, if there's evidence of criminality people should be charged. And, I mean, I asked him twice, if Jack Smith finds evidence of criminality, should Donald Trump be charged, and the impression you get is, no, I don't think so. I mean he said, I hope Donald Trump is not charged. That would be bad for the country. Which is an interesting position to take given the fact that if you read Donald - I mean, I'm sorry, if you read Ron DeSantis' memoire, there's a lot in there. He's a lawyer, a former Navy JAG.
