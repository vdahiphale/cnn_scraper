And there is one area where Republicans have broke with Trump, and that is over Trump's calls for protests. Kevin McCarthy said yesterday he does not want to see people protesting. He urged people to remain calm and to remain nonviolent. But he also said, Trump's rhetoric was not meant to be harmful and that he was not actually calling for protests, even though that is indeed what Trump was calling for over the weekend.John and Erica.",

The Trump people, we've been reading, have been pressuring publicly and behind the scenes Ron DeSantis to come out and say something in support of Donald Trump. And I don't think, up until now, he's said very much at all. So, how much pressure does this put on other Republicans, particularly DeSantis, to come to Trump's defense?",

You know, playing this inside game with having Kevin McCarthy and others on The Hill saying that they're going to be looking into whether or not public funds are used in this kind of an investigation, and then spurring that outside game, raising money, calling for protests, weekend meetings from law enforcement to have to move to see whether or not they're going to have to activate their own, you know, law enforcement to, you know, stem any kind of protests and keep peace.

CNN's M.J. Lee is at the White House. Look, first of all, what a great show \"Ted Lasso\" is and what a great cause to have this type of discussion about mental health, M.J.. M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, that's right. You know, John and Erica, we are about to have some Hollywood presence here at the White House this afternoon. As you said, Jason Sudeikis and other cast members of \"Ted Lasso\" will be here to meet with President Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden, to talk about mental health-related issues. And, you know, Sudeikis plays this football coach on this show, this sort of affable character who is dealing with (INAUDIBLE) issues, you know, as (INAUDIBLE) saw in that clip that we just played, he is grappling with having panic attacks. And he seeks the help that he thinks he needs, including therapy. And what's interesting is that the actor, Sudeikis, and other cast members have really talked about how important it has been to them to see the effect that these plot lines have had on the audience members. That they've had audience members come to them and reach out to show to say, look, to have a show that deals so directly with mental health issues can really play a role in helping to destigmatize some of the health that people can really seek if they feel like they are really struggling. So, we expect this to be an interesting meeting obviously for this White House. Mental health issues is something that they have prioritized and tried to talk about a lot.
