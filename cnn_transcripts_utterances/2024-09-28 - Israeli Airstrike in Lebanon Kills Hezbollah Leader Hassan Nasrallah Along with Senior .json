We're continuing to follow major breaking news out of the Middle East.Israel now confirming it carried out a fresh new strike in Beirut just a short time ago. Our CNN teams on the ground witnessing smoke rising after an explosion in the city's southern suburbs. And it comes just hours after Hezbollah confirmed an Israeli strike on Friday killed its longtime leader and founder, Hassan Nasrallah. A senior Iranian commander was also killed, that according to Iran state media. And moments ago, I spoke with an IDF spokesperson about what Nasrallah's death could mean potentially for a much broader conflict in the Middle East with Iran. Listen to his answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. PETER LERNER, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES SPOKESMAN:  I would suggest that Iran look very closely how we've dealt with Hamas, the leadership of Hamas, and how in the last week-and-a-half we've effect effectively decapitated Hezbollah from its senior leadership all the way down to the operational in tactical staff. There is a lot to lose here. I don't think anybody is interested in a further escalation, a broader war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Trita Parsi is the executive vice president at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft and the author of the book, \"Losing an Enemy, Obama, Iran, and the Triumph of Diplomacy.\" What impact do you think the killing Nasrallah and other senior leaders will have on Hezbollah, at least in the short term, what do you think? TRITA PARSI, AUTHOR, \"LOSING AN ENEMY\":  Obviously, this is a major, devastating blow to Hezbollah. But I would say that it's not necessarily the killing of Nasrallah that is the most important development in terms of the degradation of Hezbollah. It's the fact that the Israelis managed to essentially crack the code of Hezbollah's communications system. That is a key reason as to why Hezbollah has such a hard time regrouping. This is actually very similar to what happened in 2006, the only difference being that the roles were then reversed. Hezbollah managed to crack the codes of Israel's communication as Israel was invading Lebanon. And that's part of the reason why Israel was defeated back in 2006. But as long as Hezbollah cannot restore its communication system, its ability to be able to regroup is going to be significantly, significantly weakened. And this is part of the reason that the Israelis at this point are going forward with further bombing campaigns in Lebanon, hoping to be able to strike out as much as Hezbollah as they can.",

But the reality is they're facing significant difficulties, and that was the case even before what happened in Lebanon with the assassination and killings of Nasrallah. They're having their own internal problems. The Pezeshkian government's priority is to pursue what he's calling national reconciliation.That necessitate some sort of a deal with the United States or reduction of tensions, a removal of some of the sanctions in order to improve the economic situation. The last thing they need if they want to pursue national reconciliation is a military confrontation with Israel. And this is, I think, a key reason as to why the Iranians have held back. On top of that, of course, they are running out of options. They can strike Israel. They have already shown that. But they can only do so while at the same time starting a major war, a major war that they don't want. There's a difference between them being able to strike Israel and being able to strike Israel with the calibration to make sure that they have inflicted some damage on Israel without providing a pretext for larger escalation. The latter they do not have.",

But this is putting a tremendous amount of pressure on Iran from some of its own partners in the so-called axis of resistance, because what good is Iran to them if, at the end of the day, when things like this happen, the Iranians do not come to their aid? So Iran is now being torn in several different directions. And the ultimate balance is unclear at this point.But Hezbollah in many different ways has been Iran's first line of defense against Israel. If Hezbollah truly is degraded, meaning much more than what we've seen so far, then it would leave Iran tremendously vulnerable. And the question is, if they believe that that is the direction we are heading, they may calculate that they're better off reacting sooner rather than later. This is why so many of the other entities in the region, U.S. allies, for so long have been pressuring the United States to put pressure on Israel to actually have a ceasefire in Gaza, because that is the key to avoiding this escalation. Because even if the Netanyahu government seems to be willing to have that escalation, no one knows exactly how that will end, particularly if the United States and its own troops gets directly involved.",

He says, this is all referencing, of course, the killing of Hassan Nasrallah. He says, \"We squared the accounts with somebody who killed hundreds of Americans and dozens of French.\" He goes on to say ,\"The elimination of Nasrallah was essential for us to bring back the residents to the north,\" to the north of Israel. \"If he was alive, he would have rebuilt the terror group.\" This is what Prime Minister Netanyahu is saying. \"That's why I gave the order to assassinate him.\" That's what he says. \"There's no place in the Middle East that the long arm of Israel cannot reach.\" That's very clearly a warning for anyone else that will want to target Israel at this time, bearing in mind the Houthis fired that third ballistic missile in a little over a week at central Israel just as the prime minister was landing. In fact, the Houthis are claiming that that missile was fired aimed at the airport when the prime minister was landing.One other point from the prime minister here, saying that these are historic days. \"They thought that Israel would be eradicated. We will bring the fight together and we will win together,\" echoing what he said at the U.N. General Assembly, we are winning. And we've heard also from the defense minister who has convened a meeting with his top security officials, with the IDF Chief of Staff General Herzi Halevi, the intelligence chiefs as well. They've been reviewing the current situation with a view, it says, to the expansion of IDF activities along the northern border. That seems to sort of hint, again, the hints that we were hearing over the past few days that there could be some kind of limited ground operation along the border. That's not confirming it, but again, heavily hinting in that direction. You were asking about the vacuum left by Hassan Nasrallah. Two principal candidates, his former number two seems to be taking over as a caretaker. He is perhaps more hotblooded than Nasrallah in terms of Nasrallah careful, calculating. Just last weekend at a funeral, this number two was saying that they're now this is a new chapter and essentially in an open war. And the other person who is in the running to be the leadership is a cousin of Nasrallah, also married into a very powerful and important Iranian family that he is the son-in-law of Qasem Soleimani whom the United States killed in a drone strike early in 2020. He was the QUDs, force, the overseas military command and for Iran's elite Iranian Revolutionary Guard Counsel. So both of these figures would carry weight within Hezbollah, one known to be sorted of more hotheaded, if you will, than Hassan Nasrallah. Wolf?",
