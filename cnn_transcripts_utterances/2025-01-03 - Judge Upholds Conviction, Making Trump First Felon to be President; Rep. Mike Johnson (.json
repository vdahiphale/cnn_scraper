(END VIDEOTAPE) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about, upheld. Tonight, Donald Trump is still a convicted felon after a New York judge said his convictions were lawfully made. But for Trump, he may still wear that title of criminal, but he will not suffer any of the consequences. This decision from Judge Juan Merchan spares Trump of jail time, quote, a sentence of unconditional discharge appears to be the most viable solution to ensure finality and allow the defendant to pursue his appellate options. In our fifth seat tonight, Attorney Donte Mills, he's also professor at Temple University's Beasley School of Law. Donte, is this a kind of Goldilocks decision by the judge here to give people who want Trump to have consequences, a conviction that is upheld but not have to deal with, you know, a sentence, which, frankly, was unlikely to actually happen given that he's about to be the president of the United States?",

They came back with the decision and now the judge is saying, essentially, it doesn't matter. You found them guilty, but I'm not going to assess any penalty at all.I'm not saying you had to put Trump in jail. That's not likely or reasonable, but there are fines that could have happened, up to $170,000 in fines. Why not assess that and say, you were found guilty?

Where did Mark Meadows end up? He ended up chief of staff.So, what you've seen over the years, at least if you're a house member of Congress, that you can hold the place hostage. And because the speaker's so weak, you're not negotiating with a president of the United States, who's Donald Trump, and he's with your own party. So, you're not having you -- you now feel that you're having an impact for your constituencies. You now feel you're having an impact for your issues because you're not talking to the most powerful man in the world, whereas those three members, they'd never ever have that opportunity. So, I think because of what took place today, and Trump had to save Johnson, it almost puts President Trump in a more dangerous position going forward because now anybody can raise their hand and say, I object, Speaker Johnson says, what do I need? He goes like, I want to talk to Trump. That's what's going to happen. KINZINGER: (INAUDIBLE) point on that, because it's also important to note this isn't new. So, the whole time I was in there, there was always a group of people that were trying to hold this hostage, but when we had the majority, we had a large enough majority that we could kind of ignore them or maybe they'd come into play and we'd have to cut some deals.

He said that on January 12th, people like Leader McConnell, most Republicans, all the people that came into January 6th to testify, with the exception of one or two, were all Republicans.So, I get it, he's embarrassed because we exposed how, for 187 minutes, he sat there and did literally nothing, then claims that somehow Nancy Pelosi is in charge of the National Guard when actually the D.C. Guard is -- the person in charge of that is the president of the United States, not the D.C. mayor, not the speaker of the House. He can continue to lie, that doesn't mean it's true. And so from my perspective, if they want to re-litigate January 6th, four years later, after this election, I said, look, we put this in front of the American people, they reelected Donald Trump, I respect that.

I mean, I'm just going to show you this posting from the FBI's recruiting event.This is probably the sort of thing that if you're an anti-woke person, you automatically will say, this is terrible. There are brown people in an image recruiting for the FBI. But to Brian's point, we had a former FBI agent sitting right at this table yesterday. The kind of law enforcement work that they need to do, and that they need to do more of, according to this agent, is to go into communities that don't look like Adam, sorry to call you out here, but where people look different, where they have different cultures, where you understand their background, and where they trust you to give you the information that you need.",

And when I say I think there is a conversation to be had, there is aperception that there is too much of the DEI initiatives in federal agencies, in the military. I mean, this is one of the things that President Trump is bringing Pete Hegseth in for, because he's somebody that wants to get rid of these DEI initiatives in the military.

Now, there's a hit television show on it, I encourage you to read the book \"Ashley's War\" which discusses this entire conversation about the military bringing in women to these roles. And women are crushing combat roles now. Women are crushing the physical capabilities for these roles. That has only increased our strength and our readiness.

There may be a lot of reasons behind that.Let me show you this other thing, though. Daily or near daily consumption of marijuana versus alcohol. Look at the end there. As alcohol goes down, marijuana consumption is going up. That is so interesting to me because this is my personal experience. I know a lot of people, especially young people, who are like, I don't like alcohol, but I'll smoke or I'll have an edible or whatever. Young person. I'm going to go with you.",

They're also coming of age during the time in our culture where drinking behavior is being socialized differently.We have dry January. I was just having dinner with a friend who's doing dry December. We have damp January, but why are people doing that? Let's go back to that conversation about risk and what can we prevent? Look, we know smoking, leading preventable cause of cancer, right?
