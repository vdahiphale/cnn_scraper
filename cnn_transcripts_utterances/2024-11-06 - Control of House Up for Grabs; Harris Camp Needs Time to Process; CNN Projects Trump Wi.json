Tim Sheehy defeating Jon Tester, the Democratic incumbent there in Montana. This is a pickup for Republicans as they now seek to expand their new majority in the U.S. Senate, flipping control of the U.S. Senate in this election. Tester long considered the most vulnerable incumbent that was running for re-election. You see there, 52.8 percent to 45.4 percent. Sheehy was recruited by Montana's junior senator, Steve Danes, who's the head of the NRSC. He's a businessman who's never held elected office before.What does this mean for the balance of power? Well, we know that Republicans are already going to be controlling the U.S. Senate. Right now they are holding 52 seats with three pickups, this being one of them. Democrats with 42 seats, including one independent. There are six seats that are outstanding. A lot of those still in the blue wall states that we have been watching overnight as well. John.",

How many cycles, John, did we watch the candidates on the Senate or House level to do whatever they could to stay away from Donald Trump, and then ran out in front of him? That's not happening anymore. And you've seen that in the Senate's strategy, in the campaign in the closing weeks. But let's take a look at those critical counties we've been goingthrough for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and where does Elissa Slotkin. So, there's still 14 percent outstanding in Wayne, right? If you're down by 10,000 votes and you're a Democrat and there's still that much vote outstanding, you're saying, all right, there's a pathway here through one of our critical counties, 63-32. What's the presidential at right now? Narrowly, narrowly outrunning. I think this was what I was most fascinated to look into. What about Oakland County? In the presidential you see where that currently stands, Harris underperforming the 2020 results here. Where's Slotkin? Yes, right there. I mean that's - I'm surprised by that to be completely candid with you. Going into this cycle, I didn't think that would be a problem - as big a problem for Elissa Slotkin. Right now I think the biggest question is, where is the outstanding vote? We know there's vote in Wayne. Where else? Let's go over here into Kalamazoo. How much is outstanding? There's still 21 percent here. What's interesting, in a presidential, back in 2020, this was a county that Joe Biden won by 18 points, almost 19 points. Where's Kamala Harris right now? At 11. So, again, the underperformance, and then you flip that over to the Senate, where is - so Slotkin's doing better than Harris was doing.

The vice president, confident, running on offering the country a new generation of leadership, restoring reproductive rights, warning against the threat, in her view, a second Trump presidency would bring. And ultimately that argument did not win the day. So, this is a team that I've been with them for several months, have worked very, very hard to make their case, to broaden their coalition beyond the Democratic base. That perhaps is a part of the strategy that is going to get the most scrutiny. The degree to which they embraced Republicans, that, of course, is being criticized in some Democratic corners this morning.

There was a real risk that this fight was going to drag out for weeks or longer. That would not have been good for business. Investors hate uncertainty. Something playing out in the Supreme Court would have been a nightmare. I also think there's some relief that the winner is Donald Trump, because he's, obviously, presented himself as the more pro-business candidate. He's promised to cut taxes, fully extend those 2017 tax cuts. That's going to help corporate profits. He's also promised to cut red tape. That's good news for investors too. But there's also the fact that he's promising to use tariffs more than he did during his first term. That's not something that most of the mainstream economist I talk to, most of the CEO's like, because that can actually be inflationary. But for now, there is a sigh of relief on Wall Street.",

Car insurance, groceries, everything has gotten so much more expensive. But that does bring us to one of the ironies here, right? Inflation may have gotten Trump elected again and yet a lot of the mainstream economist, a lot of the experts who know how this stuff really works, they're worried that he could make inflation worse if he actually does what he's promised to do, which is go all out with tariffs. Now, maybe some of that was just campaign rhetoric, right? Maybe he won't actually do that. Maybe those are just threats.

Early, after the midterms in 2022 in which Democrats over performed, the decision that at 80 years old that he could serve another six years essentially is what he was running for, and basically bet the farm on the fact that he was going to stay completely healthy and would be able to be a consistent, coherent messenger, which we all clearly saw he is no longer capable of doing. I think that decision. And then, you know, Kamala Harris, I think most people say, like, she made some missteps, but she had 100 and some days to introduce herself to the American people.

We're talking about inflation. We're talking about immigration. We're talking about crime.

And, look, I think the campaign, again, it was 100 and some days. I think they did a lot of things very right.
