But as Natasha mentioned, that ground is almost complete saturated in a lot of spots. So it would not take much. Here's a look at the radar now. We still have some rain across areas of northern, central, and even southern California. So really not much area is spared at this moment. You've got two separate systems, the one that's pushing rain and snow into the Pacific Northwest. And then see this chunk of clouds here? That's going to be the next system that pushes into areas of central and southern California as we go through the rest of the day today. Because we talked about it, that ground is already saturated, you still have flood watches in effect for San Francisco, San Jose, stretching down into Monterey. Even though the bulk of the rain is really going to be focused over the central and southern part you will still have some rain in the forecast in northern California. And then, obviously, also still going to get some rain and some snow across areas of the Pacific Northwest today, too. Here's the thing, though. Once that system finally pushes out, maybe getting a little bit of a break to the middle of the week, still looking, though, Amara and Boris, for significant amounts of rain and snow until we finally see things dry out at the end of the upcoming week.",

He told that group of holdouts, about 20, that he would pass a proposal that would tell the Treasury Department which payments should be prioritized if the debt ceiling is breached.We heard this directly from Congressman Chip Roy of Texas. He is one of those Republicans that was a holdout to support speaker for the gavel, or excuse me, support Kevin McCarthy for the speaker's gavel. He said that McCarthy committed to passing this proposal in hopes of limiting congressional spending. That is one of the priorities of this new Congress of the Republican majority. They don't want as much spending. They don't want to increase the debt limit. And look, there are several versions of this proposal floating right now in the House Republican conference. And look, McCarthy is stuck in the middle. That's the bigger picture here. He's going to have to get all of his Republican conference to support any proposal to deal with the debt limit should the country default on its debt in June. He has a razor thin majority. And really, the other bigger picture here, Boris and Amara, is that whatever proposal he puts on the floor of the House to pass, that would address the debt limit before June it's unlikely to pass the Senate, especially if Republicans wrote this legislation and be passed into law. So, McCarthy will likely have to negotiate with his Democratic counterparts in the House and in the Senate to be able to deal with addressing the debt limit, and hoping that, of course, that the debt limit -- United States does not default on its debt before June.

They're not of course going to say that, but, you know, that might have played some role in the back of their heads.

Because McCarthy only became speaker because he had kind of cut a deal with those holdouts, and saying, hey, you'll get more influence. But these people want to kind of have strict fiscal discipline, even though, if you ask Americans, they are not that interested in that -- those types of issues anymore. With the debt just climbing 40 percent under President Trump, under every president, Democrat or Republican, I think the public has viewed fiscal austerity as not in their best interest but also you can't have this go on forever in terms of these, you know, the debt increasing rapidly.

And amazingly, the number of people who are actually being rescued from that building, because as you said, there are dozens of people unaccounted for, presumed trapped under the rubble, whether they're dead or alive is another question.And so, the rescue efforts have been frantic, involving hundreds of people, and an immense amount of equipment, and it is extremely delicate as well. Case in point, there was one woman whose voice that they heard just early this morning, around 1:00 in the morning. They were trying to communicate with her. It was not until 11:30 today, so 10 hours later that they were actually able to pull her out of the rubble. And when you look at the video of this scene, it is difficult to imagine how anyone frankly could have possibly survived something like this. Imagine this building had about 300 apartments in it. More than 70 of them are not there today. They were completely obliterated. Obviously, the rest of them were damaged as well. Yesterday was a very active day across the country in terms of missile strikes. The entire country put on air-raid alert. More than 30 missiles were incoming, according to the Ukrainians, 2/3 of them were shot down, and of the 1/3 that actually landed most of those were aimed at energy infrastructure which was hit in five separate regions across the country, which means more emergency power cuts and a power deficit that is even worse in the country. Now, it is not clear why this particular building in Dnipro would have been targeted or if it was the target or if there was even a legitimate military target in the vicinity. But the Ukrainians say that they are confident based on the speed and altitude of the incoming missile detected on radar that they know what type it was. They think that it was a Kh-22. This is significant because this is the same kind of missile that struck a shopping mall last summer in Kremenchuk killing 18 people. Now, the apparent target in that case was a facility to repair military vehicles, a few hundred yards away. But western military analysts say the reality is that this type of missile is meant to sink ships and frankly it is not very accurate, has an accuracy of around only 500 yards or so. And the Ukrainians have no ability to shoot it down. There have been more than 200 of those missiles fired at this country since the war began. Not a single one has been shot down. Boris, Amara.",

He followed those four interceptions with four straight touchdown passes, the last going to Christian Kirk with just over five minutes to go in the fourth.
