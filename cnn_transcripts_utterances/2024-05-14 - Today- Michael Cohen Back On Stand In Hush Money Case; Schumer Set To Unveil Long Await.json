So I expect that if the prosecutors want to kind of shore up their case -- this is a major hold in their case -- they have to present evidence that somehow entering these payments as legal expenses in the book was actually fraudulent or incorrect. That it should have been something else, and that Donald Trump knew that. I think that is a difficult accounting decision to make, and so Michael Cohen is really going to have to explain for the prosecutors why that was a fraudulent or incorrect entry.",

But how do they get past that? CHERKASKYI think number one, the whole idea of the nondisclosure hush money agreement was so that it wouldn't be made public. Now, that is something that I think people can have a negative reaction to. It's a lawful agreement to reach -- these nondisclosure agreements. The other idea is kind of this lying to the public idea that he did know about it, but he told media that he didn't know about it, or he didn't know details about that. And that's certainly something that I think is a negative in terms of how people view him and certainly something that's political. As a criminal defense attorney, I will tell you that many of my clients find their way into a courtroom because they engaged in salacious or condemnable behavior from kind of a public perspective -- thing that people would find distasteful. But ultimately, when I get in front of the jury as a defense attorney, I have to kind of the jury to set that aside and look at the elements of the -- of the law. What are the legal requirements before you can actually call this a criminal act? And so that's why I keep going back to this idea of some of these underlying elements. Like, was the actual entry of legal expenses -- was that fraudulent? That's a necessary element in order to find it illegal as opposed to us discussing this from a moral or a political standpoint, which I'm sure folks can do all day long in the -- in the bowels --",

So the goal for Schumer here is to number one, mitigate the risks associated with AI. But also, number two, allow it to flourish and innovate, and be a positive thing in society.
