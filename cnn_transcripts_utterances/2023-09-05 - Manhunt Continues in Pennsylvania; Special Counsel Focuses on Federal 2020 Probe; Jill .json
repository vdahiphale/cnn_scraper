Initially over the weekend we were told by law enforcement officials that the bulk of the search operations were really centered about two miles south of the Chester County Prison where that inmate, Danelo Cavalcante, broke out back on Thursday. But then, overnight, police learned that this man, Cavalcante, was actually captured on trail cameras outside of the initial two-mile search perimeter in Longwood Gardens. And you mentioned it, Kate, it's a popular tourist attraction in the area. It's more though than a botanical garden. It's really 200 acres of really beautiful, lush gardens, but also there are open meadows, there are also winding trails as well. And it was a private camera on one of those trails that actually captured him twice. And this garden, this - again, this vast, expansive garden, it's really fairly close here. It's only about five miles aways from the prison. So, that is what state police, they're saying, is the positive message here, that he has not gotten that far. And they believe the pressure that they've been putting on him throughout the course of the weekend and Monday has been here. But, again, we got new pictures as well from this press conference. I want you to take a listen to what Lieutenant Colonel Bivens said about this picture. We'll talk about it more on the back end. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. COL. GEORGE BIVENS, PENNSYLVANIA STATE POLICE: Early this morning we were notified by security at Longwood Gardens that they had trail camera photos taken on their property which appear to be Cavalcante. This area is just south of the perimeter. Investigators quickly examined those photos and we can confirm it is Cavalcante. The photos confirm that Cavalcante has not changed his appearance, but also that he has obtained a backpack, a duffle/sling type pack and a hooded sweatshirt. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They say they believe that he is winging it. It doesn't appear that he has any cashes or any stored materials that he's getting. And, again, they are taking that as a positive sign that they're closing in on him. But the challenge here, Kate, is that this whole area, there's a lot of woods. There are creeks. There are cornfields. Like I said, Longwood Gardens is huge itself. The challenge is, as police have said, there are a lot of places to hide as this manhunt continues. Kate.",

So, if you hadn't been tested a couple days into your symptoms, you would back that timeline up till the first day after you develop symptoms. And then, you know, you can - you don't have to test at the end of five day, but if you do test at that point, you can come out of isolation without a mask.
