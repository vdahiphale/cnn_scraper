We're now learning that the special counsel, Jack Smith's prosecutors, are zeroing in on a chaotic Oval Office meeting as they near a decision on charges in the alleged scheme to overturn the 2020 election.It is a now-famous meeting just 19 days before the January 6th insurrection, and that meeting devolved into a screaming match between White House lawyers and a group of outside advisers who are pushing extreme ideas to try to keep Trump in power. Prosecutors have asked specifically about those outsiders, including former national security advisor Michael Flynn, also attorney Sidney Powell, and the former CEO of Overstock, Patrick Byrne. They floated ideas like having the military seize voting machines in crucial states Trump lost; invoking martial law; and appointing Sidney Powell as a special counsel to investigate supposed voter fraud. Rudy Giuliani was in that meeting, as well. Prosecutors asked him about it when he voluntarily met with him over two days last month. And we know that Trump's White House lawyers pushed back hard on those ideas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So December 14th is where all of the paperwork is done. And then what happens after that is important, because it's when prosecutors get to see who is still in disbelief. Who still does not want these electoral votes to go forward for Joe Biden to make him the president of the United States. So December 14th is a crucial day for prosecutors.

It's not only the speech at the Ellipse and then the storming of the Capitol. It's all this planning and scheming that went up to this.

So all of that is still under way. But what makes this very challenging is that where this baggy of cocaine was found is a highly-traveled part of the White House. This is on the ground floor of the West Wing. It was near the entrance in cubbies. So it was in a cubby that visitors use when they are going on staff-led tours, as well as ones that staff can use if they have to leave their cell phones behind to go into an area to review classified materials. Now these tours happened over the weekend. Those are led by staff. And so there is at least a time frame that they can look at. And, of course, this was also a finding that led to a temporary evacuation on Sunday evening. But the investigation is still under way, as we know. And the time line could still be fluid. But as of now, it is still very much on track to end early next week.

So there is a convention on cluster munitions that is signed by over 100 countries, essentially banning them.And U.S. -- the U.S. Congress has placed some statutory restrictions on the export of cluster munitions that have a greater than 1 percent dud rate. Right? That is where the danger to civilians comes in here. If those bomblets land and they fail to explode, then they can pose a long-term risk to civilians. But the president can overrule that. And so what we are learning is that, according to Pentagon press secretary Patrick Ryder, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the cluster munitions that the U.S. would provide to Ukraine would have a lower than 2.5 percent dud rate. And that is something that is important, because it means that fewer of those little bomblets as they scatter on the ground would fail to explode and pose that long-term risk to civilians in a way similar to land mines. That is why they're banned by so many countries, because they could pose that danger. But we're learning that, you know, the administration has been considering providing these munitions for quite some time now. The Ukrainians have essentially been begging for them as they run low on artillery ammunition and as they say these munitions could provide a boost to Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. But the administration really did not start shifting its tune on these cluster munitions until very recently when that Ukrainian counter offensive did not appear to be making as significant gains as the Ukrainians and as the Biden administration and the West, writ large, had wanted. And so the idea is that these munitions might be able to help turn things around, but also importantly, they could provide key ammunition to Ukraine at a time when they really need it, Poppy.",

Earlier today, Secretary Yellen met with a number of Chinese counterparts on the economic front. She met with an official from the People's Bank of China. She met with Liu He, a former official who served in a very similar capacity as hers. That meeting was described as informal but substantive. However, she also took time to meet with leaders of the business community, the American business community in China, which has invested a lot over the years. This included invites to officials from Boeing, from Bank of America, from Medtronic.
