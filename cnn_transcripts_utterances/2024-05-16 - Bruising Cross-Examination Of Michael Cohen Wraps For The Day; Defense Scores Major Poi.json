The bruising crossing examination of Michael Cohen by Donald Trump's lawyer wraps up for the day after the defense repeatedly hammered the prosecution's star witness for his past lies and aggressively tried to catch him in new lies under oath. The Trump team scoring major points in its bid to undercut Cohen's credibility, that includes getting Cohen to admit he did not fully remember a phone call portrayed as a direct link between Trump and the Stormy Daniels hush money deal.For the next hour, we'll be taking you inside the courtroom from gavel to gavel with new testimony, transcripts, breaking down all of today's most important developments and looking ahead to what's next. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer is on assignment. I'm Alex Marquardt, a special report in The Situation Room, Trump Trial Today. Let's get right to the breaking news on a pivotal trial day for Donald Trump's defense, the former president's lawyer poking holes in Michael Cohen's testimony and possibly sowing doubts in juror's minds. CNN's Kara Scannell has emerged from the courtroom in Manhattan where she's been reporting on the trial all day. So, Kara, tell us about the most significant and the most dramatic moments that you saw firsthand in that courtroom. KARA SCANNELL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Alex, just moments ago, Trump's lawyer saying -- still not saying whether the formal president will take the stand and testify, but the judge told both sides they should prepare to give closing arguments in this case as soon as Tuesday and this after a day of fireworks where Trump's lead attorney, Todd Blanche, had Michael Cohen in the hot seat branding him a liar and through aggressive questioning, painting him into a box. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCANNELL (voice over): Trump's ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, in a dramatic moment on the stand, grilled over his memory of a key phone conversation that directly implicates former President Donald Trump in his criminal trial.",

Now, Todd Blanche, Trump's lawyers, said that cross-examination will continue into Monday when court is back in session.

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And we have some excerpts from some of our reporters who are in the room now. Viewers who did not have Michael Cohen fighting over text with a 14-year-old on their bingo boards are right. You are not alone. This was quite a moment in terms of what it meant. So, again, going back and forth about this call that happened on October 24th, 2016, where allegedly Michael Cohen says that he raised Stormy Daniels with President Trump, but as Kara had noted, the text -- the records don't seem to suggest that.So, on the call, or at least today on cross-examination, Michael Cohen says, part of it was that the 14-year-old, but I know that Keith was -- Keith Schiller, this is President Trump's bodyguard, was with Mr. Trump at the time. And there was more potentially than this. Then Todd Blanche, the defense attorney says, that was a lie, you did not talk to President Trump. You talked to Keith Schiller. You can admit it now. Cohen still staying pretty cool and calm here says, no, sir. I don't know that it's accurate. I believe. I also spoke to Mr. Trump and told him everything regarding the Stormy Daniels matter. Then Todd Blanche says, we are not asking for your belief. This jury does not want to hear about what you think happened right there. There's an objection and the prosecution objects, the judge sustains it because of the fact that Blanche was forcing him or asking him to opine on what somebody else thought. It just was an improper question. So, at this point, Todd Blanche is pacing around, flailing his arms, he's pretty -- appearing pretty upset with Michael Cohen. And he says, but your memory is that you were testifying truthfully on Tuesday, a minute and 36-second phone call, and you had enough time to update Schiller about all the problems you were having, and also update President Trump about the status of Stormy Daniels situation because you had to keep him informed. Michael Cohen responds, I always ran everything by the boss immediately, and in this case, it would've been saying everything has been taken care of and has been resolved. So, again, what Todd Blanche was getting at was in this minute and 36 seconds, it sort of strains logic a bit to suggest that he raised both Stormy Daniels and this, you know, punk 14-year-old who he was fighting with. And quite frankly, the prosecution did not, prior to this, prepare the jury for the fact that there might have been some ambiguity as to what happened on this phone call.",

And as Elliot said, not a lot of time for there to be a conversation about both X and Y raises some doubt that the -- and the why here obviously is that what Trump said was -- or what Cohen said was discussed, had to do with Stormy Daniels. And if there was just very little time to discuss both the 14-year-old issue and Stormy Daniels, it is hard to believe that, that he got to the Stormy Daniels.So, I think, I mean anything, the prosecution -- sorry. Anything the defense can do to suggest that Michael Cohen isn't getting it right or is misrepresenting things is important --",

JIM TRUSTY, FORMER TRUMP ATTORNEYAnd it's a little bit dangerous territory for the defense. You know, I think Todd did a very nice job being very disciplined in his cross for the first big chunks, which was establish facts, establish he's biased, establish he has a history of lying, but don't give him an opportunity to crawl out and make a speech. Set it up for closing argument. I think he got a little fired up and went a little far. And you saw the objection, but it's not really the objection that matters. It's that he started making argument that Cohen could figure out where it's going. And Cohen then comes back with, I don't admit it, I'll tell you why. You know, don't ask him the question of admit it's lie. He is not going to do it. And so there's a little bit of a, a kind of an advocacy lesson there, I think, in terms of getting too whipped up and thinking you're going to get the home run when a triple is just fine. But, look, at the end of the day, you know, I like everyone. I'm just shocked that Cohen would lie. about this call. It's an amazing development for an otherwise perfect witness. Now, I mean, more seriously, they set the whole trial up, right? The defense set the whole trial up to be a referendum on Cohen's honesty. That's exactly where you want this fight to be.

I'm not a lawyer, so I don't, you know, all the ins and outs of what the final questions and the approach will be, and, of course, there'll be closing arguments. So, you know, they have more time to process this, right? We sort of look at this almost like it's like a football game, right, and this is, you know -- they've still got some time left on the clock and there could be a more to come. I do think, obviously you saw Trump feeling very good today. He came out he was reading, he'd clearly had folks look at CNN, look at MSNBC, which he calls, of course, MSNDC. And, you know, people were saying that this was a good day for him and a kind of a bad day for Michael Cohen, because this is a case that rests on Michael Cohen's credibility, and you saw them really poking holes in it today.",

And don't go too far with trying to rehabilitate him. Simply walk in and they could ask the question on that call on October 24th. Do you remember talking about Stormy Daniels and this 14-year- old? Yes. No further questions, and get out of there. It does not benefit the prosecution in any way to be going back and forth and ping-ponging with the defense about the facts of this of this phone call.The damage has been done, but sort of -- and this was Jim's point, you sort of risk stepping in it further the more you keep lingering and trying to litigate really small points, even if they are really damaging to your side.",

      "sentences": "Well, one, I love these court sketches because Christine Cornell, she's amazing, you can watch her, that Todd Blanche looks a little more like a superhero bit in that court sketch that he did in the courtroom. But this was really a huge test for him this afternoon and today really overall as he was questioning Michael Cohen, because Michael Cohen is someone who was not flustered on the stand when he first started questioning him on Tuesday. There weren't any really knockout blows, certainly not that Trump was looking for, or that could help sow doubt about his credibility for the jury, and that shifted today.And so one thing I was watching really closely was, one, how the jury was taking in Todd Blanche, because he hasn't played a huge role in this trial so far. He is the lead attorney, but he hasn't really been in charge of cross-examining any of the other high-profile witnesses that we've seen, people like Keith Davidson or David Pecker or Stormy Daniels. Today was his chance to really do that. And, obviously, you saw and heard from Kara how he drilled into Michael Cohen on his memory of certain phone calls with Donald Trump. And the jury was watching Todd Blanche very closely. And you could kind of see, it's almost like a tennis match where their eyes are going back and forth between Todd Blanche and Michael Cohen, Todd Blanche and Michael Cohen. And Todd Blanche kind of has this way of questioning Michael Cohen, where he would say something and say, that's right, isn't it, or that's correct. And Michael Cohen in turn was very calm and even toned, but he was speaking very slowly and even haltingly at some points, Alex, as if he was choosing his words really, really carefully. It's not the same when, you know, the prosecution was up there he knew generally what they were going to ask of him, because he is their witness here. And so that was remarkable in and of itself. As for Donald Trump, who you see here, I've been in court several days. When Keith Davidson was on the stand, when Stormy Daniels was on the stand, when Michael Cohen first took the stand earlier this week, typically, Donald Trump is kind of looking straight ahead. Sometimes he'll lean back in his chair, kind of relaxed, have his eyes closed for sustained periods of time. That was not the case this afternoon with Michael Cohen. He had his body almost shifted in the direction of the witness stand. He was looking directly in that way, as Todd Blanche was really drilling down with Michael Cohen and at times he kind of had a scowl on his face. Sometimes he had a smirk on his face as he was watching all of this play and clearly enjoyed watching his attorney cross-examine his former attorney.",

And, of course, you can never say with 100 percent certainty with Donald Trump, everyone who has ever covered him always has a caveat because he does like to be, you know, predictably unpredictable. But it seems quite clear from conversations we've had that there is no plan for Donald Trump to take the stand. And even he has waffled on it in his public statements saying it.But it's not clear why Todd Blanche doesn't want to just definitively state with no one else in the room. You know, the witness is not in the room when this is happening. The jury is not in the room when this is happening. It's just the prosecution, the defense, and the reporters and members of the public who are there watching. And so he would not say that. But what is clear is this is coming to an end quite quickly. And the judge told the parties to be ready potentially as soon as Tuesday to start wrapping this up to give their summations of their cases. It's not guaranteed that it will happen that quickly but Todd Blanche did say he only has maybe two hours or so left to question Michael Cohen, and then prosecutors will have the chance to reexamine him, to re-question him. And so whether or not Trump's team ultimately calls any witnesses. It could also depend on how this questioning of Michael Cohen goes. If they feel as strongly as they do at the end of Monday, as they do right now, which they felt pretty good walking out of that courtroom today, that remains to be seen, you know, whether they even think it's worth calling anyone else or if it's necessary for them.",

But the real relevant time period that these events occurred, she did not know Michael Cohen other than by name, had never met him and never talked to him. So, the relationship was really a distant, you know, just reference relationship.I don't think there was any doubt that the defense in this case would have a lot of fodder to cross-examine Michael Cohen. I mean, we've had years of statements, lots of appearances by him, statements he made in writing and then orally they were captured on video. So, it's a cross- examiner's dream to have that mountain of conflict and inconsistency to cross-examine him. It's no surprise that he would have some traction on that.",

The real issue is, what is corroborative? What documents exist? Who had the motive? What actions were taken? And I don't think a witness needs to know every detail.

And then, you know, also Eric Trump, Donald Trump's son, was there as well.And then, of course, we saw them do this press conference outside the courtroom. And that's really keeping with what we've seen from other high profile allies of Donald Trump over the last week or so, them coming to court, standing in solidarity with him and attacking the case. Now, I think a key thing to keep in mind here is that, remember, Donald Trump is under a gag order. He is not allowed to discuss the witnesses in this case, people like Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen. He's not allowed to attack prosecutors' families. He is allowed to attack the judge and a special, or excuse me, District Attorney Alvin Bragg but he's also not allowed to talk about the jurors. However, Matt Gaetz is one example. We just saw that video of him there. He has been really going through that line attacking the people that Donald Trump can't go after. He labeled Michael Cohen at this press conference as an unreliable liar. He spoke about the judge's family, something that Donald Trump had been warned repeatedly not to do. And he also spoke about the jury. So, we're also seeing many of these allies, not only show up with Donald Trump, but kind of going around the guidelines of the gag order to do the attacking for the former president. MARQUARDT: That's a very good point. Scott, what do you make of all this? This parade is growing so strong that today there were enough Republican lawmakers who accompanied Trump to court that they actually risked losing control of the House floor.",

So, I guess it's par for the course for people like Matt Gaetz who work with Democrats to throw out Kevin McCarthy.But, largely speaking, I think this is reflective of something old in campaigns, which is surrogate operations. You know, most campaigns organize groups of supporters to go out into the country and talk on the candidate's behalf. Usually, it's about policy issues, whatever. But in this case, the entire campaign is happening in and around this courtroom. So, this week, all the surrogates for Donald Trump are coming to court, and they're saying things that the candidate himself cannot say. So, I think you'll see this kind of surrogate work continue long after the trial. It's just right now there really isn't a campaign outside of what's happening in New York City.",

The background here, of course, is that the special counsel investigated the president's handling of classified documents. That concluded back in February, and Hur, as you'll recall declined to bring criminal charges against the president.But he did create a whole lot of controversy by suggesting at numerous points in his report that the problem -- that the president suffered from serious problem memory problems, which, of course, the White House wrote off as gratuitous and political in nature, and back in March, we did see the DOJ released the written transcript of that interview. But House Republicans have been pushing for the release of the audio recording. They have been now threatening to pursue Merrick Garland, the attorney general, for being in contempt of Congress for not releasing that audio recording. And their argument has basically been that we need that audio recording to continue pursuing our impeachment investigation into the president. Now, what we saw today was the House Judiciary Committee voting to advance that contempt resolution. The House Oversight Committee is also going to hold a vote tonight, and the House -- the White House's counsel said in a letter to House Republicans, the absence of a legitimate need for the audio recordings lays bare your likely goal -- to chop them up, distort them and use them for partisan political purposes -- Alex.",
