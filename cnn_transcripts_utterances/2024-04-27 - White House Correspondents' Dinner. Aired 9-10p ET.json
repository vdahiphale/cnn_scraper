KELLY O'DONNELL, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS' ASSOCIATION: Now, we've got your attention. That was a lot of fun and you see how lucky I am to have so many friends with big personalities who were willing to be a little silly to help us kick things off tonight. Thank you to all of them who said yes when I called all the networks. Thank you, friends, for turning up for that. Mr. President, Vice President Harris, Dr. Biden, and Mr. Emhoff, we welcome you as we celebrate freedoms that are both enduring and repeatedly tested. Your presence here speaks clearly and loudly about the essential connection between a free press, freedom of speech, and the democracy we value. (APPLAUSE) Tonight, we will honor excellence. We will look to the future with support for our student scholars, but we know that, eyes are wide open here, we come together for this grand evening in tumultuous times, with crises and conflicts all around us. There's no mistaking that. We also know that life has many dimensions, including time to celebrate and time to laugh. So many of you have reached out to me to say how excited you are to see Colin Jost as our entertainer. Let me be honest with you, when your dream choice to headline this event and this crowd says, yes, that is a good day. That is a good day. Thank you, Colin, for being here. And I know Colin cares about history and things about history like so many of us in the White House Correspondents' Association and I don't mean dusty books in the library. I learned a lot about Washington from me hearing laughter on Saturday nights when I was growing up in Ohio, and that showed me humor could take on serious subjects and leave us feeling a little lighter. So I ask Colin and our friends at \"Saturday Night Live\" to open up the time capsule, nearly 50 years of political humor to take us on a fun and funny ride. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Sound rich and textured and written on Air Force One.While in route back to the United States, Keith's story lays out President Biden's thinking and brings listeners in on the trip along with her and onto Air Force One to hear the president himself announced breaking news. And Keith's quick work as part of the White House press pool to share her audio. Also speaks volumes of her professionalism.

This years award goes to a collaboration between the \"Texas Tribune\", \"ProPublica\", and \"Frontline\" reporting on the tragic mishandling of the active shooter situation at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, on May 14th, 2022. (APPLAUSE) Titled unprepared, it is comprised of a series of newspaper articles and a \"Frontline\" documentary, the meticulously researched report explains why Robb Elementary School students and teachers remains barricaded in a classroom for 77 minutes. With a gunman, while more than 100 police and military officers scrambled to find radios, flash bang, shields, and even the key to unlock the classroom. Investigators later surmise the classroom might even have been opened during the entire siege. For more than a year, Lomi Kriel, an investigative reporter with the Texas Tribune and ProPublica led a team of reporters who examine video footage from two dozen body cams and hundreds of hours of interviews with 150 law enforcement officers to untangle the actions and inactions that led to the deaths of 21 people, including 19 children. Kriel and colleagues, Lexi Churchill, Jinitzail Hernandez, Jessica Priest, Perla Trevizo,and Zach Despart contributed to the series. Juanita Ceballos wrote and directed the \"Frontline\" documentary. One of the judges said it was a standout investigation into the missteps of law enforcement during one of the most horrific school shootings in recent U.S. history. The accompanying frontline documentary was especially strong, using officer bodycam footage and recording debriefings with officers to take viewers inside the investigation of what went wrong and why those entrusted to protect children and teachers failed to act until it was too late to save some of the victims. Here to accept the award are Lomi Kriel, Lexi Churchill and Zach Despart. (APPLAUSE)",
