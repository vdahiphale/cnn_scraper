A less redacted version of the Justice Department's search warrant for Mar-a-Lago last summer reveals what prosecutors knew before the FBI went in looking for classified top secret documents. Investigators say -- quote -- \"video footage reflects that evidence has been moved recently.\"Joining me now, CNN legal analyst and former assistant U.S. attorney Jennifer Rodgers, CNN senior political analyst and anchor John Avlon, editor-at-large at \"Reason,\" Matt Welch, New York GOP surrogate Joe Pinion, and Rolling Stone columnist Jay Michaelson. Great to have all of you. So, Jen, this affidavit, what did they know? What does this less redacted affidavit reveal? JENNIFER RODGERS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY: Well, not a whole heck of a lot, Alisyn. It is still heavily redacted. But at least we know that they knew about some of the shenanigans in and out of the storage space, right? And that not only forms the basis of the classified documents at least of the case but the obstruction part of the case, right? All of this in and out, and Trump is reviewing documents and they were hiding all of that from his lawyer at the time, Evan Corcoran. So, it is really important evidence and we didn't know how quite -- how early DOJ was on to that. That has ended up being one of the big building blocks here. But we'll have to wait to see more. Of course, Trump and his team will have access to the unredacted version and they will make their challenges to search warrant based on that. The rest of us will have to wait and see as the litigation proceeds whether we can learn more.",

(LAUGHTER) However, it could also suggest perhaps that there is some number, this is the greatest question in American politics right now, what is the lowest possible number of the Trump support within the GOP? Is it 50 percent? I tend to think that it is probably lower. But it is not going to be all that much lower probably. How many (INAUDIBLE) votes are there right now? I think it might be 40. It might be 35. We don't know. But until the Republican Party figures that out, they are stuck in a bit of a doom loop, right, because Trumpism is not popular with the general electorate. It just isn't. How many times do we need to see that proved out? So, until there is a republican challenge to that, a meaningful one that is not 16 people, it is a couple, they are in trouble.",

Part of the reason that the opponents aren't seizing on it is because they realize that if they did, their numbers would go down and his numbers would go up.I think you see that reflecting in what is happening with Chris Christie who has some of the highest negatives of any candidate running in spite of the fact that he is, for all intended purposes, a quite accomplished governor who got a lot of stuff done in New Jersey. So yeah, I think the reality is that no, I don't think that gravity takes over. I think, in many ways, President Trump is only going to go up from here. But also, correlation, not causation. It is also because of the fact that the other people namely Ron DeSantis who was touted to be the preeminent challenger to President Trump has in many ways continued to bite his own tongue and stub his own toe, including that latest bizarre ad that ended up on Twitter because again, it appears that we're more concerned with trying to win the Twitter news cycle than actually trying to cultivate an actual constituency within this republican primary that has all of their hopes and dreams still in the basket of Donald Trump. JAY MICHAELSON, RABBI, WRITER FOR ROLLING STONE: We must need a whole different methodology for dealing with this phenomenon, right, which is having to do something with a cult of personality and how people do or don't change their beliefs. It does seem -- I think Jen just perfectly summarized what's going. This case is about shenanigans. That is the legal term. I could define it. It is Latin. But basically, we know what this case is about. But it does not matter. Right? It clearly does not matter. I think that question of like what is the percentage of Republicans (INAUDIBLE), that is the question. But we need to be thinking about what -- what if anything -- I mean, maybe we should be talking to (INAUDIBLE). What if anything can penetrate the kind of orifice of this information and of group belonging? I'm not -- this is not right or left issue, right? This this happens on the left as well where there are cults of personality. And we saw it with what sometimes called conspirituality (ph) where left-wing people take on right-wing conspiracy theories because it fits (INAUDIBLE).",
