The Homeland Security secretary expressed deep disappointment by the court decision. He stressed that it does not impact current DACA recipients, permitting renewals, but it will block DHS from processing any new enrollments. Joining us now is Erendira Rendon, the vice president of immigrant justice at the Resurrection Project. She is a DACA recipient whose family brought her from Mexico when she was 4. Erendira, thank you so much for being with us. How are you reacting to the ruling? ERENDIRA RENDON, VICE PRESIDENT OF IMMIGRANT JUSTICE, RESURRECTION PROJECT &amp; DACA RECIPIENT: We're very disappointed in the ruling, although we did expect that -- the Fifth Circuit Court rulings tend to be conservative and don't take into account the broad authority that the president does have using enforcements with immigrants.",

      "sentences": "Right. They reached a deal, Jim. And it was at least the judge's discomfort with what she thought was the odd nature of that agreement.Which basically called for her to play no role. She had to rubber stamp it, was how she viewed it. She was being asked to rubber stamp an agreement between prosecutors, David Weiss, the Trump appointee, the U.S. attorney who is still in office and who is overseeing this investigation as now special counsel. The deal was, if Hunter Biden abided by a certain amount of terms that were going to be laid out, that he would have this charge essentially go away eventually. And that's where the judge drew the line and started asking questions and, frankly, where this all began unraveling. But the other thing worth noting is that Hunter Biden himself caused a lot of the problem for, obviously, the fact that he was addicted to drugs and he bought this firearm. He possessed it for about 11 days, I believe, according to the information, according to the prosecution. But what made this certainly more easy for prosecutors to bring was that Hunter Biden wrote a book, he discussed his struggles with drug issues, and he talked about the time when he possessed the firearm. And that really drew the attention of investigators at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Who were already looking at the issues and really cemented the idea that he should not have been able to buy the firearm or at least when he bought it, Jim, that he did not truthfully fill out that form, which everybody fills out when they buy firearms. Look, you and I have talked about this before. This is one of those things that cases like this don't often get brought. And I think Hunter Biden's attorneys are going to make a big case of this. Because usually there's other things that are attached to it, other criminal conduct attached to it related to the gun. It's unusual for this to be brought as a single charge without anything else, perhaps violence or anything else.",

So they had reached this deal after a five-year investigation where they had taken a very expansive look at a range of conduct, including possible foreign bribery, possible failure to register as a foreign agent, a foreign lobbying charge.And then it had narrowed down to the tax charge and the gun charge and that was something that both Hunter Biden's team and prosecutors had negotiated this plea deal for. It was essentially all agreed to, they brought it to the judge in Delaware and, as Evan noted, it was structured in, in such a way that she was supposed to be, essentially, a rubber stamp on it. And as part of the deal for the tax charges, Hunter Biden would have faced a sentence of probation. That's what prosecutors agreed to recommend. It would ultimately still be up to the judge to decide. But they were coming in with the idea that it would be probation. And the gun charge was structured differently, where it would go away if he agreed over the course of 24 months to abide by certain things, such as not using drugs, not purchasing a gun. And his lawyers said he was meeting weekly, regularly, with probation now as though the deal was valid and in place. But then the judge asked a lot of questions about it, including what the scope of potential immunity Hunter Biden would have from future charges in connection with the tax component and then also on the gun charge. She wasn't sure it was constitutionally sound the way it was structured. They had wanted her to serve as an arbiter to decide if either one, if the prosecutors thought that Hunter Biden had violated the terms of his release and the terms of the deal, she wasn't sure that would stand up in court and asked them to rework it. And soon after that, both sides said they couldn't find a deal. They were working towards it in court. They had actually come back to the table after a break telling the judge they figured it out. And she said, no, no no, I want you to go, you know, back. And then it really did fell apart. They weren't able to see eye-to-eye on it. As then, as this was all becoming public, we learned that the U.S. attorney in Delaware, the Trump-appointee, David Weiss, had asked for special counsel status and that Merrick Garland, the attorney general, had granted that. He said it reached a stage in the investigation. And there has not been any clarity on what prompted -- you know, what he meant by \"reached a stage.\" But there is obviously a lot of scrutiny by Republicans over this investigation, the handling of it. And that has been something that is a real discussion on Capitol Hill, with hearings and with now this move to open an impeachment into President Biden and whether he has any dealings with Hunter Biden's business.",

If you are a felon, which you can prove on paper, and you possess a gun, you're guilty.It's a little bit different when you talk about an addict. It's usually very hard to prove. Granted, easier if you are someone who has written an autobiography. But he could come back and say, I was just embellishing, I was writing a book, I wanted to make money off of it. I was lying. There's a reason that they don't bring many cases under this subsection. And the proof issue is one of them. It's also inadvisable because prosecutors and the government in society have an interest in addicts getting clean. So when you look at someone under the rubric, not \"can we charge, do we have the evidence\" but \"should we charge in our discretion?\" If you look at an addict, who says, I'm now clean and I don't even have the gun anymore, is that the kind of case that, in your prosecutorial discretion, ought to be brought? Prosecutors originally thought no, so we'll divert it. Now they've made a different decision and we'll have to see if a jury can be convinced of that.",

As I said, if you have someone who's clearly not dangerous, assuming he stays clean and doesn't possess a gun, that's what we should all want.

He wants the tax thing wrapped up. He wants the gun charge wrapped up. So I'm sure they'll be back to the table now. What really pushed them to do this and kind of forced this is that the Speedy Trial Act was running. They had to take care of this speedy trial requirement. So obviously, the defendant, Hunter Biden, wasn't going to waive his rights to have the indictment brought within the time anymore, because he didn't want to give them that leeway. So that's why they had to charge. So now, hopefully, everyone can take a breath, sit down, get back to the negotiating table and see what happens. As I said, Hunter Biden has a lot of good arguments here. If they get pushed into a situation where they don't have a deal that works for them and go to trial, I think they have a good case.",

You're going to hear skepticism pushed back and members trying to investigate everything that's happening with David Weiss' investigation into Hunter Biden.I just caught up with one Republican, Congressman Matt Gaetz, who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, and asked him about this charge. He said, \"Indicting Hunter Biden on a gun charge is like indicting Jeffrey Dahmer for littering.\" So you're hearing some skepticism from some folks on the right. I'm sure that will be echoed on down the line. You'll recall exactly what the House Republicans hoped to do. In the aftermath of that plea deal that later collapsed, they wanted to try to figure out all the communications that went into the plea deal. They raised concerns about David Weiss being named a special prosecutor in the aftermath of that collapsed plea deal, and pushing to try to get Weiss and people who have been closes to the special counsel to come to Capitol Hill, something they have been unsuccessful to do so far. This is, of course, all part of the Republican effort to try to tie Hunter Biden's actions to Joe Biden, specifically about the Justice Department's handling of this investigation. There's no evidence that the White House itself was involved in any way with the Justice Department's handling of its probe and the ultimate indictment here into Hunter Biden. But that's one thing that Republicans continue to raise suspicions of, continue to say is part of their overall effort to investigate the president that could eventually lead to his impeachment. So no question about it. This announcement here unlikely to satisfy the Republican critics here, who believe much more should have been brought against Hunter Biden.

It's one that certainly -- certainly, the Biden administration spends a lot of time fighting with because they keep making rulings that are contrary to things that the Biden administration has been trying to do, right? So it certainly is not over. Certainly, from the federal government's point of view, from the Justice Department's point of view. This is a long-standing law. This is a law that's been on the books for a long, long, long time. And it's only now being revisited because of the trend that we've seen from the conservative Supreme Court and the courts in general that perhaps Second Amendment rights are more expansive than we've ever thought, right? That's one reason why you could see why prosecutors in Delaware are bringing this case, because it's not final, and it doesn't apply to them. That ruling in New Orleans does not apply to the district in Delaware where this case is being brought. But it does raise the question. And one reason why I think it may have played at least -- again, this is me being -- doing some analysis here. It may have played a role, at least partly, in why David Weiss, the now special counsel in Delaware, sitting in Delaware, wanted to try to get this move -- to move on from this. Because there are very, very big questions as to whether this law that they are using to prosecute Hunter Biden is actually going to stand when everything is said and done, certainly by the Supreme Court.",
