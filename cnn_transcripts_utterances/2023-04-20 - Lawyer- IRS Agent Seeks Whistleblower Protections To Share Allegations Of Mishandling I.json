But some lawmakers say it is a trap for the White House, given the cuts he's demanding. In exchange, the plan would cut federal spending in the Biden student loan cancellation plan. Repeal the IRS expansion plans, set new employment policies for welfare programs, among other things. Or as Democrats see it, neutralize the president's agenda, which already passed Congress. The Treasury Department has warned that the us could reach its debt deadline as early as June 5th. That's not long from now. And an ambitious space mission made it off the launch pad this morning, but not much farther. The coolest, frankly, rocket exploded midair after it separated from its heavy booster, the first stage. SpaceX's starship, as it's known, the heaviest, most powerful rocket ever built. The goal was to fully orbit the planet in about an hour and a half. Elon Musk says that they will attempt the mission again in the coming months. Also this hour, Brianna, over to you.",

We know the president's son has been under investigation since about 2018.We know from our reporting that they have considered bringing charges that include tax crimes and even a possible false statements charge related to a gun purchase. But no charges have been filed so far. And this person wants whistleblower protections so they can share what they know with Congress. Now, they alleged that they not only have evidence that this case has been mishandled, but they also have evidence, they say, that contradicts public statements by the attorney general. And I want to be really careful here. And this is someone who alleges to have this. They presented no evidence. They, at this point, do not actually have whistleblower protections. It's not clear if they're going to get them. So at this point, again, we have to be cautious because there have been other promises about whistleblowers related to Hunter Biden and the Biden family that have not come to fruition.",

We know in the past several months, again, there has been some dissent within the Justice Department. Not that unusual in any criminal case. About whether they had enough evidence to bring a case and prove it beyond a reasonable doubt. And as I said, no charges have been brought in that long, ongoing investigation.

The battle over the pill comes after a Texas judge abruptly revoked the FDA approval of the drug. Fortunately, we have CNN's justice correspondent, Jessica Schneider, with more on this.

If the Supreme Court extends that stay, it will continue to be status quo.The big question is, if the Supreme Court decides to enact some of those restrictions that the Fifth Circuit had put, maybe some of them or all of them. So what are the restrictions here? If the Supreme Court decides not to extend the stay and impose the restrictions, it would mean that Mifepristone would only be available up to seven weeks pregnant, currently that 10 weeks pregnancy. In addition, it would change the parameters for in-person doctor visits. Typically, allow the women now get it via telehealth. And it would also would mean more in-person clinic visits. Plus, it could potentially halt the availability of this drug via mail. Right now, women can get pretty easily via mail.

So, for example, the Supreme Court ruling on same-sex marriage, that can be taught, but it cannot jump start of further dialogue about the efficacy of gender ideology or transgender and such. So that's kind of where the vagueness of this, though, is creating a lot of headaches for teachers and curriculum makers and superintendents who are -- who need to abide by the law.

What we know is that anti-LGBTQ legislation has taken several forms across this nation. It's not only a Florida thing. This is what's happening all across the country right now. But I also want to point out that it's clear this isn't about the urgent issues that we need to be focusing on here in Florida. And also when we're talking about parental rights, which parents? Is it just for the straight parents that we want to make sure that they -- their rights are protected. What about the parent who has a transgender child? What about the parent who has an LBG -- a gay child? So what about those parents? Why can't we just have a conversation ensuring that parent protection, meaning that we are protecting all children, all parents to ensure that truth is being taught? And reasonable minds would agree that inappropriate conversation should not be had inside the classroom. Yes, parents should have those conversations. But LGBTQ youth who do not have that type of supportive parents should have the ability to talk to a teacher and to get that solace, to get the encouragement that he or she needs to make sure that they're going to feel ostracized, to ensure that they're going to feel as if no one cares about them.
