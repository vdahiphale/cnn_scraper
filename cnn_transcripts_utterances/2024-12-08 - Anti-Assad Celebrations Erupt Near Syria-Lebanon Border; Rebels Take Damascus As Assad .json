For those of us who have been covering this story for more than 14 years, it never seemed possible that it would end like this. I want to say that the streets are incredibly calm, incredibly quiet. But you can see just behind me a few cars have been going through the street.There's actually a curfew in place from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. that is a security measure. Of course, there has been some looting in Damascus earlier on, some chaotic scenes. And so as a precaution, as we saw in Aleppo, they have put this curfew into place. I want to show you, though, Wolf, a clip of the moment that we cross the border, because this is a border that I crossed many times when I used to live in Lebanon, when I used to cover Syria at the very, very beginning of the uprising. And the contrast from what it was and what we experienced tonight is just startling. So take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Will there be lawlessness? Will we see more looting like we saw today?But if you have that other clip pulled up, I just would love our viewers to be able to see the scene at that border crossing as we pass through it. Again, it was already dark, already past curfew, very, very quiet, and just nothing like we've seen it before. The only real evidence we saw, Wolf, of any struggle to finally take Damascus, to finally ouster Bashar al-Assad was a tank in the road below a torn poster of president, or I should say former President Bashar al-Assad.

Just a few friendly people waving us through.And honestly, the last time I came down this road was back in 2011. I was leaving Syria. I had been undercover in Damascus, but losing as a tourist, went back into Lebanon.

This is the old flag of the Syrian regime, which has two green stars. The rebel's flag has three green stars. But this one has now been literally, we just found it on the floor. I guess a real moment where you see how much things have changed just in the past 24 hours.In terms of the security situation on the streets, I would just add we anticipated that we might see quite a lot of checkpoints as we came into the city. We didn't. We did see a group of men. They did not appear to be armed, but they asked us what we were doing, where we were going. And now that we are sort of ensconced in our place, where we're staying for the night. We have seen a couple of patrols. I saw two men armed, and I went up to them and asked them where they were from. They told me they were from Idlib, which is in the northern part of the country. And we saw a man on the street go up and wanted to pose for a photograph of them, which I think sort of speaks to the moment. There is obviously jubilation, elation, but also this sense of, you can't compute. It was so fast, so breathtaking, it's astonishing. And I think people are taking some time to try to process the magnitude. Keep in mind, Wolf, we're talking about 53 years of Assad rule, 53 years of a brutal police state. And I can't tell you how many Syrians have said to me, Wolf, that, you know, we understand that there are concerns about the rebels and the makeup of the rebels and the fact that some of them are Islamists and some of them are even jihadists or have been affiliated with Al Qaeda or prescribed organizations. But let us have this moment. Let us celebrate the fact that this brutal dictator who has ruthlessly killed hundreds of thousands of people, who has gassed children with lethal nerve agents, who has locked people in prisons and tortured and beaten them to death, that he is finally gone. And that whatever may come and whatever the anxiety, this is a new chapter for Syria. Wolf. [13:10:00] BLITZER: Certainly is. And what really surprised me, and I assume surprised a lot of people, is that this happened not only very, very quickly. Within a few days, the Bashar al-Assad regime is gone. But what surprised me is that his army, his military, his police force, which is so well armed with highly sophisticated weapons, basically didn't use those weapons against these rebel forces. There was no major bloodshed, no big war going on. It was a pretty dramatic development that the rebels could do all of this without being attacked brutally, as you correctly point out the Bashar al-Assad regime has done over the years. How do you explain that?",

      "sentences": "And again, it's such an important point, Wolf, because what you have to understand, during the hottest years of this war, from 2011 to 2015, there were so many times where it looked like the rebels were poised, for example, to take Aleppo, where they were storming across the country with these offensives. But Bashar al Assad's forces continued to fight. And most importantly and crucially, they had a rescue plan, which was Hezbollah, which was Iran, which was Russia, and those vicious Russian airstrikes that killed so many civilians in rebel held territory.This time around, there was a fundamental in the psyche, the confidence wasn't there that the support team, that the rescuers would come once again and essentially save Bashar al-Assad and his regime from its now seemingly inevitable fate. What exactly contributed to that psychological shift? How it is possible that the rebels were able, in a matter of nine days to take the entire country while barely, I won't say barely firing a shot, because there were places where there were some pitched battles, particularly in Homs, but these were no longer than a day. And somehow we see these images on social media of regime soldiers taking off their uniforms, putting them on the floor, and just trying to melt into the background because the fight was no longer there. The desire, the will was just no longer there. How the rebels could have anticipated this moment, what help they may have had almost certainly have had from outside forces. These are the kinds of things that we will start to learn in the coming days. But for most Syrians tonight and for the residents of Damascus tonight, the primary focus is on the joy of being free of Bashar al- Assad and the fear and concern of what comes next.",

I think also for those of us who watch Syria closely, it's an open secret that the Russians were very frustrated with Bashar al-Assad, that they were very frustrated with his regime as a whole, that they felt like they needed to do a lot of work to keep propping it up, that they were sick and tired of the fundamental dysfunction, corruption of this kleptocracy.And so there were many reasons that may have contributed to their decision to ultimately not put the full force of their weight behind rescuing Bashar al-Assad once again. And almost certainly the war in Ukraine will have been a factor in that. But I think part of it as well, honestly, Wolf, is that they saw the writing on the wall, that this just wasn't happening this time, that the army wasn't willing to fight, that the people were ready and waiting for something new. And it happened at such a speed that I think, frankly, their primary focus has been on trying to get their personnel out, protect their assets here. Of course, it's important to remember they have this port on the Mediterranean, Tartus and Latakia, that is a crucial asset for them strategically. And so they will be very much focused on trying to protect that and make sure that nothing, you know, that there are no attacks against them and that is not in any way threatened.",

      "sentences": "It is an incredibly powerful moment for them. And those scenes were actually on the Lebanese side of the border, where obviously the security situation is much calmer, and so they felt more comfortable. And there's no curfew. So they were out on the streets, they were cheering, they were passing out candies, they were hugging each other, they were setting off fireworks. They were just, honestly, it was an electric atmosphere. People truly jubilant.And they see this as a victory of the people, a victory for the people and for many of them who are deeply conservative, a victory from God. Now, I do think it's important to underscore that Syria is not a monolith. There are many different minorities represented here, and it would be a lie to pretend that it's the case that every single person in Syria is celebrating tonight. There are a lot of people who are probably worried, particularly members of the Alawite community. Bashar al-Assad is part of this, forgive me, of this minority group, a minority ruling a majority for many years. And so many Alawites will now be concerned, potentially, that they will face reprisals. Many Christians who have also often stood with the regime or sort of silently being seen as apologists for the regime, may also be worried. And that's why you've seen the rebels and you've seen Jolani, the head of Hay'at Tahrir al-Sham, who spoke with my colleague Jomana Karadsheh and Halep (ph), just in Aleppo, sorry, just a few days ago, really take pains to make it clear that the mission of this new face of the rebellion is to be inclusive, is to be pluralistic, and really trying to make it clear to those minority groups that they are part of Syria, that they are welcome, that they will not face any reprisals. But for some, of course, when you look at the initial original makeup of some of these rebel groups, there are still a lot of suspicions and there will be worries and there will be concerns. And there has been so much bloodshed here, Wolf, over the course of the last 14 years that it is difficult in a moment like this for everybody to come together, to take a deep breath, to not kind of revert to the instinct to take revenge for so much of what has transpired here. And that will take a huge amount of logistics, a huge amount of discipline, and a huge amount of generosity in the coming weeks and months.",

Here now the regime of Bashar al-Assad has fallen. This is a momentous, mind blowing, frankly, historic moment. And there's no way of getting around that, and there's no way of extricating it or seeing it separately from the events, honestly, that have transpired since October 7th. So often in this region, you will see that the domino effect, the ripple effect. And what's scary is that you never know what the next shoe to drop will be. And I don't think anyone could tell you that they ever expected that Assad would fall in a matter of less than two weeks. And yet here we are in this moment.

Hugely important because if he's still trying to hold out and form up some kind of resistance inside of Syria, as wild an idea as that might be, that was a worry.What we have learned now, the Russian state media TASS is saying that Assad and his family have landed in Moscow. The Russian state has agreed to give them asylum for humanitarian reasons. So we know now know the fate of Assad. He fled yesterday during the day from Damascus. He fled to the Russian air base in the northwest of Lebanon. And then today he has been transported to Moscow and this appears to be now where he'll end his days. What value Russia thinks he has for them going forward is unclear. Of course, those two major bases inside of Syria, the Tartars, the major Mediterranean warm water port facility, a vital strategic interest for Russia. Russia is something they'll be watching closely. We understand Russia already pulling some of its assets out of there. And that airbase near Latakia, that Assad will have flown out of earlier today, that also vital strategic interest. Does having ownership of Assad parlay something for the Russians for their interests in Syria going forward? That's very unclear. But what is clear now is Assad is no longer in Syria.

They've put in place a curfew in the cities across the country, a very long curfew through the hours of darkness. That should really tamp down any looting and any sort of wanton destruction, anger at the Assad regime.But, I'm struck by looking at some of the images. One of the things on the top of the agenda for the rebels has been to free prisoners from some of the most notorious jails in Syria, like Sednaya, the jail in Damascus, long -- a place for where Assad put and killed and tortured opposition members anyone who stepped out of line. You know, one account of a prisoner freed from there, he was put in jail for 10 years, being conscripted into the army to fight for Assad, didn't want to fight, tried to sort of get out of the country, was caught and put in jail. But the images that we're seeing, Wolf, are so reminiscent of what we saw in Iraq in 2003 when the United States overthrew Saddam Hussein. There were people so desperate looking for family members in Assad jails. They were literally pulling the drain covers off in roads, thinking that there were hidden jails down there. And we've seen similar images this evening coming from the Saydnaya Jail, where people are literally breaking down walls with hammers. It's a sort of underground areas within the jail, wondering if there are people trapped in there, wondering, you know, where all the disappeared people are. One prisoner who was released gave an account on the streets today of some 60 prisoners being taken out of their cells just yesterday by guards with shotguns. And he understood that they were being taken away for potentially for execution. That was the level of brutality. So, we're seeing scenes and emotions similar to the overthrow of that brutal dictator, Saddam Hussein in 2003, who came from the same mindset, the same political set, the Baathist Party, as Assad and his father, Hafez al-Assad. This is an absolutely monumental moment in the history of Syria and potentially for the region, too. And it cannot be understated. He here was a dynastic dynasty of brutal dictators that were still alive, I mean, still on the fringes, just across the border from Turkey, on the fringes of Europe, if you will. This was still going on and existed. And now the lid's been taken off of that. The opportunities, obviously, are huge. The pitfalls are massive. The chances of misunderstanding and miscalculation by potential friends, potential enemies in the region, around the world, again, is huge. But the trajectory that we've heard so far laid out by the rebel leadership and other politicians who I've spoken to is one that aspires to a smooth and calm transition. And I think the curfew is the first step towards that. So much further to go there, Wolf.",

      "sentences": "Wolf, the president delivered equal parts victory lap and roadmap in that statement from the Roosevelt Room there, talking about the actions that his administration has taken up to this point to weaken the would be backers of the Assad regime, essentially to provide the environment in which a rebel group could overthrow it, and essentially suggesting that work is what allowed this current situation to take place.And then he also offered some insight into what comes next, while acknowledging that there are so many unknowns about exactly what will take place in the days and weeks and months to come as new leadership gains a foothold in Syria. But he said that the United States is going to be supporting a United Nations organized process to transition power there. But he also called on other opposition groups within Syria to make their voices heard and to step into the void, a sort of tacit recognition that the U.S. while happy about the fact that Assad is no longer in power, does not necessarily support the rebel groups that have overthrown him. He said that the U.S. is going to be supporting Syria's neighbors, that he'll be speaking to leaders in the region in the coming days and sending members of his own administration to continue that work in person. And that the U.S. military is also going to be working strategically to try to prevent any resurgence of ISIS in the region. We know that there are some ties by this group given its it was born out of essentially an Al Qaeda branch, that there are real concerns about what its ideology is and what it will pursue and how it will govern going forward. The president noting that the U.S. military carried out precision strikes on ISIS facilities in Syria just in recent days even while this offensive was going on. So clearly that work by U.S. troops there will continue. And of course, we imagine that the president and his team will be engaging with the United Nations as well to figure out this day after plan for what comes next in the region. So interesting to hear the president talking about all of that, both what has happened up until now and what will come going forward, even while acknowledging there's still so much they don't know, Wolf. BLITZER: And he did say, the president of the United States, that the United States will continue to support Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Israel in the aftermath of what has happened in Damascus right now in Syria. Kayla, standby. I'm going to get back to you. I want to bring in Fred Pleitgen, our international correspondent, who's now in Moscow where just a little while ago, as you know, Fred, the Russian state media organization TASS reported that Bashar al- Assad, the now former dictator, the former leader of Syria and his family have arrived in Moscow and they've been granted asylum in Russia as well. Give us the latest. What else is what else are you hearing over there?",
