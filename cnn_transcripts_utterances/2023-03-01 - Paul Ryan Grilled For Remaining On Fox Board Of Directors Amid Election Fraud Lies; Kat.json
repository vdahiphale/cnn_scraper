The problem is, is that process itself becomes corrupting?Your belief that you can change the culture, the culture ultimately eats you for breakfast. And look, let's be honest. You know, part of the problem we're seeing in Fox is a version of what we're seeing in the Republican Party. It's a form of Stockholm syndrome. It's driven by fear and greed. And for Paul Ryan being on the news corporation as part of his retirement package, he clearly hopes that Fox can reform itself. But everything we've seen from discovery suggests that this is marrow deep inside the culture, that the people who are trying to tell the truth were the outliers. And so, I don't know who is -- he's fooling himself on this one. CAMEROTA:  He makes $335,000 a year as a board member on the Fox board. A lot of that is in stock.

It left Fox, it left the GOP, it left CPAC, it's gone, because Trump convinced all of those entities to jettison it, so that Trump and Trumpism could be at the center of all of these universes. And so, he is hoping to restore something that isn't there anymore. And because Fox has become so beholden to its viewers, as we now all know, they have no incentive to restore conservatism because the viewers don't want it. Now, they're here for the culture wars and the conspiracy theories. And Fox is going to keep doubling and tripling down on that diet. So, I don't think Paul is disingenuous.
