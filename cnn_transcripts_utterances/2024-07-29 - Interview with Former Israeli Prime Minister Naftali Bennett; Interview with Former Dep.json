Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, it's been over nine months since the horrors of October 7th. Nine months of war in Gaza. Nine months of pain for thousands of families. And now, more than ever, it's clear that children are paying the highest price. In the Israeli occupied Golan Heights, 12 children were killed Saturday in a rocket attack that hit a soccer field where they were playing. And at the same time in Gaza, children were killed in Israeli attacks that left at least 19 people dead. Israel has blamed Hezbollah for the rocket attack in the Golan Heights and has vowed that the militant group will pay a price. Hezbollah has firmly denied that it was behind the strike. The rocket hit the village of Majdal Shams with Prime Minister Netanyahu visiting the site this afternoon. He was met with jeers amid protesters there and protests from residents. One sign reads, down to those who are killing kids. Well, with fears of a full-blown war in the region once again at dangerous levels, foreign leaders are scrambling to de-escalate tensions. Several European countries have called for their citizens to urgently leave Lebanon. And that's where we find our correspondent Ben Wedeman, who is joining us from Beirut now. So, Ben, just to recap, 12 children killed in the attack, 44 injured after approximately 30 projectiles crossed into the Golan Heights. As we noted, Hezbollah has denied the attack. Israel says it is Hezbollah, has even identified the rocket made by Iran and publicized the name of the local Hezbollah commander responsible for the strike. U.S. secretary of state said there's every indication the rocket was from Hezbollah. A lot has happened over the last 24 hours, walk us through where things stand right now.",

And we've seen this trend every time there's an election or a big important politicalaspect within the country, and Maduro stays in power, people get their bags and start to leave the country. And that will mean probably a much bigger influx on the southern border. We already have 8 million Venezuelans across the world. There's an 8 million population of diaspora, which, by the way, yesterday was not allowed to vote. Of those eight million people, 4.5, almost 5 million people were able -- would be able to vote, but the Maduro regime created so many obstacles in place to impede that as well, because those people who already fled, they voted with their feet. So, he did not want those votes to come in at any time. So, I think it's important to understand that if Maduro stays in power, migration will continue without a doubt.",

And Kamala Harris just put out this video. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE:  Hey, everybody. So, today, Iowa put in place a Trump abortion ban, which makes Iowa the 22nd state in our country to have a Trump abortion ban. And this ban is going to take effect before many women even know they're pregnant. And what this means is that one in three women of reproductive age in America lives in a state with a Trump abortion ban. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Wade or entrench it, but also, because conservatives part -- as part of Project 2025 have argued that federal law might already prohibit abortion. In other words, that states that want to permit abortion may not be able to do so, regardless of what Congress does, because of the Comstock Act, a 19th century law that Project 2025 features prominently. So, we're at a point not only where voters can register that they were unhappy with what happened when Roe v. Wade was overturned, but where voters will also have a say in what happens next. It's not just a question of whether we're going to stay with the status quo with this -- the nation divided between states that permit and do not permit abortion, we're going to see abortion opponents push even further to try to get something at the federal level, likely through executive action rather than through Congress.",

I think passing strong protections for abortion rights will be hard given that Congress will likely be very, very divided, if Democrats are able to gain majorities at all. At the same time, I think it's really important for Vice President Harris to lay out what the goal is, like, what's -- what are we aspiring to if you're a Democrat or an abortion rights supporter.

Vance saying that there either needs to be a new national ban or, again, that this zombie law, the Comstock Act already is a national ban. When asked himself, Donald Trump's kind of punted, right? So, in a \"Time\" magazine interview, Trump would not answer whether he would veto a national ban, whether he would enforce the Comstock Act as a ban, he's just never answered the question. So, we really have no idea what we would get from a second Trump administration. What we do know is that certain things are possible in a second Trump administration that would never have been possible before. So, I think voters need to take into account the fact that they may not have any certainty about what a second Trump administration would mean, but they do know what it could mean, and that would be prohibitions that would have effects not just in states that already prohibit abortion, but in places that have passed ballot initiatives in states that are progressive, in states that are battlegrounds, all of that is possible.

So, my family is from Owsley County, Kentucky. It is one of the poorest counties in America by household income, and it really took three generations of women in my family working really hard to create those opportunities for me. That doesn't fit as nicely into a movie or into sort of that uplifting narrative. I don't think I really knew that I had a story worth telling, honestly, until I read \"Hillbilly Elegy.\" At first, I was really excited to read the book. It was written based in a county, one county over from where I grew up. I never thought that I would write a book.

We actually passed a law this past legislative session that was championed by a rural Republican around making sure that local governments had more tools to bring child care centers in. When we look at the impact of women in particular, but also families, the economic impact of not having access to quality and affordable child care, it's a huge hit for those families economically, it's a huge hit for communities.

And so, with eviction, if we hold all other things equal, people in rural areas are 55 percent more likely to have their eviction case proceed to judgment. And so, we don't exactly know why, I have some theories. People in rural areas are less likely to have attorneys. We have a lot of legal deserts. There are fewer nonprofits to sort of swoop in and be able to help support people. Court systems have fewer nonprofits coming in to set up these early interventions. But at the end of the day, it means that we have a lot of folks in rural communities experiencing housing instability and we don't see it. It's one of those things that we don't talk about enough.
