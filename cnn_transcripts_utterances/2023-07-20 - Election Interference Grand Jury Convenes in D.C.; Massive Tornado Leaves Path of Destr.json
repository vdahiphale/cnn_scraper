Right now, a federal grand jury is meeting in this Washington, D.C., and those jurors would be the ones to hand up a criminal indictment against former President Trump over efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.Today is also the last day for the former president to respond to the special counsel's target letter to appear and testify before that grand jury. That is the thing that is least likely to happen today. But in the face of this growing trouble, Donald Trump is now expanding his legal team, adding Criminal Defense Attorney John Lauro to the roster. CNN has also learned this man, Will Russell is his name, he's a special assistant to Donald Trump, he will testify to the grand jury for a third time today. CNN's Katelyn Polantz and Paula Reid, they're standing by for us to start us off this hour. Katelyn, I want to go first to you. You are outside the courthouse. Last hour, when we checked in, proceedings, the grand jury was really just getting seated and things were just getting under way. So, what's happening right now?",

That grand jury is behind closed doors at the federal courthouse here in D.C. with at least one prosecutor of the special prosecutor's office that we've seen so far. And they have work to do today.The reason we say that is because we know there is at least one witness coming in to testify today, a man named Will Russell, a personal aide to Trump, someone who also worked in the White House, who has testified to this grand jury twice already at least, and so has provided evidence. He is due to be coming back here today with his attorney today to talk to them one more time. We don't know exactly what it would be about, but he would just be adding to much of the evidence that the grand jury has already heard over several months from the witnesses both known and unknown to Donald Trump, now that Donald Trump expects to be indicted. And you mention that additional lawyer added to Trump's team, John Lauro. He would be a defense attorney that has worked with witnesses who are attorneys for Trump on the documents case in Florida, that separate indictment brought from the special counsel's office. But he is getting involved on the January 6th case, because there's a lot of work to do when you something this sprawling, when an indictment is expected in this way. There's a lot of coordination that has to happen both on the legal side as well as just understanding the amount of witnesses, the amount of evidence that has already been presented to that grand jury and may make it into the indictment at this point.

And even if the former president's lawyers got a few minutes heads-up that we would learn about it at the same time. But that's just not the way this has transpired.A lot of what we've learned is when the former president announces, right, that he has been informed, that he's a target, or he's been informed that he has been indicted and then there's been a lag before we actually got the indictment. Now, the Mar-a-Lago indictment, Kate, was very detailed. We learned a lot there. And it's unclear if that choreography, right, that rollout will be the same here. We find out from Trump, he's been informed that he'll be indicted, and then we have a few days before we actually get to see the details that support the charges. And I reiterate, this is a choice by the special counsel. I mean, he is giving the former president, defendant of the Mar-a-Lago case, potentially here the opportunity to tell the story before the facts are known to the public.",

SOLOMONAnd in the target letter sent to former President Trump, according to The New York Times, the special counsel noted that Trump was being investigated under Section 241 of Title 18 of the United States Code. With me now to talk more about that and more is Nick Akerman. He is former assistant Watergate prosecutor and former assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Nick, great to have you certainly on a day like today. I want to start there, Section 241 of Title 18. It basically says it is a crime to deprive U.S. citizens of any legal right or privilege. How do you think the special counsel applies that here? NICK AKERMAN, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHER DISTRICT OF NEW YORK:  Well, he applies it here because what he is going to charge is a conspiracy to deprive the American public of their right to vote, their right to have handed in their votes which elected Joe Biden as president of the United States. It is a very compelling jury argument to be able to argue that what Donald Trump did was basically to try and deprive all of you of your right to vote in the 2020 election. And I might add that this is really kind of the same central theme of the indictment that was filed in New York by the Manhattan district attorney. If you look at paragraph one of the statement of facts in that indictment, let me read from that, it alleges the defendant, Donald J. Trump, repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hide damaging information from voting public during the 2016 presidential election. In essence, what they are saying in New York is that you have also deprived the voting public of their right to know very material information that would have a bearing on how you would vote. So, you have got in New York a charge that basically sets up Donald Trump as having deprived voters in the 2016 election of material information and you've got now the current indictment which may likely charge Donald Trump with having conspired to try and deprive the voters of their vote for Joe Biden in the 2020 election.",

Tuberville is a man alone in the Senate really at this moment. Most others say blocking the military promotions, not the right way to go about it, and also could endanger national security. Tuberville says that he spoke to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin twice in the last week, still nothing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. TOMMY TUBERVILLE (R-AL):  Both conversations were very cordial.

He's not backing down. So, how is this going to end? SEN. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-IL):  Well, we keep offering him all sorts of options. We offered him a vote on the defense budget, the NDAA, which is the authorization for the National Defense Budget, on Senator Joni Ernst's amendment, which is actually far stricter than what he's asking for. He declined that vote overnight last night. I believe Majority Leader Schumer offered Senator Tuberville a vote on the floor when the NDAA comes to the floor for a vote on an amendment that would repeal this policy, exactly what he says, he wants to be done, but he's rejecting that vote. So, I don't know where he's going with this. I think President Biden is spot on when he says that Senator Tuberville's actions are bizarre, because he's been given all sorts of options and he turns every single one of them down. I think that his motives are much more insidious than that. I think it's bizarre when someone claims to put America first, and unless I get my way on every political issue, I'm going to make it hard of our military to keep this country safe.

One of the sticking points is over the pilot shortage that folks have been reporting on and talking about all over the country and the proposed fixes to that.What's been put out as a potential fix includes changes to the 1,500- hour rule, which is the minimum of flight hours required for pilot training, to broad-strokes it. You have said reducing those hours. People are -- if those hours are reduced, if that 1,500-hour rule is changed, that people are going to have blood on their hands because an accident is inevitable. The rest of the world, flying world, requires far fewer hours than what we see in the United States in terms of the FAA. How do you fix a pilot shortage then without changes like this? DUCKWORTH:  Well, you know, if there were not enough doctors in this country, and I'm going to paraphrase Captain Sullenberger from the Miracle of on the Hudson, and he said if there were not enough doctors in this country, it's a solution to say, okay, let's just make medical school two years long and we'll just graduate you after two years. Now, you can go and operate on patients. No, that's not the answer. The answer is not to reduce the safety of our flying public. The answer is to invest more in pilot training, which is why I've included in this FAA reauthorization, in a bipartisan way, by the way, with Senator Moran, who's my ranking member, a tripling of the funding for the grant program to train new pilots, a tripling of the funding program to train new mechanics.

And the only thing that has stopped those near misses from happening has actually been pilots, pilot training. That is absolutely critical.So, the solution to our pilot shortage is not let's just put more inexperienced pilots into the front of the aircraft to fly the flying public. The answer is what can we do to increase more pilots in the pipeline. Let's add more pilots into the pipeline so we can address this issue. Listen, we've not had a single aviation fatality due to pilot error in the ten-plus years since we've had the 1,500-hour rule. Now is not the time when our air traffic is absolutely maxed out.
