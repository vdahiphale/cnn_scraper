President Biden's son, Hunter, pleading guilty to all nine charges in his federal tax evasion case. Elon's style efficiency. Donald Trump says the Tesla boss has agreed to lead a government body tasked with cutting waste. Storm surge. Super Typhoon Yagi growing in strength as it heads towards the Chinese Coast. And Christie's christening, the auction house celebrating the opening of its new Hong Kong HQ with a masterpiece moment. That conversation and plenty more coming up. But first, the judge in Hunter Biden's federal tax evasion case in California has accepted his offer to plead guilty to all nine charges. The dramatic admission of guilt comes after the U.S. president's son had first attempted to make a plea that would maintain his innocence. Prosecutors accused him of failing to pay $1.4 million in taxes. They say he instead spent money on luxury cars, extravagant hotels, and sex workers. CNN Legal Analyst Jennifer Rodgers joins us now. Jennifer, this has been a day of pretty astonishing legal wrangling, I think, as I mentioned there. It started with Hunter trying to maintain his innocence, but also accepting some form of punishment. And it ended with him pleading guilty without any kind of leniency deal. What happened? JENNIFER RODGERS, CNN LEGAL ANALYST AND FORMER U.S. FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  Yes, it's really unusual, Julia. He tried to put in what's called an Alford plea, which is a no contest plea. It's when they say, listen, I'm not going to admit that I'm guilty, but I'm willing to go ahead and be sentenced on these charges. So, that's what the first gambit was. But DOJ objected and ultimately, said they wouldn't take that plea. So, then he had to plead what's called pleading open. He just pled to the indictment as is with no deal in place. It means the judge will sentence him without any sort of leniency. Although, it also means that he still avoids a trial. So, to the extent that there were lots of damaging things that were going to come out at trial, of course, that won't come into the public sphere, but also, the judge won't sit there through all of that testimony. So, he may think that he has a little bit of an advantage now at sentencing because all of that damaging information won't come out, but we'll have to see on that one.",

So, he could, if he wished, although again, as you said, he has promised he will not, but he could pardon him altogether. Say these two federal convictions, this tax offense and the prior gun conviction are going to be wiped away, or he could provide clemency, which is to say the convictions would stay in place, but he would commute any prison sentence. He hasn't yet been sentenced in either case, but he could commute those sentences so that Hunter Biden would still have those convictions, but not go to prison for them. So, those things are technically on the table. Again, he has said he wouldn't do anything, but as you point out, he won't be serving a second term. So, we'll see if anything like that happens.",

So, it's Judge Chutkan's job to make sure that this indictment wouldn't do any of those things, that the Supreme Court has now prohibited. And so, to do that, she has to understand more about what the proof will be and what proof there is to support the charges. So, there's really no way to do this without learning about a lot of this evidence. And I think the choice really was between doing it on the papers, as she has decided to do, or do it in a hearing, which would have been even more explosive. Of course, she also could have opted to do what the Trump team wanted her to do, is to push the whole thing after the election. But as she pointed out, her job really doesn't have anything to do with the election. She's charged with moving this case forward and the fact that he's a presidential candidate doesn't have anything to do with moving this case forward, which, of course, is about what he did while he was president. So, that's what we're going to see. It should be very interesting transcripts of witness testimony, documentary evidence. We could see a lot of different things. The problem is, we don't know exactly what, because much of it was not part of the public presentations that were made by the January 6th Committee in the House of Representatives. So, you know, it's anyone's guess as to what it is, other than, of course, it's evidence relating to the charges in the indictment.",

None other than billionaire businessman and now Trump supporter Elon Musk. Trump delivered what was billed as a major economic speech in New York on Thursday. He outlined his proposals to boost energy output, ease inflation, and lower taxes. He says he'll build a sovereign wealth fund to help pay for infrastructure projects.

We got a lot of buybacks and dividend payments that benefited the top 10 percent that owns 85 percent of the shares. You know, we've heard a lot about tariffs. You know, there are good geopolitical reasons for some of the proposals that he has. But across the board, tariffs -- you know, not just on China, but on allies, is a recipe for disaster. And I would also look at the immigration part of Trump's economic plans and say, that's very worrisome because one of the reasons that the U.S. economy has done so well in the last few years is that we've had good levels of immigration. That's just the fact of it. I just don't see a coherent plan here. What I see is a lot of desperate proposals coming at a time when Kamala Harris is rising in swing states.

I've written a couple of columns saying that I would actually like to see less air between what the previous -- what this administration has done, Biden- Harris, and what Kamala Harris might do on her own. Right now, I'm seeing a little bit more ad hocness, you know, there's -- we're very close to the election, she hasn't had a lot of time to lay out policies, and that's, frankly, politically probably the right thing to do. But going forward, she's going to need more systems thinking. She's going to need to look at something like, for example, childcare. This is a passion point for her. She wants to improve the ability of Americans to pay for childcare by increasing tax credits. That's great. But you're also going to have to look at things like the fact that private equity owns eight out of the 11 largest childcare centers in America. That's part of a larger monopoly problem in America. You know, where does she stand on those things? Those are I'm looking at. But in terms of debt, look, you're raising a great point, and it's something that both parties are going to have to answer for. But I would make this point, whoever and however you're going to pay for debt, you need growth to do it.

There are so many tall buildings in that city, 2 to 3 million people in that and the suburbs will be hit by these 180, 220-kilometer per hour winds and those high buildings aren't a good sign. The higher you get into a hurricane, the higher the wind speed is as well. There's an awful lot going on here. Yes, it will probably miss most of Hanoi, but we're still going to get significant rainfall here.

We've had experiences back in the '80s and '90s where the steel companies restructured their businesses, bought other companies with the profits that the steel sector brought to them, and then went bankrupt. And that's why in the early 2000s, all our collective bargaining agreements in the steel industry required the ultimate parent to sign on so that our members weren't left with pensions going back to the PBGC or losing their entire health care because the companies no longer existed. Nippon was aware of it. U.S. Steel is aware of it, they simply ignored it. And there are real concerns for us about what their plan that they announced on the day of the transaction would be in terms of national security and critical supply chain issues. They clearly said that they would be transferring work out of where we make blasphemous material, blasphemous products to EAF, electric arc furnace facilities. And there's certain products that cannot be made in EAF, such as tin products. You buy a can of food, it's made out of tin. It has to be made in a blasphemous.

The FBI Atlanta and the Jackson County Sheriff's Office said in a joint statement that they have received tips about online threats in May of 2023 and tracked then 13-year-old Gray as a possible subject and interviewed him. The subject denied making the threats online. The father stated he had hunting guns in the house, but the subject did not have unsupervised access to them, and there was no probable cause for arrest or further action at the time according to their statement. This afternoon, CNN obtained the incident report from Jackson County detailing that interview. Colt express concerned that someone is accusing him of threatening to shoot up a school, stating that he would never say such a thing, even in a joking manner. Jackson County alerted local schools for continued monitoring, but Gray later moved to neighboring Barrow County, where the shooting occurred. That's where law enforcement sources tell CNN authorities found writings in Gray's bedroom, they believe he wrote referencing the 2018 Parkland, Florida high school shooting massacre. Georgia Bureau of Investigation said the gun used in the school shooting was an AR platform weapon.

I saw some of the Chinese tools that you're using, whether it's on WeChat or Douyin, of course, which is like the TikTok equivalent.

We have to move away from physicalpresentation of objects and supporting transaction physically to, you know, moving into digital world. And now, in a world where both physical and the digital world actually emerged. We had last year 80 percent of our bids globally being placed online, whether it's our online set, but also our live sound. So, digital innovation is absolutely core to our strategy. And I would say even more so in Asia, where we structurally have a younger audience, we account for 40 to 60 percent of the new buyers, the Gen Z buyers, the millennial buyers, you know, depending on how you get it and which period you're looking at, and this is multiple of, you know, the -- you know, what Asia is accounting for the global buying base. So, innovating in platforms across the world for us is key and being relevant to our audience in Asia is equally key. And you gave some of the names of the platform. We are very active. There's another Little Red Books, Xiaohongshu, which is really getting a lot of traction for us here. So, this is important for us to remain relevant and engaging with the new collectors that we see across the region.",

Because I was there in Hong Kong earlier this year, and I was blown away, actually, by the relative freedom and quality of the art that I saw. I mean, M+ was one of the places that I visited.

On Wednesday, let's recap. We witnessed an amazing performance from Jessica Pegula, one of those billionaires' daughters. Her father, Terrence, actually owning the Buffalo Bills and the Sabers. Jessica was so impressive against top ranked Iga Swiatek. After a long wait, she's now broken through to reach her first Grand Slam semifinal, upsetting world number one and five-time Grand Slam champ Swiatek. Two and four at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Wednesday night, just massive relief for the American. Why? Because she was previously 0 and 6 in Grand Slam quarterfinals. Well, she next faces the unseeded Karolina Muchova in the semifinals, the 28-year-old Czech, dangerous opponent. She booked her spot in her second consecutive U.S. Open semi with a 6-1, 6-4 victory against the 22-year-old two seeded Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil. That was earlier on Wednesday. Now, Pegula joining fellow American number 13 seed Emma Navarro in the semifinals tonight. Navarro is the daughter of a U.S. businessman, billionaire Ben Navarro. Emma at 23, through to her first major semifinal and she has a really tough task in her match because it begins in just a few moments from right now. Who is she taking on? She's taking on Aryna Sabalenka of Belarus, who is many people's favorites to win this tournament, including mine. She's also back-to-back as the Aussie Open Champ. Aryna is in the U.S. Open semis for the fourth year in a row, Julia. She was runner up last year as well to Coco Gauff. So, I do believe that she feels she has unfinished business in the Big Apple given that defeat to Coco in the final 12 months ago. Navarro has nothing to lose, though, and I do expect her to make this a close fought contest. Julia, back to you. It's an exciting night ahead in New York.",
