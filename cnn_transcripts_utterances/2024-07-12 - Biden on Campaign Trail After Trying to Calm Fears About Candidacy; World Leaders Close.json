As soon as Biden finished speaking last night, three more Democratic lawmakers called for him to step aside, including the top Democrat on the House Intel Committee, Congressman Jim Himes.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

You mentioned the three additional Democrats who have since come out against the president. And it's not just elected officials. It's also some of his critical constituencies. Right before that press conference, it was reported that the United Auto Workers were having second thoughts about endorsing Biden, whom they endorsed last fall after he joined them on the picket lines, because they had doubts about his ability to beat Trump. But when a reporter asked Biden about that possibility and about the potential to lose the support of the UAW, Biden appeared to be learning that for the first time and appeared surprised and said the UAW endorsed me. That's going to be a key question when he goes to Michigan today. He's been trying to shore up support among labor leaders this week, but, of course, that is critical for him to deliver the state of Michigan.",

      "sentences": "So, now to the reporting on former President Obama and former Speaker Nancy Pelosi. CNN has exclusively learned that the two have talked privately to discuss concerns they have over Biden and how much harder they think it's become for Biden to beat Donald Trump. Neither sure what to do about it.CNN's Isaac Dovere broke this story, has all of this reporting. Isaac, thanks for coming in. What more are you learning? And has there been any reaction from Biden or those around him on this? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes, good morning, Kate. Look, President Obama and former Speaker Pelosi have been -- they have talked. They are worried about what they are seeing. They are not sure quite what to do about it. Nancy Pelosi has made pretty clear publicly that she doesn't think Biden should keep running. Barack Obama taking a very hands-off, so far, approach dealing with Biden, trying to figure out how to manage that dynamic. And that is coming at a point when a lot of Democrats feel like no matter what happens here, they need to get to an end point of this discussion and put the focus back on trying to beat Donald Trump. They think that these two are the people who might be able to get to that end point, a lot of them hoping that that end point would be Biden leaving the race. Someone who speaks to Obama regularly saying to me that his approach to it will be that he's going to be all in for the Democratic ticket. No matter who our nominee is, he will be busting his, you know what, it's morning television, helping to make sure that person wins in November. I think, Kate, to note there, that is not someone saying he will be doing that necessarily for Joe Biden, whoever the nominee is. And these sorts of comments fall on Biden loyalists as betrayals, to an extent, and is not the kind of thing that they are hoping to hear from people that Joe Biden has been friends and partners with for many years.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, with Barack Obama, a lot of this tracks back to their long and complicated relationship. Part of the reason why Obama chose him for the ticket in 2008 is because Obama didn't think he would run for president ever. Then in 2015, in the summer after Beau Biden, the president's son, died there, Biden was looking at jumping into the race at the last minute. At that point, he has written -- Biden has written since then that he felt like Barack Obama was not encouraging of him running.Obama's view of what happened there I'm told is different from that. That he was more saying to Biden, focus on your grieving, think about how hard this race would be. But that means, to a lot of people who know Joe Biden, that they think that his reaction if Barack Obama comes to him and says, you've got to step out of the race, would be something, as one person put it to me, that it would be like saying that Biden's response would be, well, Mr. President, you used that chip in 2015, you got me not to run them, and that's what brought us Donald Trump. So, really, that might lead to him digging in more.",

So, just this morning, AT&amp;T disclosed that back in April, it learned of an illegal download of data. The company says they immediately launched an investigation, and that investigation has determined that the incident exposed the call and text message records of, quote, nearly all of its cellular customers and the customers of other wireless networks that use its network. This was between May 1st of 2022 and the end of October 2022.Now, landline customers who interacted with those cell numbers also impacted here. Now, it's really important to note. That's what we're going to talk AT&amp;T says that at this point, it does not believe that the data is publicly available. But, of course, that could change --",

Thankfully, AT&amp;T says that the content of calls and text messages is not included in this breach, nor are the Social Security numbers or the names of the accounts.Now, that, of course, is good because that would be really even more disastrous. But what is included is the phone numbers, and AT&amp;T acknowledges that there are publicly available tools that can link phone numbers to names of people. So, let me just give you an example. This would not show, let's say, that you called me at 6:00 P.M. last night, if that were the case, right? It would not say that we talked for 90 minutes or anything like that. But it could show that my number and your number connected dozens of times over the last few months and for a total of three hours. And, obviously, that could be potentially sensitive information. Look, this impacts a lot of people. At the end of 2022, AT&amp;T listed about 110 million wireless subscribers just for that company alone. Again, that doesn't include the landline customers and other cell phone customers. AT&amp;T, they're promising to notify current and former customers who were impacted and provide them support. The company says in a statement, quote, we sincerely regret this incident occurred and remain committed to protecting the information in our care. Another thing here that's interesting here, Kate, is the timing. Remember, I said AT&amp;T actually learned about this back in April, but they're only disclosing this now. The company explained that back in May and again in June, the Justice Department determined that a delay in disclosing this was warranted. We don't know exactly why that is. We're going to reach out to the Justice Department and find out more information there. But we do know that AT&amp;T says it's cooperating with law enforcement. And the company understands that at least one person believed to be involved in this incident has been apprehended.",
