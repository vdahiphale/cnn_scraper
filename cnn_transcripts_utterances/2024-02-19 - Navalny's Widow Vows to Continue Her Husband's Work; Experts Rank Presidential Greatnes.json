I just honestly think that these political scientists are biased and I want to just give you an understanding of why I think they might be biased. All right, so take a look. This is Trump in New Hampshire, right, because we can go down to the town level there. I just want to look at Dartmouth, that's Hanover, and UNH, that's Durham. And take a look here at Dartmouth. Look at this. Trump just got 13 percent of vote in the Republican primary. So, it's not just that you have a lot of Democrats there. Even the Republicans who are voting really don't like Trump. UNH, he just got 29 percent of the vote there in the Republican primary, 22 percent in the 2020 general election. So, the fact is, yes, Donald Trump is rate historically low by political scientists. But the fact is, they are amongst -- they are very liberal themselves. And even the Republicans in their ranks are not exactly Trump-friendly. So I'm not sure I exactly trust it, though Biden will certainly take his ranking over Donald Trump's 45th at that a full fit.",

Seung Min, CNN has -- CNN's Isaac Dovere has some really interesting new reporting about Vice President Kamala Harris, the role that she has had in the re-elect, but also it's more about how she is pushing to break through Biden's campaign information, quote/unquote, bubble, pushing to have a more prominent role in the campaign strategy. Let me read this for you. Multiple leading Democrats anxious about a campaign they fear might be stumbling past a point of no return, say their conversations with Harris have been a surprising and welcome change after months of feelings left off by the White House and Biden campaign headquarters and Wilmington, Delaware. There's a lot of talk about resets and if there's even time for resets for the Biden campaign.

And if she could -- and, you know, we know that she's taken a much more prominent role in the last couple of years within the White House, obviously being the administration's point person when it comes to abortion rights, we saw her take a big role in foreign policy at the Munich Security Forum over the weekend. And in terms of campaign strategy, if she could kind of be that bridge between the outside Democrats who want to tell her, you know, we're hearing these concerns in Michigan, we're hearing these concerns in Nevada, can you get our concerns to the president's inner circle and the campaign team, that certainly could be an effective role for her.",

If Donald Trump is elected president again, I don't think you're going to be able to see members of Congress effectively do that turn because he'll be calling the shots on the actual implementation of American policy.
