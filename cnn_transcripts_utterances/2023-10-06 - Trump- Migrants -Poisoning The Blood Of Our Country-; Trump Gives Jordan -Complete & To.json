      "sentences": "Tonight, straight from THE SOURCE.New reporting, on the behind-the-scenes shuffle that led to Donald Trump's late-night endorsement, in the House Speaker's race. He's not only deeply invested in who the next Speaker will be, but also how loyal that person will be to him. Plus, President Biden, facing backlash, from his own party. After reversing his immigration policy and building more of Trump's border wall, he says he had no choice. A senator, who once called that wall, \"Medieval,\" is here to respond. Also today, today's Nobel Peace Prize winner, sitting in jail, tonight, continuing to risk her life, from behind bars, fighting Iran's oppressive regime. What she wants the world to know? I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, I have new reporting, on how Donald Trump is viewing the race, for House Speaker, in terms of loyalty, to him alone. As he traveled, from a New York courtroom, back to his Mar-a-Lago club, this week, I'm told that Trump was paying very close attention, to the dramatic ouster, of the man that he often refers to as \"My Kevin.\" While Trump reveled in the idea of getting the gavel himself, he never really took that suggestion publicly. And instead, I'm told that he focused on making sure that the role is going to someone, who was loyal enough to him. He scoffed at the idea of some of these more moderate names that have been floated, like the Majority Whip, Tom Emmer, and others. Trump is actually looking to capitalize on the entire chaotic spectacle by going to Washington, next week, to endorse his pick, potentially, during that GOP meeting that is set to happen, on Tuesday. But that plan hit a brick wall, when Congressman Troy Nehls tweeted this, catching not only Trump, but his inner circle off-guard. He said, quote, \"Just had a great conversation with President Trump about the Speaker's race. He is endorsing Jim Jordan, and I believe Congress should listen to the leader of our party.\" Though Trump had been reluctant, to actually do so, publicly, at least, that Trump did force him to post his own, shortly after midnight, affirming that, yes, Jim Jordan does have his endorsement, in this race. For now, that trip to D.C. is scrapped. And so is a scheduled Fox debate, between the candidates, for the next House Speaker. That fell apart after fellow House Republicans were infuriated that they'd be debating, publicly, before actually doing so privately, within their own party, with one Republican lawmaker telling CNN, quote, \"People are pissed.\" It's just another sign of the tension that is happening, inside the GOP, right now, as Republicans are still scrambling, to find their new leader. And speaking of the former leader, Kevin McCarthy spoke today, denying reports that he is planning, on resigning from Congress. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): I'm not resigning. I got a lot more work to do, so.",

He clearly wants someone, who is loyal to him, as the next House Speaker. What influence, do you think he has, in actually deciding who they vote for, as soon as next week, potentially? ADAM KINZINGER, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE (R-IL), CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, HONORARY CHAIRMAN, COUNTRY FIRST PAC: Well he'll have significant influence. Because what this does is this sets off the right-wing echo chamber, where people will start tweeting, and people will start asking members of Congress, who they're going to vote for. And you can't play coy. You have to now say it publicly, because that's the pressure. And if you do anything, but Jim Jordan, you're a RINO. And that's of course, unacceptable to be a RINO, or a squish. And so, all the people that would normally be opposed, to Jim Jordan, start publicly coming on board. So, and it doesn't mean that Jim Jordan has this thing walking away.

I can't crawl inside Kevin McCarthy's head, and see what -- and think about what he would do. But I will say this. I think Trump's rolled the dice here. You can't be the self-proclaimed and apparent leader of the party, the front- runner for the nomination, interpose yourself in this fight, and not win it. So, he has a lot at stake here. The last thing that Trump wants to look like is a loser, as we know. And so, now, it's really on him, to try and deliver his guy. If he does, one thing, I think, will be for sure is that we will see a formal impeachment, of President Biden, during the next few months, because I think Trump will insist on it.",

And post that, when we wanted to talk to him, so.But I think this is just a matter of, Jim Jordan probably knows Donald Trump isn't running, and probably wants to just keep kissing Donald Trump's backside, because he knows that he can turn a lot of votes. And again, even if, in a secret ballot, which in the Conference itself, so in the meeting of just Republicans, it's a secret ballot. You only have to get half of the Conference to then be the quote- unquote, \"Republican name\" put forward. I think Jim Jordan gets that very easily. The question in this is are there five to 10 Republicans, so-called moderates that play the same game that the eight that deposed Kevin McCarthy played, and they simply refuse, under any condition, to vote for Jim Jordan? Particularly, because, this will doom Ukraine and, particularly, because, Jim Jordan, frankly, doesn't deserve it. So, that would be the question. And I don't know the answer to that yet.",

When protests rocked Iran, last year, after 22-year-old Mahsa Amini died, in the custody of the Regime's Morality Police, Mohammadi organized prison protest, and led weekly workshops, for female inmates, about their rights. Now, tension is once again brewing on the streets of Iran. Activists have accused the Morality Police, of assaulting a 16-year-old, who was not wearing a headscarf. She was seen collapsing, at a metro station. She has been in a coma, since Sunday. Iranian officials claim that she fainted, because of low blood pressure. But Mohammadi told CNN that the Regime is preventing the truth, from coming to light. I should note that CNN also received exclusive audio, from within her prison, before today's exciting announcement, where Mohammadi is heard, leading prisoners, in a chant of \"Women, Life, Freedom.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Just last month, the Department of Homeland Security announced that Protected Status, for migrants, from Venezuela, meaning they could stay, and work, in the United States, for 18 months. All of this, as President Biden, today, is defending violating a major campaign promise that he made, by resuming construction, on the southern border wall, with President Biden saying that it's because money was already approved, by Congress, in 2019 that he has to take this step. Meanwhile, we're also hearing, from Democratic mayors, in major cities, asking the federal government, for more help, as they are facing a wave of migrants, who are seeking asylum, in their cities.

Yes. And no one in Colorado would ever support that. I didn't support putting spikes on a wall. I didn't support putting alligators in a moat. I didn't support shooting people that were coming, across the border, all of which Donald Trump did. What I did support was the last comprehensive bill, immigration bill that we passed, in the Senate. There was the so-called Gang of Eight. I was one of the four Democrats, who negotiated that bill. That bill had a pathway to citizenship, for 11 million people. It had the most progressive DREAM Act we've ever written. Something forgotten is that it had $40 billion of border security, $40 billion. That's far more than Donald Trump ever spent on his wall. But it was modern border security. It was stuff that we developed, in Afghanistan and Iraq that could allow us to see every single inch of the border, and allow us to manage the border, in a proper, rational and humane way.

Well, no one can say that anymore. And McCarthy's gone. And McConnell has lost control of his caucus. And they were successful in stripping the aid out. And McCarthy thought he was doing that as a concession, to the right-wingers. And the right- wingers removed him anyway. So now, the Ukrainian aid is in the worst possible position ever. It's not in the bill. It's going to take an active act of Congress to put it back into the next funding bill. And there's no (ph) clear path on the House floor. And there's no promise, by Jim Jordan, or Steve Scalise, to bring it up to the House floor, in the first place. And if the funding doesn't come through, within a couple of weeks, or a couple of months, depending on who you ask, the Ukrainians are going to run out of money.
