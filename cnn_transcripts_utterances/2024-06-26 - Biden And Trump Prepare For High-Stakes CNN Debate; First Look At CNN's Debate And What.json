And tomorrow night, the country will tune into CNN for the most important political event of the calendar so far and possibly for all of this campaign, the CNN presidential debate. In just a few moments, a play by play of how exactly it will look and work on that stage where it'll all happen. And that includes a paint by numbers demo of the microphones and what it'll look like and sound like when one of the candidates breaches the rules that they've all agreed to and tries to talk over his opponent. But, first, the news tonight, Joe Biden plans to talk past Donald Trump and talk straight to you, the American. Voter sources are telling CNN that the president he wants to recreate some key moments from that 2020 debate when he bypassed the moderators, and he addressed the American people directly. Advisers say that that strategy is more important than ever this year. It is no secret, voters are less than enthusiastic about the choices that they face this year, and it's all about making it personal. Speaking of personal, though, the Biden campaign is also preparing for Trump to go there with attacks on his family and, of course, on Hunter Biden. Joining me now, one of the best sourced reporters and a longtime Trump watcher and biographer, Maggie Haberman of The New York Times. Maggie, what do you know tonight about how Trump is preparing in these last 24 hours before this debate?",

He has been engaging in policy sessions with a wide range of advisers and senators and people he's close to essentially to refresh his, his talking points about his administration and the accomplishments he wants to highlight and then also to figure out how to parry certain attacks.You know, he does not do debate prep, as we understand it, the way that President Biden does. For instance, President Biden does a pretty traditional debate prep, somebody behind a podium, somebody playing Donald Trump. As far as we know, there is nobody doing that now in terms of Biden, but I do think that there is a focus on how to parry aggressive questions from various directions.",

It's impossible that Trump's criminal conviction is not going to come up. Hunter Biden is not running for president, but Trump and his associates are very aware that it is a sore topic for President Biden. And I think they're going to look for opportunities to try to disrupt his performance or get under his skin.You are correct that in 2020 he was prepared for such an attack once before and that was specifically on Hunter Biden's drug use. I think this would be a little bit different. I'm also not sure how President Biden will react to that attack, I think, if it comes. I think that's a big question.",

[22And so they had been workshopping answers to those kinds of things. I mean, among the things that they had looked at, and this was about two weeks ago, was talking about the supposed internet censorship or efforts to regulate social media by the government.

At the moderator's discretion, there may be an additional minute for follow-ups, clarifications, or responses. So, how does a candidate know how much time is left to speak? Attached to the cameras in the studio and in the candidate's field of view are the timing lights. When the lights show yellow, there are 15 seconds left in a candidate's answer or response. When the lights flash red, there are 5 seconds left. And when the display is solid red, the time is up.

I think it's actually going to make a pretty big difference to your colleagues, to Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, because it'll give them some breathing room and some just peace and quiet for a minute to process what they just heard to decide if they need to follow up.

What I was able to demonstrate in court after court was that we were correct.And in fact, in a lawsuit that was settled and determined that was actually adjudicated in 2022, in a very long opinion, the judge said, indeed, what we claimed happened, it simply was out of his control to do anything about it because of people like President Trump, who put Supreme Court justices in place, who have weakened access to protections. That's why I created the organization Fair Fight. I believe in the outcome of elections. But what I do not and will not countenance is putting voters in a position where they do not have full and fair access to the right to vote. Republicans can try to conflate the two. It is not only false. It undercuts and undermines the legitimacy of those who do need to speak up, who do need to point out that there were irregularities in how they were allowed to vote. And we know that in Georgia right now, we have new laws, as do 27 other states, that were not in place in 2020 that will make it harder to vote. Republicans have intentionally restricted the right to vote across 28 states because they believe too many people had the right to vote in 2020. And so, I'm absolutely proud of the work that I have done to lift up the right of voters. I am not entitled to win an election and I never once challenged by election.
