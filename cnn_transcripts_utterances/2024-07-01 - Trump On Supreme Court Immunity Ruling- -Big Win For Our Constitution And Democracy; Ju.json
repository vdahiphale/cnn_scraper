Trump touting the 6-3 ruling on presidential immunity as a big win for our -- our Constitution and democracy.While House Speaker Mike Johnson calls it a victory for the former president and a defeat for what he deemed President Biden's weapon -- weaponized Department of Justice and Jack Smith, who is, of course, a special counsel. CNN's Kristen Holmes is here with more on this. All right, Kristen, you have the Trump campaign saying this. Tell us more about this. And also how this decision impacts their plans moving forward.",

So but what this does is this actually helps them with this idea that Donald Trump will likely no longer have to go to trial ahead of the election.What they were hoping for was anything. They actually got more than what they were hoping for originally. They were hoping for any kind of limited immunity that would essentially have to kick the case back to Chutkan, which this does, because she is going to have to determine what was an official act and what was an unofficial act. And then there's going to have to be some litigation around all of that. It seems very unlikely -- now, obviously, we don't know this. But it seems unlikely that Chutkan is going to do this in a vacuum. We're likely going to hear from both sides as they weigh in to these different actions that are going to be deemed either official or unofficial and therefore covered by immunity. And one thing to know going into this is that this was really this January 6th case which Judge Chutkan -- it was the last looming potential case for them that would go to trial before the election. They knew she was moving fast. They knew she said she wanted this to happen before the election. They thought there was still a chance it was going to go on the table even if it would be right up in September or October. Now it appears that that is done. And because of that, they are very happy and they are celebrating because Donald Trump is going to focus on one thing now, which is the election in November.",

And the reason why is, first, I believe it's fantastical that this notion of somehow the president orders SEAL Team Six to kill a political opponent. I don't like using that talking about it, because I think it risks politicizing the military further. And so -- but -- but, that said, look, the president has a constitutional duty to -- to protect the United States. So clearly, he can use the military force outside the country. But he doesn't have the authority to employ military force against political opponents within the country. And I think, as I interpret the reading and talk to others of this decision, that's kind of where the line gets drawn.",

      "sentences": "OK, So just -- I just want to be clear -- and I understand you don't want to politicize the military. But this example was used during the oral arguments and now in Justice Sotomayor's dissent. So it is important to discuss.So if you were defense secretary for Trump, if you were still serving in the Trump administration, this ruling had been in place and that order was given to you. And a political rival was outside of the United States, would you feel bound to follow the order to execute on what the president was telling you to do, given the ruling today?",

And I believe that the uniformed military would also refuse such an order because it would be illegal.And so -- and I'm confident that that's what the military would do going forward as well. So that's -- that's my view on it. Now, you mentioned earlier about the case of protesters in the streets of Washington, D.C., there are things the president can do that may be lawful, but we often call awful. And that he has the authority to do. But in this case, given an example of using the military to kill political opponent, no, in my view, that's an illegal order. That's not part of his constitutional duties. That -- that's a law enforcement -- that would be an action -- an action being to consider arresting or pursuing charges against somebody if -- if the president believed they were somehow promoting a conspiracy or trying to overturn the government. That would be a law enforcement issue, certainly not a military issue. BROWN: So I want to go back to then, you know, going back to President Trump firing you because of opposing -- your opposition to using the military force when it came to the George Floyd protests. So under that, given the ruling today, would you have held firm on your stance, given what we just heard from the Supreme Court, or would you have had a different position?",

I thought that was inappropriate.I thought that the better steps -- and still do, and I wrote about this in my memoir -- is you cited that this is a law enforcement action, first and foremost. It should be handled by Washington, D.C., law enforcement. If not -- if not the district, then federal law enforcement. And if not that, then of course, the National Guard. And that's eventually where, in my opposition to him, we walked him back to that point where we had the D.C. National Guard out there and not -- not pushing back on protesters but defending federal buildings and federal property. And it was ultimately law enforcement, civilian law enforcement that took action against -- with regard to pushing back the protesters, so. But my view is still the same that there are things that are legal and things that are illegal. And then there are things that are appropriate and things that are inappropriate. And that's kind of how I would carve up these decisions. And would do so going forward if that were ever the case again.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Look, and I'd have to think through it a little bit more, but the issue at the time was not immunity for official acts. The question at the time was, did he have the authority to employ active- duty forces on the streets of Washington, D.C.And the fact is, yes, he did after he invoked the Insurrection Act. That was the piece that I opposed, that Bill Barr opposed. And so to me, that was the hurdle, was, should he invoke the Insurrection Act? I thought it was inappropriate to do so, but it was completely lawful for him to do so if he wanted. Again, I thought the better -- the better approach was to use law enforcement. And then, if not law enforcement -- law enforcement was not up to the task, then use the National Guard, since National Guard has a dual mission, which includes support the civilian law enforcement authorities.",

Because the company has been sharply criticized for relying too heavily on contractors and subcontractors to build major parts of each plane.And investigators believe it was Spirit AeroSystems' mistake that led to the January 5th door plug blowout. Spirit builds the body or the fuselage of each 737 Max plane in its Wichita, Kansas, plant. And then they're taken by train to Boeing's plant in Renton, Washington. This purchase is a major part of Boeing's four-point plan to make it so that this incident does not happen again. Boeing's overall plan calls for \"revamping training, simplifying assembly line instructions for workers, overhauling the safety culture, and eliminating defects.\" That last point is what this is all about. Something I saw firsthand at the 7:37 factory line last week. Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun says this deal, \"Is in the best interest of the flying public, our airline customers, the employees of Spirit and Boeing, our shareholders and the country more broadly.\" Now, Calhoun was in a Senate subcommittee hotseat last month and he insisted that Boeing inspectors are now showing up the Spirit AeroSystems' Wichita plant in force so that defects are caught before the fuselages are sent to Boeing. Here is what Calhoun said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
