Starting at midnight, President Joe Biden severely restricts the process of seeking asylum at the U.S. southern border.

And during periods when the border is overwhelmed, the administration defines that as when illegal encounters between ports of entry exceed 2,500 per day. Those migrants would be subject to expedited removal the order we should note exempts, unaccompanied children, as well as victims of sex trafficking.The administration points to the same federal statutes that Trump administration used in its actions on immigration. Like those, however, this order will almost certainly face challenges in court. With me now for more, CNN senior White House reported Kevin Liptak. Kevin, this is a remarkable change from Democrats in particular on the immigration issue. It shows how much views in this country among both parties has changed on the issue. Tell us how the Biden administration landed on these executive actions to well, replace what Congress was not able to do earlier this year. KEVIN LIPTAK, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE REPORTER:  Yeah, the biggest shift is probably from candidate Biden to President Biden. You'll remember, Jim, he railed against former President Trump's policies when he was running against him in 2020. Now he is using those very same authorities to try and get a handle on the migrant situation on the southern border. And I think it does tell you how much of a political vulnerability this is for President Biden heading into November that he really does want to demonstrate that he has a plan and is willing to take executive action to try and curb some of that flow. Now, in his speech today, the president did try and delineate between what he is, his plan is, and what Trump's plan is. He talked about how he wasn't in favor of separating families. He talked about how he wouldn't demonize migrants. Listen to a little bit of how he characterized that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He called the new executive action a ban, and he was very specific that illegal crossings wouldn't be tolerated. But on the flip side, he does want to show to progressive Democrats, to his own supporters who are worried that he's using Trump's own policies, that it is not an exact replica, and that he is approaching this with more of a humanitarian point of view.And certainly when you talk to administration officials, that is what they're trying to emphasize that this is more nuanced, more strategic than what Trump implemented when he was an office. But certainly, they are prepared for legal challenges. Of course, this is something that could have been passed by Congress as part of that bipartisan legislation that was eventually torpedoed by Republicans and by Trump who wanted to use this as a political cudgel against Biden. Ultimately, executive actions are always on shakier legal ground than something that is passed by lawmakers. And so even though the administration says this is going into effect at midnight tonight, it is certain that it will be tied up in courts sooner rather than later, Jim.",

I mean, let's remember that this is a president who first de, in office actually did put forward a package around immigration reform that would have not only dealt with the situation at the border, but also dealt with other needed reforms in the system. And so, I think the president felt couple of things and I think politically he was right about.Number one, once the deal with Republicans collapse after Donald Trump and that they had had a -- Trump said, you know, don't do the deal. I need it, the president had a couple of options. Do nothing or try to figure out what could be done via executive action. And that's what you're seeing today. But the second piece I think is important, which is, and I think we'll hear this in the debate, how you talk about people who are here illegally actually matters. When you talk about people coming from until institutions and demonizing the blood -- I mean, we don't need that kind of talk in order to say, you know what, I'm going to deal with a legal migration at the border. I'm going to make sure we're cracking down on the drugs, the flow of drugs coming through. And I'm going to make sure that we treat people who are here humanely including our DACA kids.",

They asked in retrospect, do you think those humanitarian moves early in the administration when he and undid some of Trump's policies, helped drive that big jump in illegal border crossings.Biden said no, and he said, as you can see there on the screen, if I was wrong, it's because I took too long.

And as Karen knows, in politics. What people here is more important than what you say, they're both important. But what people hear tends to be more important and that's what fed that surge.And, ultimately, Jim, I've worked on very six unsuccessfully, I should say immigration legislation in the House of Representatives. I supported the compromise with Senator Lankford. I thought it was a good deal, but it didn't happen. So we're in a new reality and politicians often talk about what they're going to do on day one. We're in day 1,200 here, and this is why I think Biden had to act. And to ultimately your first question in this segment, will it matter? I don't think we know yet, but very clearly, Joe Biden sees the polling that shows that he is underwater massively on that issue -- on this issue, it's a huge advantage for Trump and Republicans. It's why they're campaigning and they're going to campaign hard for Hispanic votes specifically on this issue. They're going to put resources on Hispanic television on this as well. That's a smart move for them to make because Joe Biden is so underwater on this issue, he needed to do something. Well see if it's effective or not.",

The other part of this is the strain on those communities that are taking in this influx of migrants also was at a breaking point. And I think that was also part of the political calculation because again, the legislation would have surged resources to those communities. So I think what the president has to do, again, he had to take action. But the second part of it and, look, it's not going to make my colleagues in the far progressive movement happy, but he is going to try to combine this with some more humanitarian and humane efforts around, how do we make sure that people who are already here who have done everything right -- how do we help make sure they're able to get asylum? What do we do about our DACA kids? How do we also help communities that are dealing with the influx? So I think you're going to -- he mentioned that in his remarks today.

One, it's the video that we've all seen over and over again of what looks like just people crossing the border whenever they want to, however they want to. And we talk about Mexico, because that's the border. These are people who could come from anywhere. We know quite often these are Chinese nationals as well.

There's this idea that if you are tough at the border, you say no to, and you put these asylum restrictions in place, maybe it's mean, but it's somehow effective. The evidence is actually quite the opposite. Biden administration has done a lot of really important things here.

Now because so many people have gone through the asylum process, you are seeing folks were often waiting 5, 6, 7 years you can get in front of a judge. That's not the right approach, right? We can all agree on that, but we're not talking about how do we have more lawyers and more processing today. We're just talking about its more restrictions that are just going to spur more chaos. And look, ultimately, we need an immigration system that expands legal pathways, but also deals fairly certainly with the people who are here in this country.

As he said, in that press briefing earlier, and as he said in the full transcript of the interview he conducted with \"Time Magazine\", he believes that Netanyahu is doing whatever he can, anything it takes to bring those hostages home.That, of course, is the imperative at this time. The overwhelming majority of Israelis want to see those hostages brought home, dead or alive, preferably alive, as soon as humanly possible. I think that is the order of the day.

They may threaten that they are going to bolt and bring him down if he advances the ceasefire proposal. They don't actually have that interest because they he realized that if that happens in all likelihood, they will not be empowered. They'll end up in the opposition.

The first witness for the prosecutors a FBI agent that has been a part of this investigation.They are using her time on the stand to bring in a ton of the digital evidence in this case, messages and photos from Hunter Biden's laptop, from his iCloud backups, photos that show him buying drugs. According to the prosecutors here, we've seen images in the court of crack cocaine that he was buying from dealers in Los Angeles, and also text messages that the prosecutors say show him trying to connect with dealers in 2018. Why are they getting into this stuff? Well, it is a critical part of the charges in this case. The allegations here, as you know, Jim, are that Hunter Biden was a user of or addict of to -- addicted to illegal drugs into it? 2018 when he bought a gun. It's against the law to do that. And so, the prosecutors are using this FBI agent to bring in a lot of that evidence. And also, I should point out earlier before the lunch break, they introduced some very long passages of Hunter Biden's memoir, where he was very forthcoming about his plunge to the depths of addiction while he was living in L.A., in the same year that he bought that gun. [15:35:09] He described in his own words in his audiobook, which was played, how he would go into homeless encampments in L.A. to try to find drugs to feed his addiction. Of course, the jury in this case told the judge yesterday as they were being questioned during the voir dire process, that many of them have personal connections to people who had similar struggles, and that at moments, one of the jurors, our colleague Evan Perez spotted one of the jurors dabbing her eye during some of the more emotional periods of the presentation earlier today -- Jim.",

Number two, can an addict formulate the necessary specific intent to commit the crime if, in fact, they are high at the time or they are addicted and they're acting upon their addiction?

And because of that, the judge throughout the plea agreement and without the plea agreement, the government decides when Mr. Weiss that they were going to move forward against Mr. Biden, and they are prosecuting him for this. It is hard to imagine in my mind, not that he won't be convicted because probably will be, but that he would be punished so severely as to put him in jail for this charge.
