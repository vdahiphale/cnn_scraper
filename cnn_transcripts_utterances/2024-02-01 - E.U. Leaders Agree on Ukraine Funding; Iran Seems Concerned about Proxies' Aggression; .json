This is a deal that the European Council president says provides steadfast funding for Ukraine's war with Russia. The E.U. had been wrangling over this deal since December when Hungary vetoed it and there were fears that the same thing would happen. Again today, even as leaders achieved a show of unity inside European Parliament. Outside the building, evidence of the atmosphere of discontent in Europe. This time, farmers across the continent expressing their anger at, among other things, cheap imports that make it harder for them to make a living. Well, some of those imports, let's be clear, are coming from Ukraine. So tonight we ask, if despite their internal struggles, how did 27 European countries eventually reach a consensus on this big package for Ukraine? And what happens next with those farmers? Let's bring in CNN's Fred Pleitgen in Kyiv. Melissa Bell is in Paris. And Melissa, lets start with you. This has been tough and it's been ugly. Hungary, holding out; Viktor Orban, holding out, using the power of the veto. And threatening to block this aid package, which is so needed it by the Ukrainians. What happened?",

So lots of fears here in Kyiv about what that would mean. This was a summit that was designed to get everyone back around the table and fix that blockage. Victor Orban had held out until now, at the end extracting some concessions insofar as there will be, as part of the deal, an annual discussion about it and a review every two years of the amount within the context of the wider European budget. That goes a few steps in the direction of Viktor Orban. He'd complained really, Becky, that the amount was too great. That it needed more oversight than it was getting. The suspicion of people watching what had been happening since December, was that he was also using this as leverage with regard to his fight with Brussels to try and unblock some money that was due for (INAUDIBLE) that was held back by the European Union. Still, now despite that disunity being shown, being exposed over the course over the last few months, a huge sigh of relief in Brussels that they've managed to find a deal that well get that money to where it needs to go, Becky.",

European leaders meeting in Brussels to discussUkraine and yet forced its way on as a result of that anger. And there is a link to Ukraine. Part of the farmers' beef across the European Union, Becky, is that -- and specifically in eastern parts of the European Union -- is that there's been unfair competition from things like Ukrainian grain that have been brought in without any levies or quotas or taxes ever since the war began. Also that there is unfair competition coming from Latin America, for instance, in the shape of beef imports. It's what they say is that these are, whether the grains or beef from elsewhere, that are not subject the kind of regulations that European farmers face. So what they're saying is that the red tape that Brussels imposes on them, things like the 4 percent of their land that has to remain fallow for environmental reasons, the additional red tape and environmental measures taken as part of the European Green Deal. All of these have made their economic activity unsustainable, even as they're having to fight against products that come from other parts of the world, where the farmers are simply not subject to the same kinds of constraints. It is the injustice at the heart of that that's really forced them to the streets. Now we have been seeing some concessions here in France. The newly minted French prime minister has announced 150 million euros' worth of immediate aid tax relief to the farmers. That seems to have gone some way to assuaging part of their fears, for instance, the two main farmers' unions have just called here for the farmers to leave their road blocks, urged them to continue the movement in terms of keeping pressure up on the government. A change of tactics, perhaps, but certainly concessions appear now to be being made. Becky.",

U.S. airstrikes hit 10 Houthi drones and a ground control station in Yemen early today. That after U.S. officials say a cruise missile launched by the Houthis came within about 1.5 kilometers of the U.S.S. Gravely before it was shot down. Meantime, U.S. intelligence contacts tell CNN Iranian leaders are concerned about these continuing Houthi attacks and attacks by other Iranian proxies in the region and are seeking to avoid a direct confrontation with the United States. Katie Bo Lillis is with us this hour from Washington.

Came as a surprise to Iranian leadership and was met with some dismay as it's the first time in more than 160 attacks now that these Iraq- and Syria-based militia groups have successfully been able to actually kill American service members. There's also the matter of these Houthi strikes on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. There's some concern, according to our sources amongst Iranian leadership, that the damage to both commercial Chinese and Indian shipping interests, two sort of key allies for Iran, may blow back on Tehran in ways that they didn't intend. Now look, very important to understand here, Becky, that our sources tell us that there's no sense that this sort of sense of nervousness inside Tehran is likely to end up with a response of Tehran saying, you know what, we're going to -- we're going to put the kibosh on all on all proxy attacks. We're going to close up shop. But there may be a possibility that Iran may seek to sort of temper some of the direction and support that it's giving its various proxy groups around the margin. Right U.S. officials are really seeing this kind of in the broader context of Iran's attempt to kind of calibrate its response to the Israeli conflict in Gaza, to sort of exact costs on U.S. and Western interests in the region without actually crossing over the line into all-out war. Now what might complicate this reaction for Iran, of course, is that they do not have perfect command and control over all of their different proxy groups, Becky.

So that is the context we're coming at this from. The fact that the FBI director chose to do this in a hearing, that he knew would cause a huge splash, I think, is very instructive. I think it shows some divisions inside the U.S. government about the gravity and the urgency of the threat. But he also knows he was talking to a responsive audience that wants to act. He's trying to get more money out of Congress, more sort of motivation from the private sector, which runs a lot of these infrastructure facilities, to act here and quickly. I think the way to look at this, as well as the Homeland Security dimension, it's the fact that, if there was a conflict with China, perhaps over Taiwan or the South China Sea, the costs to the United States for intervening would not just be borne by American forces in the Pacific. China would have the leverage to create a great deal of disruption and hardship for Americans back home. And that, of course, has its own political dimension.",

And it put the -- President Biden in a very difficult position. That summit seemed to be able to put a trapdoor under the relationship. Both sides know that the strains are coming; a U.S. presidential election this year, in which China is a big issue, again, a tear that sort of attempt to arrest the plunge in ties. So it's going to be interesting to see how this episode, for example, which appears to have really angered the Chinese, strains the perhaps little entente cordial (ph) that Biden and Xi were able to create in California. China is going to be a huge issue in this election. The president is under fire from Republicans, who say that he's weak, that he doesn't stand up to Xi. The fact that now a Republican candidate can stand up and say that Biden, perhaps not quite fairly, has allowed China to create this leverage in the U.S. infrastructure system, makes it a very difficult political moment for the president. But the relationships are fragile and there's no reason to think that the trajectory of this relationship is going to be anything but troubled, as China increasingly challenges the U.S., not just in Asia but back home on the U.S. mainland.",
