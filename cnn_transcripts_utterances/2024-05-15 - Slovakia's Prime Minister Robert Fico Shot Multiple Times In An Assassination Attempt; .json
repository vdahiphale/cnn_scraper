An official statement from Fico's political group on his Facebook page, they say that he was shot multiple times. This was indeed an assassination attempt. The Prime Minister is now in life-threatening condition. I want to bring in Nic Robertson who's joining us live now from London with the details. Nic, the next few hours are decisive. Every moment at this point in time counts. We don't know who the attacker is. We don't know his motive. We don't know why he shot the Prime Minister.

She said that she and some others have been waiting there to shake hands and have photographs taken with the Prime Minister. It's normal in Slovakia. He's a populist. He's a man of the people. He's used to going out and shaking people's hands and seeing them. And these ladies were waiting to see him and do just that. And this lady said, \"Well, you know, it sounded like firecrackers and then I realized it was three gunshots that were being fired.\" She said she saw the Prime Minister fall towards the barriers. You can see them there in the video, those metal barriers that were put up, a sort of security barricade there in the vicinity of where the Prime Minister was coming out of this meeting. In terms of injuries, all she could say was that she could see a scratch on his head. And that's really about the only detail that we have. It's a non- medical detail, of course. And what the hospital is saying that when he arrived at the first hospital that he was taken to, the local hospital, the one that was closest by, they stabilized his condition, but that he was conscious when he went in. They said he was conscious and they stabilized his condition, but immediately transferred him to a higher-level facility. And they say the reason they sent him by helicopter to one that was about 30 kilometers away is they said he just needed urgent treatment, too urgent, to try to get him to the capital, which was two hours' drive away. They sent him to this much closer facility to get this higher level of care. So, the next few hours will be decisive, is what we're being told. But we have no details as yet on precisely where those gunshots -- multiple gunshots in this assassination attempt actually impacted the Prime Minister. All we know is from that one witness, and this is a witness who's obviously in a state of shock because she wasn't expecting this, saying that she saw him fall towards the barrier. And in her words, he had a scratch on his head.",

All the opposition leaders, the president of the countries, they all issued very strong statements saying that political violence is not something that we should be tolerating in our democratic societies. Regardless of the disagreements, we should not be shooting one another. They're very much committed to finding ways how to make sure that people have democratic ways to vent their grievances and find a way forward. And of course, much will depend also on what the current government does. There is a lot of shock in the country.

The relationship between China and the United States, in their assessment, is going to get worse. The U.S. relies on a huge network of allies and partners in Asia, Europe, and other parts of the world, where China is very short of friends. So when they look at the map, Russia is something that comes as close as a partner for them, because it's a giant nation next door, nuclear-armed, like- minded, authoritarian country that also shares obsessions about the U.S. dominance, and that drives the two closer together. Now, Russia is sanctioned by the West, has burned all of the bridges by this ugly war, and that drives Russia closer to China on China's terms. It can bring cheap natural resources. It can bring some of the military technologies that China needs. It can bring its vote as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. And it also brings a lot of distraction to the U.S. by just the magnitude of challenges it creates in European theater that still diverts away resources and precious time of Biden's national security team.",
