It is question the sitting U.S. president does not want to face and did not expect to grapple with, should he remain in the race for reelection? And against an opponent he describes as a threat to democracy? In a few hours, President Joe Biden will confront the growing calls for him to withdraw from the campaign, including many in his own party in his first major live and unscripted event since the debate two weeks ago. The stake is enormous. Just moments ago, the 12th sitting Democratic lawmaker called for Biden to step aside. That announcement to, quote, pass the torch to a new generation coming from Illinois Congressman Brad Schneider and our team's new reporting just in to CNN about the intensifying anger and frustration from current and former Democratic officials about why the debate came as such, a surprise and who inside Biden's inner circle may have shielded the public from Biden's decline. CNN senior White House correspondent MJ Lee joins me now. She helped break that story. Tell us, MJ, they're speaking about a notable decline. I wonder how the White House is responding to that.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, well, Jim, you know, my colleagues and I have been speaking to many Democrats across the party since that very shocking debate performance some two weeks ago. And what has been striking is that all of the folks that we spoke with and that includes people that know the president well, have known the president the years and regularly spend time with him. All of them basically said they had never seen that version of the president that you saw on the debate stage, that that version that was so halting at a time, days was really unrecognizable to them. And the reason that so many of these folks that we spoke with are so angry and stunned right now is because they believe that there is a daily operation at an apparatus that is in place at the White House that is basically designed to shield that full side of the president that might give a better sense of his condition, and some would say his decline from the public.Now, one example that we have in our story is, according to two sources up before the president attends these cabinet meetings with his cabinet officials, these cabinet officials are submitting questions, including bullet points of what they might present to the president in these closed-door meetings. What one of the two sources told us is, quote, the entire display is an act. They would come and say, hey, the president is going to call on you about 25 minutes in and ask this question, what are the bullet points that you'll respond with? Now, the White House is defense on that has been that, you know, that's sort of general practice for any administration striation. We want to be mindful of his tie. We never want him to be caught off guard and want him to be aware of what topics are going to come up. But we also checked in with our sources from going back to the Obama administration and they said there were no cabinet meetings during those years that were this meticulously scripted or anything close to it. And, you know, in response to our broader story and the anger that Democrats are showing that we've heard so much about, the White House sort of broadly different defended the breadth of the president's travels, his schedule, his interviews, and not to mention his record over the last three-and-a-half years and said, you know, the president welcomes these kinds of questions and about his age, his fitness from reporters. And obviously, in a couple of hours, that is going to be put to the test. We'll see how he handles all of those questions when he has this formal press conference.",

There were days where it really felt like he thought everything we were hearing, you know, maybe the president is going to survive this after all. I think the last 24 to 36 hours, things have felt really tenuous for the president and his campaign, and we're obviously seeing the Biden campaign go to real lengths to try to allay these concerns that are so widespread, including heading up to the Hill today to meet with Senate Democrats behind closed doors to reassure them.But my colleagues on the Hill who have been talking to these members that have been coming out of the lunch, we've gotten a range of responses, including, for example, Senator Blumenthal saying he just needs to see more data. And I think that is probably one of the more telling responses that I have seen coming out of Capitol Hill today. The focus on the data is so important because there are Democrats who really do believe, sure, maybe the inner circle of advisers, maybe the family can convince him at some point to drop out of the race, but also what is the data going to tell him if he gets convinced he is going to bring down the House's effort, the Senate's effort to keep the keep the, you know, each of the houses in on Capitol Hill, the maybe that could end up playing a big role in him realizing this is going to be bad for the party.",

      "sentences": "MJ Lee at the White House, thanks so much.So as President Biden tries to save his candidacy in Washington, there is some spotlight growing on his vice president, Kamala Harris. \"The New York Times\" reported today that Biden's team has privately polling how Harris would do at the top of the ticket. A new ABC News/Washington Post poll has some answers on that. Biden runs even with Trump nationally Harris, while within the margin of error outperforms Biden with a two-point edge against Trump, again within the margin of error. With me now to discuss Leigh Ann Caldwell of \"The Washington Post\" and CNN senior reporter Isaac Dovere. Leigh Ann, there's been so much talk and were two weeks out from the debate about the data, right? And even Trump's own team, it was CNN's reporting, conceded in the days after the debate, if -- if they saw polls are plummeting, they might reconsider. I mean, is there enough data already combination of public and private internal polling as to the damage done, or is it still something of an open question? LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST'S \"EARLY BRIEF\": Well, it depends on who you ask and it depends on what data people are looking at. If you talk to members of Congress and senators on the Hill, those that are concerned, they tell you that they've seen the data and the data shows that President Biden can't win, or that at least his path is narrowing. And what they're also mostly concerned about in addition to Biden is also the data showing that battleground states and battleground House districts, so Senate and House races are also struggling more now in a post-Biden debate scenario than before. And that's why you're seeing such a freak out on Capitol Hill and some corners about President Biden. But when the senators just met with administration and campaign officials and those officials told the senators that the data shows that Biden still can win, that there actually is a path to 270 electoral votes. And so, you know, there's some concern that President Biden is not seeing the data that he needs to see. And so, everyone's just looking at what they want to look out right now. But when you talk to a lot of people on Capitol Hill who want Biden to step aside privately, they say that the data doesn't look great.",

There's a couple of who didn't. She wields a lot of respect in the caucus, but given the amount of private concerns being relayed about President Biden, the question is, do these people come become -- go public. Now, there's some sort of debate and discussion about is it better -- is it a better way to convince Biden to say something publicly? Or is this internal quiet behind the scenes pressure the right approach? And so, there's some strategizing and conversations about that, too. But we're going to have to see if it's -- if it's a disaster tonight. I think that you could absolutely see a total of flood of people.

And let -- let's not forget that we had a general election in Sweden where we had eight parties who stood and six were in favor of NATO, two were against NATO membership and we have more than three -- three fourths, 75 percent majority in our parliament in favor of joining NATO. So, the democratic process cannot in any way be questioned and nobody has coerced Sweden to joining NATO. On the contrary, we have seen with our own eyes what Russia is capable of doing in its illegal warfare against Ukraine and finding safety and security within NATO and under Article Five was the reason why we chose to join NATO and nothing else.",

And, of course, Sweden wouldn't like anyone to come in and tell us who's going to run our country. So I'm not going to do that either.What I would like to point out is that NATO is, of course, reliant on U.S. participation. U.S. is an indispensable partner to a member of NATO. And of course, we, Sweden, value the transatlantic link very high. And this is for this reason that we want to show the American people that we live up to our commitments. U.S. alone should not bear the burden of financing or powering NATO alone. Sweden has already reached the 2 percent target. We will very soon reach with 2.6 percentage of our GDP going to defense spending. We encourage all other partners to do the same. And we feel that regardless of the outcome of the election in the U.S., Europe has to do more. We have to see to it that we increase our defense spending and that we ramp up so that we can both protect our own territory and aid Ukraine. We are very grateful for everything that the American people have done so far in aiding Ukraine. But we ourselves in Europe also has to do more. And we have to pay attention to the Indo-Pacific area where we know that the U.S. fears (ph) China, we should also pay attention to the Indo-Pacific for the same reason. Doing more is one thing, but the fact is that replacing U.S. leadership, the U.S. portion of defense spending just the largest U.S. military in the world if a future U.S. president were to pull back from NATO to some degree, does Sweden -- does NATO have a plan B to be responsible for not just more, but perhaps most, or even all of its own collective defense?",

I think he has shown especially during the process of bringing Sweden and Finland into NATO, but various leadership in place in the White House, and I think that is what really counts at this moment in time, when we see the international rules-based order being challenged by China, by Iran, by North Korea, and by Russia, who are all forming a group of authoritarians states who were trying to overturn things. We have to put our trust and our ability in this alliance, which has now existed for 75 years, the most successful alliance and Sweden is very proud to have joined it. We have to put our trust in this ability of us to cooperate and to provide unity. This is the big thing coming out of this summit here in Washington, the unity of a NATO -- NATO alliance.",

Well, the top one will surprise nobody. It's cigarette smoking, so they estimate that 19 percent of cases of cancer, 29 percent of cancer deaths were contributed to by cigarette smoking. The second is excess body weight, 8 percent of cases, and 7 percent of deaths, and alcohol consumption, 5 percent of cases and 4 percent of deaths. Beyond those things, like UV radiation are big contributors as well, obviously to skin cancer. The types of cancer they say are most affected by these risk factors that we can modify or things like lung cancer, obviously, that connection to smoking. Female breast cancer, that's connected both with excess body weight and with alcohol consumption, skin melanoma, and colorectal cancer.
