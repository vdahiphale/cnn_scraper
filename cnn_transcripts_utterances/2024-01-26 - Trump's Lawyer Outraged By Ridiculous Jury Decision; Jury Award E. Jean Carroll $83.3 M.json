      "sentences": "Good evening. Thanks for joining us.We begin tonight with a massive bill a New York federal jury today handed the former president for repeatedly defaming the woman he has already been found liable for sexually abusing: $7.3 million for the emotional harm he caused by his repeated verbal attacks on E. Jean Carroll while he was president, which some of his followers turned into serious threats against her; $11 million to repair the damage Carroll suffered to her reputation and $65 million in punitive damages. $83.3 million in total. No comment from her or her team as they left the courthouse in Lower Manhattan making their way through a sea of cameras and reporters. In a moment, we'll hear from her attorney, Roberta Kaplan, her first interview since the verdict. Also exclusively from another Trump accuser, Jessica Leeds who was a witness in Miss Carroll's first lawsuit, in which she told jurors the former president groped her on an airplane on a cross country flight. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied Leeds' claims. Today, he responded to the verdict on social media, saying he'll appeal the case, adding; \"Our legal system is out of control and being used as a political weapon. They've taken away all First Amendment rights. This is not America.\" And not some minor detail, we should point out the First Amendment does not cover defamation. Mr. Trump's lawyer, Alina Habba, who spoke a short time after the verdict either ignored or didn't understand that this trial was only about damages, and complained about not being allowed to re-argue what another jury already determined, namely that her client sexually abused E. Jean Carroll. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In fact, 24 hours he was on a CNN townhall with you repeating the statements the jury just found to be defamatory, repeated them throughout this trial, and she said, repeated them on the stand when he testified, that really solidified the point.And their argument that the jury was nothing will make this man stop, but money because that's what matters to him, not the truth.",

And I think one thing that came up during the trial and something that was clearly effective is an argument that E. Jean Carroll's attorneys made their arguments to the jury is they were saying, you know, she felt worthless when he was making those comments at the townhall the day after this verdict had come out and that was essentially the argument here.

And the relationship between the two numbers, between the compensatory damages and the punitive damages number is reasonable. I mean, courts do worry if the punitive damages are an X factor, too much beyond what the compensatory was, here, it's about 3.6, right, times that compensatory.

And so I'm sure he was angry and he probably pounded the table and left. And now he's going to have to, you know, go on appeal and hopeful -- be hopeful that this $83 million was reduced because, you know, as Van said, this does stack up.

They ultimately declined to meet with us, but several hours after this report was first published online. They did issue a statement saying, quote, \"CNN refused to broadcast the footage\" -- sorry-- \"CNN refused to provide the footage in question prior to the broadcasting of the article, as the IDF requested to receive in order to thoroughly examine the incident and provide any sort of comprehensive response. CNN's hesitancy to share the materials discloses the partial nature of their report, doing a disservice to the complex nature of the operational reality on the ground. The incident is being examined.\" Now the IDF statement doesn't specify which incident exactly within our report is now being examined.
