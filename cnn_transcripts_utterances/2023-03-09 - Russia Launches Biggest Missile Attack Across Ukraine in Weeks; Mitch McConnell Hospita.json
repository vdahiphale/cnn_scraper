Happening right now, intense bombing hitting cities across Ukraine, Russia launching a barrage of at least 81 missiles. This is the biggest attack in weeks, striking residential areas and blacking out power. Attacks on Kyiv have been reported including on a power plant in the capital. The city's mayor says at least two people were hurt. Emergency services are at the scenes of the blast in Kyiv. Much of the city has been left without electricity. Officials say a Russian rocket also hitting a residential area in Lviv killing five people. CNN's Ivan Watson is live in Kyiv for us with more. And, Ivan, it looks like at least seven regions have been targeted by chilling from the Russians. Get us up to speed here.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, this was a large salvo of missiles of different types that targeted different cities and regions across the country. I think we have a map that we can show that illustrates kind of just how country-wide this assault was from Russia. And as we heard from the commander of the armed forces, he describedit as a massive missile attack on Ukraine's critical infrastructure. He described 81 missiles being launched, and that ranged everything from air launched cruise missiles to sea launched cruise missiles, the Kalibr missiles, to Kinzhal, which are hypersonic air launched missiles and as well as some of what we believe to be Iranian made Shahed drones. Now, the Ukrainian armed forces, they say that they were able to shoot down at least 34 of these missiles and four of the Shahed killer so- called suicide drones. But there were impacts across the country. At least five people killed in a western city, two wounded here in Kyiv. We tried to see some of the sites that were hit but couldn't really see extensive damage or even smoke at this hour of the day. Odesa was hit, Kharkiv was hit as well. And Zaporizhzhia, the nuclear power plant, disconnected from Ukrainian power. So this is an assault and one of the striking details that has come out is that the spokesperson for Ukraine's air force, he says that some of the munitions that were used that Ukraine simply doesn't have anti-aircraft weapons that can bring those down, that there are no defenses against them. That said, you know, you look around the center of Kyiv right now, there is an orchestra playing over here. This clearly hasn't made much of an impact on day to day life in the city, though it does terrorize the residential population here.",

What stood out to you the most about the DOJ report of this investigation? SGT. CHERYL DORSEY (RET),  LAPD POLICE:  Well, the fact that here we are hearing still about neck restraints being used by police officers after Eric Garner was choked to death in 2014 with the prohibited neck restraint. And so we understand and appreciate that telling officers not to a thing, having them engaged in unnecessary use to force, conduct police misconduct, occurs daily. And so, my question, knowing all of this now for sure, where are these officers today? Are they still out there on the Louisville police department running around throwing drinks at folks and calling black people monkeys and animals? Because if you don't did anything to deter the bad behavior, if they are not held accountable, if they are not removed from the ranks of that police department, then they live to offend again.",

When an officer kills one of us, there is only one version to tell and that is the one that they give.So I'm not surprised at all that this Louisville they had the Vipers, disbanded it, gave it a new name and brought it back. I expect the same to occur in Memphis with the Scorpions. Again those officers are disbanded, but where are they is this back out on patrol. So these are just a band-aid. Something more needs to be done. And not only the officer, what about the people arrested and convicted and in jail right now because you have a compromised officer's testimony that put that person there in the first place.",

And I'm not saying that just because a Black officer is on your department that you won't have a problem like we saw in Memphis, it has to be the right kind of police officer that you recruit.So unless and until that happens, you can and until these police chiefs look at these specialized units and make sure that they don't have a bunch of elephant hunters abusing people at night, we'll continue to see this problem.",
