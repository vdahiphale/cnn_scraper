      "sentences": "Today on INSIDE POLITICS, sadness and strife. The grieving family of a hostage murdered by Hamas makes one final memory, while Israelis from all corners of the country strike in a message of defiance and distrust, aim at Benjamin Netanyahu.Plus, the long and winding road toward the election hits the home stretch. Donald Trump and Kamala Harris hightail it to swing states, as we are again days away from a potentially defining debate. And Donald Trump repeats what Republicans wish he wouldn't say that he had every right to interfere in an election. There's plenty of insiders confused about his strategy. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at INSIDE POLITICS. Up first, an odyssey of nearly a year of torture ended. And with it a different kind of pain for a nation in near perpetual grief. Protests today are overwhelming Israel as a strike stops much of life there, but for the Goldberg-Polin family, life will never again feel the same. This morning, the parents of a 23-year-old, Hersh Goldberg-Polin buried their only son. They did so with sadness, but also with hope that one of the best of us taken far too soon would push the rest of us to find a way to bring the remaining hostages in captivity for 11 months halt. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JON POLIN, HERSH GOLDBERG-POLIN'S FATHER: First, we failed you. We all failed you. You would not have failed you. You would have pushed harder for justice. You would have worked to understand the other to bridge differences. You would have challenged more people to challenge their own thinking. And what you would be pushing for now is to ensure that your death, the deaths of all the soldiers and so many innocent civilians are not vain. Maybe -- just maybe, your death is the stone, the fuel that will bring home the remaining 101 hostages. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That one-word no is doing a lot there for President Biden, of course, he has been so reluctant in the past to criticize Benjamin Netanyahu for how he is handling this conflict. But you see him there very much aligning himself with the thousands of people who are out protesting on the streets in Israel.And certainly, we know that American officials are now viewing this moment as an urgent one as they work to bring this ceasefire deal across the finish line. President Biden just wrapping up that meeting in the Situation Room. What the White House says is that he reaffirmed the importance of holding Hamas' leaders accountable. But he also discussed the status of the American bridging proposal to try and bring those hostages home and talked about the next steps. Now, on the South Lawn, I did ask President Biden if he was preparing to present a final hostage agreement proposal to all of the sides, and he said that they are getting close. And that does speak, I think, to the critical moment that American officials now view themselves in. And when you talk to us officials, they do say that, of course, the deaths of these six hostages beneath Rafah does raise new questions about Hamas' seriousness towards reaching a deal. But they also acknowledge that it does apply new pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu. You saw President Biden speaking to that on the South Lawn as well. It has appeared to open and deepen the rift between President Biden and his Israeli counterpart, as senior Israeli source speaking after President Biden said that calling it remarkable and dangerous. So certainly, the relationship there a little bit frosty still, but I think, you know, when I asked President Biden why a new deal would have any more success than the past proposals. He said that hope springs eternal, certainly American officials very much wanting to use this window to try and get a hostage deal across the finish line.",

Just to sort of add to Kevin's reporting about what's going on inside the Biden administration, inside the national security team on what more they can and should do. There is a lot of frustration among -- particularly, the Americans. We'll hear some of it later. I spoke to the Neutra family, whose son Omer is one of the remaining hostages, believed to be alive, who is an American citizen. And they're kind of, you know, done with the prayers and they have been patient. They're obviously upset with the prime minister in Israel, but they're also upset that the American administration has not done more.",

      "sentences": "And just on the sort of the politics of this, domestic politics of this for now, Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump. Isaac, I was talking to a veteran Democratic strategist over the weekend who was saying that he hopes that the Harris campaign, which is relying, of course, on the administration because this is a policy issue, not a political and campaign issue.Understands that this is not just a issue for Jews or for Palestinians at this point, or for the sort of sides who have been erupting in the streets, so this is a competence question. And that this is one of those issues that will likely reverberate among those swing voters, suburban voters in the collar counties of Pennsylvania or elsewhere that will decide this election, and that is the way that they have to view it politically. Do you agree with that? EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER: There's the buildup here over the next couple of weeks to the anniversary of October 7, right, which is just under a month before Election Day and that is going to be a critical moment in itself. We'll see what happens in between here and there, whether there is a deal for a ceasefire and the hostages being returned. But if it's been a year of the Biden administration saying that we're close to a deal. We're getting close. We're getting -- they keep on saying, we're getting close. I've heard from people in the administration who say that they have said to other administration officials, we can't keep going, other saying we're about to get a deal. And they've been doing that for six months at this point already. So yes, I think it is a question that can reverberate into competence. It's a question that reverberates into all the political ways of this issue. I mean, it's a war in Israel that has become the major source of domestic political tension for a lot of people in the Democratic Party. And where this all builds to we don't know, because it was not two weeks ago that we had the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin at the convention, having the entire Democratic convention hall chanting, bring them home. He was alive at that point. And he is obviously not now, that in itself is going to change the way that people feel about this.",

The hostage crisis in Israel is only taking place because comrade Kamala Harris is weak and ineffective and has no idea what she's doing. I look forward to seeing her at the debate.By the way, I'm just -- as I'm reading this again, the hostage crisis that he put that -- he put it in those terms, a la Jimmy Carter.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I mean, I think he is using this moment to try to paint a broader picture of Harris, that she is weak on foreign policy, that she is a weak leader. And he's using rhetoric that he's used a lot when he talks about foreign policy issues.He often says October 7 would have never happened if he had been president and he's not offering a lot of evidence as to why he thinks that. But that is something that he says a lot. He says the same thing about the war in Ukraine. And so, I think this is another example of him trying to portray himself as a stronger leader than Biden and now Harris. And -- but I think it's worth noting that Trump has offered very little specifics about how he himself would end the war in Gaza. And he has also offered conflicting statements about the war itself. He has a complicated relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And so, I think this is a complicated issue for him as well. BASH: Yeah. That's a good point. Real quick. I just want to remind our viewers what the vice president told me about this very issue in our interview last week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I want to ask you about some of your reporting this morning. This is with Isaac Arnsdorf, Josh Dossey and you, Marianne LeVine.

And we haven't seen him quite land on a message over the last few weeks with the changing candidate. He often still talks about Biden. And I think that in the next couple weeks, we can expect sort of a barrage of attacks on Harris.In looking at the ad impact data, just even in the last -- in the next few weeks, many of the ads are solely focused on negative attacks on Harris. And so, I think we can expect the race to get a lot uglier. I think the September 10 debate will be really telling in terms of how the Trump campaign tries to refine their message against Harris. But I think part of the issue is the candidate. The campaign really wants to make this race about the economy. They want to make this race about policy issues. Trump has often veered into personal attacks. Has pulled the crowds about wanting, about whether or not they prefer personal attacks to Harris. So, I think the question with Trump, as it often is, is how -- can he stay on message in the next few weeks and really make this race about Harris and not about him.",

You often hear them talking about issues like abortion and gun violence or issues that they believe are something that they really can bring positive ideas on and bring to the table to try to court more of those female voters.But you've also seen Donald Trump trying to make his own plays in these weird ways with kind of waffling when it comes to reproductive rights and abortion. He's put out a lot of different positions, whether its presenting different options, relating to different ideas about how he'll vote on that Florida six-week ban, floating the idea of IVF. Ultimately, these are things that the Harris campaign believes that they can really hold significant sway with female voters, specifically on those types of issues.
