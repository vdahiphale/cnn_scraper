I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. The message tonight, it is both the words and the wear that Kamala Harris is using to convince the country to vote for her in these final days. The setting tonight was The Ellipse in Washington, D.C. And this is the split screen that the campaign wants to be seared into your memory, Kamala Harris promising a future full of possibility, clashing with Donald Trump's insurrection carnage.

January 6th happened three and a half, almost three and three quarters years ago. Everybody who's going to make a decision based on January 6th has already made that decision. And so in a razor tight election, where there may just be a small fraction, a small percentage of the people who are undecided, it wasn't January 6th that pushed them over the edge.
