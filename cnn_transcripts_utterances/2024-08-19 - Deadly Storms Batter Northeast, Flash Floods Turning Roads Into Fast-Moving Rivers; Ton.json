So not just celebrating the fact that that might happen, but what opportunities is that going to provide, opportunities and freedoms to make health care decisions, to tell your kids that they can be anything they want. So I'll let her -- I'll let her do it. I don't want to ruin it. But, yes, I think you're going to hear an upbeat future-oriented endorsement of Kamala Harris.",

I've just been briefed on it. But I think you're going to hear her focus on that positive vision and not dwelling a bunch on Trump. I'm sure a lot of other speakers you're going to hear tonight are going to spend some time on that. I'm sure the president is going to spend some time on that in his remarks.

Particularly because, look, we have a Democrat in the White House, so we need to more clearly define what does Kamala Harris' vision really mean? What is she going to deliver uniquely? This isn't just re-elect the status quo. This is a new chapter, a new page. And it is imperative we define that. We started to hear the vice president roll some of that out next week. But these next four days, if people forget, a convention is four days of television. You get to say whatever you want. It is unfiltered, right?

Police say violence will not be tolerated as the city is bracing for tens of thousands of protesters to converge on the city this week.CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is outside the convention hall. And, Shimon, there is certainly a heavy police presence outside. We have seen it. What's being done to ensure safety? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Brianna, so we're actually several blocks away from the convention center. We're at Union Park, which is where the protests are gathering. This is the area where they we're told to gather. This is where the protesters have been gathering. At some point, we do expect them to start marching from here. There are thousands in this, so far, probably a little less than what the organizers were expecting. And then at some point, as I said, they have a route. It's about a mile route where they're going to go from here in the park and they're going to head out and they're going to go into the streets. They're going to march towards the convention center. The police have only given them -- the city has only given them a mile. They want more. They want a mile and a half. They're not getting that right now. So that's where we could see some confrontation as they get closer to the convention center, to the United Center, what will happen there if they tried to go any further than where police are allowing them to go. And that's sort of the big question right now. He said, the organizer yesterday told us that it's going to depend on how many people show up and what the protesters want to do. That's going to dictate where they go and how far they go. But as you know, because you're there, at the United Center, there are gates surrounding that entire complex for about a mile. And it's going to be really difficult for them to get anywhere near the center. So it's going to be interesting. But they're supposed to start marching here once the speeches are done. They're wrapping up here. Once they take to the streets, we're going to see how that goes -- Brianna?",
