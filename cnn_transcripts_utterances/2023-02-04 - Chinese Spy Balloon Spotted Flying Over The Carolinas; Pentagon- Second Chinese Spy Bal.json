CNN has reporters around the world tracking the latest developments on this story. Let's turn first to CNN Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon with the latest. Oren, what's being said?",

So, this balloon made its way across a good chunk of United States from Montana on Tuesday and Wednesday now to where it is over the heart of the country to where it is now over essentially North Carolina, South Carolina, where it's reaching the coast.And then open water beyond that where you no longer have the risk to people and property below. And therefore, the question then becomes does the military change its recommendation and recommend to President Joe Biden that if you're going to go ahead and follow the we'll take care of it that it would be the time and the place to shoot this down. It is worth noting that as many people will along the path or looking for the balloon. I've been watching flight tracking Web sites pretty much all morning such as ADS-B Exchange and Flightradar24. And there we've seen some noteworthy flight activity, not the only military flight activity but some noteworthy activity. A couple of tankers, refueling tankers, right off the coast of Myrtle Beach there essentially fly in a holding pattern. Why is that noteworthy? Because fighters that would be used or could be used to shoot this down might need to refuel as they wait for this balloon to reach that area. So, that's one thing we'll be keeping an eye on. It is important to note that the Pentagon hasn't confirmed that these flights are related in any way to the balloon, but they are along that trajectory. So, we're going to keep an eye on that, as Fred, we wait to find out exactly what President Joe Biden meant when he said we'll take care of it.",

We know it's there. Essentially, please just take a picture of it, post it on your social media. That's all you need to do if you feel the need to do something. And two, please do not try to take matters into your own hand. There are tongue-in-cheek post about this in Gastonia, Boone, North Carolina, your County, South Carolina, but also telling people please do not shoot at this balloon. Please do not. Your county telling people what goes up will come down including your own bullets. Again, tongue-in-cheek but also reminding people please don't try to take this into your own hands.

And we're learning about sightings of this second balloon, what could be a second balloon which looks a lot like the Chinese surveillance balloon flying over the United States and at least two Latin American countries. Columbia media are reporting sightings of a balloon flying at about 70,000 feet over the South American country's airspace. Citing the Colombian military.We've also seen reports a balloon has been spotted over Costa Rica on Friday. The Pentagon confirmed sightings of a balloon over Latin America and said it was another Chinese surveillance balloon. CNN has obtained the video shot Thursday showing a balloon geo located to San Jose. This is Costa Rica's capital, but we cannot independently have confirmed that it is indeed a Chinese balloon. We checked, but neither the Colombian government nor Costa Rica have issued any confirmation or official statements so far regarding any sighting. However, the topic as you can imagine, has gone viral on social media in the region. There were a number of sightings of an object from eyewitnesses in Costa Rica and Colombia that at this point, could not be confirmed by CNN as Chinese balloon. Beyond this second balloon and based on my reporting on the region, Fredricka for many years, I can tell you that China's presence in Latin America is nothing new. Beijing has had it for years very closely relations with authoritarian regimes, like the ones in Venezuela, and Nicaragua. And as you may remember, in 2020, China offered a $1 billion loan to Latin America and the Caribbean for access to its COVID-19 vaccine. Fredricka, get back to you.",

That has a lot of people saying, why are you allowed to investigate yourself? In this case, the mayor is welcoming the federal government to come in and really look at this police department. There have been calls to look at their training. What was their training? Was there a lack of training? What's the culture within the police department in some of these special units like the SCORPION Unit that these five original officers were a part of, and just the department as a whole? This is welcome news to local activists and to the family. Let's dive into what's happened recently. We have now another police officer who has been fired. It's because of departmental policy violations. Those are the allegations. There's Officer Hemphill and there's a long list -- take a look -- a list of alleged violations, personal conduct, truthfulness, compliance. He was the first officer to really interact with Tyre Nichols, pull him over, take him out of the car, attempt to tase him. He was heard on that body camera saying, \"I hope they stomp him.\" This officer has faced a lot of scrutiny but was not part of the original five who were fired. Now fired, now facing this. But we are looking at departmental violations, not criminal charges. His lawyer saying that, \"While we disagree with Preston Hemphill's termination from the Memphis Police Department, Mr. Hemphill will continue to cooperate with all investigating agencies into the death of Tyre Nichols.\" Again, stressing these are not criminal charges. Who are facing criminal charges, have already been indicted? Five other Memphis police officers are facing criminal charges. We're looking at a murder charge, an assault charge and a long list of charges facing these five officers. A total of seven officers have been fired and have these allegations against them. There's another person on paid administrative leave. If you look at the fire department, those EMTs, two of them have been fired and their licenses have been suspended. So they're not allowed to use that license that they studied for, took a class for, and gives them a ticket for their career. That's been suspended as this investigation continues. All of this coming from the family really who started this, family and local activists pushing for answers, pushing for the release of that awful video we watched.

This is pertaining to that Chinese spy balloon that continues to coast over American air space. There's an FAA ground stop now at three airports in the Carolinas. They issued a restricted air space for, quote, \"national defense air space.\" With me, Pentagon correspondent, Oren Liebermann. Oren, tell us more about what this means.",

When you hear national defense air space, temporarily restricting air space to any commercial private aircraft, the first thing anyone would think about is there is going to be some forceful takedown of this balloon. Is that what it means? Are there other options that would take place? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Fredricka, that is the most logical explanation. We're seeing a standard procedure that the FAA uses in conjunction with the us Air Force when something like this happens. Think about some of the things that happened on 9/11 over 20 years ago, when you had various parts of our air space shut down as part of this national emergency. In this particular case, what you're looking at is creating an air space where the Air Force can potentially shoot down this balloon, probably over water just off the coastline of the Carolinas, as Oren mentioned. What they would do is they've got a lot of Air Force assets that could come from about three different bases to help with this. You already mentioned the tanker traffic that is orbiting off the coast of Myrtle Beach there. And you also have the fighter aircraft that could come from various places, including Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, bases in North Carolina and South Carolina. Those are all potential places where fighters could be scrambles from to go after this balloon and take it down.",

Normally, the Coast Guard and local authorities, Marine patrols, such as those from North Carolina and South Carolina, would be involved in providing some notice to mariners. They would also get on the radio and warn all boaters that this area is now restricted. I don't know exactly if they've got a specific exclusion zone at the moment, but it would be wise for boaters in that area to pay very close attention to what's going on because it could absolutely impact their operations.",

You know, sometimes that's done by the Coast Guard, sometimes by the Navy. Those are the kinds of things that they work out when it comes to operations like this. This is definitely a choreographed operation, or at least they're attempting to choreograph this operation to do it as safely as possible with a minimal amount of life lost or, hopefully, no life lost in this case and as safely as possible for everyone concerned.",

People took pictures of it. You're looking at some of the images captured earlier. Now, we understand -- this is three days or four days after this Chinese balloon was spotted in Montana. It has made its way, some believe by way of the jet stream, others have said it is maneuverable and perhaps it was manipulated as it has traversed the country. Now we are understanding from our Pentagon sources that they have temporarily closed the air space along the Carolinas. Three airports have a ground stop. We're talking to Cedric Leighton now about all of the options about how this seems to be precipitating what will be an intentional takedown possibly of this balloon. Also with us is our CNN aviation expert, Pete Muntean. Pete, talk to us about this temporary ground stop, the level of cooperation that is now under way between the FAA, you know, commercial, private aircrafts and, of course, the U.S. military.
