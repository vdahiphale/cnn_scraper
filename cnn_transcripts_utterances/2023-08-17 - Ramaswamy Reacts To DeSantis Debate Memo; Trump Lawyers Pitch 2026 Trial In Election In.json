That's nearly a year and a half after the 2024 election and just a year and a half before the 2028 election.

It's their counter to Jack Smith's proposal to start this January. Meantime, the former president in his first on-camera reaction to the Georgia indictment has a warning to his party.

I am putting my own money into this campaign precisely to avoid taking a tin can with a hot hand (ph) asking a bunch of donors for permission to run. And I think that's a very different model from any of the other professional politicians in this race. And the good news is voters across our country, in our base, they can tell the difference between somebody who's actually sharing their own convictions versus somebody who's parroting off talking points served up to them 15 minutes or 15 days before a debate. I think the reality is also the message of my campaign is resonating. Shut down the administrative state, declare independence from China, grow the economy, revive national pride, revive our national identity itself. We as conservatives, we can't just be complacent with criticizing the radical Biden agenda. That's boring. It's trite at a certain point in time. We have to stand for a vision of our own.

But I'm looking forward to introducing myself to the people of this country and hopefully drawing some important policy contrasts from the rest of the field. I think this is an important moment for the GOP, to stop obsessing over the who. There has been so much obsession over Donald Trump or somebody else. Forget the who for a second. Let's first focus on who we are, but what do we stand for and why we stand for it. That's a discussion we actually haven't had in the GOP for a very long time. I think this debate stage is actually going to be good for the evolution of our party, really defining our agenda rather than devolving into biographical brawls.

We'll look at Nixon versus Fitzgerald. This is something that the press has altogether ignored.A president's acts while in office are something that he actually enjoys immunity for other than through the impeachment process. So, if he believes, even incorrectly, that he was looking after election fraud, that alone could be a defense. I also think there are deep due process failures. Let's start with the fact that they actually, Fulton County, publicly posted the charges of the indictment even before the grand jury had signed them. That's a grave, prosecutorial, bushy-tailed, over-excited mistake. That's a due process violation that itself could be grounds for a motion to dismiss. We also have to look at this prosecution in the context of the fact that there are three others, now four prosecutions in a series of months, all convening around a presidential election that sets a god- awful precedent, Jim, for this country. We do not want to become a nation where the party in power uses multiple different legal cases at the same time, pushing untested novel legal theories to knock out its opposition in the middle of a presidential election. That is not how we do things in the United States of America. And I say this as somebody who in many national polls is now polling second.
