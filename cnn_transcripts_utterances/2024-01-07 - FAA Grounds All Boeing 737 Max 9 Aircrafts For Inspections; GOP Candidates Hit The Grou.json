All of this because of the scary incident Friday night with an Alaska Airlines flight 1282 that was taking off from Portland, Oregon, en route to Ontario, California, here in southern California.This happened just minutes into takeoff when part of the fuselage just broke off. And you can see it in some of the video, it looks like a door. On this particular aircraft it was not used as a door, but could be used as a door if the plane was reconfigured by the airline. But when you look at the images coming from passengers on the plane, you can see hair is blowing around, you can also see that oxygen masks had been deployed. In fact, one passenger, Emma Vu, said that she did not know what was going on because she had fallen asleep before they even took off but knew something was wrong when she got a jolt awake and saw those oxygen masks, this all happening behind her, however. Another passenger said that he could see someone sitting in front of him and talked about the scary incident with one boy very close to that hole in the fuselage. Take a listen to him.

It has flown about 150 flights so far, but still a new plane having this incident happen is worrisome to many. But some of the experts that we have spoken to do say that if this was going to happen it's better that it happened at the altitude that it did instead of at a cruising altitude of like 30,000 feet simply because the air is so thin and people may have been up walking around the cabin at that point. And with that sort of hole in the plane, they could have been pulled right out. So, truly a miracle that no one lost their lives in this incident. Amara and Victor.",

They should be looking at where this fuselage and this panel was manufactured, which was in Wichita, and then it was sent to Boeing which would have been finally placed, this plug in place on the final assembly. The plane, they have to be looking at maintenance. They have to be looking literally at all factors. And they did list a number of things they would be looking at, metallurgy, survivability, manufacturing processes, and even safety -- overall safety accreditation of the plane. They did not however -- one thing they did point out is they would not be looking at the certification because, you know, they just looked at on the 737 Max 8, but, you know, that could be an issue, too, depending upon what they find.

The safety statistics improve as you get newer models of plane, more safety features, life-saving safety features on newer aircraft, but in the case of the 737 Max series now we've had two groundings, we've had -- if you look at just recent statistics it's probably the most deadly aircraft model in the world right now, depending on how many years you put in those statistics, and that is not a good trend line for a new aircraft model. So -- I mean, you know, Boeing took, you know, a major hit to its reputation over the Max 8, as it deserved. And, remember, Boeing signed a deferred prosecution agreement in which it agreed to sign this agreement so it would not get criminally charged or criminally prosecuted for its behavior over the Max 8.

He directly responded to a speech Biden gave on Friday, arguing that Trump is a threat to American democracy. Trump, as we've seen him do time and time again, tried to flip the script and argue that Biden is actually the threat to democracy and pointed to the series of indictments and charges that he is facing as proof of that argument. But Trump didn't just attack Joe Biden, he also really escalated his attacks on his rival Nikki Haley.

A source telling CNN that President Biden uh was not notified until days after the secretary was admitted to the hospital. And he was told by National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan who also didn't know about it until Thursday and notified the President late Thursday afternoon. Now, we know that Secretary Austin was admitted to the hospital on New Year's Day because of complications from an elected medical procedure. But that same day he was also on a call with top National Security officials and President Biden over among other things escalating tensions in the Red Sea. Now, we don't know if that call was before or after he was hospitalized, but it goes to underscore how critical a member he is to the Biden Administration, but also, again, how unusual this set of circumstances is. Now, in a statement, the secretary did say that I also understand the media concerns about transparency, and I recognize I could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed. I commit to doing better. He goes on to say, but this is important to say, this was my medical procedure and I take full responsibility for my decisions about disclosure. Now, that statement came yesterday. The public, the press, learned about the secretary being in the hospital on Friday. Typically, when senior admin administration officials are admitted to the hospital, the press will learn about it within 24 hours. So, this took days and they got criticism for that. And it's still unclear what the medical procedure was, how serious it was and what these complications were. But the White House did say last night that the President continues to have confidence in his secretary.",

And that is going to be a lasting scar that creates an insurgency. Even if Hamas steps down, whoever tries to impose security in Gaza is going to have a really tough time keeping the area stable especially with so much of it smashed so much of its, you know, water sanitation destroyed.

And it seems like Lloyd Austin may have forgotten that he is now a civilian public servant. He's a member of the cabinet.
