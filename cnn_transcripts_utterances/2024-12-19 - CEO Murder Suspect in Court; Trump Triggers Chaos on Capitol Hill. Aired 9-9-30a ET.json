Really appreciate it. A new hour of CNN NEWS CENTRAL starts now. Happening right now, the man charged with murdering a health care CEO on the streets of New York is right now in court. Prosecutors want Luigi Mangione extradited from Pennsylvania to New York. And that decision could come very soon. Also, as word that he could also be soon be facing federal charges. And on the brink of a government shutdown. The bipartisan deal that fell apart after Elon Musk started tweeting and Donald Trump called it a bad deal. There is no plan b at the moment, and they are very clearly running out of time. Any moment now we are going to get a first look at the new Superman. The trailer about to release any second for one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year. I'm Kate Bolduan, with John Berman and Sara Sidner. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: All right, happening at this moment, the man accused of murdering health care CEO Brian Thompson is inside a Pennsylvania courtroom. This hearing has been going on. One hearing, and a new one is about to begin on his extradition here to New York. Once that does conclude, suspect Luigi Mangione, who arrived in court - you can see the video of him arriving in court a little while ago. We are told he will waive extradition today. And the process to get him here to New York will begin. He could be here theoretically this afternoon. So, we've got teams inside the courtroom watching this hearing, outside with cameras, inside the hallways everywhere. Let's get to CNN's Brynn Gingras, who's with us here in New York monitoring all the developments. We talked to you a few minutes ago. What's the latest now?",

      "sentences": "Yes, John, the latest now is that we're hearing its possible - again, there are no communications inside the courtroom, so we're trying to filter this through our crews that are all there. It's possible that that first hearing has concluded and maybe the second hearing, the extradition hearing, is going to begin. It was expected to begin around 9What we do know is that he had first a hearing at 8:30 on those charges he faced in Pennsylvania, which was a forgery charge, a gun charge. And then what would happen is, the judge had to swap out. So, that new judge would take the bench, and he would have a hearing for that extradition hearing. Now, of course, our sources telling Kara Scannell that he was planning to waive extradition. That means that he will be brought back here to New York. So, once that hearing is concluded, then Mangione, our understanding, is that he will be in the custody of the NYPD. Now, we're still trying to also firm up whether or not he's going to be traveling from Pennsylvania to New York via helicopter, plane, or if it's going to be a ground transportation by car. But either way, he will be coming back to New York sometime today. Also not clear just yet is when he will actually go in front of a judge here in New York on the 11 charges that were unsealed in an indictment just two days ago, including murder one and murder two. We don't know if that hearing will take place today or tomorrow. So, we're trying to firm up all of this. But we know he will be back here in New York. Now, once he gets here, he will eventually make his way to 100 Center. Now that's the courthouse in lower Manhattan. You might be familiar with it. That is where Trump had his criminal trial earlier this year. He will be brought into what is called the tombs. He will have a booking photo done, fingerprinted, be in the custody of New York City and go in front of a judge. And tonight, I can tell you that he will definitely spend the night in Rikers, which is, of course, the prison - or the jail, rather, he will be held in until he eventually makes his way to his trial.",

You have a right to contest it. You're not going to. And then, of course, you move. So, what will happen is, is that could be virtually immediate, right? Not as in, he's transported to New York, but ultimately he'll be brought to New York, I would assume right away, and as early as tomorrow, right, he could be before a judge. And the purpose of that, we know he's indicted. He has a right as a defendant to be arraigned. That is apprized of the charges. And now, right, due process. And what is due process? Knowing and an opportunity to be heard. He'll enter a plea of not guilty, which is standard protocol, and then it's game on in terms of his attorneys filing motions, discovery, that is evidence being provided to the attorneys for evaluation, and then the case moves.",

What happens, Sara, very briefly, right, is that you have concurrent jurisdiction. The state, obviously, it was committed in Manhattan. The state has a right to move forward. But that does not mean that the federal government, right, has an opportunity because of that concurrent jurisdiction to go forward as well.And so what they will do is they will likely file charges under what's called the Travel Act. The Travel Act, wat does that mean? It means when you cross state lines and you're actually committing a crime, that's a problem. And it's federal in nature to the extent that you used interstate commerce to carry out what you did. Then it raises all other questions as the federal government does come in with respect to, do they now go first? Does New York go first? The big distinction, as we know, is that the federal government has the death penalty. New York state does not have the death penalty. His highest exposure, which is significant, is life in jail without parole. Under the federal system, however, you could be sentenced to death, if convicted.",

And he was silent. That is certainly the undertone of this meeting right now is there is not a plan going forward. House Democrats are wondering what that plan is and are eagerly trying to put the onus on Republicans to get this solved in a matter of hours.

And instead, Republicans are hitting themselves over the head with a hammer, going into a potential shutdown over the holidays, into a speaker election, into an inauguration. And it means, yes, as Matt said, that there are vulnerabilities here, but it also means that this does not help Donald Trump's agenda to kick off the way that it should. If there are questions about the speaker vote, if we're dealing with those kinds of questions moving forward into an inauguration, it creates problems for Donald Trump that he doesn't need as a brand new president or as a president-elect building that transition.
