As we follow the FTX fall from grace and surveythe outlook for the crypto space with the head of the giant crypto exchange Coinbase our special interview with the CEO Brian Armstrong coming up later on in the program. His key message though, does not judge the entire crypto community by the actions of one rogue player. We will discuss also this regulator has to pay us the commissioner at the powerful U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC on what regulators can and should learn from this and what comes next. Former FTX head, Sam Bankman-Fried saying in a new interview that fresh regulation is not the answer using language way too strong to repeat here. Just for the record, I disagree. The industry needs much more robust regulatory oversight to protect investors and consumers. And withdrawal some level of trust and level the global playing field. We will discuss it's an important day to discuss Chris Rosette future amid reports that crypto lender BlockFi is planning a bankruptcy filing. Just to remind you BlockFi was once the recipient of millions of dollars, worth of FTX aid. The lending unit of crypto investment bank Genesis Global and Crypto exchange, Gemini restricting customer withdrawals too. So there's clearly turmoil in this space or ongoing turmoil. The Head of Binance now proposing a crypto recovery fund to help steadying tottering firms their crypto outlook bruised. The U.S. stock investors not enthused. Take a look at that futures looking softer. After a Wednesday pullback driven in part by a holiday sales warning from retail giant target and some hawkish fed speak too. They are nowhere near done yet. In Europe, U.K. shares are lower. After the government's austere budget statement spending cuts and tax hikes are on the menu. And we are live in London with more on the details of that. In the meantime, it's a softer picture over in Asia too with particular weakness among tech stocks. Tencent is slashing its exposure to meal delivery firm Meituan. And there are fears of more Tencent entrenchment ahead too. It's also set to cut it straight in online retail@jd.com, Wowzers. There are lots to get to today. But in the meantime, we do begin with the war in Ukraine. And Ukraine is likely to get access to a missile strike site in Poland that according to a senior Polish official. It's what President Zelenskyy has been calling for and also repeated in his late night address on Wednesday saying, \"The Ukrainian position is very transparent. We want to establish all the details, every fact\". Meanwhile, dozens of new missile attacks across Ukraine took place today mostly targeting energy infrastructure once again. Nic Robertson joins us now from Kyiv. Nic, good to have you with us! Presidents Zelenskyy very clear last night I mentioned it there in his speech. But he did create a degree of confusion over that earlier missile strike this week when talking to Ukrainian journalist earlier on Wednesday. Just can you talk us through perhaps some of the confusion that was created and what we know?",

And as well, there will be questions asked in the investigation was Russia intentionally flying cruise missiles close to the border with Poland to induce these automated air defense systems, which trigger off on where a missile is detected. It doesn't have somebody writing a joystick, it's all automatic. To chase down that list, I did Russia intentionally fire one close to the Polish border to try to engender such a scenario, because Russia would see that potentially as a way to cut off these much needed air defense supplies that Ukraine is getting from the rest of the world. So it's a very, very politically charged situation. And it does seem that President Zelenskyy always aware of what can happen in the political scene has now his statements seem to run concurrent with what we're hearing from his allies and partners at NATO.",

One struck with Ukraine, one stuck with Russia, they're not making a deal with each other on this that this Turkish U.N. effort has actually pushed the boundaries. So this new grain movement should get more of that tonnage of grain, shipped around the world. Remembering in the summer that it was hoped that three-month period, 90 days will get about 20 million tons of grain and other commodities out they didn't achieve that target just a little bit less than 11 million tons.

But if the G 20, in Bali, Julia, I mean, he had meetings with a number of U.S. allies. Of course, there was that three-hour marathon on Monday with President Biden, where Xi Jinping later, you know, push back at the narrative that it's a fight of democracy versus autocracy. He said that what he has in his country is, as he put it, Chinese style democracy. And he also met, by the way with the Leaders of Australia, France, and the Netherlands, South Korea, South Africa, Senegal, and the list goes on, in terms of the meetings that he had. And what's also really interesting to me, Julia, is that he's now here in Bangkok. And he was in Indonesia, mingling with people without a mask, shaking hands, you know, walking through streets that are bustling. And essentially back to almost pre pandemic levels, in terms of tourism and in terms of businesses being open, life feeling normal. And yet the China that he rules with 1.4 billion people, they're still living in this, you know, Orwellian pandemic Time Warp with rolling lockdowns and mandatory COVID testing and a Polish state of heavy surveillance where movements are restricted so even though he's trying to portray himself much like a Western Leader, including with this sort of face to face diplomacy.

It's certainly looking into the conservatives, if there were an election to be held today would actually lose that. What he's doing is freezing things like spending on cultural activities, freezing certain budgets of certain government departments, putting a bit more money on the table for the National Health Service. To acknowledge the fact that there's a huge pandemic backlog that needs to be addressed a little bit more money on the table for education, which Xi says will hopefully try and raise the level of educational attainment and therefore productivity. Perhaps boosting the tax takes in a few years, time. They're also going to be acknowledging that there'll be some help needed for the lowest earners in the country.

And that often gets all lumped together just like that. And to weather this accelerates the right kind of regulation. Something our next guest has long called for joining us now is Hester Pierce, one of the five commissioners at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Commissioner Pierce, fantastic to have you on the show with us! Can we start there because this is something that you fought for? Do you think that those recent events, I know you can't be specific about individual cases, accelerate regulation? And they know, it's not a simple question, nor is it an easy solution. But do you think it does accelerate? HESTER PEIRCE, U.S. SEC COMMISSIONER: Yes, Julia, thank you for having me. And I do think that an event like this can be a catalyst for really focusing minds on regulation. And that's a good thing. I mean, these are rules that we should have been writing years ago. And so if we can turn our attention to doing that now, that's a good thing. There are a couple of things, though, to worry about. And one is that in the wake of something bad happening. It's often very tempting to craft regulations just based on what you just saw. And second, you know, rushing to regulation can mean that you don't get the public input that you need to develop good regulation. So I think we need to turn our attention to it, work on it, get the broad public input that we need, and that will be a good thing.",

And I think this is very important. And I'll read it to you, as we show it. Congress's failure to pass legislation, creating regulatory guardrails for crypto trading, combined with the complete hostility and lack of transparency by the SEC. Governor, has generated a debilitating amount of legal uncertainty. Can I ask for your response to that? Because I know you've long said, and you've been opened with your boss, Gary Gensler, the SEC Chair, but the enforcement approach isn't enough. It's not optimal for not we're seeing. Do you think he's hostile to the sector in general? And is that creating a gap where consumers are at greater risk than they should be because that's the key.",

And I do have thesame concern that the lack of regulatory clarity in the United States has led to undue emphasis on trading, and not on building things. And so I think if we had better rules in the United States, if we were clear about when something is covered by the securities laws. And then we went and we develop the securities laws, in the way that were that Congress authorized us to do, to allow necessary accommodations to let the experimentation happen to let the technology grow. Then the development in this space would have been healthier, and there would have been greater protection. For people buying tokens, there would have been better information I put out several years ago now, a call to have a safe harbor in which there'd be disclosure given when tokens were being sold. So these are basic things that would have put us in a better place. I'm not going to speak to what my fellow Commissioners feel about crypto, I think that's up to them to say, but you know, as regulators in this space, we could have done more.",

And so I'm always looking for ways that we can lower barriers to entry. That doesn't mean eliminating regulations; it just means thinking about which regulations are necessary.

And someone in the industry said to me, you know, for someone that wants to invest in this kind of thing, at the moment. It's like almost putting money with a bank. Clearly, a crypto exchange is not a bank, but you put your money there. You can transfer it to some form of digital assets or crypto. But the big difference is that when you put your money in a bank, there's insurance, if things go wrong. You'd almost be better off today, rather than giving your money to a crypto exchange actually just putting the money on a Starbucks card, because at least there's guaranteed utility value in that you get lots of coffee. And their point was about one that the lack of clarity, the lack of protections. But also that what's going on right now doesn't allow the good to flourish. It means that everybody's tarred with the same brush, and actually takes down the good with the bad.

And it is a moment for introspection too. I mean, the industry doesn't need to wait for the government to try to fix everything there. There are many things that the industry should have been doing on its own proof of reserves is one basic thing. There, the whole point of decentralized technology is transparency so that you can see what's happening. And indeed, that did help some people see what was happening in certain situations. There have been instances where bad things have happened, and people have been able to see that on chain, right? And so I think that is an area to where people can spend their time doing things on their own without the regulator coming in thinking about counterparty risks. Thinking about the risks that come from leverage the risks, when you leave your money or your assets in a particular place, you should have an understanding of what the risk of that place is?

And unfortunately, due to the lack of the clarity about that crypto specific legislation, in particular in the U.S. around what is a commodity, what is a security, what are other types of crypto like stable coins; it's driven a lot of the activity to these off-shore players. And that has turned out to actually harm investors that, you know, we're drawn to these overseas companies. It's harmed American businesses. And so I think there's a real impetus, this is a moment for U.S. and every major market around the world to say, let's go create that regulatory clarity for the crypto space. So we can grow this industry in a trusted and reliable way. And we stop having investors be harmed by these off-shore actors.",

And so, you know a lot of venture firms, I think are going back and looking at what diligence they did as well. And what were the signs, what could they have seen? I know, for myself, just seeing over the last year, I knew how much revenue we had done as a public company. You know, last year, we did seven billion revenue and, and I knew what our budgets were to kind of go do venture investments and these kinds of things. And FTX which was a relatively small competitor at that time, you know, they done about 1/7 our revenue, they seem to have unlimited funds to go invest in things. And I certainly was scratching my head a few times to think like, where are they getting the liquidity from this? You know, they had this other entity called Alameda, which was their market maker/ hedge fund and people kept telling me what that thing is just printing so much money. That's how it's explained. But, you know, we always, we never wanted to have a market maker, we felt it was a conflict of interest, since we're operating an exchange and you know, it just seemed too good to be true.

Firstly, there are likely would you agree that the other people struggle as a result of the complication that this is added and the pressure that this has added to the sector? I think the latest is Genesis. So the lending arm of the crypto brokerage now Genesis saying its suspending withdrawals Binance, which is another crypto exchange, a giant one out there is talking about a recovery fund to try and support those that good companies that are now under severe pressure as a result of this.

And one bad player does not undermine the entire thing, similarly to how you know, Bernard Madoff doesn't, you know, cause us to question the entire financial system, the traditional financial system. So there are various actors out there now kind of creating different ways to establish trust, you know, Coinbase is going to do that, as a public company. We're unique in that regard. We're the only publicly listed company out there. And so audited financial statements are a really good first step. But I think we can go even beyond that and use the power of crypto to sort of say, OK, and well, what cryptographic proofs we can provide. And eventually this industry should move to, you know, using self-custodial wallets and something called defy decentralized finance, which is totally done in transparent on the blockchain, where anybody can go audit the exact code that's being run. They can store crypto funds themselves, that's kind of the future promise of crypto and where things are going to create a more trusted and fair and free financial system where you don't need to trust intermediaries, you can trust yourself and the laws of math.",

There's, in your mind, perhaps not that much further, it can go because that is important for your business as well.

I think every company right now is looking at how to make sure that they survive and not only just survive, but thrive through this down period. And so Coinbase, you know, we're very comfortable in these environments, believe it or not, over the last 10 years, we've been through about four of these cycles in crypto, this one just happens to be co-ordinated with a broader macro downturn. And so I think we're actually going to emerge much stronger from this period, we're incredibly well capitalized, we have over $5 billion, you know, we hold our balance sheet largely in U.S. dollars cash, by the way, so we're not seeing that exposure on our balance sheet to crypto. And we can, you know, there's opportunities in every down market as well and so I'm actually optimistic long term, how this is going to play out.
