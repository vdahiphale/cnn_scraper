Investors, businesses, workers and citizens all worried about what would happen. When free trade is at risk, that isn't good for competition in the global market. Thankfully, the belief in free and fair trade won the day. We renegotiated and we got an even better deal. To put it simply, we are and always will be stronger together. The world today is facing a lot of uncertainty with the rise in authoritarian leaders causing global instability and the high cost of living, putting stress on families at home. It's important that we come together as leaders and as friends to look at ways to make our economies more resilient.

They found some documents in a box in a locked cabinet, or at least a closet. And as soon as they did, they realized there were several classified documents in that box.And they did what they should have done. They immediately called the Archives, immediately called the archives, turned them over to the Archives, and I was briefed about this discovery and surprised to learn that there were any government records that were taken there to that office. But I don't know what's in the documents. My lawyers have not suggested I ask what documents they were. I've turned over the boxes.

I think how Jamie frames things is probably the correct one, in the sense that this is what the president knows, this is what his team has briefed him has happened and it also underscored the fact that the president is still not aware of what the documents are. He was not informed when he was briefed initially and he still has not been informed by his legal team up to this point. That was our understanding going into this press conference. That is what he confirmed there.He made clear he was surprised when he was briefed about that, kind of as Jamie alluded to, the idea that he takes classified information very seriously and how this was able to occur, how these documents were able to go, make into it this private office in this locked closet here. Look, I think the other key piece here, Wolf, that I think is most interesting, and we've gotten some reporting on this throughout the course of the day, through Evan Perez and our colleague, Paula Reid, and that is that, he said this is going to be over very soon, in terms of the review or he hopes it's over very soon. The understanding is that this is very much in that process, that the U.S. attorney who has been involved in this has already delivered an assessment to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, who would have to make a decision about next steps about where this may go. And the president seemed to hint at the possibility that that answer may be coming sooner rather than later. And that's critical, one, to understand the scale of what may be happening next, how significant this may be going forward, but also because White House officials have made clear they feel like they can't talk about the details about this process, about how things have played out over the course of the two months when they knew about this and did not talk about it until that review is complete, until the attorney general has weighed in. So, that will be a critical moment for a number of different reasons, not the least of which could answer some of the questions that we still don't have answers to right now.",

Whether or not he actually knows how it happened, we don't know, because he also said he doesn't want to sort of engage anymore because this is now in the hands of the Justice Department. But he did say he was surprised to learn about this happening. And, look, he's also -- never mind the politics of this happening on the back of what happened at Mar-a-Lago, which we cannot say enough is a very, very different situation. He's also, because of other issues in his predecessor's administration, promised during the campaign and has pretty much stuck to it not to meddle in things going on at the DOJ, especially when it's about him and his office and his previous office.So, he is in a bit of a bind when it comes to that.

And number two, I didn't know what was in these documents. That speaks to the intent as to did he know he was mishandling or misappropriating classified information, right? And that's just -- you know, we talked about this basically for the last four or five months. Now on process, there is a question as to can the Justice Department fairly investigate it. Now something I said on your show months ago, yes, I believe the Justice Department can. Now, if there is a public perception that politics might be involved, then you may move down the road of appointing a special counsel. That's the decision the attorney general is going to have to make. Again, I think he can.

And on it was stamped \"VP Personal.\" He opens it up. He sees something that says \"classified.\" he closes it and he makes a call, and he says we have a problem here. And they immediately cooperate with the archives. That folder saying \"VP personal\" may be the answer to the question of why it might have been mistakenly packed up with his things and sent to his private office. We don't know yet. But it's a plausible thing. And then let's just remember, we are talking about 10 documents here with Biden, with Trump it was hundreds. And most important, maybe, cooperation.

That's why we classify it. And so, you know, I was interviewed with Pamela Brown on CNN shortly after the Mar-a-Lago raid, and I felt I was excessive.
