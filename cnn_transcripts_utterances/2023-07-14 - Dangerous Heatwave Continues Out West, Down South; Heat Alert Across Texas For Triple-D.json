The south, the southwest, the west coast, all well over 100 degrees and shattering heat records.And the streak is far from over. Forecasters warn this weekend is going to be extreme. California bracing for the hottest triple-digit weather of the year. Most of the state is under some kind of heat alert. Death Valley could hit 130 degrees this weekend. Phoenix hasn't dropped below 110 in two weeks. And the nights are offering little relief. Normally, you get some in the evenings but not so. Cooling centers are a form of refuge but burn centers say they're seeing more patients who have been injured by the sizzling concrete. CNN's senior national correspondent, Ed Lavandera, sweating it out for us in Dallas. Actually, you look pretty good. I want to know how you are staying cool there, Ed. But El Paso is set to top its heat record that was set nearly 30 years ago at 117 degrees. I think when people look at Texas now, they always want to know how the power grid is holding up when you have temperatures like this.",

So far, ERCOT, the organization that essentially manages the Texas power grid, which has spent several years under a great deal of scrutiny, says that the power is expected as to hold, that there's more than sufficient capacity to handle the coming days of heat.The organization did say that yesterday was a record peak amount of energy use here in the state because of these record hot temperatures. Here in Texas and Oklahoma were some of the hottest heat indices in the country. And right now, the temperature here in the Dallas-Fort Worth area starting to approach 100 degrees. The heat index well over that, 105, expected to creep a little bit closer to 110 as we get later into the day. But there's more than 90 million people from Florida to California under these heat alerts. And while, you know, a lot of people brush this off as a typical summer, these are dangerous conditions for many people. We're hearing reports from emergency EMS units across the country of increased reports and calls for heat-related illnesses and that sort of thing. And many adults, especially those caring for young children, are concerned about the conditions as well.

Prime Minister Albin Kurti was speaking about reducing tensions with the minority ethnic Serb population. And it's blastoff on a new mission to the moon. Today, India launched its third lunar mission, aiming to become just the fourth nation to successfully conduct a controlled landing on the moon's surface.

But now the World Health Organization has a new warning about Aspartame and its potential link to cancer. A committee for the WHO says the artificial sweetener should be categorized as possibly carcinogenic to humans. Aspartame can be found in everything from diet sodas to ice cream to cereal, breath mints, sports drinks. The list really goes on and on. We have CNN medical correspondent, Meg Tirrell, with us with more on this. Meg, should people be changing how much Aspartame they're consuming? Should they be trying not to consume any Aspartame?

That's making this whole set of announcements a little bit controversial.The way the WHO itself is sort of characterizing what it's saying -- its director of the Department of Nutrition and Food Safety, says, quote: \"While safety is not a major concern at the doses which are commonly used, potential effects have been described that need to be investigated by more and better studies.\" So essentially, they're saying there have been some studies that have suggested a potential link, but that link has not been proven that Aspartame actually causes cancer. So they put it in this category, which is really the third out of four in terms of potential cancer risks to humans. Other things in that category include aloe vera, occupational exposure to dry cleaning, gasoline, engine exhaust, and traditional Asian pickled vegetables. So they're nowhere near the highest groups of cancer-causing agents, like cigarettes and asbestos. Now the actual recommendations from the WHO in terms of the safe daily limit for the average 180-pound American, they would have to drink 33 cans of 12-ounce diet soda at the level the industry tells us of Aspartame in those cans in order to actually hit that limit. So almost nobody will probably -- is really actually there. And the FDA, Brianna, today, just came out saying it disagrees with the WHO's assessment, and said it considers Aspartame safe.

Among the things they're going to do is they're going to cut the monthly payments to $0 if you are borrowing -- if you are a borrower and you're making less than $32,800 per year, and for families of four, $67,500. So basically what they're going to do is push that down and say, look, if you're not making enough money to pay this, nobody benefits by forcing you to do it. They're also going to protect your credit score by basically saying, if you missed a payment, made late or partial payments, they're not going let you get negative credit reporting. And they're saying they're doing a better job of keeping track of the payments that have been made. So people who are pushed into forbearance, a system where basically they're never going to get out of it if they keep going that way, they're saying, look, we've got to get people out of this. The result, they think 804,000 borrowers will have their debt wiped out. And that's going to amount to about $39 million worth of debt going away. And again, even though some Republicans are immediately jumping on this and saying, oh, another big giveaway program and hate it, you add it all up, it's $116 billion in student debt relief. Republicans are saying this is a problem. I think there will be a court challenge. But the administration saying, listen to the court, they went to a different program where we think we have every legal right. And their argument is to say, if you want to help the administration, if you want to help struggling Americans, those who are not making much money anyway, you've got to have a way for them to get out from underneath this debt.
