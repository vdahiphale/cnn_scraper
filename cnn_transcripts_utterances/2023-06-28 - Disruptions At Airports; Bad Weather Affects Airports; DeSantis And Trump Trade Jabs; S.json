Now people from the Midwest and the northeast are being advised to stay indoors with their air conditioning running or wearing an N-95 mask if they have to be outside. That is how bad the air is.This is the scene from Chicago on Tuesday. Look at that. That is not fog. That is smoke. You can see the skyline covered in it. Take a look at another video from Milwaukee. You can barely make out where the buildings are. Look at that. Because the smoke is so heavy. And this is the scene in Minneapolis St. Paul, where the sky, very hazy today there. Canada is enduring its worst fire season ever. Across the country more than 200 fires are burning out of control today. Kate.",

One story in particular, one woman had eight flight delays, OK, and then she ended up deplaneing. Then four hours waiting in line. And then she ended up overnighting in Newark. This morning spoke to a family. They were supposed to fly to Florida on Spirit Airlines. They said this morning they got there and were told all of a sudden their flight was canceled. Their next flight not available until July 3rd. So their holiday is ruined. That's the story being heard over and over again at airports all over the country. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

RON DESANTIS (R-FL) AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And I think the idea of draining the swamp in some respects I think it misses it a little bit because if you -- we didn't drain it. It's worse today than it's ever been by far, and that's a sad testament to the state of affairs of our country. But even if you're successful at draining it, the next guy can just refill it.

      "sentences": "Well, John, it's interesting, I'm not sure that you can break a swamp. But the point is still clear, that Governor DeSantis is clearly trying to remind voters that Donald Trump did not accomplish all he set out to. We heard it earlier this week about the wall. He said that Donald Trump did not build the wall. That is true. He did not drain the swamp. That also is true.But you also notice that big banner behind Governor DeSantis. It says \"restore sanity.\" That may be a change from the Biden administration, but perhaps also a not so subtle message about how he is promising a change from the Trump administration. So, John, what we are seeing here in these summer months, really week by week by week, we are seeing these candidates draw some differences between themselves and between themselves and Donald Trump. So, yes, Governor DeSantis is not out there sort of hammering the former president again and again, but there really are some, you know, very interesting messaging things going on here about what Trump did not accomplish. That's one of the things that DeSantis is trying to do to get his sort of attention up, his poll numbers up over the summer. Of course he, you know, is struggling a bit more than he thought he would. He thought that, you know, he was the Republican candidate that people were awaiting for. He's finding out it's a little more difficult. But he was in New Hampshire yesterday taking questions from voters. And, John, as you know very well, covering campaigns, that's what you must do in New Hampshire. He started out by not taking questions from voters, not explaining what he would do. Now he is very much a normal candidate in that respect. And, increasingly, taking a few shots and drawing distinctions with former President Donald Trump.",

Big questions about how many candidates will still be on the ballot there, how many would survive Iowa.But it is an uphill climb for Governor DeSantis. He knows that. But say, for example, he would win Iowa. You go on to New Hampshire. It often has a different response. So, I think what he's doing now is just introducing himself to voters. And he needs a strong showing sort of everywhere. But we're in the very early stages, of course, of the New Hampshire primary campaign. But clearly I think he's just trying to show that he can be a strong presidential candidate and, by doing so, trying to draw some distinctions there with Donald Trump.",
