Mushelle \"Shelly\" Smith worked as a caregiver for Alex's mother, and says Alex came to his mom's home sometime after 9:00 p.m. on June 7, 2021. That would have been shortly after the state says Maggie and Paul Murdaugh's phones ceased all activity, meaning they were likely dead. Alex's mother had Alzheimer's. Smith said his mom was sleeping that night and that it was unusual for Alex to come visit her so late. Smith recalled Alex stayed about 15 to 20 minutes. Despite that, she says he told her the next day, unsolicited, that he was there much longer than that.",

And what we discovered was that he had a similar pattern of 21 $199.99 entries all on the same day.Now, we talked to Zeldin's campaign. His former campaign manager told us that he believed this was batched for accounting reasons, but it certainly raises a lot of questions. And so we started to look at who is Nancy Marks, this treasurer. And what we discovered was that she did more than what your typical treasurer does, which is just -- would normally be kind of an arm's length books and records accounting. That she was involved in fundraising with Santos. That - that she was even setting some goals for people to reach in fundraising. And that she was involved with for profit entity that Santos had set up. So, their relationship goes much deeper. That is starting, you know, to draw a lot more scrutiny. Now, Santos is distancing himself from her saying that, you know, he -- he wasn't involved with the filings. He had a treasurer for that. She resigned from the campaign at the end of last month. So, just a lot of questions here. And I spoke to a long-time client of hers. He's been with her for 15 years. He called, after she resigned he called her and asked her, you know, have you done something wrong? And she said, absolutely not.
