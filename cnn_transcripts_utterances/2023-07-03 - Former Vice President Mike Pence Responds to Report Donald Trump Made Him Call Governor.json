Now, Jack Smith is focusing on this effort that really took hold after Trump lost the election to try to swing and steal the election results in these seven swing states, including by directly pressuring state officials. We know about the infamous phone call that we just heard that Trump placed to Brad Raffensperger, asking him to just find 11,780 votes.Now, we know that last week, Jack Smith did speak with Brad Raffensperger, arguably belatedly. It's been a year since he testified in front of the January 6th committee. And we're also now learning that Donald Trump pressured the then governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey. Now, Doug Ducey has said that Jack Smith has actually not contacted him. That could be on the to-do list. And I think it's very consistent with what DOJ has been doing. There's also been this focus on what we call the fake electors scheme. What that means is there was a coordinated effort, all seven of these states, people working for and with Trump and his team, put together actual documents that they actually submitted to the National Archives that said we are the rightly selected electors for Donald Trump. And then people, Republicans, Trump supporters from those states actually signed those certifications. Now, we know that the DOJ has spoken with several of these fake electors. We don't know exactly who. They've been given immunity, meaning, you have to testify. We're not going to use your statements against you. Tells me DOJ sees these folks as potential witnesses.",

Obstruction of an official proceeding, meaning, they tried to block the counting of electoral votes. That charge has been used successfully against many of the people who actually stormed the Capitol. Potentially false statements. Remember those false elector certificates. They're false, they were actually submitted to the archives. Conspiracy to defraud the United States is sort of the broadest legal theory, meaning they tried to cheat the election.And people have said, could there be incitement charges for what Donald Trump said at the ellipse, did he incite the riot? That's going to be difficult because, yes, he said, we're going to go down to the capitol, yes, he said you're going to fight like hell. But he also said, be peaceful and patriotic. And just to keep in mind what's happening inside DOJ, Jack Smith is the special counsel. He's running this investigation. When it comes to January 6th, he's going to recommend, indict or do not indict. Either way, it then goes to the attorney general. Now, the A.G. has to defer to Jack Smith, but we've already seen Merrick Garland is willing to approve a criminal charge of the president.

The UK sent them, I believe the Storm Shadow capability and they've utilized it to some degree, the US has been very wary of sending what are known as ATACMS and part of the reason is because of how much the US actually has in terms of the weaponry itself.\"The Wall Street Journal\" reported on Friday that they may actually be moving back towards the direction of saying yes to that. I'm told there's caution on that, and we should maintain it. However, why do the Ukrainians want this so badly? Why has the US been so reluctant to give it to them?",

There's been a long shift towards more sort of familial language about Russia and there has long been sort of hostility to spending overseas. So is he right to be concerned? MAX ROSE (D), FORMER US REPRESENTATIVE:  He is absolutely right to be concerned, but we've seen this really strange reversal of traditional political positions.
