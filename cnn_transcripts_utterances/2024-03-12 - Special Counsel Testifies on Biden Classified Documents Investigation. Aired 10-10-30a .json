And you could see just a few moments ago, as Wolf was pointing out, those committee members making their way into the into the committee hearing room. They'll get started in just a few moments.I'm back with Kasie Hunt and Paula Reid. I do want to read just a portion of the Hur opening statement where he talks about what the president was up to with respect to these classified documents. And if we have, we could show it to our viewers and he says, and he's going to say this in just a few moments, my task was to determine whether the president retained or disclosed national defense information willfully, meaning knowingly and with the attempt to do something the law forbids. I could not make that determination without assessing the president's state of mind. For that reason, I had to consider the president's memory and overall mental state and how a jury likely would perceive his memory and mental state in a criminal trial. Paula, I mean, much has been made, and I suppose Democrats are going to seize on this and want to talk about this. I suppose Republicans will take some shots perhaps at this as well, you know, wondering why Hur put this in there to begin with, why did it need to be in there?",

      "sentences": "Well, he said he had to do it. He had to lay out his reasoning as a prosecutor. He said, as a prosecutor, these are the kinds of considerations that you must make. He says in the first few lines of his executive summary, he says, our investigation uncovered evidence that President Biden willfully retained and disclosed classified materials. And then he has to go through the steps to assess the strength of his case. Can I prove this beyond a reasonable doubt? And these comments about his memory, well, I know that they aggravate the White House. This was how he viewed the case, not strong enough to bring because he couldn't prove it beyond a reasonable doubt.And I'm told from a source very close to Hur that they believe one of the reasons that the transcript was released today by the White House is because the White House is probably concerned that additional damaging information could come out under questioning. But I'm also cautioned that Hur hopes to not really reveal too much more new information and stay within the contours of his report.",

Kasie, you know, just some final thoughts from you before we get started here because we're going to get going at any moment, but the fact that this was included in this report at the time that it was when there were these questions that were being raised about the president's fitness and so on. I mean, the president addressed a lot of that during the State of the Union speech.So, I mean, this is -- they're going to go back and forth over this issue. But in the minds of a lot of Americans, this may have been resolved, maybe not everybody, but to some extent during the State of the Union.",

And, look, I think that from a political perspective, you have to remember that the thing that is the most damaging to the president in terms of how his age impacts voters is this idea that it means that he is a weak leader.It's not necessarily about his health or his sharpness. It's, is he strong enough, right? And so that is the theme that I'm looking for from Republicans on this committee. Let's also take a step back and remember that we are living in just incredibly divisive and polarized times, right? I mean, these are not typical political times.

And I was -- of multiple pages. And so what I was referring to, I said classified, I should have said, it should be private because it was a contact between the president and the vice president as to what was going on. That's what he was referring to. It was not classified information in that document. That was not classified. REPORTER",

And all the stuff that was in my home was in filing cabinets that were either locked or able to be locked. It was in my house. It wasn't out in -- like in Mar-a-Lago in a public place where, and none of it was high classified. It didn't have any of that red stuff on it. You know what I mean around the corners? None of that. And so I wish I had paid more attention to how the documents were being moved and where. I thought they were being moved to the archives. I thought all of those would be moved. That's what I thought.
