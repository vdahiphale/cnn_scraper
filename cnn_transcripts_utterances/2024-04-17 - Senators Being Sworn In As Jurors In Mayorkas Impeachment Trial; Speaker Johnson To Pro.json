You are listening to the Senators being sworn in as jurors in the impeachment trial of the Homeland Security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas.Let's bring back in Gloria Borger and Ron Brownstein and Michael Gerhardt. Michael, I want to go out to you because what is interesting in a bit striking is, during Trump's first House impeachment, many Republicans definitive -- their defensive of him was essentially, he didn't commit a crime. He can't be impeached. And this time, the Republican impeachment managers are arguing the opposite, that impeachment, quote -- this is their quote, \"impeachment does not require the commission of indictable crimes.\" So which one is it? MICHAEL GERHARDT, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR, UNC-CHAPEL HILL: Well, it is, in fact, true that officials such as the president or secretary of Homeland Security may be impeached for non-criminal offenses. It's also true that maybe felonies that are so serious that they could serve as a basis for impeaching. So there are grounds that can be found either in terms of felony or in terms of something really bad and an abuse of power that the person who's being impeached has done.",

But in the data that were getting, in the polling that were seeing from voters, immigration is a concern for voters out there, especially in some of these swing states that are going to matter a lot to Joe Biden and Donald Trump.And so that continues to be a key issue that is going to drive us toward November.",

      "speaker": "RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST",
      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. And, as said earlier, Biden polls more poorly on immigration than almost any other subject, except possibly inflation.I do think immigration is reflective of a dynamic that is absolutely pivotal on this election across a whole range of issues. And that is that, as I said, voters are very discontented with Biden's record on immigration. And he gets bad marks, even among a surprising percentage of Democrats. It's hard for him to want to change that retrospective judgment on his performance very much between now and November. On the other hand, a lot of the things that Donald Trump is talking about doing on immigration are going to test kind of the public tolerance as well. I mean, he's talking about mass deportation, internment camps unilateral military action against Mexico, including a blockade, ending birthright citizenship. He would not rule out, in a CNN town hall last year, restoring his policy of separating kids from families, from their parents at the border. And so on all of these fronts, voters may be unhappy about what Biden has done. That doesn't necessarily mean they want to buy the direction that Trump is proposing. And that applies to a lot of different issues, on the economy, with tax cuts, et cetera. So I do think that, like, this is an interesting place, an interesting kind of encapsulation of the larger challenge. Trump largely wants voters to look back and kind of assess what the Biden four years have done, compared to what he says was his record his four years. Biden mostly wants voters to look forward and assess what each man would do with power if returned to the White House for four more years. Immigration really captures that dynamic.",

MANU RAJU, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. This is a key moment here in the House over this furious battle to fund the - Ukraine, give it aid that it's saying it desperately needs at this critical moment. Republicans have been badly divided for months. And now the speaker of the House indicating he's prepared to move forward the package that includes aid to Ukraine. They're planning to vote on separate bills in the House on Friday, splitting up this aid package between Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan, some other measures as well, including a potential ban on TikTok. But after they vote on them separately, they'll be tied together. We expect them to be tied together as one big bill that will go back to the United States. And that is causing furious anger among the right wing of his party because a lot of Republicans on that right flank have said there're should we absolutely no more money spent for Ukraine. They're also demanding new border security measures to be part of any deal. And that is not expected to be part of this underlying bill that eventually passes the House, if it does get the votes. I spent the morning talking to a lot of those members on the far right. And many of them are indicated that they may support an effort to oust Mike Johnson from his job. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And that is clearly his calculus here. And also there, which could be part of it, will Democrats come to his aid to save him from that threat of being ousted from the speakership? Much different than a historic and unprecedented ouster of Kevin McCarthy last fall when Democrats all voted with eight Republicans to oust him from the speakership.
