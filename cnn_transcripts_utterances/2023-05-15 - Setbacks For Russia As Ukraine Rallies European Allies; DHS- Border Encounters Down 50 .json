That happened inside or over Russian territory.

Those NATO members have pledged major new military aid ahead of Ukraine's highly anticipated counteroffensive. CNN's Sam Kiley. He is in Ukraine.

But they have said that they will begin training fighter pilots in the summer, which it already is in the United Kingdom with a view to putting those fighter pilots inside NATO-supplied F-16s.Of course, the U.S. has the majority of them and makes them. At the same time, he got long-range drones -- attack drones capable of reaching 200 kilometers. That's very important for him, and more air defenses. All of them are very illustratively important, Jim in the context of what's just happened across the border in Russia, where these four aircraft, two helicopters, and two jets reportedly downed in somewhat mysterious circumstances. It's unclear. For example, whether they were shot down in a series of own goals by Russian air defenses or whether the Ukrainians managed to get at them. But either way, they've been confirmed by President Lukashenko in neighboring Belarus, who says that it's somewhat concerning as to what's been going on there. And all of this combined with a sort of on-off, it's soon, but we need a bit more time messaging coming from Zelenskyy, once again, out of Chequers, the country retreat for the British Prime Minister, where he again said that the Ukrainians need a bit more time. Every time he says it's soon or gets delayed, he's rattling the cage of the Russians. He's saying to the Russian soldier, to the fighting man on the frontline, something terrifying is coming, and we're not going to tell you when. They're very much part of the psychological operations there. And the shaping operations that you've reported on in the past is the psychological game, working away steadily at the mind of the Russian soldier. And, of course, nothing's going to pray on his mind more than the recent successes that the Ukrainians have said that they've gained and that's confirmed by Russia around Bakhmut with some significant advances, Jim, in a localized counteroffensive. Possible that they may even try to exploit that as a wider military attack when this big offensive gets underway, Jim.",

Now, they are also clear that an agreement is not necessarily within reach in the near term. What they're trying to do, particularly today is on kind of the top issues that they feel like there's the potential to reconcile differences. it's kind of set up the most important ones, the most important differences within that context for the leaders to address tomorrow here at the White House. And that will be a critical meeting because, Brianna, as you noted, the calendar is certainly running short at this point. About two and a half weeks before the potential X date, as they call it. But the Treasury Secretary, Janet Yellen, laid out it just really adds the emphasis of the importance on these negotiations happening behind the scenes at the staff level driving into that meeting here tomorrow. One thing we're also keeping an eye on, we expect another update from the Treasury Department -- from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to lawmakers about what their calculations are for when a default would actually occur at some point early this week, potentially as soon as today. But the reality is this. Regardless of what each side is saying publicly, behind the scenes, there does seem to be an acknowledgment, a deal is an absolute necessity and for good reason. There's never been a default before. And a default would be an economic catastrophe. So, clearly, an effort to try and figure out a way out of this, but the pathway to actually reach that agreement is still pretty far off ground.",

That is something Republicans included in their proposal, and it's something that Democrats, including the White House, have shown some openness to negotiating on.

This is where migrants are dropped off by immigration authorities. And then normally they take buses here at the Brownsville station.And exactly what you're describing that officials are saying that's exactly what nonprofits are telling us here on the ground that the number of migrants that are being dropped off at respite centers along South Texas has dropped significantly about 50 percent or more. And the big question is why. I've been in contact with officials and also community leaders on the Mexican side of the border and they tell me that the tough talk by the Biden administration is resonating with migrants. He says that the images of migrants being shackled and deported back to their home countries that is circulating online and in WhatsApp groups, and that they're starting to believe that the border is closed and that there is a five-year ban on re-entry if you enter the country illegally. Now, according to these community leaders and officials in Mexico, they also say that the National Guard in Mexico -- their presence, especially along Tijuana, that has also decreased the number of smuggling groups that are in that area, which has also decreased the smuggling overall in that particular area of Tijuana, which across the border is San Diego. Now, back here in South Texas, these organizations are still preparing for the worst. The Brownsville superintendent is going to propose later this afternoon to the school board that they should make vacant schools available to the city of Brownsville just in case there is an uptick in migrants that are in this area and just in case the city needs to shelter them. But, Boris, everyone is still wondering if this uptick is actually going to happen or not. But based on what I'm hearing on the Mexican side, it really sounds like migrants, first of all, do not want to come into this country illegally only to be deported. And second of all, they're starting to use the CBP One app, the software that where they can set up an appointment. It just takes a really long time. Boris.",
