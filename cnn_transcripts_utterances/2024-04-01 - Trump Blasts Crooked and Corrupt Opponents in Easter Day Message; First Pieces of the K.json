      "sentences": "It's Monday, April 1st, April Fools. Right now on CNN THIS MORNING, Donald Trump preparing to return to the campaign trail, he had a pretty dark Easter message for America, I will tell you what he said.The first pieces of the key bridge removed from the Patapsco River, crews are racing to reopen the critical port of Baltimore. And House Speaker Mike Johnson getting advice from an unlikely source, as he maneuvers to try and keep his job. All right, it is 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, a live look at Capitol Hill on this Easter Monday, good morning, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's wonderful to have you with us. We'll begin with the striking contrast and messaging over the Easter weekend, President Biden went with uplifting traditional -- this was his Easter Sunday post. Donald Trump veered in a different direction. He had this all caps tirade on Truth Social, \"happy Easter to all including cricket and corrupt prosecutors and judges that are doing everything possible to interfere with the presidential election of 2024 and put me in prison, including those who completely and totally despise me because they want to destroy America. Now, a flailing nation.\" Now, that's hopeful and uplifting. Biden also celebrated Sunday as transgender day of visibility that falls every year on March 31st, that did not include some on the right, including the House Speaker, Mike Johnson from saying that the president was sharing the Christian holy day, Johnson posted on the platform, formerly known as Twitter. The American people are taking note. Here was Democratic Senator and Pastor Raphael Warnock talking about the stark contrast and tones we saw this weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA):  This is just one more instance of folks who have -- who do not know how to lead us, trying to divide us. And this is the opposite of the Christian faith. Jesus centered the marginalize, he centered the poor, and in a moment like this, we need voices, particularly voices of faith, who would use our faith not as a weapon to beat other people down, but as a bridge to bring all of us together.

Marianna, good morning, thanks for being here on this Easter Monday. So, this has become a little bit part for the course, but it is still, I think important to remark on President Biden, obviously, a man of faith himself, his Catholic faith has always been part of both his private, but also his public persona, and he went with a very kind of traditional approach here at the former President Donald Trump, going with the politics of grievance.On again, we should note, you know, the religious holiday is about uplift and you know, redemption and you know, rising from the dead and all of that. What does this say about the presidential race up broadly and what we're heading for here in November of 2024?",

I don't know if you saw the Truth Social post, it was just like a barrage of him criticizing the investigators who are -- you know, looking into his several cases and then coming after Biden and call him all these names too.And I think that that's just kind of become part of, I think what we all see in this election. And it's kind of a little concerning that people are so willing to be like, well, that's just Trump being Trump.

[05:05:00] HUNT:  Well, speaking of Christians, there was -- there was a Christian behavior, I should say, and there was a video that Trump posted, leap Friday, Friday afternoon, that quite frankly got a little bit lost in the holiday weekend. I'd like to show a little bit of that video if we can. It's from -- Trump posted it on his Truth Social platform. And it shows a Pickup truck driving on Long Island with, you know, flags on the back of it. And again, they said that they filmed this on Long Island when -- and around the president attending the funeral for the slain NYPD officer, and it shows President Biden -- there's a picture of President Biden on the back, and he is hog-tied. And both the Trump campaign and the Biden campaign responded to this. The Trump campaign saying, \"so, this is the beginning of the video and watch it as it kind of comes into frame.\" And there you can see it on the back. Again, this is a Trump campaign repost, so, let's get that up on the screen as well, because I don't want us to just be, you know, acting like this is something we are showing. This is something that the Trump campaign posted -- all right, that's enough. Let's take it down. The Trump campaign's spokesman said that picture was on the back of a Pickup truck that was traveling down the highway, Democrats and they say, crazed lunatics, they're making a claim that they've called for violence against President Trump. I'm going to sit here and dispute that. They also make the -- they claim again, they're weaponizing the  justice system. The Biden campaign said, \"this image from Trump is the type of crap you post when you're calling for a bloodbath or when you tell the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by.\" I mean, it is very clear. I'm not sure I've ever seen an image like that of a sitting president in this context. And again, they can't control what supporters do, but they sure as hell can control what Donald Trump puts on his social feed. And this is something that he re-circulated.",

Trump is calling for all those violence, he's trying -- you know, we don't know what would happen if he loses again and then come January.Would it be another January 6th? And they're trying to warn that. And again, I think that there's this issue when you see polling -- Democrats put the threat to democracy at the top of their concerns. Meanwhile, Republicans are not, you know, pulling that high on that issue. They're talking about immigration, they're talking about an economy, and I think that there's quite a discrepancy about who sees these messages as an actual attack on American democracy, and who just like waives them off as being, you know, again trumping Trump.  HUNT:  Well, and this is also something that is very personal for President Biden. I mean, obviously, in this case, it's violence against President Biden, but I mean, you know, they referenced Charlottesville in their statement, right? And what happened there. And that has always been a moment that for President Biden was galvanizing. I mean, he has said out loud, it was a big part. The reason why he wanted to run in 2020, and he also will say that he has acknowledged much to the chagrin, frankly, this aid sometimes that he's only running now because he's running against Trump and he sees that it is that important for these reasons, no?",

We were not used to seeing this level of, like political rhetoric before. It was so violent and so hateful. And I think that there's still that effort by the Biden campaign to really nail that. But they're still struggling to get a message across to them, to all of these like pro-Trump voters who just haven't been able to let go of all of that denial and -- and some men -- and you know, hatred towards others.",

And there's a big question about conscription. Every single military age Israeli has to serve in the army except ultra-orthodox who have had a religious exemption all the way along. That exemption apparently is now in question. And the significance of that is that no matter which way Netanyahu goes on it, it may fracture the coalition in either direction and spark new elections.

You see them here. So, they were, you know, thrilled to bits. And then, Charles actually went over to them and was shaking hands without gloves. And I think this is a big -- you know, a symbol of re- assurance really with him and the princess both suffering from cancer right now. He is now confident enough to go speak to the public. So, his first public engagement as doctors are currently happy with that. I spoke to a source saying future engagements are still the subject of medical advice, but this was an encouraging sign of how treatment is progressing and we look -- as we look towards the Summer, and how the road ahead is looking positive. So, this was a big moment actually for the monarchy, which has been under so much pressure here.",
