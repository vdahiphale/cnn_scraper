This hour, President Biden will have his chance to possibly speak out publicly for the first time as he's leaving Delaware. Both campaigns right now looking to capitalize off this truly uncharted territory-type moment that country finds itself in once again. July 11th is now the newest key date leading up to the November election. That date July 11th is when Donald Trump is scheduled to face sentencing and that's just four days before the Republican convention when Republicans were formally nominate him to be their presidential candidate.CNN's Kristen Holmes and Brynn Gingras are live inside and outside Trump Tower I think is what I'm looking at. Kristen, take us inside first. Donald Trump says he's holding a press conference. What are you hearing we could be -- he could say? KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I wouldn't expect to hear anything different from what he has been saying that this case was election interference, but it should have never been broad. It was political persecution, and probably trying to link this without any evidence to President Joe Biden. And the reason why he has continue to repeat this rhetoric is because his team thinks that this helps him in November that it riles up the base, that it really helps rally Republicans around the former president. Now I will note that there are several advisors and allies of the former president who will acknowledge that they are in uncharted territory, they don't know what is going to happen. They are feeling good. After getting a lot of fundraising numbers, they haven't given them to us yet. But they say that they really took in a lot of donations in the last 24 hours, of course, we'll wait to see what those numbers look like. But they still don't know. And I want to talk about a recent poll that came out and it was specifically about people who said that they were going to vote for Donald Trump. Seven percent of those people said they were less likely to vote for him if he was convicted. Now, his team has told me they don't believe that. They don't believe that number. They believe that this is actually going to help him. But that margin is pretty big when you consider that both Trump and Biden believe that this margin that this election is going to be determined by a very small number of voters. And when you talk about 7 percent of Trump's base, the people that always turn out for the former president, that could be a problem. But again, I will note his advisors are saying right now they are feeling good, because of the fact that the former president has gotten so many calls from allies, lawmakers, donors saying they're standing by him and they are donating to his campaign.",

Look, the bottom line is, there's not many reasons against an appeal, Kate, because you want appeals, that's our system of justice. And that's how you exhaust the system. And if there's any error, and just to be clear, what you're appealing is not -- the jury got it wrong. You're appealing whether there was evidence before the jury that perhaps should not have been before, or evidence that the jury didn't see that perhaps they should have. Those are judicial rulings.I think another thing that's going to be significant is the issue as to how we got to the felony, and how we got to the felony, somewhat technical, but you have to first conclude that there's this fraudulent ledger invoices and the checks, and then you have to make the leap with respect to the concealment of this other crime. What is concerning is that as to that leap, you just have to determine that it was an unlawful purpose. You can decide smorgasbord, what unlawful it is to you. And that's somewhat troubling to me. I think there should be a specific delineated other crime not well, it could be campaign finance, it could be taxed. Well, I think it's this, if the jurors could have a different assessment with respect to what it is, but could conclude it was unlawful, and therefore he's guilty. That to me is troubling, that certainly will be an issue for appeal.",

I think they'd all talk themselves into a hung jury. I really do. If you listen to what they had said, in the days and hours, even while they were deliberating. I think that's where they were.

How do you persuade your fellow jurors? Because that's what they're doing when they asked for things like a read back of certain testimony or the judge's instructions. Again, they're using that to persuade their fellow jurors, this is a negotiation among the jurors.And then finally, you know, this was 34 counts of guilty. A lot of people thought that they might split that up, they might find the checks that Donald Trump wrote to be guilty, the other ones not guilty somehow compromise on that, but they didn't, 34 counts of guilty. So what happened there? Did they talk at all about splitting up those counts in any way and finding some guilty, some not guilty? Or were they just, you know, on it for the whole time.",

But let's be clear about this. There are people at Rikers Island on misdemeanor offenses, right? There are people were sentenced to jail because their lawyers take pleas from felonies down to misdemeanors to do jail.But I think that an essential thing with the judge is going to be respect for the judicial system. Look, I know it's a campaign you can wax poetic, corrupt judge, corrupt D.A., this, that, the other, but you got to accept some responsibility, 34 counts, we have a jury system, and that 12 jurors concluded you're guilty, and just to absolve yourself of all sin, because it's Biden, it's this one, it's that one, it's not you, I think that's troubling to the judge. And it may play a big factor with regard to what the judge does, and will certainly hear Trump saying a lot of things between now and then I'd be careful.",

I think going after Stormy Daniels the way that they did even the framing of the cases that she was a liar. And this never happened when you didn't really need to prove any of that. I think they should have focused really narrowly on whether he was involved in causing those financial documents to be falsified and not getting into the whole thing about did he or didn't he with her?Yes, and even the part about, you know, the conspiracy with respect to the campaign, not that they shouldn't have challenged that, they should have. But that was so overwhelming. That at the end of the day, I think if they had narrowly focused on, you can't believe Michael Cohen, he's the only one who gives you direct evidence of the falsification. And so you must acquit really narrowly and strongly. I think they would have been better off. JACKSON: Yes, you know what I agree with Jen. The problem is, I don't put that on the defense lawyers. I don't. I think their client was like, I want you to rip Stormy Daniels. I want you to do this. You know, clients have to sit down, right? And certainly they're very important with regard to what we do. But we're the lawyers, let us have our strategy in theory. Stormy Daniels doesn't matter. Let's not talk about the affair, not the affair. Did you see ledgers falsified? Do you know anything about the internal operations of the company? Do you know what Trump did or not? You know, if he signed anything, no, sit down. But they're like, I'm sure he was behind that saying I want that him to be excruciated. I want this. No. You want to win and whatever we take to win, that's what you should follow. And that's why, John, I think you're absolutely right. But I think they were hamstrung don't know that for a fact.
