First, nine hours from now, the pause in the fighting begins. Shortly after that, we expect to see the hundreds of aid trucks beginning to enter Gaza for that desperately needed humanitarian assistance there.Then, nine hours after that pause in fighting begins, we'll begin to see the release of those 13 women and children, those first group of hostages. They'll go to the Red Cross from Hamas. They'll then be transferred into Israeli military custody and will then be brought out through two different border crossings into Israel straight to hospitals. Those younger than 12 will meet their families quickly. Those older than 12 will meet their families at the hospital. After that's confirmed, so after that part is done, a number of Palestinian prisoners, women and children, will be released from Israeli jails. At the same three-to-one ratio as the overall deal, so it'll be the release of 39 Palestinian women and children from Israeli prisons, they'll be released from two prisons in Israel. They'll be taken to a prison in the occupied West Bank and from there released to their families. You get a sense there of how many parts there are to this and how delicate this is. And that's why the first day and the second day are viewed as sort of a testing period for this to make sure this can work. Earlier today, the Qatari foreign ministry said they've tried to go through every possible scenario to troubleshoot anything that might go wrong here so this can keep moving forward as it's planned, but a lot of moving parts.",

      "sentences": "No doubt about it, Wolf. Just moments ago, an enormous barrage of - sounded like a bombardment, heavy bombardment of the Gaza Strip. It appeared to be coming from the same direction where we were hearing explosions last hour, which is in the direction of the Jabalya refugee camp. That is where we know that Israeli forces in recent days have been operating very, very heavily.They have told us in recent days that they have encircled that refugee camp and they say that Hamas militants are still inside there and they are ready to go. They are fighting them. And so moments ago, we just heard an enormous barrage of bombardments in that area. What is clear, Wolf, is that Israeli forces are going to continue to operate in the Gaza Strip up until that truce actually begins. And then after that truce begins, we're told that Israeli forces will not move past the truce line. That truce line, I'm told, is effectively the north-south divide in the Gaza Strip, where Israeli forces have told civilians to move south of that line. That will be the line that Israeli forces will not cross as this truce goes into effect at 7 in the morning local time and is expected to last, if everything goes according to plan, for at least four days. Now, one thing that is also clear is that Israeli forces are going to continue to fight after this pause is over. The Israeli prime minister as well as the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, both signaling very strongly that this war will continue until they reach their objectives to destroy Hamas, to get all of the hostages, all of the nearly 140 hostages back. And the defense minister, in fact, saying that the fighting will last for at least two months after this initial pause is over.",

And so it was interesting to hear the spokesman for the Qatari ministry of foreign affairs talking about the opportunity that this might present to try and establish some kind of a longer ceasefire. For Israeli officials, at least, that appears to be off of the table.But one thing that is on the table is the possibility for additional releases of hostages and additional days of pause beyond those first 50 and during those four days of pause in fighting. In fact, I spoke with Gal Hirsch the other day, the special coordinator for the Israeli prime minister for hostage affairs, who emphasized that this first 50 hostage release is simply phase one. Phase two could be those 10 hostages per day in exchange for an additional day of truce, as well as a three-to-one ratio of those Palestinian prisoners. But also, of course, Israeli officials making very clear that they are committed to the release, securing the release of all nearly 240 hostages, whether that is through negotiations or through military operations on the ground.",

We are told that they have detained him and taken him in for questioning by the Shin Bet security services.The Israeli officials say that they detained him because of the evidence that they have uncovered in recent days of a massive, sprawling tunnel system below Al-Shifa Hospital, only some of which we have actually seen evidence of in recent days. But the evidence that we have seen in recent days, Wolf, has been pretty compelling in terms of the extent of this tunnel system that appears to exist under Al- Shifa Hospital, including areas where there is an air-conditioned room in one spot, there is a bathroom in another, and meters of tunnels that Israeli forces have shown us in video so far. Now, this hospital director, we're told, Israeli officials effectively saying that, look, this tunnel system existed under his direction, and it appears, according to Israeli forces, that Hamas was using electricity and other resources from the hospital. And so Israeli officials say they want to question him about his knowledge and his potential cooperation with Hamas. Of course, Al-Shifa Hospital and health ministry officials inside of Gaza, they have denied that Hamas operated tunnels underneath Shifa and they have denied any knowledge of that.

For various reasons, we have not made this list public and I'm sure that you can understand why.We have informed the families of these hostages as well as the families of all hostages, nearly 240 families who have been going through this torture of mind and soul. And we are with them in this together. We're all feeling the pain. We're still living the October 7th moment in Israel and it is going to be a bittersweet moment for us. Because while some hostages, we hope, will come back, others, for this point, will be remained behind. You know that our government took a very difficult decision here and I know that you talked to some families. Not everyone are seeing this in the same way. We have various opinions in Israel, but this decision really reflects a very wide consensus among the Israeli public. We want to see our sons and daughters back, all of them, and we will continue to work tirelessly towards this goal and the goal of dismantling Hamas. But in the words of the great Thomas Sowell: there are no good solutions, only trade-offs. So this is the trade-off that we have agreed for.",

We need to make sure that we eradicate terrorism.If we want to have any kind of hope, for any kind of prospects for peace in the region and it's something that Arab partners in the region understand. It will also benefit their causes, because we need to send an unequivocal message against terrorism. First, pure evil, the pure evil called Hamas, that mutilated, raped and butchered our people on October 7th must be eradicated. It is true that it's not only a governance rule and a military wing, but that Hamas is also, in a sense, an ideology. And that a longer commitment, a difficult process to root out this ideology that they call for, that the state of Israel should be obliterated. They say in interviews, Hamas leaders, that they want to sacrifice the Palestinian people of Gaza to achieve this goal of the destruction of the Jewish state. We will not let them achieve either of these goals.

I spoke with one father whose 35-year-old son was kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th. He said he welcomes the release of any hostage, but does express feelings unsettled because of what it doesn't mean for his son and the others still in captivity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JONATHAN DEKEL-CHEN, SON TAKEN HOSTAGE BY HAMAS:   This news, honestly, for me, it's a - for all of us, it's a mixed bag because Sagui will, in all likelihood, not be released in this round. However, we - I expect that we know very well and are friends with many of those who will be released in this first batch. And so we couldn't be happier for those families that will be reunited over the course of the next few days with their little children and moms. Since the morning of October 7th, we and many other of the hostage families have heard absolutely nothing about or from our loved ones. I truly hope, I mean, it's kind of outrageous that the Red Cross wasn't able to visit with them until now, but it will be really important for all of us to know, all of the 240 or the 190 that will remain after this first stage to get proof of life, to know if our loved ones are healthy. So that is an important step, but only one step, of course, towards what is the goal for all of us, which is the release of all of the hostages. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
