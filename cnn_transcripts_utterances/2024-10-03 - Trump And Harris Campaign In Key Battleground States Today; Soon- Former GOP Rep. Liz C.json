We saw Caroline Rose Giuliani, the daughter of the former mayor of New York, very close Trump aide, endorsed Harris. Alyssa Farah Griffin of this network has done that. She worked for Mr. Trump. Now, Cassidy Hutchinson's in. This creates a permission structure. So it makes it okay. And here's the art in this. It's very hard to do. You have to do two things in the final 32, is you got to fire up your base and you've got to reach out to voters you don't already have. That doesn't take wedge issues. It takes web issues. So, the same things that fire up the Democratic base, talking about the commitment to our Constitution and democracy in January 6, talking even about abortion rights were Liz Cheney disagrees, but Kamala is never going to get off of that issue, talking about first-time homebuyers, small business -- these are all things that rally her base and reach out to swing voters. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is talking about neighbors eating each other's cats in Ohio. And that does -- that rallies his base, God knows why, but it doesn't get him any votes he doesn't already have.",

      "sentences": "Well, right now, it's a very close race. I think she's slightly favored, but because it is so close and because there's a real question about what will turn out look like -- I do think this is all an open question. Think about the way that the coalitions in our politics have changedover the last decade and a half, used to be that Republicans were the party that had the really reliable voters, country club Republicans who loved to turn out for Mitt Romney. And when Donald Trump came on the scene, he scrambled things a little bit. Suddenly, Republicans were bringing all of these, what we would call low propensity voters, people who don't turn out all the time, they're not watching cable news there. They're living their lives and maybe because they like Donald Trump, they'll participate and vote Republican. But the GOP also shed a lot of those voters, those country club Republicans, the types of folks that Paul wisely notes, this is intended to give them permission. The fight is not that these voters are trying to decide to vote for Donald Trump, or do I vote for Kamala Harris? They're trying to decide which leave it blank. Do I just wash my hands of all of this? And so while I don't think that it's likely that this is its going to cause a turnout surge for Kamala Harris. While I don't think it's likely that it's going to tip someone who's on the fence between Harris or Trump, because I don't think there are many of those particular voters left. She's really trying to make the case, I'm not the Kamala Harris of 2019. I'm not the person who is trying to pander to the progressive base. I'm really more palatable to Republicans than you think. And frankly, she's got an unlimited long leash from the progressive base in the Democratic Party to do these sorts of things without turning them off because she's running against Donald Trump and he is a number one motivator of voters on both sides of the aisle.",

Her radical leftist views, raising taxes, banning guns sales, taxpayer money for abortion, an illegal immigrant health care, eliminating private health insurance would be devastating for America.Do you think that Cheney still feels that way on policy?

We heard her come out for -- for impeaching Trump. She has said this is not about policy. I will do whatever it takes that Donald Trump is so dangerous, he should never be allowed to return to the White House. She also I think we should remember on the policy front, Liz Cheney sacrificed her political future. I'm not saying forever. But right now, they're really is no lane for her. So I think arguments about policy are just not what this is about. One point about Black male voters and what I would just say is, as we'd like to say, two things can be true at the same time, Vice President Harris needs to go out after a lot of people that certainly one place, but I think the fact that she is in Wisconsin where Hillary Clinton didn't get to that she's going to be in Pennsylvania, that Liz Cheney and others are going to Pennsylvania, they're just going after every single -- they're going to live in swing states.",

She is holding together coalition from AOC to Liz Cheney. That is hard to do. That's a broadest coalition I've seen in my lifetime and she's doing it. I think quite artfully. So nothing she's saying to gain Liz Cheney's support or those normie Republican she's trying to create a permission structure, none of that is alienating her base of African-Americans and Latinos and white liberals.

We will see if he does.But look, this could motivate Trump supporters could motivate his base on the left, it could motivate some others. The vast majority of voters are looking at this election through their lenses of their own lives, through pocketbook issues through concerns about potentially immigration or other matters, not about the former president's legal case. So I do not think this is going to be a driver of the election, but it certainly is a reminder and coming on the heels of Liz Cheney's endorsement and appearance in Wisconsin in the next hour. This is all tied together, so it is certainly an argument that bolsters the Harris campaign's really anthem of her candidacy about how a second President Trump administration would be dangerous for the country. But overall, voters, I don't think are going to be driven by this issue.",

This is her fifth visit to the state since she got into the race.What's interesting though, with this particular visit is where it's going to be. It's in Fond Du Lac County. This is not a Democratic stronghold. Donald Trump, actually, from 2016 to 2020 expanded his margin in this state, has expanded his vote share. But where she's giving this speech matters. In Ripon, it's a town in Fond Du Lac, known as the birthplace of the Republican Party. And it's all about margins here, yes, they need to run a big vote in Dane County. They need to run up big vote in Milwaukee County if you were the Harris campaign. But if you can keep margins down Trump strongholds like Fond Du Lac, that will help, too, given how close these states are going to be, disaffected Republicans may not be a huge population.
