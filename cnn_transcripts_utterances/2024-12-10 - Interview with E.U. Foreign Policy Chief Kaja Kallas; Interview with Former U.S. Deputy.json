Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And a new era begins in Syria as rebels appoint a caretaker prime minister for three months in order to oversee a transition of power. The reality of life without Assad is sinking in for the people there who are at once jubilant and heartbroken as the atrocities of the regime are brought to the surface now. Meanwhile, on the diplomatic level, Russia and Iran are trying to downplay the severity of this blow to them. Even as the U.S. and Israel take advantage of this moment to bombard targets inside Syria. We'll examine the global fallout and consequences in a moment, but first rumors flew in the first hours of the fall of secret prison cells locked by fleeing guards, depriving them of food, water, and even oxygen. Today, the Association of Detainees and the Missing say the notorious Sednaya Prison is now empty, with the White Helmet rescuers confirming, quote, \"no evidence\" of undiscovered secret cells or basements. But before that confirmation fueled by fear and desperation, thousands of relatives went there in search of those who had been condemned to Assad's dungeons. Here's Correspondent Clarissa Ward. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CLARISSA WARD, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  The roads are choked with cars full of people looking for loved ones.

So, they also create this theater of different wars in Africa, in the Middle East, in Ukraine, so that there is, you know, a flow of migrants into Europe. refugees from those regions towards Europe. So, this narrative meets the reality. And that is of course the problem because our adversaries also know that migration is a vulnerability. So, they are weaponizing this also against us. So, this is what we have to understand also about Europe. So, what do we do with this? I agree that, you know, we need to have legal roots for legal migration, and the rules have to be in place. But it's true that we need to work with the countries of origin that, you know, also take their people back.

And frankly, Europeans do with the exceptions of some countries like Poland. You know, I noted the high representative's comments about punitive isolationism. I think, let me put this to our European friends. And again, I don't speak for the president-elect, but I think this represents the kind of mindset that you see in America. I think we don't need lectures. I think we need action by Europeans. Europeans know what they need to do. They need to not just spend more on defense, but deliver more combat capability for NATO. And that's what President Trump has clearly said and take a much greater lead, including in military aid for Ukraine. And as the high representative acknowledged there that has not really happened. Germany, for instance, has cut below the level that the Bundeswehr was acting -- asking for. It's cut aid to Ukraine. France has cut aid to Ukraine. The U.K. is also in a parlous situation. So, I think, look, we can talk about all of this stuff till the cows come home, but the right course for Europe is really to step up, maybe move away from some of these green initiatives, move away from some of this over regulation on industry, build back up its own defense industry capability, move back towards conscription. I don't know, those are decisions for Europe. You know, liberalize the ability of Europe to issue bonds for greater defense spending. To me, those are all things that Europe should put on the table.

So, I don't think this is lecturing. I think this is a -- as President Trump rightly puts it, it's a dose of common-sense. And here's the thing, Christiane, I talk to Europeans all the time. They know what they need to do. How does it make sense for Germans to have spent between 1 and 2 percent of GDP on defense for decades and Americans to have spent a lot more? How does it make sense for the country that the current secretary general of NATO for a very wealthy country to have spent well below 2 percent?

Boris Pistorius, the minister of defense in Germany, has suggested Germany might need to go to 3.5 percent or above to restore the many years of neglect that countries like Germany have gone through. So, let's -- and there's a lot of accounting chicanery going on. Let's get real. What we need to see are results and not just accounting. On the issue of China, candidly, I think that's a bit of a triple bank shot argument. Let's ask, the American Navy has fewer ships now than the Chinese Navy. The Chinese are, even as we speak, mounting the largest exercises around Taiwan since 1996. There's no European military capability that can matter in the first island chain. This is not 1937. And American forces are overstretched, including because of the stout support that the United States has given to Ukraine. Really extraordinary levels of military support. So, we need to make tough choices. And I think President Trump has made clear that he doesn't want a war really anywhere, and I think that's absolutely right. But we need a peace through strength approach, especially with China. And that's going to require a senator -- Vice President-Elect Vance has pointed out, concentrating our scarce military power.

This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved. So, look, OK, fine, but so what do you think that actually means when we peel that apart? For instance, there's several hundred U.S. forces that are based there purely to fight and to make sure that ISIS doesn't raise its head again. And as you know, President Biden ordered B-52s, F -- you know, fighter jets, et cetera, to bombard ISIS positions as the Assad regime was crumbling. So, let's just take that little bit.

So, that's very important. It sounds kind of common-sense, but common-sense has been exceptionally uncommon over the last generation, and we've managed to fritter away our enormous military advantages and the support of the American people, especially those who've served in uniform, as I think Pete Hegseth has really spoken for them in a very eloquent way, as well as JD Vance and others, really eroded the willingness of the American people for these kinds of conflicts. And so, I think basically saying, hey, we're not going to get involved here is a really important starting point. That's the baseline. I always like to point out, I mean, Christiane, during the Cold War, Syria was basically always in the Soviet sphere and yet, we won the Cold War. It's not something that is strategically vital for us, and we really have to husband our resources. On the issue of what U.S. forces in Syria is going to happen. I mean, I certainly supported President Trump when he was attempting to pull them out last time. I think we're going to have to see. That's his decision. I think there's a sort of bizarro element to our posture in the Middle East, where we're bombing multiple groups and possibly supporting, according to reporting, multiple groups on varying sides. I think the better course here is to, as President Trump said, to stay out of it directly, to empower and back our allies like Israel that are taking matters more to their own hands, and some kind of equilibrium will hopefully arise, and then, of course, keeping a weather eye on the possibility for transnational jihadis to emerge from that, that's really a core, of course, American interest coming out of that area.",

I don't want to get ahead of the president's decision making given the current situation, but I think the idea of keeping sort of perpetual lily pads that often become sort of hostages to Iran or its proxies over the -- I mean, some of our servicemen and women have been killed and wounded in the last kind of year or so because they're kind of just sitting out there without a real overriding purpose. I think there's certainly a strong argument for consolidating our position. And overall, Christiane, I think the point here is that we need to be much more disciplined and strategic. And I think President Trump is very different than Obama or George W. Bush or Joe Biden. I think, candidly, these people were essentially hostage. I mean, Joe Biden said his favorite show, with all respect, was \"Morning Joe\" and he read Tom Friedman every day. These were representatives of the conventional wisdom. President Trump has already decided, I am running against the conventional wisdom. He's taken lawfare, all the kind of flack they can throw at him, and he's been elected decisively on an agenda to put Americans first and to make changes that are uncomfortable to the established way of doing things. But the way -- the thing I always stress is, how successful has the established way of doing things been over the last 25 years? I would say it's been an utter failure. And so, we need a much more common-sense America first approach that rationalizes -- in a sense like a business that rationalizes our commitments with what, you know, we have available. And by the way, that we can work with a lot of countries that are willing and able to do more. And that gets back to the high representative's comments. Look, I think it's all fine and dandy to have highfalutin language, but we need to see real combat capability. When you look at a country like Israel, when you look at a country like India, like South Korea, you say these air countries that take care of their own security that field serious forces. The Germans are -- have -- just a few years ago, were training with broomsticks. So, when I hear the foreign minister of that country me giving us lectures, I take it less seriously than when I hear from the external affairs minister of India, or the prime minister of Israel, for instance.",

It's usually handled confidentially and discreetly, and it's all about the Senate examining the character and the fitness of nominees and making sure they're the type of people who can be trusted with the immense power that some of these offices offer their incumbents. And the -- one of the questions you're asking and a question that the Senate should be asking now of nominees is not just whether they agree with their politics, but whether they are the type of men and women who will be faithful to their oath of office, put the law and the constitution above their own whims or the whims of any political leader.",

Important and concerned that the president-elect and that some Republican senators, and I should say just some, I think most Republican senators have been very clear that the normal process is what should be followed here. But so, there's been this talk about sidestepping the FBI and the background investigation and also musing from the president about using things like the recess appointment power to sidestep confirmation entirely. And the confirmation process is just a critical check and balance in our constitutional system, and it should not be minimized or pushed aside lightly.

We did it in a cooperative way. And we got the senators the information they needed. So, there's a lot of history and precedent that says this process works. That's the first part. Second part is that with a private company, we have no way of knowing that they're going to be consistent. that they're going to be thorough, that they're going to be objective, particularly if they're hired by the president's team, rather than being people who have worked for the federal government for years and years. With the FBI -- not that the FBI is perfect in every way, but this -- with this process, you know that you're getting experienced people giving an objective look, getting senators they need so that -- the information that they need so that they can decide about people taking important positions that matter a lot to Americans. With a private company, you don't know what you're going to get and we don't necessarily have a lot of reason to trust that who the president-elect brings in is going to give the type of searching analysis and investigation that is needed.",

So, I understand that a reformist president who has objections to how the current government and federal investigatory bodies have functioned. Even if those are well placed, I really don't think there's a lot to fear here. Again, it's a very discreet confidential process and there's no judgment being placed in the hands of the FBI or career government employees.

You can have people who aredistinguished professionals who deserve a position based on the career that got them very wealthy, but there are certainly potential concerns that come up. One is the potential for conflicts of interest, is that the potential for officials to be asked to make decisions on questions that specifically affect their wealth, maybe affect companies that they own or that they work for, or that they invest in. And so, you know, that's the first piece, is to really determine what somebody's financial interests are. So, you can see whether there might be conflicts. A lot of those conflicts could be addressed by divesting or recusing. So, it doesn't necessarily mean that somebody's not fit to be in office, it just may inform the kinds of questions that a Senate -- senator asks and the kinds of assurances they seek. The other thing that comes with tremendous wealth is a question of whether, you know, cabinet figures filled with very wealthy people is going to be looking out for the interests of regular Americans who aren't tremendously wealthy, rather than serving essentially in the interest of millionaires and billionaires. That's not really a background investigation question, that's a question for the Senate and the American people to consider, you know, in terms of what kind of government they want. But so really, you know, in terms of the investigation, it's making sure that the Senate has the information it needs to get assurances that people will take the steps they need to make decisions on behalf of the American people rather than their own bottom line.",

I do think that the many thousands of experienced professionals in a place like the FBI and throughout government are going to continue trying their best to do their jobs in a professional and objective way. As Gregg said the FBI is not a perfect institution. The federal government sure as heck is not perfect. There are things that could be done better.
