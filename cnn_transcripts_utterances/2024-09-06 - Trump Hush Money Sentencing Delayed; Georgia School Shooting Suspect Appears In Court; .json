      "sentences": "A very warm welcome to the show, everyone, I'm Isa Soares. Tonight, a legal victory for Donald Trump. Theformer President's sentencing in the hush money case delayed until after November's election. We will have the details on Trump's complex legal web. Plus, the 14-year-old charged in a deadly school shooting in Georgia appears before a judge minutes after he walked out of the courtroom, his father faces an arraignment. We have details for you in a live report. And the U.S. is said to pledge another $250 million in security aid for Ukraine. As President Zelenskyy urges international allies to speed up delivery of promised air defenses. Tonight, we'll speak to Poland's Foreign Minister. We begin though with breaking news. The judge in Donald Trump's hush money case says he will delay sentencing for the former President until after the 2024 election. Just in the last hour, we learned Judge Juan Merchan has decided to schedule the sentencing for November 26th, saying he wanted to avoid the appearance that it could influence the election. A Trump campaign spokesman says the case should be dismissed. And the ruling comes on what has been a truly busy legal day for Trump. He and his attorneys were in a New York court to appeal a civil jury's $5 million verdict that he sexually abused and defamed writer E. Jean Carroll. Our senior crime and justice reporter Katelyn Polantz has been tracking all these stories for us today, and it has been a very busy day. Katelyn, good to see you. So, just explain and delve a bit deeper here for us, Katelyn, on the reason that was given by the judge to move the sentencing to after the U.S elections, that turmoil perhaps that he faced. KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER:  Yes, Isa, he lays this out, Judge Juan Merchan in a four-page letter where he announces that instead of sentencing Donald Trump as a criminal defendant convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money payments to Stormy Daniels that he made. He's convicted by a jury in state court in New York. Instead of doing that 41 days before the election on September 18, he's going to do it in what will be the lame duck of Joe Biden's presidency. November 26th, a time where Donald Trump will either be the next President-elect or will be just another man who once served as the President, and who will remain a criminal defendant facing sentencing before this judge. Now, Judge Merchan is clearly grappling with a lot here. The sentencing has moved several times. It was initially scheduled for July after his conviction by the jury on those 34 criminal charges. And Judge Merchan says he's trying to protect the integrity of the jury. He writes that the public's confidence in the integrity of our judicial system demands a sentencing hearing that is entirely focused on the verdict of the jury and the weighing of aggregating and mitigating factors free from distraction or distortion. He goes on to write that he doesn't want to advantage or disadvantage any political party, and he wants people to realize that he is serving justice and keep holding sacred the verdict of that jury, and that all factored into him moving the sentencing date for Donald Trump to November 26th in the state of New York --",

Jean Carroll in the 1990s. And then in 2022, 30 years later, making defamatory statements about her saying that she was lying about that sexual assault, sexual abuse. The jury had awarded him $5 million of damages, so, his attorneys appealed it and today, was the argument where they got to argue and E. Jean Carroll's attorney got to argue whether the trial was appropriate, whether there was information the jury heard that they should have heard or should not have heard. One of the things Donald Trump opposed in that trial was the jury hearing the Access Hollywood tape, where he spoke about women and saying you could do anything if you're a celebrity. That was something that his attorneys say the jury  should have been able to hear, E. Jean Carroll's attorneys said, no, they should have heard because it's a part of the pattern of this man. And that is relevant. So, that was the argument today. No decision from that court. Donald Trump after the hearing was unable to help himself, apparently. He continued to say very much very similar things to what he said about E. Jean Carroll previously. Here's what he said at a press conference after leaving the court this morning. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:  We had a trial today, it's an appeal of a ridiculous verdict of a woman I have never met, I don't know, I have no idea who she is. She wrote a book and she made a ridiculous story up, she put it in her book, and we're now appealing the decision. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He keeps doubling down, tripling down, quadrupling down, saying that E. Jean Carroll, he never met her, he doesn't know her, she made up this story to sell books. He said it again today. Her attorney responded that all options are on the table, though, he's just appealing these suits that juries have said he's liable for the damages for, there haven't been new suits from E. Jean Carroll since those monster verdicts.",

As I told you the top of the hour in the last 40 minutes or so, we saw today Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyin Ramstein Air Base in Germany where he's really asking countries, allies for more defense -- more air defenses and for it to arrive much faster, something we've heard from him time and time again. Let's discuss this further. William Taylor joins me now. He is the vice president for Europe and Russia at the U.S. Institute of Peace, as well as a former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine. Ambassador, great to see you. Welcome back to the show. Let me just pick up with what I was just mentioned there. We have heard on numerous occasions I think it's fair to say, including today in Ramstein President Zelenskyy urging Western allies to use long- range weapons for strikes on Russian territory, asking the U.S. to ignore Moscow's red lines. Secretary Lloyd Austin from what we heard today, Ambassador, has been resisting calls for the use of these long-range capability. What is your view? Should U.S. allow their weapons to strike deeper into Russia? WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER U.S. AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: I think they should, Isa. I think they definitely should. The Russians are firing at the Ukrainians from these bases inside Russia, so the Ukrainians ought to be able to fire back. If they can, if they are allowed to, then they'll be able to push the Russians back even farther. But as you know, the Ukrainians have moved into Russian territory in order to push the Russians back. And they're requesting the ability to use the weapons that we've given them and others have given them to push -- to fire at the Russians who are firing at them.",

The Russians haven't even really pushed them back. They've begun to send some troops in to try to slow the Ukrainians down but they haven't stopped any of their fighting in the -- in the Donbas. So, there's no real red line here to be worried about, Isa. On the conventional side, the Russians are at the max, so there's no further escalation that they can do conventionally.",

Last week, President Biden changed the terms, changed the terms that he uses to demonstrate -- to illustrate and designate the goal. And he said the goal now is to support the Ukrainians until they prevail. He used to say as long as it takes, but now he says until they prevail. That means until they win.

After 12weeks in space, the spacecraft will undock from the International Space Station and perform a fully autonomous six-hour-long maneuver before landing in New Mexico. It will be guided by flight controllers from the Boeing Mission Control Center in Florida and the Starliner Mission Control in Houston in Texas. If the spacecraft experiences a mishap or NASA ultimately decides not to certify it for human space flight, repeating the test could cost the company millions of dollars on top of the roughly 1.5 billion that Boeing has already lost on the Starliner program. So you see what is that stake here. Let's bring in veteran NASA astronaut and Air Force Colonel Terry Virts. Colonel, welcome to the show. Just talk us through the plan as you understand it for the Starliner's return and what you make of it. COL. TERRY VIRTS (RET), FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT: Well, Boeing has already done this twice. They flew two unmanned test missions in the past few years, so it will undock -- it's on the front part of the Space Station. It'll undock. It'll fly a quarter way around the space station, and then do a quick backway maneuver. They'll do some testing of the jets. The jet, these small rocket engines, small rocket jets that have been giving them so many problems. And then a few hours later, they'll do a deorbit burn. It turns around backwards and fires the engine, slows down, and that brings it back down to earth about 30 minutes later. It's going to land in the New Mexico desert. Hopefully, they'll nail the landing just like they did the last two times.",
