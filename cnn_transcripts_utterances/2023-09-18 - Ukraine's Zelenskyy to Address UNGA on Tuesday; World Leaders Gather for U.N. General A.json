U.S. officials telling CNN the five U.S. citizens held in Iran for years are now on their way to Doha and to freedom.But first we begin in New York, where world leaders are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, will address the assembly, the U.N. Security Council and meet with U.S. President Joe Biden as well. And advisor told CNN he'll explain why the war needs a fair end. He also expected to say helping Ukraine is an investment in stability, and the more weapons will accelerate the war. CNN U.N. Senior U.N. Correspondent, Richard Roth joins me now from the United Nations. I mean, he always brings a bit of star power as well. But there's absolute substance to Zelenskyy's visit. RICHARD ROTH, CNN SENIOR U.N. CORRESPONDENT: That's right, he appeared on a video. Last time he was not here at the U.N. It's his first visit and he will also then go to Washington to talk to members of Congress and President Biden. It's really the hot story. There has been some concern about U.N. people that it will overshadow anything. I mean, there's a big conference on brace yourself Sustainable Development Goals that many of the world leaders will speak at, but their formal speech will be on Tuesday. Zelenskyy wants to keep the momentum if he has it regarding getting new weapons, and anything that can combat Russia. Of course, it's a preposterous situation here Max, which is really Donald enthusiasm. You have a permanent member of the Security Council Russia, which has invaded its neighbor.",

If you think about it, every major weapons system that we've provided, we originally said no, and delayed and then eventually changed our mind and said yes, and provided it.That was true of the stinger missiles. It was true of the HIMARS, it was true of armored vehicles, tanks, F-16, which are still not delivered yet. And there are still systems that we continue to hold back on, such as the eight tackles. It's a very long range artillery system, which would be very useful for Ukraine, striking Russian forces that are occupying the country in areas where they cannot reach them right now. So we could be doing more, and we should be doing it more quickly. What Ukraine needs is to separate the Russian forces, you have the occupation forces in Crimea and Southern Ukraine, and they are connected by a land line of communication across Southern Ukraine. And if Ukraine can break through that will effectively isolate those Russian forces and make their presence there unsustainable. That would be a tremendous breakthrough for Ukraine, which is achievable.",

It is an Iran that is dominating in Lebanon, a threat to Israel. It is a real rogue state, if you will. And to give them the $6 billion is a very, very high price.

Are you surprised that they actually reached the deal?NEGAR MORTAZAVI, IRANIAN-AMERICAN JOURNALIST: Thanks for having me. Actually, quick question, I'm an Analyst, not an Activist. But I'm not surprised, as Becky also said this had been in the making, but it's a rare deal. It's one of those moments that, doesn't happen often. It took very long and complex negotiations. The entire deal is very complex. It's carefully choreographed for two longtime foes who weren't even sitting in the same room negotiating for this deal. The negotiation happened with essentially with shuttle diplomacy with the batteries going back and forth between hotels, where Americans and Iranians were staying. So it was long, it was complex. That's my, actually both sides were hesitant as far as giving out details or acknowledging what's happening, but it seems like it's finally happening. Then nightmare as Becky said is over. The prisoners are in the sky. I'm also hearing from the Iranian side. Iranian media are reporting that the Iranian prisoners on the U.S. side have also been released, and some have arrived in Doha.

One of the things that happen is that the negotiations happen behind closed doors and back channels, mostly secret because of the sensitivity of the issue. And essentially, the point does not want things to fall through.Also, families are hesitant in publicizing the case of their loved ones, for conflicting reasons. Sometimes families feel like giving more press will actually put pressure and help your loved one get out. Sometimes they feel like keeping it quiet would help the diplomacy and negotiation. So my understanding this is again, my reading and analysis is that in the case of these two other ones, that families mostly felt like not giving it too much press attention, would increase the chance of their loved ones being released. So that's why we only know of the three others who have been held essentially build on this with Siamak Namazi since 2016.",

So a big moment in international diplomacy, a huge moment for these people individually many questions though, about that deal, and that'll all be thrashed out in the hours and days ahead amongst politicians and analysts.

And there are buildings that were abandoned by the owners some years ago and people are living there not paying rent. So the city is saying some of these issues are caused because of groups like Siyabonga is that they say are stopping people from being evicted. But their organization says that the Constitution of South Africa guarantees free housing and if people are kicked out, they need somewhere else to live and it needs to be provided by the state.
