As the Biden administration begins deporting Venezuelan migrants all the way back to their home country. Here's what else is moving today. Another Ukrainian child has died in a new Russian strike on civilians. The Nobel Committee honors and imprisoned Iranian activist back here in Qatar. I hear how last month Iran prisoner release unfolded from an insider. Plus, Max Verstappen could clinch his next F1 title this weekend, right here in Doha. And we are also following the action on financial markets, U.S. stock sector for sharply when the opening bell sounds on Wall Streets, just about a half hour from now after the release of an extremely strong U.S. jobs report. 335,000 jobs added to the economy last month, twice as many jobs had been expected. Good news for workers of course, but a worrisome report for investors concerned about inflation, and rising interest rates more on all of that later this hour. First up though, we begin in Ukraine a 10 year old boy and his grandmother are dead after a new Russian strike in Eastern Ukraine. Missiles leaving a gaping hole where an apartment building once stood, it happened in Kharkiv region not far from Thursday's horrific attack. Authorities now say that strike which was unfolding as we came on air, yesterday killed 52 people they had gathered in a cafe to mourn a fallen soldier. Nearly a third of that village was wiped out in an instant. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is in that village for us. And Fred, what is the scene there today?",

As you can see, there's pretty much only the foundations left of it. And as you can see also, Becky, a lot of the debris that was here has already been clear. That's why it became very certain to the authorities here who were working here pretty early on that they weren't going to find any survivors anymore underneath the rubble. So this quickly turned from a search and rescue operation into a recovery operation and now a clearing operation. As you can see, one interesting fact that I want to point out, Becky, is that new attack that you were talking about the one in Kharkiv apparently involved the same type of missile that Ukrainians say that was also used on this building as well. It's called an Iskander missile. And it is very popular. As you can see, folks, though, coming out here, laying flowers over here, obviously, as you've noted, this entire village is extremely devastated. As large portions of this village, quite frankly, were wiped out. That's a makeshift memorial that's been set up there. A lot of candles and we have seen throughout the day, extreme a large amount of villagers come out here pay their respects, many of them, of course, bursting into tears. It was interesting, because earlier today, I was speaking to one gentleman who witnessed the attack and he was simply recounting the people who had died here. And he said pretty much from every family here in this village, somebody was killed in that strike. You mentioned that currently, the death toll stands at 52. But of course the forensic work is still very much going on a devastating strike here on this village, which of course happened during a funeral wake for a soldier. Nevertheless, the authorities here telling us that the people who were killed pretty much all of them were civilians, Becky.",

This is also recognizing the men and women of Iran those who have been rising up over the past year demanding their most basic of human rights following the death of Mahsa Amini of course in their woman life, freedom movement. Becky, we had a very rare opportunity recently to indirectly interview Narges Mohammadi, who is in Evin Prison, we were able to send her questions through intermediaries and got her responses. And here's her report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KARADSHEH (voice-over): Not even the darkest cells of the notorious Evin Prison have silenced this fearless fighter for freedom. Narges Mohammadi named this become synonymous with the battle for human rights in Iran. Her life has been a cycle of arrest and re arrest. Now serving a 10 year prison term and sentenced to 154 lashes. Not only has the regime taken away her freedom, the last time she held her twins Ali and Kiana was eight years ago. They were only eight a sacrifice so painful, but like without liberty and equality she says is not worth living. For her activism Mohammadi has been accused of actions against national security and propaganda against the state. And she's now facing more charges as she continues to defiantly speak out from behind bars. In an exclusive recording from inside Evin, Mohammadi reads excerpts of a letter she sent CNN.",

KARADSHEH (voice-over): She writes in prison, I have heard the narratives of three protesting women who were sexually assaulted. One of them was a well-known activist of the student movement, who upon entering the prison filed a complaint with the authorities and announced that after being arrested on the street, her one hand and one leg were cuffed and tied. And in that position, she was sexually assaulted. I went with one of my cellmates under the pretext of taking food for a prisoner. We saw bruises on her stomach, thighs, arms and legs. The Iranian regime has denied allegations including a CNN investigation of using sexual violence and rape to suppress the protests, calling them baseless and false. For years Mohammadi has been the voice of the voiceless, fighting for political prisoners against the death penalty and solitary confinement. Something she and her husband Taghi Rahmani have both endured. Rahmani a Former Political Prisoner who was jailed for 14 years now lives in exile with the children in Paris.

I said goodbye I got into the car and went to school when I got back my mom wasn't there anymore. KARADSHEH (voice-over): Ali says he's proud of his mom and his accepted this life. He says it's for freedom for Iran. Rahmani shows off all the awards his wife has won while in prison. She's an endless energy for freedom. He tells us an unstoppable force, her fight extending deep inside Evin where she leads women who continue to protest. Their chance of woman life freedom captured in this recording shared with CNN.

So we don't actually know if she has received the news.

This week U.S. officials met with their Mexican counterparts in Mexico City, and leaders from Panama and Costa Rica holding bilateral meetings today about the crisis that they face. Let's get you to the White House and Reporter Priscilla Alvarez. She joins us from Washington D.C. and Journalist Stefano Pozzebon joins us from Bogota in Colombia.

Essentially what it boils down to is thatfor years, the U.S. has not been able to carry regular deportation flights to Venezuela. And that is exactly the population of people they're seeing the most of at the U.S. southern border. Well, senior administration officials say that changes this week. Now, the U.S. will begin again, deporting Venezuelans directly back to the country. Now, this matters again because Venezuelans are making up a larger share of border crossers, in fact, just in the month of August, there were more than 30,000 Venezuelans that were encountered at the U.S. Mexico border, and that number has gone up since then. And of course, this is because there is mass movement across the western hemisphere, more than 7 million Venezuelans have fled that country, many of them making their way north. And that has been a reality that this White House has had to contend with. And it is making it -- made it increasingly difficult because there are really only options for logistical purposes was detaining or deporting them. They were unable to really -- as well as therefore they were releasing them in the U.S. as they went through their immigration proceedings. And that put increasing stress on cities, including some of the President's allies who have begun to publicly criticize them. Now this week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with their Mexican counterparts in Mexico and they talked about migration. This is a country they lean on, often to try to stem the flow. And now they're hoping that by making this decision by being able to directly deport them as well as that they'll be able to drive down those numbers. But of course, the outstanding question is how many flights can they actually carry out? And would that even make a dent in what they're seeing along the U.S. southern border, Becky?",

In Caracas,inflation remains very high, it's no longer in hyperinflation as it used to be just before COVID-19 and the pandemic, but still, we're talking about inflation of over 400 percent every year, which means that Caracas has effectively become one of the most expensive cities in South America. And then on top of that tragic humanitarian situation, you have the social and political stalemate and the situation is just as dire with a government of Nicolas Maduro who by the way, Nicolas Maduro is wanted in the United States for drug related -- drug trafficking related charges by the Department of Justice. But his government is not giving any sign of leniency is not given any sign of negotiations or any sign that they would accept democratic election anytime soon. We are in electoral season right now in Venezuela because the opposition is selected in a primary election some candidates to challenge Maduro in a presidential -- eventual presidential election next year. But out of the three leading opposition leaders are all barred from running in for office, because they face charge by the Attorney General nominated by Maduro. When we talk about reaction from Venezuela that didn't need -- we didn't need to wait too long to get it yesterday night that the Venezuelan Attorney General presented charges and an arrest mandate against the Former National Assembly President Juan Guaido. You might remember him he was the leader of the parliament, who swore himself in into power as the legitimate President of Venezuela. And that the U.S. has recognized back then in 2019, as the legitimate Head of State in Venezuela. Well, Guaido is now living out of the country. He lives on asylum in Miami and the Venezuelans are looking for him. Another aspect of the reaction well, if you have deportations directly from U.S. soil to Venezuela, you probably going to need direct flights and having direct flights from Caracas to the United States has been a demand for Maduro for quite some time. Venezuelans Airlines are currently barred from entering the U.S. skies due to sanctions, in particular, just not Maduro himself. But also most of companies that are controlled by the state are under sanctions in the U.S. So you see how this change of policy from the White House doesn't really solve the problem on the ground, which in Venezuela remains very, very seriously, Becky.",

And this is after the release of what was a highly important what can only be described as blockbuster U.S. jobs report. The U.S. economy added 336,000 new jobs last month, more than twice the number. Expected job numbers for July and August were revised much higher too. Now all of this suggests that the U.S. economic expansion does remain firmly on track. And of course, that is good news for the bond markets because of its inflationary implications. The yield on the benchmark U.S. ten-year treasury is trading well above 4.8 percent right now a resumption of the historic rise in yields that we saw earlier this week. Well, that's the story as far as bond markets, of course, are concerned. But all of this will lead to higher borrowing costs for American consumers for businesses and the federal government. And that is where the kind of -- comes in here. Matt Egan is in New York to help break this all down for us.

But not only that, this is 80,000 jobs more than the most optimistic forecasts had been penciling it. That is pretty incredible. And this is acceleration from August, which by the way, was also revised higher. If you look at the chart, you can see that in some ways, this jobs market apparently is actually heating up at a time when a lot of people thought it was cooling down. And so from the perspective of these fears of an imminent or ongoing recession, you know, clearly, that is not something that's happening right now. There's nothing about these numbers that speak to an imminent recession. But of course, the other big concern out there is inflation and the Fed's war on inflation. And so if your big fear is that the Fed is going to end up overdoing it or that the bond market is going to tighten things for the Fed and overdo it. Those fears are still very much alive because of today's number. A lot of people were hoping for Goldilocks, not too hot, not too cold, we ended up getting something that was much closer to too hot. And that is why we've seen a negative reaction in the stock market with U.S. stocks opening I would say modestly lower.

When we talk about inflation the good news this week is that we've seen a slowdown a slip in the price of oil we had been looking you know only a week ago at the possibility that 100 bucks on the barrel down closer to the sort of 80 bucks on the barrel level at this point.

And I'm glad you brought up the hedge funds in all of this, because, you know, when you talkto the stakeholders in the oil and gas industry, the Energy Ministers OPEC Secretary General, I spoke to earlier on this week. You know, they talk about the influence that the hedge funds have on these markets. And they worry about it. They look at the fundamentals. They do what they can, as far as the sort of fundamental picture is concerned. And this -- there are some clear concerns about where China's growth is going at present? There is not as much in that market, as people had anticipated coming out of COVID. And so the China story, I think, is a slightly worrying one for these key stakeholders in the oil supply market. But what really irritates -- when you hear this time and again, from OPEC Energy Ministers is the activity of the hedge fund players who have effectively sort of, you know, push this elastic as far as it will go in trying to get the oil price to 100 bucks on the barrel. And it seems as if there's no elastic left in that string at this point, or no string left in that elastic, and the price is coming low. It is absolutely fascinating.

And we talked about what went on behind the scenes. And I asked him whether at any point he believed that this exchange wouldn't happen? Whether there was any point at which he believed he wouldn't be able to get this over the line? Have a listen to what he told me earlier.
