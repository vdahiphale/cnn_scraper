      "sentences": "All right. So, who is Carlos De Oliveira, the man who just made his first appearance in court in the classified documents case? Let's lay it out. He has now been indicted on four criminal charges alongside his boss Donald Trump as well as the president's former aide -- or the former president's aide Walt Nauta.Friends and family said Oliveira -- De Oliveira came to the U.S. from Portugal to seek a better life. He started as a valet at Mar-a-Lago. Later became the property manager. But unlike Walt Wauta, he is not someone who is well-known inside Trump's inner circle. One former Trump aide who has frequented Mar-a-Lago told CNN \"I've never heard of that person.\" Here is what he is accused of specifically, a number of things. The superseding indictment says De Oliveira allegedly helped Trump and Nauta try to delete security footage. Remember, prosecutors claimed that he twice told a Mar-a-Lago it worker that the boss wanted the server deleted in a conversation that he said must remain private, probably because the security footage allegedly shows De Oliveira and Nauta moving boxes of classified documents to hide them from authorities. There's also this if you can believe it. De Oliveira was accused of draining a pool in order to flood the server room that stores that footage. Perhaps, in an effort to damage it. Last, but not least, he's also accused of lying to the FBI. According to the indictment, Trump called De Oliveira last August to say that he, Trump, would pay for his attorney fees on that same day authorities said Nauta had a conversation with a different Trump employee who assured Nauta that De Oliveira was loyal to Trump. It's a frequent question we hear asked by Trump about his employees, particularly his legal troubles mount, are they loyal? Brianna?",

What's interesting is there's already a senior judge that's been assigned to hear the case or hear this issue because the Fulton superior court judges had all been recused.

Otherwise, this superseding indictment wouldn't have been necessary that they could have just moved forward as the -- as they had the case. And so apparently, this other employee will corroborate some things or at least make some statements.

Now, we've heard about something about the boss said this, the boss said that you know, isn't going to be -- is Nauta go say he's the boss or that he was acting as the boss or that he thought the boss might want it so he said it or who knows where it's going to go?
