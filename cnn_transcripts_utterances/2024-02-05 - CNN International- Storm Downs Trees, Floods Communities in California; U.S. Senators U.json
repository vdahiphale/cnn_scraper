And at least one regional airport says it's shut down because its airfield is flooded. This was a scene on Sunday in central California. As water levels continue to rise at this creek in the city of Santa Barbara. California's governor has declared a state of emergency in nearly 15 percent of its counties. Here's what else we know right now. Evacuation orders are in place for several counties across the state. We've learned the number of people still without power has dropped to more than 700,000. Hundreds of flights have already been displayed -- or delayed or canceled and 40 million people under flood watches, which are still in effect. CNN's Amy Kiley has the details on the storm.

The measure could be dramatically changed -- or it could change dramatically U.S. immigration law for the first time in decades, really. Here's a look at some of the key points. The one hundred $118 billion bipartisan package would empower the U.S. to significantly restrict illegal migrant crossings at the southern border. It also raises the standard of proof to pass an initial asylum screening while shortening asylum processing from years to months. It preserves the president's authority to designate humanitarian parole on a case-by-case basis and authorizes an additional 250,000 immigrant visas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), U.S. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: This bill is vital, vital to America's future interests. Ukraine would be run over by -- if we don't get aid in this bill.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on his way to the Middle East, where tensions are high after U.S. strikes in the region. This will be Blinken's fifth visit there since the October 7th Hamas attacks in Israel. Meanwhile, two U.S. defense officials tell CNN that the airstrikes in Syria and Iraq destroyed or damaged 84 of its 85 targets. And a preliminary battle damage assessment indicates no Iranians were killed. U.S. Central Command released this video of the weekend's U.S. strikes in Yemen. The U.S. strikes and the Israel-Hamas war are expected to be the big topics under discussion during Blinken's visit to the Middle East. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv with more on the trip.

One is to try to ensure that what is already a very hot war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the slightly less warmer wars that are going on across the region, particularly on the border between Israel and Lebanon, that they don't spiral into hotter wars as well.And, in fact, just over the weekend, Israel is saying that it's hit more than 3,400 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon and more than 50 Hezbollah targets in Syria, as it says it tries to disrupt the flow of arms to Iran's proxies over there. So that's still bubbling away. In fact, just this morning, seeing video from the IDF showing them taking out Hezbollah observation posts, they said. The other three main objectives are all related to the hostages. Now, we were talking last week about that framework agreement between Israel and Hamas, that there would be a couple of phases with a six- week pause, starting with Israeli hostages, released for about three times the number of Palestinian prisoners, and then other phases with the IDF soldiers released and also bodies that Hamas either took into the Gaza Strip or from people that it killed inside the Gaza Strip. And the other issues are related to those because Blinken also wants to try to facilitate a humanitarian pause or some kind of ceasefire and also get more humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip. But those are generally predicated on whether a hostage deal can be done. And we know that all parties are still trying to get that across the line. But we also hear from Hamas. It seems that they are insisting that there will be no hostage deal unless Israel not only ceases fire, but also withdraws from the Gaza Strip entirely. And we've got Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying that there will not be a deal done at any cost and Israel won't release thousands of terrorists. So that actually seems to be at a bit of an impasse right now. And, you know, it's possible that Secretary Blinken, after what, his fifth trip, when he goes back to the United States, he may go back empty handed.",

And he's been losing a lot of support among that constituency because of the U.S. support for Israel in its war against Hamas.And, of course, we saw those sanctions on four settlers last week, which perhaps was seen in some quarters to be a bit of a try to regain some of that support among Arab-Americans. But certainly, as long as -- the longer this war goes on and certainly if it escalates, then that could spell more trouble for President Biden as he seeks re- election.",
