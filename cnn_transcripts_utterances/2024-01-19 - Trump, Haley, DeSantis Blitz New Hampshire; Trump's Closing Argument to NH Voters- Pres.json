First, I have to make this point, because it's been bothering me for several days. Democrats are not allowed to vote in the New Hampshire primary. Donald Trump keeps saying that. That's not actually how it works. You can change your registration a month beforehand. It actually had to be in October. Independents can vote. Democrats cannot vote. However, to Eva's point, it is a more moderate electorate. There's no question about that. There's more independents. There's no question about that. At least in Iowa, certainly in South Carolina.

You know, or either you vote for me or the Democrats are going to steamroll us in November. Rather than say anything like that, she continues to do this little dance. And so she doesn't want to set expectations too high, because she's got a very unusual and sort of low odds path to victory. She's got to win New Hampshire. She doesn't want to come out and say it, but that's really what all of the political odds makers will tell you. Is that she's got to win it, and that will change the race fundamentally. If she can't win it, outright, she's got to come very, very close and come out of there with something like a moral victory. And from what she's been doing, all the resources that they poured into the state, the messaging that she's been doing. That is actually what her strategy is. She didn't want to come out and say it.

A president -- in his case, he is talking about himself -- should be able to, must be able to legally do, with legal impunity, do whatever it is he or she wants.The word salad that we got from Nikki Haley, it ended where it should have begun. No one is above the law is the principle with which you have to start this kind of a conversation if you're serious about democracy. Not, you know, sort of trying to do what she's trying to do. And I understand she's trying to win an election, so she -- she kind of wanders around it, talks about it. And chaos seems to follow him, like you know, mysteriously; like some stray dog, it seems to follow Donald Trump. And she's going to pardon him for whatever crime he might have committed, even though she doesn't know what it might be. All of that stuff undermines the really -- the core argument and takes us away from what other candidates have tried to do, which is sound a sense of alarm. You cannot have a major party candidate saying, at the top of his lungs, trying to influence a specific Supreme Court decision, but also trying to influence all the rest of us, to say that the president can do whatever they want.",

That your path through salvation, if you will, as a voter is through me. That is a really, really stark sort of view of democracy from his point of view. And for Nikki Haley, who's trying to walk this line and this word salad, the problem, again, is -- as I said before, she should have done that earlier. Chris Christie, God bless him, was trying to sort of sound that alarm very early on. Didn't get too far doing it. She's trying to figure out a way to walk that line to get a couple of votes.
