And I had the opportunity all weekend long to visit all the various different parts and pieces of our community. And the enthusiasm for Kamala Harris is off the chain I guess I would have to say. The number of people who are showing up to knock doors, to make phone calls are in the hundreds. I think we knocked on 90,000 doors just in our district alone and then something like 800,000 across the entire commonwealth.And so to your other question about the energy amongst women, and particularly rural women, I was in a community down in the Canon (ph) area, and I know you're familiar with that. It's sort of southern Chester County, near the border of Delaware. All women in the audience and all older women. And I think the atmosphere there is one of - I think they called it nauseous optimism. And I think that they're really hopeful that there will be a change. And that change will be a positive one with Kamala in the White House and that President Trump will not return to the White House.",

And then he also, of course, made comments about reporters potentially being in the line of fire at future rallies. What's your response? HOULAHAN: So, speaking of nauseating, that is truly nauseating and really bone chilling. And this is an indication of were he to be successful and return to the White House, this is the kind of administration that he would undoubtedly run. The idea that he is really, frankly, doing nothing but intimidating and casting dispersion and doubt amongst the electorate is, I think, pretty insidious. And so I think that that's one of the contrasts that you see here on the ground in Pennsylvania. You see, you know, enthusiasm, hope and happiness on the one hand and you say sort of a dark - a dark, backward-looking vision on the other hand with a lot of kind of punitive conversation and threatening talk.",

Because of the Biden administration and hopefully a future Harris administration, those pipes are being eliminated. People are being more safe.

So, Harris is winning that number by 35 points. And just to put that in context, when Trump won in 2016, he won women over 65 by nine. When Biden won in 2020, he won them by 13. So, she's winning by 22 more points than Biden won in 2020.So, I mean, that is a huge number. And again, let's say Selzer's half wrong and she's - she's got a great record. I know her too. And I just - I think her - her - the way she looks forward, not backward, is a really unique way of looking at polling that doesn't model after 2020. And I've been saying all along, this is going to be nothing like 2020. So, you look at the granny gap. I've got a feeling this is going to be substantial.
