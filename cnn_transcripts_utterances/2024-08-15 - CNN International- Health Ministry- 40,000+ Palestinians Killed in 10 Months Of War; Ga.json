      "sentences": "Well, there's no question that it adds a sense of urgency. You know, certainly the international pressure has been mounting, just as that death toll has been rising.And as you can see in Jomana's report there, we are talking about every single day lives that are affected by the lack of a ceasefire in Gaza, whether it be the hostages who are still being held captive by Hamas, including one who was reportedly killed by Hamas guard, according to Hamas in just the last week, or the daily numbers of Palestinians who are killed every single day in the Gaza strip. It is only a ceasefire agreement that will provide the reprieve for the daily lives of people in Gaza. Now, how much that actually makes its way into the room where these negotiations are happening is perhaps another matter. We have been watching, of course, this death toll mounts and mounts and mounts over the course of months of war, more than 10 months of war now. And yet, so far, the political will on both the Israeli side as well as on Hamas' part, appears to have been lacking. And so, we understand that the Israeli Prime Minister has now given his negotiating team a slightly expanded mandate to carry out these negotiations, to try and bring them closer to a ceasefire deal. But, it's still unclear whether that mandate will be enough to bridge the gap that currently exists between the Israeli position and Hamas'. What is clear is that enormous pressure is being brought to bear by the United States, by the Egyptian and the Qatari mediators, to bring these two sides together. However, we should note that the expectations are certainly not very high for these talks today. There is the potential for progress to be made today, but certainly, no expectation that a deal will be achieved in these talks in Doha today.",

New images now of Russian POWs captured over the last week.A Ukrainian official told local media that they are treating the POWs in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, and that there are discussions about a possible prisoner exchange with Russian officials. On Wednesday, Ukraine conducted its biggest drone attack on Russian airfields since the war began. Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy called the strikes precise, timely and effective. Meanwhile, Mr. Zelenskyy is asking the West to provide more missiles, saying there are some operations that can't be done with drones alone. Clare Sebastian joins us now from London with more details on all of this. Clare, looking at the recent successful attacks, Ukraine has had in the Kursk region, how long can this last?",

And on the -- the issue of Russian response here, it has so far not been decisive.There is evidence they're bringing in reinforcements, but as recently as yesterday, the Ukrainian side was saying that they were advancing some one to two kilometers in some area. It seems that the advance still continues. Now, in terms of Ukraine's objectives, the sort of major stated ones being pushing Russia towards peace. Clearly, no progress there, and in terms of drawing Russian troops away from other parts of the front lines and easing the pressure that way, well, CNN has a team in the border region of Sumy on the Ukrainian side, and they caught up with the Ukrainian commander. His group is actually active in Kursk at the moment, he was briefly on the other side of the border. He had this to say about potential progress there.

We know, we've seen imagery that some western equipment is very likely being used by Ukraine in this incursion into Russia, things like armored vehicles, and the like. But certainly, it has not been the case that there's been any lifting restriction on the use of long- range missiles provided by the west into Russia. So, that is something that he is certainly pushing for.

So, clearly, as much as this was billed as an economic speech, Trump didn't treat it as one. When he did talk about the economy, those often looking backward at the last four years and trying to tie Vice President Harris to the inflation and the policies of Joe Biden, this is the area where they believe that Republicans may have an advantage.

And it's amazing to think that it was a tropical storm when it made its closest pass to Puerto Rico, and it caused this destruction you see behind me, from the incessant rainfall, but also the strong tropical storm force winds that knocked out power to so many.So, it's going to be days to clean this up, and it's also going to take several days to get the power back. Remember, there's a lot of warmth. It's the summer season here. So, once the storm pulls away, as it's doing now, a lot of people are going to be left in the dark without the ability to cool themselves down. So, that's problem in itself. 450,000-plus customers without power as we speak. This number is improving throughout the course of this morning, but there goes Ernesto, a lot of dry air wrapping in behind the system. So, it's preventing it from forming that distinct eye that we would look for in a rapidly strengthening hurricane, although, we do expect it to take advantage of the very favorable environmental conditions over the western Atlantic, namely the warm ocean waters, the low shear environment, lots of things working in its favor. And you'll see that explicitly from the National Hurricane Center as we time this out, going forward, a strengthening hurricane, perhaps major strength, major Category 3 by Friday afternoon, and then, some slight weakening before reaching Bermuda. Does it bring a land-falling storm to the island of Bermuda? That is still TBD, to be determined, because you got to think about it. It's like threading a needle in a haystack or finding a needle in a haystack. This is very small island in a very vast ocean, but nonetheless, all of our computer models are pointing impacts for Bermuda on Friday, and into Saturday, whether or not we get the strongest winds. That still, of course, will be determined here with the exact steering currents in the upper levels of the atmosphere. One thing is for sure, lots of heavy rain expected for Bermuda, the potential for flash flooding with over six to 10 inches of rain. We already saw what it did in Puerto Rico. And then, there's going to be a lot of wave energy associated with this. So, not only will it emanate outward, but it could impact the east coast through the course of early next week, even this weekend as well, rip currents and the potential for large swells along the eastern seaboard. It's still summer break for many people, so we do need to take note of that. Fredricka, it's a difficult scenario for people in Puerto Rico as they try to rebuild and recover after this tropical storm. But remember what happened here just a couple of years ago with Maria?",

And they got to do what astronauts are trained to do, and that is go live, and work in space for months at a time. So, it's funny to hear you say they're stranded in space. That's what astronauts do for a living. We think everybody's stranded on Earth. So, it's -- I think it's a perspective thing.",

And they want to do every single thing they can to make it as safe as possible, to bring Suni and Butch home.What they're doing right now is they've built a really high-quality three-dimensional model, a digital model of these little valves that are failing, and they want to run a whole bunch of simulations of those with the best simulation they can, so that they have the greatest chance of making all the right decisions to bring them home. Eventually, because of other ships coming and going, they've got to say, OK, it's time to undock and come back. Looks like probably by the end of the month, that'll happen, but there's no big rush. And so, that's the timeline they're working to.",

I mean, this is -- this was the goal, right, to be in space, and to maximize their experience. But then, give me an idea, so for Suni and Butch, well, it was eight days. It didn't even take luggage.I understand just through, you know, reading over the course of time, that they've been borrowing clothes, and all that. You've spent time on ISS. What is existence like on the ISS? I mean, what -- what is the daily routine, besides the experiments that a lot of them are conducting? What is the daily routine like? What kind of stuff do you need?",

A resupply ship just launched last night, and there was one a couple weeks ago. We recycle almost 100 percent of the water. We're running hundreds of experiments. So, having two extra people to help run all those experiments just makes the space station way more efficient.I don't know if you saw Suni and Butch's introduction to the Olympics, but you can just see how happy, and productive, and joyful they are to be there. And this will be their last flight, I'm sure. They're both very senior astronauts. They've flown in space multiple times. So, what a gift for them. And we just now need to make sure we do everything we can to make sure that Boeing spaceship is healthy, and we make all the right decisions to bring them home.",

If they -- if they were planning to go to the beach with their family, that's not going to happen this summer. But -- but yeah, it's -- I mean, both Suni and Butch, they were combat pilots, and then they were Navy test pilots. So, their families are used to the disruption of that type of life of service.And then, astronauts, a professional astronaut's life is a life of service. So, you get to have one of the greatest experiences of all humanity to leave the planet for extended periods, but that doesn't come for free. And so yeah, it's part of the deal. And they'll have a good reunion. And they'll be able to look back on this as perhaps one of the most magnificent three-month periods of their lives.",
