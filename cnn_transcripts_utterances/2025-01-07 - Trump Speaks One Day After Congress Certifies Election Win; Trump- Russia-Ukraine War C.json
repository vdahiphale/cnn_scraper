And I could understand their feeling about that, but there were a lot of mistakes made in that negotiation.And when I heard the way that Biden was negotiating, I said, you're going to end up in a war, and it turned out to be a very bad war, and it could escalate.

They had a deal which would have been a satisfactory deal to Ukraine and everybody else, but that Biden said, no, you have to be able to join NATO. And that's always been, and nobody knows more about NATO than I.You know, years ago, when I first started this, I didn't know too much about NATO, but I got it right anyway. I said they're taking advantage. I'm the one that got, and the secretary general was here, as you know, two weeks ago, saying that, if it weren't for me, NATO wouldn't even exist right now because I raised from countries that weren't paying their bills. At that time, 28 countries -- 20 of them were not paying their bills. 21 to be exact. They weren't paying and or they were paying a very small portion. And I raised over $680 billion, that was the number he gave by saying, if you don't pay, we're not going to protect you. And as soon as I said that the money came pouring in. But Obama could have said it. Other people could have said it. Bush could have said it. Nobody said it, but me. I took a lot of heat. They said, Oh, that's a threatening statement. Well, they weren't paying their bills. I said, we're not going to protect if you're not paying the bills. So, in a true sense, I saved NATO, but NATO has taken advantage of us. And one of the problems that I have, and I've said it openly. I said it to President Zelenskyy, Europe is in for a tiny fraction of the money that we're in now. Whether you like that situation or not, Europe is much more affected than the United States. We have a thing called the ocean in between us, right? Why are we in for billions and billions of dollars more money than Europe? And you know, they're a similar size, a little smaller, but they're a similar size economy as the United States, when you add them up. And yet, Europe is in for a small fraction of the number of the United States is in. Now, Biden could have called them up during the term. That's what I did. I said, you have to pay your bills. And they all -- one stood up. I won't say who, you'll probably have it because the media hated to report on it. But a prime minister up from a country, you know, a famous meeting of 28 nations with no press, no anybody in the room, he stood up. He says, does that mean if we don't pay our bill. And at that point it was 2 percent it should be 5 percent -- it should be 5 percent, not 2%, but at that point it was super. Many people didn't pay, some people didn't pay anything, but many people were way, including Germany. Germany was at less than 1 percent.",

You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security. You don't forget, we basically protect Canada.But here's the problem with Canada. So many friends up there. I love the Canadian people. They're great. But we're spending hundreds of billions a year to protect it. We're spending hundreds of billions a year to take care of Canada. We lose in trade deficits. We're losing mass -- we don't need their cars. You know, they make 20 percent of our cars. We don't need that. I'd rather make them in Detroit. We don't need the cars. We don't need their lumber. We have massive fields of lumber. We don't need their lumber. We have to un-restrict them because stupid people put, you know, restrictions on, but I can do that with an executive order. We don't need anything they have. We don't need their dairy products. We have more than they have. We don't need anything. So why are we losing $200 billion a year and more to protect Canada. And I said that to -- as I called him, Governor Trudeau, I said, listen. What would happen if we didn't subsidize you? If we didn't -- because we give them a lot of money. We help them. As an example, we're buying ice breakers, and Canada wants to join us in the buying of ice breakers. I said, you know, we don't really want to have a partner in the buying of icebreakers. We don't need a partner.",

We're going to start knocking it out pretty fast, but we're going to be able to do it because of energy and other things. But no, no, no right, no, no, no right.But why are we supporting a country 200 billion plus a year. Our military is at their disposal. All of these other things, they should be a state. That's why I told Trudeau. When he came down, I said, what would happen if we didn't do it? He said, Canada would dissolve. Canada wouldn't be able to function. If we didn't take that 20 percent of our car market. You know, we -- again, they send us hundreds of thousands of cars. They make a lot of money with that. They send us a lot of other things that we don't need. We don't need their cars. We don't need the other products. We don't need their milk. We got a lot of milk. We got a lot of everything, and we don't need any of it. So, I said to him, well, why are we doing it? He said, I don't really know. He was unable to answer the question, but I can answer it. We're doing it because of habit and we're doing it because we like our neighbors and we've been good neighbors, but we can't do it forever, and it's a tremendous amount of money. And why should we have a $200 billion deficit and add on to that many, many other things that we give them in terms of subsidy. And I said, that's OK to have if you're a state, but if you're another country, we don't want to have it. We're not going to have it with European Union either. European Union, we have a trade deficit of $350 billion. They don't take our cars, they don't take our farm product, they don't take anything. And so, we're not going to have it with them either.

And energy is going to bring it down.We're going to have prices down. I think you're going to see some pretty drastic price reductions. As an example, food, bacon, ham, apples, everything has gone through the roof. It's one of the reasons I won. So, as you know, I said it, inflation was one of the reasons I won. But I think the biggest reason I won was the fact that they are allowing prisoners to come into our country. They released their prisoners, their murders. Thousands of murders are now walking around the streets of our cities and farmland, all over murders, people that have killed many, 32 percent have killed more than one person. They released them from their jails, their prisons and their mental institutions and insane asylums into our country. I believe that's the reason we got such a large vote.

No, it's a deal that I was very strongly against. I was a young guy when this took place. But just why would we spend all of that money, lose 38,000 people to malaria, the mosquito? They were dying. It was horrible what was happening. They paid them four times more than they would make in the United States, but they knew they were going -- to go over there and die, and they died in the jungles of malaria. There was nothing we could do to stop it 30, and then we gave it away for $1. (CROSSTALK)",
