I don't want to jump to conclusions, but he likely went into this with some sort of a written statement. We're hearing one or two lines he wanted to say. And for whatever reason, he decided to pull that back or perhaps wait until afterward. This is where, as often is the case in Trump world, the attorneys are likely at odds with the comms advisers, who are going to want him to be, to David's point, you know, pushing back, calling it a witch hunt. But sometimes the best thing legally to do is to remain silent. So we'll see what he -- you know, we know we're going to hear from him later tonight, if not immediately after this arraignment.

So Mr. Trump would have gone to the defense table where he would have joined any number of his defense attorney. He would be seated at the table.

And the judge orders the court officers to remove the handcuffs and, then when the hearing's over, to replace the handcuffs if the defendant isn't being released. So that's their normal place. What's remarkable about it is that standing in front of them in the defendant is not somebody that they had uncuff or will probably have to re-cuff. But it's the first time Donald Trump has probably ever been more than four feet from a Secret Service agent, from his security detail.

No, I mean, it is an interesting balance of trying to act as though we're all equal under the law and Donald Trump will be treated no differently than anybody else, while also obviously he is a former president.This has never happened before, Andy McCabe. And also, you know, to be fair, I don't know that a case like this would be brought against Donald Trump, real estate developer, for the same alleged -- I mean, who knows? Maybe it would be. But on the other hand, who knows? ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST; It's really hard to say at this point, having not seen the indictment yet, right? But that's -- that's a decision that I think each one of us has to come to after reading the document. The D.A.'s office certainly maintains that they bring this charge of falsification of business records, and sometimes with the felony enhancement on a fairly regular basis against white-collar defendants. But again, we don't know what's going to be in this in this document. I will say, though, Jake, that these photographs of the former president are so striking. But to me, they are very familiar in a way. Over the course of over 20 years in the FBI, having been with numerous people on arrest and arraignment day, there is an undeniable humility and humanity that comes out against whoever has been called before the court and accused publicly of a crime in this process. Whether you're -- you know, I've seen it from street-level criminals, all the way up to CEOs and white -- white-collar -- people accused of white collar offenses. This moment, you may be sitting next to your lawyers, but you are alone before a judge and before the law and facing some very serious allegations. And it is a moment that -- that he will never forget, his family will never forget. And it's -- it's a somber thing, no matter who he is.",

So I could see why sitting at that table would be particularly humbling. He probably never thought he would ever have to.Of course, we're still waiting to find out what exactly the charges are. But just to repeat my reporting from before, the indictment has been unsealed, a source in New York government tells me. It is not live yet on the Web site. But there are 34 charges. And I am told from this source in New York government that Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to all 34 counts. We're trying to get more details and information about that. ABBY PHILLIP, CNN ANCHOR &amp; SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: I think, as we consider why he may not have spoken to the media on his way in, and we will see whether he does on his way out, the gravity of the situation really sitting with him in this moment, I think is really important. When he comes out and says something, what he says is now in the context of an actual criminal case in which his, you know, actual freedom is on the line. And that's a totally different situation -- situation that he has ever faced before. And so the normal kind of, you know, rah-rah rally bravado that you would see from Trump would not necessarily be appropriate in this moment. I cannot imagine a Trump attorney saying, let's put Trump in front of a camera off the cuff and have him say something. They would probably be much more comfortable with him standing in front of a podium reading something that they had cleared. But it would be very interesting to see if, in this particular context of a criminal case, they say to Trump, go in front of a camera and go for it. I don't care how many times you plan things with Trump, a lot of times he does what he wants in those moments.",

And Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to all 34 when that happens in a courtroom. When that happens in a courtroom, do they recite each charge to the charge of X, how do you plead and he says not guilty? Or how does it go?",
