It comes as we have the video of Russian taking down an American drone, an Air Force lieutenant general will show you exactly what he sees in this video.Plus, a $30 billion life line. The largest U.S. bank to be on the edge of collapse giving a mass cash infusion by other banks. In a moment, I'll speak to a Nobel Prize winner who saw the banking crisis coming and called for clearly five months ago. And an OUTFRONT investigation tonight, CNN finding the U.S. Coast Guard failed to act after two women came forward to say they were sexually assaulted on U.S. ships. The damning report from Pamela Brown ahead. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, rooting out Russians. We're seeing for the first time how Ukrainians are storming homes in Bakhmut, homes where Russians have been hiding. And you see soldiers come in, immediately start firing. According to the Ukrainian unit which recorded this footage, they fire, because they say, quote, they ever know for sure if there's a wounded Russian in the house who wants to take you with them. And you can see in this video how they may carefully approach another home. They go inside, you see immediately open fire as they go in. Now, according to the battalion by time they reached the neighborhood in this video, the Russians had moved out. Not wanting to die, they say. And you hear the shooting to imagine you know, what it would be like to be there. This comes as the Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin gives an interview blaming Russia's military for the front line failure, saying they won't help him win in Bakhmut because they're jealous that his forces were the ones who notched Russia's win in the tiny town of Soledar.

Now, Prigozhin's expletive-filled rant coming on day of tension. Tonight, the United States accusing Russia of lying about taking down an American drone and we're seeing the first time the shock aerial video of that incident. I'm going to play for you the video, you see the Russian jet swooping in behind the drone, right? Swooping in, jet appears to drop fuel on it, then you see the video glitch. Now, we'll pause this just a second because Lieutenant General Charlie Moore will tell us this is the exact moment of impact, and he said that there's no doubt this was both aggressive and reckless, in terms of a move by an extremely maneuverable and agile Russian fighter jet. In the shot, you then will see what appears to be the damaged propeller which ultimately brought the drone down. Now, this video catching Russian in a lie, which raises the question, whether they're telling the truth about the explosion at an FSB border patrol building in southern Russian. The FSB, of course, the intelligence for Russia. The building quickly went up in flames. Now, obviously, Russia immediately claimed this was the result of an electrical short circuit. They didn't want their FSB to have been attacked. Of course belonging to the FSB on fire like this is raising questions and fears in Russia and there's lot to get to tonight.

So I think it will work. I can tell you though in 1984, there was a bank in Chicago called Continental Bank that had a run. It was the biggest bank failure in history. It was the reason we have a too big to fail doctrine. It was set up during its bail-out. And the first thing they tried was having all the other big banks lend to them. Two days later, the bank had to be guaranteed by the FDIC for all the uninsured. So, it doesn't always work. That bank Continental had bad lending standards and fraud. I don't see any of that. First Republic looks like a fine bank that took bad interest rate bet. So, I think this should work. If there's, you know, a whole series of bank failures of the reason we want to bail people out and stop the bank failures once everybody thinks everybody will pull their money out of every bank, then it will be system-wide chaos, and that will be a self-fulfilling prophesy.

If you look among white voters in an average of recent polls, you see that DeSantis and Trump are basically even, if this was a match-up among white Republican voters, they'd be tying the polls but Trump is ahead by ten points. Why?It's because Trump has a double digits advantage among Republican voters of color or nonwhite Republican voters I believe this is so interesting because when we think of Trump voter, right, we think of the white work class voter.

But if you look among white Republicans, they make up only less than 30 percent. So, essentially what we've been talking about right is this Trump base among working class voters, but in fact, it's working class nonwhite voters who make up a significantly larger share of the nonwhite voters in the Republican primary compared to white voters, in fact most white voters in a Republican primary make more than $50,000 a year.",

We've seen a clear growth. They make up about 18 percent. Seven years ago they made up only about 13 percent.
