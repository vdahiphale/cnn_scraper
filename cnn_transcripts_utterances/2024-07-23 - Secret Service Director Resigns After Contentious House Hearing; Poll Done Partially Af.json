When she said she could lead it for -- it's actually the exact opposite. And the reason and why is because the Secret Service needs to deal with the past and it needs to deal with the president. The past is a really sort of a security planning and response that is incomprehensible at this stage. In other words, the gaps, the errors, the finger-pointing, all of it that Evan was just talking about. Like, we need -- we need to figure out what happened and the reason why is because we are now entering -- we are in a heightened threat environment leading up to the election that we always knew was coming. And now there's a change. We have a likely or, I guess, now, after the last 15 -- Kamala, Vice President Harris will be the nominee. And that will increase incitement. It will increase the racism. It will increase sexism because of who she is. And that heightened threat environment that Trump already has focused on him but that Vice President Harris will certainly suffer from, and some of it depends on what's said about her by the Trump campaign. This will lead to an environment where the Secret Service needs to look to the present and the future. Cheatle could not do that. There's no way she could do it. Because of the sort of both because of the assassination attempt but, of course, because she -- she lost everybody's confidence. And when you lose the committee's confidence -- this is a committee, as Evan was saying, was not one that agrees on anything -- it was over for her.",

And this is a poll that was partially conducted after President Biden dropped out of the race. It shows no clear leader.Trump's two-point lead there within the margin of error. So this is a statistical tie, 4.2 percent. That is the margin of error there. Let's discuss with former California Senator Barbara Boxer and strategist, Chuck Rocha. He's a former senior adviser for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaigns. All right, Chuck, we, as I mentioned, when this survey was taken, Harris had not done any campaigning as president. So keeping that in mind, I wonder what you think about the poll. I wonder what you think she needs to do to move this. CHUCK ROCHA, STRATEGIST &amp; FORMER SENIOR ADVISER FOR BERNIE SANDERS' PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: People need to remember that there hasn't really been any money spent on her behalf. The president has spent money, but she hasn't spent money yet. So I think there's nowhere to go but up with her. Now that's what I look at, the strategies. Who's spending the money? Are you out there on the campaign trail? We're seeing today that she is in Wisconsin. I saw the coverage of you earlier showing her getting off the plane in Wisconsin, meeting the governor. That's what you do because the press will follow that. The press will report on that. And that shows she's in a state, that she cares about those people. And as somebody who's run a presidential campaign, that's the goal that you have to dig every single day.",

BARBARA BOXER (D-CA): Well, first, I want to say that -- how disappointed I was when the president said he just couldn't continue and I was sad. And then it quickly turn to gratitude and excitement. And what does she have to do? She's in a beautiful situation. To start off, even Steven, with a guy who was a president, I think she needs to prosecute the case against him. I think she's going to be a champion for jobs. In the administration that she's in, Biden-Harris, they created 15 million jobs. And there you had Donald Trump, the only president since records have been kept, to actually leave with fewer jobs than when he came. Two more things. She needs to be a champion of our personal freedoms. She needs to stand up against Trump and say, how dare you say women should be punished for making decisions about their own bodies and telling them they have to be forced to give birth. I think she'll prosecute that case magnificently. Lastly, champion of democracy. She served with Joe Biden, a real champion of democracy, not only at home, but around the world. But here, she's going to go against Trump, who was admitted he wants to be a dictator on day one, loves, Putin, loves Kim Jong-Un. I think the table is set in for a great victory, honestly.",

And when you start looking at contrast and visuals back to those TV ads we we're talking about, if Democrats put this own TV and say Republicans don't think you, woman, should have a job because you're going to be some DEI hire, not that you're qualified, that you could do the same job that any man can do.
