Tonight, rescuersscramble through the rubble in Taiwan after a deadly earthquake, the strongest to hit the island in 25 years. We will have the very latest for you on that front. Then more suffering for people in Gaza, the U.N. suspends aid movements at night for at least 48 hours to assess security concerns after seven World Central Kitchen aid workers were killed earlier this week. Plus, the music industry taking a stand, more than 200 artists lash out against what they call threats posed by artificial intelligence. That and so much more coming up here. All right, we are keeping a close watch on a desperate situation in Taiwan as rescue workers try to free people trapped after a massive earthquake while dozens of aftershocks are hitting the island right now. Authorities say that at least nine people have been killed, more than 900 others injured. The quake struck during the morning commute, it was about 8:00 in the morning, drivers on bridges and highways had to stop while their cars essentially shook. The 7.4 earthquake also toppled buildings and triggered this landslide on the island's eastern coast. CNN's Hanako Montgomery has the latest.

First of all, your thoughts on what just happened in Taiwan, the strongest earthquake to hit in 25 years since 1999. And also, we're seeing so many aftershocks. Aftershocks essentially happening every few minutes throughout the day. Give us your thoughts on what occurred here. SUSAN HOUGH, GEOPHYSICIST, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY: Well, unfortunately, Taiwan is one of the places on earth that we know is earthquake prone. It's sitting on a complicated but very active plate boundary. The whole country of Taiwan is basically there because of the active geologic processes that have been going on. So, we know these earthquakes are going to happen. We know there's going to be very large ones, and they catch people off guard because they don't happen, thankfully, every day. An earthquake like this, the last large one was 25 years ago. Well, that's a long time on a human timescale. There's a lot of people in Taiwan who either weren't alive or don't even remember that.

But also criticism at home aswell over his government's failure to bring back all remaining hostages in Gaza. The hostages' family members disrupted parliament today, disrupted the Knesset today, storming the public gallery. Let's get more now from CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Jerusalem and Natasha Bertrand at the Pentagon. Jeremy, let me start with you, because I do want to talk about Jose Andres' interview with \"Reuters\", where he essentially said that Israel systematically targeted car-by-car, systematically targeted these aid workers. And we do know that there were multiple strikes, repeated strikes on the aid convoy. Just walk us through, A, what Israel has said about this, and also just in terms of the fact that Israel is already on thin ice when it comes to international trust, right? So, how will this and the outrage we're seeing around the world because of these attacks, how will this change their strategy going forward? What are they going to do differently from this point onwards?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly, to begin with Jose Andres' comments, I mean, his comments are supported by the evidencethat we have seen ourselves on the ground from video of these three vehicles that were struck by the Israeli military over a distance of about 1.5 miles is what separates the first vehicle from the third vehicle that were struck. The -- all of them indicating a precision-guided strikes likely carried out by drones, likely with full surveillance giving the Israeli military visibility into the strikes that they were carrying out, according to one arms' expert who we spoke with. And so, when Jose Andres saying here that the Israeli military systematically targeted these vehicles, and also noting that this was not just a quote, \"bad luck situation\". He is certainly speaking from the point of view of the evidence that we have seen of what these strikes actually were. Now, what is also clear is that the Israeli military, that the Israeli government recognize what an enormous error as they are characterizing it. This was the Israeli military's top General Herzi Halevi; the Chief of Staff of the Israeli military, calling this a grave mistake and actually issuing a rare public apology on the Israeli military's behalf. The Israeli Prime Minister himself also acknowledging what happens here, and that's because of the international uproar of this situation, because of the fact that so many of those killed were foreigners. But we should not of course, lose the fact that so many other aid workers in Gaza, Palestinians have been killed over the course of this nearly six months of this war. In fact, according to an organization that tracks these matters, more aid workers have been killed in Gaza in the past six months than in any other conflict annually over the last 20 years, 190 different humanitarian aid workers killed in Gaza since October 7th. And so, the question, as you just ask of what will the Israeli military do differently going forward? They say that they're establishing a joint command center to coordinate the delivery of aid in Gaza to de-conflict with Israeli military operations. That of course, is something that humanitarian aid organizations have been saying for months now, has been an enormous issue, an enormous impediment to the distribution of aid. And of course, making the jobs of these aid workers so much more dangerous. And so, it's of course, important to keep in mind that the dangers that these aid workers face, that the deaths of these aid workers yesterday is intrinsically tied to the fact that not enough aid is getting into Gaza, that this job is so dangerous, and it is so needed at this time because of the fact that hundreds of thousands of Palestinians at this moment are staring down the possibility of famine facing massive food insecurity already.",

They were targeting us in a deconflicted zone in an area controlled by IDF. They knowing that was our teams moving on that route with two armor -- with three cars.

So, it's interesting, Natasha, because President Biden says that he is outraged by what happened here to the World Central Kitchen aid workers. He also has said repeatedly that he doesn't believe that Israel is doing enough to protect humanitarian workers. But at the same time, he's also approving or pressing Congress rather to approve an $18 billion worth of sale in terms of F-15 fighter jets to Israel as well. How -- what's the reaction to that?

And yet, you continue to make decisions to approve these massive military sales to the Israelis, is that going to stop? And the response was essentially, it is not going to stop because we have made an investment in Israel's long-term security. We have a longstanding defense relationship with them -- and oh, by the way, these sales that we are approving, the equipment such as the F-15 fighter jets are not actually going to be delivered to Israel for another four to five years. While of course, the obvious response to that is, well, you could -- you are still approving and engaging in these transactions with the Israelis now, thereby essentially affirming that you have faith in their ability to be a professional military and carry out their operations in the way that the U.S. would expect its allies to. And you know, the response consistently from the Biden administration has been that these weapons and these systems are going to Ukraine -- to Israel to defend itself from the many threats that it continues to face. Not only from Hamas, but also from Iran. But you know, that argument is increasingly -- I think wearing thin on not only on President Biden's critics, but also generally on the American public who are wondering why the administration appears to be saying one thing in public very loudly, criticizing the way that Israel is carrying out this war. And then on the other hand, continuing these arms sales. I think that this attack on the WCK convoy could move the needle somewhat in President Biden's thinking, just because he is a close friend of Jose Andres, and unfortunately, that does hit closer to home perhaps than the many other Palestinians that have been killed in this conflict. But as of right now, we are not seeing the signs that any change in U.S. policy in that regard is imminent, Zain.",

And because of all of the typhoons, this is not a hugely populated area. There's population, half a million people, but not like it would have been on the other side where we saw the shaking in Taipei. Taipei shaking was somewhere equivalent to a 5-0, 5-5, 5-6, somewhere in there where on the other side we were hundreds of times more shaking in the areas that we saw that. 34 quakes so far, aftershocks now above four magnitude, so that's a pretty good shake all on its own. And what that's doing are these buildings that are already compromised are shaking when we do have rescue crews trying to get still people out. Here, the promised picture of the tsunami. Not a big tsunami, but there was an area in Taiwan of about one meter. This is about a half a meter here from Japan. Why? Well, because it's the ring of fire. The Atlantic Ocean is getting bigger. The Pacific Ocean is getting smaller and we're crashing these plates into each other. So, most of the earthquake activity, the volcanoes around the world are all in this ring of fire, 450 volcanoes, 90 percent of the world's quakes, and most of the big ones. Now, this was a seven, four. Look from seven to eight. Between seven and eight, they -- 15 earthquakes a year of this magnitude or close. So, not a rare event, one per month or so, but rare because they were under so many people's feet. That's the problem.

He -- we heard a lot of familiar names. These are things like the movies like \"Avatar\", like \"Moana\", like sequels of things like that. And I -- so, I also think what's really important for Bob Iger right now is to figure out the succession issue, because keep in mind what happened over the last few years and the, kind of, what happened with Bob Chapek didn't quite work out. That was his handpicked successor, only lasted for two years before Bob Iger had to come back. This is something that investors are very worried about. They want to see a succession plan in place that they can trust. Disney also has to figure things out on streaming. This is something that Nelson Peltz said he wanted Netflix like margins. On streaming, Disney is -- says that they're aware of this. Says that they are working towards this question of will they be able to succeed on all of these points?",

That's the sun. That is the sun. This was my 8th. Yes, that was my 8th. So, the one, this year it will be my ninth. My name is David Baron and I'm a science writer and eclipse chaser. An eclipse chaser is someone who is so in love with the experience of seeing total solar eclipses that they will travel around the world to see something that lasts usually three minutes. I want to capture my own reaction. So, this now was in Chile in 2019. It's such a precious and brief experience. I don't want to waste any time trying to take pictures of the eclipse itself. That was August 21st, 2017. I mean, a total eclipse connects people. Yes, it gives me chills. I mean, it's just -- it's like I leave my normal, everyday existence and I'm suddenly transported someplace else. It's just all about appreciating being alive. It's just meeting new people and seeing new places and experiencing something so rare and so brief. it just reminds me to appreciate that I'm here. It's as simple as that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, this time, one of the most amazing things about this upcoming total solar eclipse is thefact that the moment of totality, the moment when, the moon totally obscures the sun and it literally changes from daytime to nighttime in a matter of seconds, so dark that the stars come out. It's going to last so much longer than it did back in 2017, about double the amount of time. At the longest point, you will be in total darkness in totality for about four minutes and 30 seconds. That is a long time when you compare it to a lot of the more recent, previous total solar eclipses. The other thing, Zain, that makes this eclipse so unique is that it just so happens to coincide with a very unique period of very active activity on the surface of the sun. So that means that it may be much more dynamic and, quite frankly, cool to look at during those four, roughly, four minutes of totality. So, you should see things like solar flares or coronal mass ejections, big things. Those big wispy things kind of coming off the surface of the sun during that moment of totality. So, those are the two big things that make this eclipse so different and the fact that there's not going to be another one in the contiguous United States for about 20 years, Zain. So, it truly is a once in a generation event. And can I just say that eclipse chaser right there, I thought he put it so well, you know, I've never seen a total solar eclipse.
