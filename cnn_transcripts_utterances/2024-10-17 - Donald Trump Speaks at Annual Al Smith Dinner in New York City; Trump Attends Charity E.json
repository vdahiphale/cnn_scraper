It's a charity event that gives the presidential candidates a chance to do some comedy in the middle of a heated and bitter political year. Donald Trump did get a lot of laughs, he also got some boos, and he used the stage to call Kamala Harris disrespectful for skipping the dinner. And then he cursed from the stage. He praised conspiracy theorist Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has endorsed him. He tried to flip the word weird against Democrats, and he made a transgender joke about Chuck Schumer, who was sitting right next to him. He joked about Doug Emhoff's infidelity in his first marriage. He winked at the assassination attempts against him and much, much more.Good thing we've got our round table here to break it down. Brian Stelter, what did you make of this performance?",

So, they are investing in America.And if I may, your point is good. People are saying, why is our money going over to Ukraine? Why are we sending all this money to Ukraine? I think what most people don't understand is that a lot of the money that we're spending on Ukraine is actually being spent here in America. We are sending old weapons over to Ukraine and then we are rebuilding new weapons here in America to update our military, to make new fresh weapons, to give Americans jobs to do things here. So, a lot of the money spent on Ukraine is actually spent right here. And we keep telling people it's going away, but it's actually been spent here.",
