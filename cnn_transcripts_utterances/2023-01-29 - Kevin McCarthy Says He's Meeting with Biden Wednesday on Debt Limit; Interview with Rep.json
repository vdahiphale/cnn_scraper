This will be the first time the two men are meeting in person since McCarthy became House speaker.Now the White House has said there will be a range of issues that are discussed during that meeting but this discussion about the debt ceiling is certainly expected to be one of the central focuses. Now both men have said that they don't want to see the nation default on their debt, but for the time being they disagree on how exactly to do that. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has been very eager to try to push President Biden to the negotiating table, and Republicans have been insistent that if they are going to raise the debt ceiling, they also want to see some spending cuts. But President Biden and the White House have said that this is a non- negotiable, that this is an obligation that Congress must fulfill. I want to read you a statement from a White House spokesperson who tonight said, quote, \"The president will ask Speaker McCarthy if he intends to meet his constitutional obligation to prevent a national default as every other House and Senate leader in U.S. history has done, and as Leaders McConnell, Schumer and Jeffries have pledged to do. He will underscore that the economic security of all Americans cannot be held hostage to force unpopular cuts on working families.\" Now, earlier this week we also heard President Biden try to warn that Republicans could create chaos to the American economy if they do not raise the debt ceiling. So certainly this is a high-stakes meeting that is being set for this coming Wednesday. I will also note Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said that she is using extraordinary measures to prevent a default targeting an early June deadline. So certainly over the course of the next few months this will be one of the major contention points between the White House and Republicans up on Capitol Hill that could have huge consequences for the American economy.",

I said when Mar-a-Lago was raided that this had been a problem in previous administrations. There had been accusations that presidents and vice presidents had mistakenly taken documents that were deemed classified with them. This has always been a problem. I don't understand why we can't have a system where someone, and if that someone is from the National Archives, is there overseeing the boxing up of documents because every president and vice president has a right to take that -- take personal documents with them.

That suggests that Scorpion, this unit that has now disbanded seemingly, I think rightfully, was used to this kind of violence. But the more tragic part is I think community members, they were in a residential area, did not feel like they could come out and intervene because these were the police officers. And I think what the district attorney is saying, it's not each individual police officer as a totality, they were responsible for the murder of Mr. Nichols. And I think that's the case that they should make, honestly, Pam. You know, whether they can prove it is different.",

They'll be restarting without their principal, their assistant principal and the school district superintendent. The principal has been reassigned and the other two have been forced out or quit since the shooting.And the environment will look a bit different when students arrive in the morning. The administration is asking parents to send their kids to school without a backpack. They'll be given a clear one instead. If a student brings their lunch, officials say all items will run through a metal detector. Strict visitor protocols are already in place and even parents walking their children to school are subject to search. The school's newly assigned administrator says a police presence will be on campus to assist with this transition. Joining us now for more is defense attorney Misty Marris. Misty, I mean. Just as a mom of a kid who's about to go to elementary school it's just like shocking to me that these changes have to be made to protect students. I want to play a little bit of what the attorney for the teacher said earlier this week. Let's listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But this information that came out through the victim's lawyer really sets forth a timeline that the school was on notice before the shooting that this student did have a gun. And so from a liability perspective there's several different areas here. So you have potential criminal liability. Right? That could be against the 6-year- old child which there are legal hurdles and we can discuss that in a minute, as well as potentially against the parents of the child.But in this other capacity, it's civil liability. Was there a foreseeable risk and did the school fail to take reasonable action? In that type of case you have to prove what's called gross negligence. But here you see the allegation is that the school -- teacher requested that the child be searched and the administrators declined. Now, you do have Fourth Amendment rights at a school. So there has to be what's called a reasonable suspicion. But the questions that are arising here, why didn't the school act? Why weren't the police called? Why wasn't the child removed from the classroom? Why wasn't something done in order to investigate this? Why wasn't the school on lockdown? In this day and age every school has safety protocols, trainings, active shooter training. Why weren't the protocols followed in this particular case? And from a liability perspective there could be significant civil liability against the school. There are additional legal hurdles. However, in a case of gross negligence, meaning that the school failed to act, they did not do their due diligence, there absolutely could be civil liability in this case.",

Generally a child of this age is pretty much protected from prosecution because of several legal threshold issues. One is called an infancy defense, that a child at the age of 6 just doesn't have the capacity to formulate intent in the way that you would have to present that if you were going to prosecute.The other is what's called competency. In order for anyone to be charged with a crime they have to be competent under the law. That means they understand the charges against them, and that they can participate in their own defense. For a 6-year-old that's a really -- that's a hurdle. So it's unlikely that this child would be prosecuted. Even the juvenile delinquency system, while Virginia does not have a threshold age to be prosecuted, at any detention center the age is 11 and older. So there really isn't a lot that could be done from a criminal perspective when you have a 6-year-old child. However, what I foresee happening is what's called a child in need of services petition. This would go to a judge and there would be court-ordered medical treatment, counseling. So there would be some active participation by the court in helping this child who is obviously very, very troubled.",

Lawmakers and their families raising questions about whether there's enough funding to meet the threat need for the threats that they face and what gaps in the current programs there are. For example, the attack on Paul Pelosi showed that there's a real gap in correspondence between Capitol Police, which is based in D.C. protecting lawmakers when they're here, and local law enforcement protecting lawmakers and their families when they're back in their districts.Also across the board the attack on Paul Pelosi showed that more Capitol police officers are needed, more funding is needed for that to be able to meet the increasing threat levels like you're mentioning. But members do have access to funds to beef up security of their homes and their district offices. There's a lot of questions around if that's enough and if that funding can exist and extend to their families. But this was all under a Democratic-controlled Congress. Now we have Republicans in control of the House, so we're going to have to see when they take -- when it's their turn to address these funding questions if they're going to meet the need that really exists today.",
