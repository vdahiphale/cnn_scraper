If there was a democracy in Gaza, they would elect Hamas again. So there's no way that I see a two-state solution is actually possible going forward. I think we need to really be thinking outside the box here, of what are the other types of solutions, maybe even ones that put aside concepts of political recognition and focus instead on economic development on enfranchisement of a population, on demilitarization.

In the past few hours, the GOP controlled lower House failed paths to their own bills, due in part to chaos within party ranks. First, there was a blatant political stunt which backfired when Republicans fell short by two votes to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. House Speaker Mike Johnson says they will try again but only when they actually have the numbers. For almost $18 billion standalone funding bill for Israel also failed. Right Wing Republicans forced the House speaker to bring up the bill under a fast track procedure which required a two-thirds majority to pass. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle oppose that measure. And a bipartisan deal on immigration and foreign aid is on track to fail a vote in the Senate Wednesday amid Republican infighting and because Donald Trump wants the bill dead. The bill includes $75 billion in aid for both Ukraine and Israel. U.S. President Joe Biden had this warning for Republicans if the bill does not pass. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So the New Zealanders immediately refused to negotiate with this group of rebels who are designated as terrorists by Indonesia. And Indonesia's method to try to rescue Mehrtens was military. They sent wave after wave of special forces troops at this group of rebels to try to take him back by force and were unsuccessful. So over the past 12 months, little has been known about how Mehrtens has been getting on save for a string of proof-of-life videos of hostage videos, in which we see Mehrtens growing increasingly thin, increasingly unkempt as well. And those hostage videos even began to dry up as the rebels realize that even New Zealanders were not going to negotiate directly with them. So now, one year after this hostage situation began, a glimmer of hope in that the rebel group, the top brass of the rebel group, want to try to convince the individual rebels that hold Mehrtens to release him. The command at the top level, these rebels no longer believe that there's a political gain to be made in keeping Mehrtens captive. The rebel group, the individuals that hold Mehrtens have not agreed to do that yet. Unfortunately for Mehrtens, it's one of the most feared rebels that has him in captivity now. Eganius Koyega is someone who's previously claimed responsibility for massacres of Indonesians in Papua. So it's this delicate situation in which the rebels are effectively squabbling between themselves as to what to do with Mehrtens, this 37-year-old New Zealand father and husband who has been in captivity for 12 months. That window, that glimmer of hope may be a small one, John. As you know, next week, Indonesians will go to the polls, including people in Papua will vote for a new president. The front runner --",
