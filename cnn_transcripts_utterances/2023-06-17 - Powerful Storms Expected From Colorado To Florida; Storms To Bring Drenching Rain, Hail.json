I'm Alex Marquardt, in for Fredricka Whitfield. We begin this hour with millions of Americans bracing for a new severe weather threat. Powerful storms are expected today from Colorado to Florida, putting 60 million people in a potentially dangerous situation. CNN meteorologist Britley Ritz is monitoring the latest. Britley, where are the storms now? I know you're tracking them very carefully. How strong are they expected to be?",

      "sentences": "Well Alex, we are dealing with the threat of damaging winds, tornadoes, and even hail, yet again today. Currently, we have severe thunderstorm warnings in parts of Florida this morning.A few of them have now expired, but still one left upon the space coast yet this morning, where winds have been reaching over 50 miles per hour. Plus, heavy rain, a big concern too. Parts of -- parts of North Central Florida been dealing with nearly two inches per hour, like Ocala. And flood watches have now been extended into Florida. So, it's not just the severe weather risk in terms of wind and hail and tornadoes, but flooding. Tallahassee now, included back around the Big Bend, all the way back into Mobile, where these areas could pick up six plus inches of rain as the system moves through over the next two days' time. With that being said, our risk today, areas highlighted in orange. Oklahoma City included. Norman, as well as Tulsa with this enhanced risk of damaging winds in excess of 50 to 60 miles per hour. Also, hail, two inches in diameter and long-lived tornadoes. Strong tornadoes a possibility. So, holding on to that threat as we get down into parts of Dallas, Mobile, and Tampa, but the threats start to lower a bit. That extends back into Sunday. Little Rock, Jackson, Mobile included. Less of a risk in Florida on Sunday, but still holding that possibility. Timing it out for you, take a look this afternoon, the storms will start to redevelop as we get the heat of the day, plus, a lot of moisture out there ahead of the dry line. And that deepening area of low pressure across parts of Texas. So, anywhere between, I'd say, six and 8:00. We start to see some of these strong, possibly, even severe storms from Oklahoma down into Central Texas. That pushes into Arkansas once we get into the overnight hours. So, midnight to about 2:00. And remember, a lot of us are probably asleep at this point in time. So, make sure you have a device that wake you up to get to your safe spot. Remember, an interior room was these many walls in between you and the outside is possible. And if you have a basement, that's your prime location. This system pushes in Sunday afternoon into Florida and into the evening hours. But again, that threat starts to lessen at that point in time. On top of all of this, record heat a possibility, over 40 million under some sort of heat alert. Excessive heat warnings included from Brownsville to Corpus Christi back into New Orleans. These areas are talking about temperatures reaching over 100, actual temperatures. And if we factor in the humidity, it feels like nearly 120 degrees, Alex.",

What are the implications of officers, senior officers, who are up for promotion, having those promotions held up?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Alex, those implications are actually pretty profound. So every time a four star general moves, there are at least 60 direct other moves that happen as a result of that. All of those moves are now held up because of what Senator Tuberville is doing. The other thing to think about is that there are over 400,000 PCS or permanent change of station moves that occur every year, most of them occurring during the summer months. And there's always this cascading effect. For example, in the case of General Brown, who's the prospective chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff just nominated by President Biden, he is currently the Air Force chief of Staff. Well, his replacement can't take over as chief of staff of the Air Force until General Brown becomes the chairman of the Joint Chiefs. And so there are similar effects in multiple commands. They affect not only operational forces, but also the intelligence forces. So every time one of these senior leaders is not in position, new initiatives get stalled, new ways of doing things kind of stop.

There would have to be somebody else selected to be Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.General Milley is basically limited in his term as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs unless he's confirmed or reconfirmed by the Senate for an additional tenure as Chairman, he couldn't fill that position after his term is up. So basically what happens is, you know, a whole new set officers would have to potentially be nominated and it could have a really adverse impact on not only the readiness of the force, but the ability of senior leaders to actually carry out their duties.",

If a strike does happen, it would be the largest against a single employer in U.S. history.And it is, of course, crucial to the nation's economy. UPS delivered more than 18 million domestic packages per day in the first three months of the year, and an estimated 6 percent of the United States' entire gross domestic product moves aboard UPS trucks. Now, the Teamster's current five year contract expires at the end of next month on July 31st, meaning that a strike could start the next day on August 1st. Joining me now is Richard Hooker of the Teamsters Local 623 in Philadelphia. His union represents UPS workers in Philadelphia as well as Delaware County. Richard, thank you so much for joining us today. I know these contract negotiations are still very much underway. We're several weeks out, but can you walk us through the key sticking points that the Teamsters are seeking? RICHARD HOOKER, UPS TEAMSTERS LOCAL 623, PHILADELPHIA: Well, the key points are get rid of two tier wage system. We have this Article 224 Drivers that do the same thing as our regular package car drivers, but they get paid significantly less and have less protections. So that needs to go away. Of course, the harassment, the retaliation, and the brutal antics of UPS, that also needs to go away. Better working conditions, more sick time, because as you guys know, that COVID is still here and our members delivered through the pandemic. And so we want to make sure our members can deliver safely as well as being able to be compensated for if they need to be at home taking care of their families.",

We have in our contract, every member has a grievance procedure whenever the company violates the contract. We have an apparatus that allows us to file that grievance for the company to do the right thing. They don't like that.They don't like union activists. They don't like when you stand up for yourself, for your rights. So they become retaliate. They become retaliatory. And they are very hostile.

Authorities have not released any possible information about suspects or suspect.Daniel Ellsberg, the whistleblower who leaked the Pentagon Papers, has died at the age of 92 from pancreatic cancer. He risked his freedom to share classified documents with \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" during the Nixon administration. The records painted a devastating picture of the war in Vietnam and showed that officials knew that the conflict was unwinnable. The government sued the newspapers, but in a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court found in favor of the media. And a dramatic rescue, in Escambia County, Florida rapidly rising floodwaters Friday morning, nearly sweeping a man away, until a sheriff's deputy rushed in to help, putting his own life at risk. During the rescue attempt, Deputy William Hollingsworth and the man were both sucked into a drainage pipe and were swept underneath a four lane road. They were submerged for about 30 seconds until they resurfaced on the other end of the road. The footage you're about to see from Deputy -- is from Deputy Hollingsworth's body camera. Take a look.
