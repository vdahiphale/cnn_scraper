Plus, journalistJulia Ioffe talks to Walter Isaacson about Putin's plans to inflict pain on the west. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. Europe is welcoming Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, with open arms. Applauding the wartime leader even as he pushes and pushes them for more powerful weapons. It is an extremely rare visit overseas for Zelenskyy, after his surprise touchdown in Washington, D.C. just before Christmas. It has been nearly one year now since Vladimir Putin brazenly tried to take Kyiv and the rest of Ukraine. But in reality, the Russian offensive has been going on for much longer than that. It was nine years ago, in 2014, that Putin invaded and annexed Crimea, spurring an international crisis. Catherine Ashton was Europe's foreign policy chief at the time. Her new book is called, \"And then What: Inside Stories of 21st Century Diplomacy\". And she tells me all these years on, Putin is still trying to run circles around the west. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And we did not know whether Russia would stop, whether they would keep going. And so, I think that holding all of the countries together around a position, that accepted that this was aggression was good in its way. Now, looking back it turned quite quickly into a, sort of, semi-frozen conflict. And in fact, the last place I was before we all went into lockdown was actually in Kyiv again looking at what is going on. And I was quite worried then that we, sort of, not really given them the support that they felt they needed.

It gave Russia the time and the space to accumulate, train forces, and to plan this much bigger war. The worry is that you freeze the conflict in place as it is now, and then that becomes the starting line for the next war which can be much bigger, and even more destructive, and even more deadly.

He has become an incredible wartime leader and has become a very effective messenger for the Ukrainian people abroad, including here in the U.S. I also don't see the U.S. fatiguing as quickly as you are suggesting. I think it is still the mainstream position of both the Democratic and Republican parties to support Ukraine. I know the White House -- the Biden White House, sees its main ally on this in Congress as Mitch McConnell, who sees a strong support of Ukraine as a very strong signal to China, on Taiwan. He As he -- kind of, he sees it as two birds with one -- killing two birds with one stone. So, I think -- I don't see aid to Ukraine becoming too much of a problem.

He thought Ukrainians would greet Russian troops as liberators, and they didn't. And he also thought that he had a stranglehold of Europe, in terms of energy, and he didn't. It was amazing to see how quickly Europe pivoted from its heavy dependence on Russian energy. Germany went from importing two thirds of its natural gas from Russia to importing zero percent of its Russian -- of its natural gas from Russia in just a matter of months. Europe was able to quickly store up gas, other forms of energy. And the Russian budget is taking a massive hit. It is the Russian federal budget is running at a deficit. And for the first time in a long time, so again, Putin thought that he had all this control over Europe. But as I said from the very beginning, Putin needed Europe just as much as Europe needed him for energy because it was Russia's biggest, most important energy market. It is one that the Soviet Union and Russia had spent three generations building. All of that infrastructure, all those pipelines go west and not east. And it turns out, you can't just threaten your clients into buying from you. You, you know -- they have to voluntarily come to you and buy from you.

By asymmetrical measures. We've seen it, for example, in their alleged attempts to undermine Sweden's ascension to NATO. And other -- you know, we've have seen the mail bombs across Spain with the, you know, their mail bombs full of animal eyeballs. But there's a worry that there might be assassinations across Europe. They're, apparently, not very difficult to carry out. Although again, Russians -- Russian intelligence capabilities across Europe have been severely degraded in the wake of the invasion. Western countries have PNGed or made persona non grata over 400 Russian diplomats who were, basically, intelligence agency -- agents operating under diplomatic cover. So, that very much limits their access. But they can still travel into Europe under other guises. And we might -- it might be easy to catch them after the fact because they tend to be very sloppy operators as we saw in the Skripal poisoning in 2018, in the U.K. But that doesn't mean that they won't try, and that is the concern.",
