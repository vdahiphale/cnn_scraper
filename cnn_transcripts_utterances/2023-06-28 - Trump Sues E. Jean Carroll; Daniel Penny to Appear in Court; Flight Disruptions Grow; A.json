Now, that was one day after the jury found that Carroll -- excuse me, that Trump was libel for sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her when he denied her claims of rape. Here's what she said.

But, you know, the issue here is that, when the jury was give this case, they were given a couple of options under the statute for battery, which is what she sued for, and there are different legal standards, one for rape, one for sexual abuse, and the jury checked the box for sexual abuse. You know then - you know, you'll remember just a day after this Trump was on the CNN town hall and he again repeated his statements that he didn't rape Carroll. And he's been making this argument after the verdict that because they didn't find that he raped Carroll that he should get a new trial, that, you know, this is a defamatory claim. Now, she is saying, because he repeated these same statements, she wants to be able to get more in punitive damages for this 2019 lawsuit that is still working its way through he courts and is set to go to trial next year. And the judge has agreed to let her amend that lawsuit to seek as much as $10 million in punitive damages if that case moves forward. It's kind of a complicated, circular argument here, but it's just the -- yet another step in this litigation over Carroll's claims that Trump had raped her and his denials of it.",

We'll get to that in a second.Already red here on the board here on the cancellations board at Reagan National Airport. I just checked FlightAware. We're about 687 cancellations nationwide today. More than a thousand delays. The day is still pretty young. We're only about a third of the way to what we saw yesterday. Just want to give you a glimpse of how bad things were at the New York area airports last night. There were ground stops at all three airports last night. At LaGuardia they put into place the ground stop, the FAA says, simply because it was almost grid locked on the taxiways. No place to put places -- planes on the ground. The cancellations, the worst airports today, look a lot like it did yesterday. Newark, LaGuardia, JFK, Boston Logan and Chicago O'Hare. Although we will see, today is really the test, if airlines can recover. The deck of cards really came tumbling down starting on Saturday. And that's when United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby says the FAA really failed us, he says, because they simply did not have enough controllers, air traffic controllers, employed by the FAA to handle all of the flights coming in to its huge hub in Newark. So, the big question here is whether or not the airlines can really pull this out of the dive as we go into the July 4th holiday. The numbers are already pretty big, and the TSA is anticipating 2.8 million people passing through airports on Friday. That will likely be the highest number we have seen since air travel really started its downturn at the start of the pandemic. So, really, really huge numbers coming. We will see if airlines can really make the test here. It's going to be a hard one for them, Poppy.",
