KREBSnational security community, whether it's in the administration or in the Congress, just due to daily news cycles. But if you step back and look at the last two, three, four, five years, there is a consistent, ongoing pushback against aggression from the Communist Party of China. And it's particularly acute, this pushback, in the digital domain, whether it's cyber or pushback against technology companies like Huawei. And now you have TikTok. And as I look at the risks that the administration and, again, Congress are focused on, it's of a dual nature. One is the data collection and access, and the other is the algorithms in of themselves and how they can influence the users. My suggestions, as I've talked to whether it's the committee that developed this, is focus on the clearer threat of the data collection in the privacy issues, rather than the algorithm. I think that's where they're going to get in longer-term First Amendment challenges. They are trying to pretty narrowly focus on the economic transactions that happen at the app level with Google and Apple, but if you really do look it, I think, the data collection and the data access by Chinese personnel in China, which TikTok and ByteDance had admitted to several times, that's probably their strongest chance of success because of the national security interests.",
