Donald Trump comes out swinging at Special Counsel Jack Smith as a federal judge blocks the release of the report on the criminal investigations of the president-elect. Trump laying out his grievances and his plans for the Justice Department during a lengthy news conference.During that same briefing with the reporters, Trump also turned his fire on U.S. allies, making fresh threats and refusing to rule out using military force to take control of the Panama Canal and Greenland. This hour, I'll speak with Trump's former secretary of defense, Mark Esper. Also tonight, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announces major changes for both Facebook and Instagram. We're going to tell you why the social media giant is doing away with fact checkers, even as Zuckerberg admits the decision will lead to harmful content on the platforms. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get straight to our top story tonight, Donald Trump lashing out at Special Counsel Jack Smith as a federal judge puts his report on ice. Our Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid is joining us right now with details. Paula, so what does this ruling actually mean for Trump?",

Now, Trump lashed out at the special counsel several times during this press conference. Let's take a listen to some of what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. PRESIDENT-ELECT: -- happening that are exciting just before I take office, probably. So, he'll do like a 500-page report, and it'll be a fake report, just like the investigation was a fake investigation. And I said, well, wait a minute, this guy was thrown off in disgrace.

The attorney general had signaled that this will be made public. Also Trump's comment there that Smith was run off in disgrace, he's still in office, but he has signaled he will step down because Trump has said that he will fire him once he gets back to the White House.But here's how we got here. Last night, Trump's former co-defendants filed to block the release of Smith's report. They pointed to the fact that over the summer, Judge Aileen Cannon ruled that Smith's appointment was not legitimate, and she tossed the entire classified documents case. This is a decision that caught most legal experts by surprise. It was appealed, but never resolved. So, that issue is still hanging out there. And that is why they say he cannot release this report. So, we're waiting right now for the special counsel to weigh in before tomorrow morning. Then we're looking at the appeals court. This is something that could go to the Supreme Court. But, Wolf, I want to note that our sources have told us this final report doesn't really contain too much new information. They've already been indictments, they've released additional evidence that usually you don't see before trial. But this case, this is very personal to Trump, and he and his team, they are going to fight the release of this every step of the way.",

Now, he has tried to get this sentencing pushed back. Today, an appeals court rejected his latest effort to postpone this sentencing.Now, I will note that this sentencing, he can appear virtually. That's a concession the judge made based on the fact that Trump is president- elect. The judge has also made it clear he's not going to face any jail time or any penalties at all. This is something that'll probably be pretty quick. But this too, this is a really personal thing for the president-elect. So, even though this is something that most people in this country probably wouldn't pay that much attention to, and they're probably drawing more attention to it by fighting the sentencing, this is extremely personal for the president-elect. So, his lawyers are availing themselves of every option to try to push this back until after he takes the White House.",

Every other jurisdiction has said this is a legitimate proposition that this person is able to be under the authority as that title alone.

But none of these have gone to trial yet. Because of the fact that there have been four years of litigation against the president in state courts in New York and Georgia and federal courts in Washington, D.C. and Florida, he's conflating a lot of things together. And I think it works and lands with many people, you know, the point that Paul Reid had noted at the beginning referred to Jack Smith as in a fake report and so on.

And that he frames it, and you hear it from his advisers as well, they frame this as a national security issue.In Panama, they allege Chinese control there. In Greenland, they talk about the importance of it to the Arctic and elsewhere.

And if that doesn't work, you heard the president- elect there say himself that he might very well order military action.When I ask folks inside Trump's world whether that is serious, they say, not right now, but they're not taking it off the table. So, I think it's important not to dismiss this, to take it quite seriously. And the other point I'll make, Wolf, is this, when I ask folks in that world what his vision is, they describe it as a kind of Trump-Monroe doctrine. We got to go back to our high school history here, but the Monroe doctrine was in effect that the U.S. rules in the Western Hemisphere, and that's where the Panama Canal is, that's where Greenland is, that's where Canada is, and that he's going to push, flex his muscle here and that he's not going to tolerate any interference or any limitations on that. And to your point this would involve pressuring treaty allies of the United States either economically or militarily to give the U.S. what it wants.

We actually have a U.S. military bases on Greenland, a Space Force base and a Defense Missile Warning Radar, what we used to call Thule Air Base. So, we don't have any problems in terms of access or working with the folks in Greenland or Denmark, and, of course, same type of relationship in Panama.That said, I think there is some credibility to be given to Trump's concerns about the Chinese in Panama. It's certainly grown over the years. You know, in 2017, Panama changed its recognition from Taiwan to China. They joined the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative in 2018. Investments in ports and bridges and rail lines increased dramatically. They own two of the five port zone concessions in Panama. So, I think we should be concerned about continued growth and engagement in China. I wouldn't consider military force, but I think certainly engaging them diplomatic and economically to make sure we can push the Chinese out of Panama is something that's very important should be considered. I might say, though, Wolf, when you look at concerns about shipping and economic security, and I think, again, that's legitimate, if we go back to the broader landscape that's happening out there in the world, Panama represents 5 percent of global traffic in terms of trade. The Houthis, which have cut off or reduced traffic in the Red Sea for global shipping is at 12 to 15 percent. And more concerning, I think, which entails the broader focus against China is the South China Sea where, you know, 20 to 30 percent of global shipping passes through there and yet we have standoffs happening in the Second Thomas Shoal and the Spratly Islands and other places. So, again, it's a big world. Chinese influence is all over there. And I think we need to step back and take a look at the bigger issue of the Chinese strategy to usurp the United States.",

Number one is immigration, and we're going to need to work with them very closely to cut off illegal immigration and to seal up that southern border coming from there.And that's going to take work with the Mexican government, and then, of course, the fentanyl that's killing, what, 67, 80,000 Americans a year, Wolf, coming up through the south, through the border.

Right now, there's a lot of information pollution. But these tech CEOs, they are pulling back and essentially saying to users, you all go figure it out for yourselves.

So, what do you make of what we just heard from the president-elect on this issue? REP. SARAH MCBRIDE (D-DE): Well, this is clearly an attempt to undermine President Biden's legacy, a president who passed the world's largest ever investment in combating climate change that we've ever seen. And this issue is personal for me as someone who represents the lowest lying state in the country. We have to protect our communities, particularly our coastal communities, from rising sea levels. And this administration's really trying to talk out of both sides of its mouth. We absolutely all want to pursue more domestic sources of energy. And they can't talk about doing that while also trying to undermine the Inflation Reduction Act and undermine our capacity to invest in renewable energy here in the United States, which creates jobs, good paying union jobs, but also helps to protect our communities and our states from the existential threat of climate change.",
