      "sentences": "Welcome back to CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Anna Coren, in for Max Foster today. Here are some of our top stories.The first named storm of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Alberto, is set to make landfall in the coming hours near the Gulf Coast city of Tampico, Mexico. More than two million people in southern Texas are under tornado watch right now due to this huge storm. Electricity has been restored to 95 percent of Ecuador. A nationwide power outage on Wednesday left the country of some 17 million people in the dark for hours. The public infrastructure minister blamed the outage on faulty transmission lines and a lack of investment in the country's electrical system. More than 250 deaths have been reported among Hajj pilgrims making the annual journey to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Some are due to heat stroke, with temperatures in the kingdom as high as 49 degrees Celsius or 120 Fahrenheit. Others have died from diseases or other medical conditions. Russian President Vladimir Putin is meeting with Vietnamese leaders today in Hanoi. He thanked the government for its balanced position on the war in Ukraine, and he's also hoping to show that efforts by the West to isolate Russia are not working. His visit comes after a stop in North Korea, where he signed a trade and mutual defense pact, which some experts say may be an attempt to justify the reported use of North Korean munitions in the war in Ukraine. For more, let's go to Clare Sebastian, live for us in London. Clare, this mutual defense pact that was signed in Pyongyang, what does this mean for the war in Ukraine?",

      "sentences": "Well, Anna, I think if you look at this in the context of the not at all subtle rhetoric that we saw in the lead up to this trip and during this trip from both Putin and Kim on confronting the West, what Putin called the imperialist policies of the U.S. and its satellites. And if you look at Putin's criticism right before he talked about this defense pact of the U.S. and the West supplying weapons to Ukraine, including F-16s, of the lifting of some restrictions on using them to hit Russian territory, it's pretty hard not to see this as some kind of counterpoint to NATO's Article 5.North Korean state media also released the full text of this agreement later in the day, and it did clarify that if one side was attacked, the other would provide assistance, including military. So, it does look like some kind of collective defense pact, but we don't have much flesh on the bones as of yet in terms of what that would actually mean. Would it mean that Russia's formidable nuclear deterrent now extends to North Korea? Would it mean that they're going to hold joint drills, perhaps set up joint forces of some kind? Would anyone else be invited to join the pact in future? It certainly raises a lot of questions. And this is why Ukraine, in terms of the more immediate danger of what it would mean for weapons transfers between the two countries, is very concerned about this.",

Is there a fear that this will further escalate under this new defense pledge?",

South Korea has also said that North Korean factories are working at full speed to provide weapons for Russia to use in Ukraine.Debris from North Korean missiles has been found in Ukraine. U.S. intelligence has analyzed it, and the meeting certainly left the door open for this. You know, President Putin talked about the agreement, he said, does not rule out the development of military-technical cooperation between the two sides. They also railed publicly against what Putin called politically motivated sanctions. U.N. sanctions, don't forget, on North Korea explicitly prohibit the transfer of weapons. And don't forget that Russia had already, back in March, vetoed the extension of the mandate of a panel of experts at the U.N. that was monitoring North Korean sanctions violations. So look, it's one thing to rail against sanctions, it's another to stand up there having already denied that this is happening and publicly dismantle them. But certainly this meeting left the door open that this kind of trade, if it's already begun, could continue.",

He spent his entire presidency harming Black communities. And he's spent his entire campaign this cycle engaged in empty racist gimmicks instead of meaningful outreach. Black Americans haven't forgotten his lifetime of racism. The comments come just days after Donald Trump tried to court Black voters as he campaigned in Detroit over the weekend. Well, a contentious Republican primary in the state of Virginia could be heading for a recount. Congressman Bob Good is locked in a tight race with state Senator John McGuire. They're a little over 300 votes apart. And there's one man who could cost the incumbent his seat. CNN's Brian Todd explains. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Republican Congressman Bob Good in a nail-biter as he fights to retain his seat in Virginia's 5th congressional district. After Tuesday's primary night, Good trails his opponent by a razor-thin margin and the race could be headed for a recount. Good normally checks all the boxes for being a far-right MAGA Republican. He's an election denier, supports strict immigration measures, opposes all abortions. But he now could lose because of one move. REP. BOB GOOD (R-VA): I just want to congratulate and thank Governor Ron DeSantis. TODD (voice-over): Good initially endorsed Florida Governor Ron DeSantis in the Republican presidential primary, drawing rage from the man who ended up dominating the race. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Bob Good, who is actually bad for Virginia and who will stab you in the back like he did me. TODD (voice-over): It didn't matter to former President Donald Trump that once DeSantis bowed out, Bob Good went back to endorsing Trump. Good even made a pilgrimage to Trump's hush money trial to curry favor.",

Huge crowds marched in several cities, including the capital Nairobi, with police there reportedly arresting hundreds of people. Well Kenya's government has announced amendments to the bill, saying they would drop some of the new taxes on products such as cars and bread. But as the cost of living soars, many Kenyans say that's not good enough.Well CNN's Larry Madowo joins us now from Nairobi.

      "sentences": "So Anna, we're outside Kenya's parliament where protesters expect to come here. They're calling the protest Occupy Parliament and Reject the Finance Bill. This is where they hope to come and present the petition and have their elected leaders hear them.But the police have sealed this area off. They have water cannon trucks here. They have SWAT teams around here. No one can access this part of the road that's usually public ahead of these protests that should be starting any time now. There's been a heavy security presence around this just to make sure that anybody who gets this far does not make it all the way to the elected representatives. This all started from the proposed finance bill that the government of President Ruto brought forward that included higher taxes on basic commodities including bread and eggs and milk and sugar and financial transactions. A lot of the important things that people use in the day to day. After a huge public outcry and Tuesday's protests, a lot of those proposals were dropped. But some of them remain. For instance, a fuel maintenance levy hike that will make fuel more expensive. And those who oppose this finance bill have said if fuel is more expensive, almost everything else will be expensive. It's been extraordinary to see these protests. I've been covering protests in Kenya since 2007. I have never seen this level of youth participation largely led by young people, by women, by Gen Zs organizing on TikTok to have their voices heard, encouraging their peers to come out. And that is why you see this kind of heavy-handed response to it. If you look around here, you see a huge security presence in this road that's completely blocked off. They have riot gear. They have tear gas canisters. They have all forms of other equipment, I guess, to make sure that if they have to disperse the people, they can do so easily. They're starting to mass in parts of the capital here in Nairobi, so they might still try and get here anyway. During Tuesday's protests, we saw about 300 people, maybe more than 300 people arrested in different parts of the city. Today, these protests are happening not just here in Nairobi, but also in other parts of the country, in some major cities, smaller towns, where people still feel that they're getting overtaxed by President Ruto since he came into power in 2022. Now, his government's argument is that he inherited a lot of debt, and the only way to generate revenue is by increasing taxes, so that he can pay for government, pay salaries, build infrastructure and all that. So this is something that is impossible to avoid. But the criticism is that all of these are regulations, these extra taxes required by Bretton Woods Institutions, like the IMF. And so there's been a big push for the government of President Ruto to respond to the hustlers. When he was running for president, he said he was a hustler. He understood the plight of the common man. And now that's the call on the streets here for him to respect that. What's happening inside the National Assembly right now is that the members of Parliament are discussing some amendments and proposals. But the call outside is not to amend this finance bill, it's to abandon it entirely -- Anna.",
