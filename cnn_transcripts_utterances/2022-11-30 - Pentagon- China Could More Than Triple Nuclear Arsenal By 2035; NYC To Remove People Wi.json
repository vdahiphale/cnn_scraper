A new Pentagon report found China's stockpile of nuclear warheads has doubled in just two years. Back in 2020, the U.S. estimated this expansion would be achieved within a decade. At this rate, China could more than triple that arsenal by 2035. CNN anchor and chief national security correspondent Jim Sciutto is with us from Washington. Jim, two years? That's it?",

I mean, put this in the category of assumptions that the U.S. and the West have made about China that turned out to be wrong -- and frankly, it's a long list.But let's look at warheads here because this speaks to China's projection of military power around the world. Right now -- in 2020, rather, the U.S. put the number of total Chinese nuclear warheads in the 200s. It has already doubled in the span of two years. This is a figure that the U.S. did not believe China would reach until the middle of the next decade, so they are moving much faster than the U.S. and the West believed they would. And this is key. They are testing as they go. In the last year, they've tested ballistic missiles 135 times. That is a higher number of tests than the rest of the world combined for ballistic missile technology. Again, you've got the warheads and you've got the missiles that deliver those warheads. They are testing those missiles. At the same time, they're also testing and perfecting new technologies, particularly a hypersonic missile many times faster than the ICBMs that have been, really, the chief nuclear weapon of war for decades. They tested one last year, flew around the entire planet, and it was accurate. And the key to that was that was faster, too, than the U.S. expected as well. They just did not know China had that technology already and they fear it's ahead of where the U.S. technology is.",

This myth must be put to rest. Going forward, we will make every effort to assist those who are suffering from mental illness and whose illness is endangering them by preventing them from meeting their basic human needs.
