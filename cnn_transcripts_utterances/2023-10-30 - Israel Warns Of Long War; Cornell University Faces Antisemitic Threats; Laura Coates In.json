The IDF says that she was medically checked out and is doing well. But for the families of the remaining hostages, and we're talking about hundreds, the torment continues.Three women shown in a Hamas hostage video today seated on plastic chairs were facing the camera. One angrily demanding Netanyahu -- quote -- \"free us all now.\" Now, we have chosen not to show the video here at CNN because, one, they are hostages, and two, their statements could have been made under duress. But if you think that the war that is happening there has no real bearing on what is happening in the rest of the world, you are mistaken, because hate and antisemitism are spreading around the world. An angry mob in Russia's mostly Muslim region of Dagestan -- Dagestan, excuse me, stormed an airport when a flight from Israel arrived on Sunday, forcing authorities to shut it down and divert flights. That, as the war is also coming home domestically and on college campuses, no doubt. Cornell University's police department is now increasing patrols and even providing extra security for Jewish students in the wake of a series of antisemitic threats in online posts over the weekend. Now, that includes threats to shoot Jewish students in the campus's kosher dining hall. So, what is it going to take to keep students safe? With antisemitic incidents up almost 400%, yes, 400% since the October 7th attacks, I'll talk to a Cornell student about what is happening on that campus. And later tonight, mourning Matthew Perry, the cast of \"Friends\" breaking their silence today. Jennifer Aniston, Courtney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer, and Matt LeBlanc saying tonight -- quote -- \"We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just castmates. We are a family.\" Well, tonight, I'll talk to \"Friends\" executive producer, Kevin Bright. Let's begin, though, tonight with the antisemitic online threats against students at Cornell University. And joining me now, a student at Cornell, Davian Gekman. He's also the former National Jewish Student Union president. Davian, thank you so much for joining us this evening. We all heard about the statements that were made, the threats. It was just so unbelievable. I mean, your grandfather is a Holocaust survivor, and here we are in 2023 at your college. There were just calls to shoot Jewish students at a building that contains Cornell Center for Jewish Living. There were also calls to rape Jewish women, to behead Jewish babies in front of their families. I mean, the rhetoric, the statements, unbelievable. Do you feel safe on your campus tonight?",

In times like this, with attacks like these, we must be loud, we must be proud. And most of all, the Jewish community must remain and continue to be Jewish.This sign, I decided to do today alongside with security. And the reason I want to do this was because to show the Jewish community on campus that you can feel safe and you should feel safe. I did have Cornell police patrolling the area to ensure that no attacks were made. But it was very receptive by the Jewish community and other students who at times gave me nods, waved to me, chanted, clapped for me. Other students stood with me. I had about 10 to 15 students standing with me today with that sign in the pouring rain, cold. But, you know, rain or shine, I'm still Jewish, and I'm going to continue to be Jewish no matter the hate, no matter the attacks.",

You've seen the video from Dagestan, people flooding the runway, looking for Jews.Matt Miller, State Department spokesman, described the event as looking like a pogrom, a massacre of Jewish people. Here in the U.S., the ADL is saying that antisemitic incidents are up by nearly 400% since October 7th. There is a real fear in the Jewish community that we're witnessing firsthand.

That when you disagree with someone, there are limits to the acceptability of the disagreement. Once you enter, once you cross the line into violence, it is no longer acceptable.

He was found unresponsive in his hot tub. Now, the cause of death is still unknown, pending toxicology testing.Perry was best known for playing Chandler Bing on the beloved sitcom \"Friends.\" And tonight, his co-star is releasing a statement saying, we are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family. There is so much to say, but right now we're going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss.\" My next guest is executive producer of \"Friends,\" Kevin Bright. Kevin, thank you so much for joining us this evening. It is unbelievably sad news to think about the loss of someone that so many of us feel like we knew personally, watching him for the better part of three decades. I mean, we knew Chandler Bing. But you knew Matthew Perry. And I'm wondering if you can reflect a little bit about what his loss means to you tonight. KEVIN BRIGHT, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, \"FRIENDS\": Laura, thanks for having me. It's obviously very tragic that Matthew's life should end at 54. And especially at a point in his life where he seemed to have conquered the demons that plagued him for so long. And he was on a mission to help people. And that's what he was focused on, I know, speaking to him a few months before.",

But that's ignores the 2-24 tweet where the former president attacked Vice President Pence, said that he wasn't doing all that he could do to push the big lie. And then we saw some of the worst violence of that day come right after that 2.24 tweet.

She said she couldn't recall that specific reasoning.But then you talked to her chief of staff, we talked to her on the committee as well, and her chief of staff recalled Ivanka remembering her father calling Vice President Pence a bad name and wanting to keep him calm before he took the stage on January 6th.
