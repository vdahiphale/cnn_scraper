The German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is the president's guest this afternoon.He was last at the White House a year ago, February 2022, just two months into his tenure as chancellor and just weeks before Vladimir Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine. There were questions then about how Germany might respond. But Chancellor Scholz has emerged as one of President Biden's closest partners in pushing to get Ukraine more sophisticated weapons for the fight. With me in studio to share their reporting and their insights, CNN's Manu Raju, NPR's Tamara Keith and Zolan Kanno-Youngs of The New York Times. So, another package of military aid today, security aid, some military aid, some ammunition like timed with the Scholz visit. We're now in the first month of the year two. A year ago, there were questions, could Biden keep the world together? Would Scholz step up? Those questions are resolved. The question now is I guess, can you keep this together for another year? ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Can you keep it together? This has been really the united front and the Biden administration, President Biden's ability to rally allies to support Ukraine, has really been one of the achievements of the administration that they have tried to celebrate throughout these past two years, and often noted as one of the accomplishments of the administration. But now there's some questions going forward. You've got signs of mixed support among Republicans and the changing shape and outlook of Congress about whether or not they will continue to support providing this funding. Recent polling also suggests that wants very high and stable support among the American public as well, maybe starting to waver. So now, the challenge is, if you're President Biden, how can you continue to make sure allies who are also dealing with issues when it comes to energy supplies in Europe, continue to support Ukraine, as well as how do you maintain the support of the American people as you head into an election year. Those themes are really just hanging over this meeting today.",
