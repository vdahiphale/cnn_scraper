And this comes just days after Israel assassinated the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah. This morning, the group says a new leader will be chosen as soon as possible. Israel is also ramping up its offensive on other militant groups. An airstrike killed a Hamas leader in Lebanon. And joining us now is Ian Bremmer, the president and founder of Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm. Ian, first off, I just want to get your reaction to President Biden this hour sharply discouraging Israel from ground ops in Lebanon and what it's already engaged in with these targeted raids.",

      "sentences": "It's the latest thing that President Biden has been sharply discouraging. You will remember he sharply discouraged the Israelis from cutting off all the humanitarian aid into Gaza. He sharply discouraged them from the ground incursion into Rafah.I mean, this is ineffectual. He is seen to be weak, particularly on this issue, not just by the Israeli prime minister, but around the world. And the policy hasn't worked out very well. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Netanyahu, who just recently got his former opponent, Gideon Saar, the former minister of defense, and in charge of the New Hope Party, to join his government, he's now more popular than he's been at any point since October 7. So, I mean, you really see this playing out.",

      "sentences": "Well, one reason is because Biden is actually a very strong pro-Zionist, so he wants to support Israel much more than American allies around the world do. It's a personally felt policy.The second is that he is -- although he doesn't like the Israeli prime minister, he's been unwilling to do very much publicly. So, privately, he's saying, I don't want you to do X, Y, and Z. He's trying to exert pressure. But aside from some very, very limited sanctions, for example, against some settlers, some -- a couple of delays of some military programs, the reality is, there are no consequences for the Israeli government in their unwillingness to follow any of the advice that President Biden is giving them. So I think it's a combination of those two things. Now, why it is that Netanyahu is so popular is because his policies -- and, remember, he was seen by the entire Israeli population as responsible for October 7. He didn't protect his people. He wasn't able to get the Israeli Defense Forces the intelligence to either see coming or stave off the Hamas terrorist attacks on October 7. We see now just how capable when they're focused the Israeli military intelligence is. The Israeli population, unlike the U.S., unlike the rest of the world, does not support a two-state solution. They do support the war in Gaza. They support the destruction, the complete destruction of Hamas, irrespective of the civilian casualties that we have seen, and they support the decapitation of Hezbollah. So his policies, as much as they may be out of step with the rest of the world and with Biden, are very much in step with the people of Israel.",

Days after the storm hit, many people still have no power. They don't have cell phone service. They're just abandoned and struggling right now in isolation. But amid this devastation, there are also these incredible stories of resilience that are emerging, like the story of this man, Sam Perkins. He walked 11 miles to reach his elderly parents' house, hiking along a heavily damaged road carrying bottles of water and fresh food after he hadn't heard from them in two days. Sam Perkins joins us now. And, Sam, I know so many of us know -- can try to understand the fear you had in not being able to reach your parents, knowing the devastation from the storm, and wondering if they're still alive.

And the roads from the town at the bottom of the mountain in Marion are closed. And there was a trooper blocking the highway there and said, if you want to walk, you can. And I had a backpack and filled up water, some food, supplies, a power bank for recharging phones, and just started trekking. And I got a -- I was able to hitchhike with someone for a little bit of the ways at the bottom where the road was relatively clear until it wasn't. We hit a spot where the road had washed out. There was a really bad landslide. Ironically, there was a crew up from Florida helping to chain saw, and at that point started a trek the rest of the way up the mountain to get to them, and eventually did. And my dad was out trying to do what work he could with what juice his chain saw had, and just was the greatest relief I have had in my life, and just hugged him as tight as I could and bawled, and then went inside and found my mom and did the same.",
