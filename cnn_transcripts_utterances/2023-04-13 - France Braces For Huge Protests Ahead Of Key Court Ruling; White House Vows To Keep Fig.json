Up to 600,000 people are expected to take to the streets again denouncing the government's pension reforms. This comes ahead of a ruling on Friday of the constitutionality of the divisive law. That law, to remind you, raising the retirement age by two years to 64 years old.CNN's Saskya Vandoorne joins us live from Paris. I mean, compared to the rest of Europe and, of course, to the United States that is a very generous -- even that higher retirement age is very generous, but this is something that has really sparked outrage from the streets of Paris. What's the mood in the city this morning?",

      "sentences": "Well, Christine, I'd say that the mood is one of determination and really, it's gotten bigger than the pension reform, right? So, yes, they're angry with the pension reform. Yes, they're angry at the way that it was run through Parliament. But they are particularly angry with one person and that is French President Emmanuel Macron.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VANDOORNE (voice-over):  Anger on the streets of France. \"Macron resign,\" protesters all united against a defiant president. EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT (through translator):  If you want the pact between generations to be fair this reform needs to be carried out. VANDOORNE (voice-over):  Pension reforms were a landmark policy of President Emmanuel Macron's reelection campaign but upping the retirement age from 62 to 64 may have been a step too far for too many. Forcing the bill past one of the two parliamentary chambers pouring fuel on the fire of popular anger. Much of that ire has come Macron's way. DOMINIQUE MOISI, POLITICAL EXPERT:  Now, it is really against the denunciation of the president himself. I don't think in the history of the Fifth Republic we have seen so much rage, so much hatred at our president. VANDOORNE (voice-over):  With most French people polled supporting the protests his approval ratings are nearly the lowest of his two terms at just 28 percent in March. It was only worse during the yellow vest protests four years ago. Popularity at rock bottom, hundreds of thousands in the streets weekly. For Macron, the yellow vests protesting what they called economic injustices upset his first term. He now faces a similar risk. VANDOORNE (on camera):  The deficit-balancing moves slammed by many as tone-deaf will face its final hurdle here Friday -- France's equivalent of the Supreme Court. It will either rubberstamp it or deem that some parts or, indeed, the whole thing is unconstitutional, which would be a further embarrassment for President Macron. VANDOORNE (voice-over):  For the young reformer pensions were supposed to be the first of several policy revamps, but his crusade of government reform now looks dead in the water with little hope of energizing lawmakers behind yet more controversial rethinks. And his legacy may be even troubled, opening the door to the far-right.",

President Biden will be busy in Dublin today. He is meeting with the Irish president, the Irish prime minister, speaking to the Irish Parliament, and attending a banquet dinner at Dublin Castle. All right, more now on our breaking news. The Biden administration already speaking out about the federal appeals court ruling on the abortion pill Mifepristone. Overnight, the Fifth Circuit partially froze that Texas judge's ruling that would have suspended FDA approval of the drug overall. The decision keeps the medication on pharmacy shelves but blocks the drug from being sent to patients through the mail and restricts the generic version.

He did respond to the original judge's ruling as he departed for Ireland this week. He said it was completely out of bounds.But, you know, it is interesting. Ireland -- where we are now -- it's a country that actually had a vote in 2018. It cemented the right to abortion, which was really kind of a shock at the time, really sort of throwing off the weight of the Catholic Church that has so much dominated this island over the last several centuries. And so when President Biden sits down with his counterparts today here in Ireland he will be really talking about a new country that really does share a lot of values with the United States. This is a much more progressive country than Biden's ancestors departed centuries ago. It's a much more progressive country even than when John K. Kennedy visited here in the 1960s. And so, President Biden, when he sits with the Taoiseach and when he sits with the president they'll have a lot to discuss -- really, a lot in common -- as he continues this trip in Ireland, Christine.",

That's the biggest tumble for egg prices since Ronald Reagan was in the White House. Grocery prices, overall, fell for the first time since 2020. Relief at the grocery story -- it's been rare but we saw it.Annual inflation eased to five percent in March, the lowest in nearly two years. But Fed economists now project fallout from the banking crisis could trigger a mild recession later this year and then two years of recovery to follow. All right. Looking at markets around the world right now, Asian markets finished mixed. China's exports rose in March for the first time in six months. Europe is mixed at this hour with a pop there in Paris. On Wall Street, stock index futures barely moving here. I'd call that indecisive for the Dow. But the Nasdaq, as has been the trend, a little bit more optimistic than the other averages.

The Dow snapping a four-day winning streak, reversing earlier optimism on news those consumer prices cooled for a ninth month in a row. Prices for groceries, gasoline, medical care all fell over the month. On the flip side, shelter, airfare, and vehicle insurance all rose.
