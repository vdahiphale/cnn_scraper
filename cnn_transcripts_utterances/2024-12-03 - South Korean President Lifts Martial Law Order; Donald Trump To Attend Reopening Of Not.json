      "sentences": "Good evening. Breaking news to bring you this evening. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has lifted hismartial law order only hours after introducing it and following a tumultuous night in South Korea. People on the streets of Seoul cheered when Yoon made the pre-dawn announcement around two hours ago. Yoon's Cabinet then gathered and voted to end the measure. So the martial law was enacted barely eight hours ago. Yoon is accusing his opponents of sympathizing with North Korea. Parliament, however, immediately blocked the martial law decree. It was a unanimous vote. In other words, even his own party voted against him. Paula Hancocks is with me, having been our South Korea correspondent for more than one or two years, I think is the way we will put that. Paula, let's talk about what happened in the last two hours, and then we can reverse into why it all happened in the first place.",

      "sentences": "Well, Richard, it really has been a remarkable night. What we've heard in the past couple of hoursis after that martial law decree was declared by President Yoon, the Parliament voted against it. You had a unanimous vote against this martial law, and that included some members of President Yoon Suk Yeol's own party, 190 of the 300 lawmakers, they were the only ones that could get there in the middle of the night and were willing to be part of this. And then shortly afterwards, we heard the president himself saying that he was going to lift that martial law decree. So the entire process really only took about six hours from when he decided that there would be martial law to when he acknowledged that he was going to lift that, a remarkable six hours, where I think it is important to say it was positive in the fact that no one was injured because this is a very serious declaration that the president made -- Richard.",

So what it appears, it is on the face of it because there may be more to this than we know at this point. We would like to hear obviously, again from President Yoon, but on the face of it, it appears as though he took this decision to solve a political problem. It appears, and many experts are agreeing with this at this point, that this was a political calculation or I should say, a political miscalculation, because there will be a huge backlash. There has been a backlash against this. But for the information that we have at this point, that appears to be what it was.",

Foreign leaders all try to position themselves as the Trump whisperer, the person who gets least damaged by the president-elect's foreign policies, the extreme nature of them.

Every equation for him is a win and a loss, as you say, it is a negotiation and as the strongest partner in most of these dynamics, Trump believes that the United States should make its demands. Notice, he didn't go to Trudeau and say, look I've got a problem. There's too much fentanyl coming over the border. There are too many undocumented migrants. He said, unless you do exactly what I say, we are going to damage you and we are going to damage the Canadian economy.

So he may well have to go further.One thing, however, with Trump is, if you look at his history in the first term, whenever he has had to pay a political price himself on an issue, he has rowed back pretty quickly. So if he were to impose massive tariffs on Canada or whoever, American prices suddenly went up. This is the man that was supposedly elected to get prices down. I think history tells us that Trump is quite concerned about his own political standing. That said, he is a lame duck president. He doesn't have to run again. So perhaps his equation will change a little bit in the second term.

Hama was also the scene of huge anti-Assad regime protests at the start of the revolt against Bashar in 2011. Now the Syrian National News Agency is reporting that Tuesday evening, the government reinforcements have been deployed to the city in anticipation of an assault by the armed opposition. Now, the rebel offensive is spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham formerly known as Jabhat al-Nusra, considered by the US to be a terrorist organization. Meanwhile, the rebels are consolidating their grip over most of Aleppo, Syria's second biggest city. Regime forces largely abandoned the city without much of a fight. The area under the control of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has more than doubled in less than a week, while the United Nations reports that almost 50,000 people have been displaced as a result of the renewed fighting.

There were some military-to-military communications for all the reasons you just mentioned. South Korea is an incredibly important ally with a very large U.S. military presence and that doesn't even count all the civilians who are tied to that. Now, at least from the U.S. Military perspective, they are still monitoring how this all plays out and they are monitoring just across the border if North Korea decides to take any sort of action to try to take advantage of the situation especially because the South Korean president blamed the North for what he saw as the problems that he says led him to declare martial law. So without a doubt it is still an incredibly sensitive situation, one that could have profound effects on U.S. national security.
