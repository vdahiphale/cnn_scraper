Right now, the focus is in the area of Khan Younis. There are different maps showing it right now, a lot of the footage is showing the destruction inside Khan Younis. Khan Younis is where Yahya Sinwar, the commander, the planner, the executioner of this horrific genocidal plan, that's where he's from. There's no question that we're trying to focus on this top leadership, trying to get to where their bunkers are, most likely in the subterranean arena underneath Khan Younis. Khan Younis is a city of, you know, half a million people, so it's dislocation, it's moving people. When I say moving people, this is about saving their lives. It is not a happy situation. It is horrible. But let's save the lives. Let's get to those horrible, horrific people that need to be arrested or killed so that we can finish this and get to the hostages.

We're willing to negotiate. That's a different situation. What they're saying right now, we have no problem. Keep on going. They are sacrificing their own people in that sense because they surround themselves by them. And in that type of pressure, I say sadly, this does not make me happy in any way, comes out of the military operation. And I'm so open to any suggestion to a different way to remove Hamas from the Gaza Strip -- all of the good people who have good ideas.

She was screaming, 'Stop it already -- I'm going to die anyway from what you were doing. Just kill me!\" When they finished, they were laughing and the last one shot her in the head.

A former speaker does not necessarily want to be, you know, just a rank- and-file member of Congress. So, very -- not many people are surprised by that. Certainly, we've been getting indications of that for weeks to come. But what it does show, there are so many retirements in the U.S. Congress. It really will change the shape of Congress next year, but he is staying in through the entirety of his term, so all next year. The reason he's doing it now is the filing deadline for people who are running for his seat is at the end of this week in California. That's why he's making his announcement. But look, it just marks another moment in the Trump era, and it shows that Trump loyalists are not necessarily rewarded. That certainly is true in his case.
