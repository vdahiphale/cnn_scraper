      "sentences": "Yeah. Phil, Brian led into this perfectly, while public officials are now calling this an accident, some engineers are indeed suggesting it may have been an accident almost 50 years in the making for two key reasons.First, the size of the ship. Much of our coverage has noted that the Dali is longer than three football fields and carries tens of thousands of tons of weight. But such monster ships are a product of just the last couple of decades. When the Key Bridge was built in 1977, opened up then big cargo ships were generally only big enough to handle up to 2,500 shipping containers each, about 20 feet long. Then, as worldwide trade blossomed, and electronics appliances, furniture, cars, and other consumer items, the size of cargo ships exploded bigger, much more powerful, heavier. Today, some can carry ten times, as much as they used to carry. The Dali fits somewhere in the middle here toward the higher end. And some engineers believe dozens, maybe hundreds of bridges under which these ships pass all over the country have not been kept up with that technology. Well, many believed these safety experts that were talking about, say there should be fenders of some sort, protective barriers of concrete or steel like what you see over here around this something that will deflect or fuse the impact on structures like Key Bridge. Now whether or not they would actually stop things here if they came in, if there were a bigger protection down around here around the bottom, that's a question. As we noted, Secretary Buttigieg says he doesn't think that any bridge could have withstood this correct impact. I'm sure, Phil, you're going to ask him about that in a few minutes. But the bottom line is that's what a big rallying cry is right now to say, maybe this bridge could have withstood this impact, but it didn't really have a chance.",

That's number one. Number two, in the meantime, make sure that the traffic impacts can be dealt with. Number three, get that poured back open. And, number four, in the meantime, make sure that the supply chain impacts can be dealt with. And we've got work underway on all of those. Just moments ago, we received an emergency relief -- a funding request from the state of Maryland. That's the first step that makes it possible for us to get federal funds to help them in their rebuilding efforts. Also, this afternoon, our federal highways team is working with them to start looking at design and procurement. Meanwhile, on the port front, that's really the most acute short-term concern, especially for the workers who are impacted about $2 million a day in wages depend on the work that goes on in that port. And while it is not the largest container port in the U.S., it is the busiest of vehicle court. And getting cargos diverted to other ports up and down the eastern seaboard will be possible, but it will not be simple.

In our travels, one of the things we have noticed dramatically is that Joe Biden has a enthusiasm problem among African-Americans. You know, Barack Obama had historic Black turnout in 2008 actually, dropped a little bit in 2012, but there's no question he can help with Black Americans and the Democratic base who are disillusioned. Some of its personal to Biden, some of it just were exhausted from COVID and then came inflation. We don't see Washington doing anything that helps us. So I agree with the all hands on deck.

Some swimming into the ocean to recover aid dropped from the sky, a method of distributing life- saving aid that is neither safe nor effective, but one of the only ways for the world to help the starving people of Gaza as Israel continues to block some of the land crossings.CNN's Jomana Karadsheh brings us this report. First, we must want our viewers what you're about to see is very important. It's also very hard to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As they spot a plane and the aid begins to drop, they run as fast as they can. It's the rush of people so desperate, so hungry, but would do anything to feed their children now on the brink of starvation. This is what survival in Gaza has come to, fighting for food. That little bit of aid that makes it into the north where man-made famine now looms. People chase parachutes that fell into these choppy waters. It is desperation that drives them into the sea. What you're about to see next is disturbing. It's the reality of war growing more cruel by the day. The fastest, the fittest emerged with boxes of American issued meals ready to eat. Others didn't make it out alive. People gathered around the thin, frail body of a man who drown trying to reach that aid, 12 people drowned according to paramedics. The parachutes fell into the water, Abu Hamad (ph) says, but people want to eat. They went into the water and drowned. The current was so strong. They didn't know how to swim. It's what you do when you have nothing left to lose. A man goes in swimming to get food for his children. He returns dead, this man says.. Bring us aid through the land crossings. Our children are dying. We are dying. What are you doing? Where is the world? The world has  been piling up life-saving aid into trucks stuck at land crossings, seemingly powerless in the face of Israel that's accused of using starvation as a weapon in this war, a charge it denies. Forcing some the international community to resort to dropping aid from the sky. Several countries carried out aid drops on this day, deliveries that have been criticized for being ineffective, insufficient, and unsafe. Earlier this month, another airdrop disaster when a parachute failed in aid packages came crashing down, killing at least five people. It's a war that's testing humanity, and many say this is what failure looks like. Jomana Karadsheh, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
