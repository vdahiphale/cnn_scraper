Tonight, on LAURA COATES LIVE.Thankfully, a sigh of absolute relief, at least for one family, and of course, this nation. An American mother and her daughter from Chicago, Judith Tai Raanan and Natalie Raanan, who were just visiting family in Israel when they were taken by Hamas, pictured here after their release in a photo from the Israeli government. Now, President Joe Biden actually spoke with them and promised the full support of the United States government as they will recover from their ordeal. The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem releasing a photo late tonight. None of them, the president nor either of them, can really contain the smile that they have at what is really an extraordinary moment. And as we wait for them to touch down and come back to the United States, there is that bittersweet feeling that is gnawing at all of us because there are more hostages. So why do they decide to only release these two? Thankfully they did. But why them and why now? A source tells CNN it was on, quote, unquote, \"humanitarian grounds,\" but what exactly does that mean? And can their experience be a kind of a roadmap to rescue the others?

The Israeli Prime Minister's office said that in a statement tonight confirming that Judith and Natalie had been released. But Laura, I mean, as you well know, there are about 200, we believe, hostages who are still in the custody, still been captured by Hamas and are inside Gaza tonight.

They have said it's for humanitarian grounds because of the mother's health. What does that say to you about this decision to release them? P.J. CROWLEY, FORMER U.S. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS: Well, hostages from Hamas's standpoint are valuable as long as they're alive and good health and can be bargained for something of interest to Hamas, prisoners, conditions on the ground, et cetera. So it was not in Hamas's interest to see an American hostage die in captivity. This indicates that they are prepared to deal, you know, through Qatar.

They're going to be all kinds of things that they won't know and in some cases they may even lead the intelligence analysts astray just because they may risk -- misremember something.But it's still worthwhile because they will have had firsthand experience. They might give a telltale clue about a location. They might be able to say, hey, you know, when we passed a certain point, I don't know where it was, but I heard this particular sound and that then can be correlated to perhaps a landmark or some other situation, you know, where they can say, OK, this is here, this is where these people were, and they may still be there, they may not.

This tells me something about what they're trying to signal to the world. It does not, it's not lost on me. I'm sure it's not to you all. First, you had a release of a hostage video of a French-Israeli citizen. Now you've got the release of two Americans. Does that strike you as telling? CROWLEY: Absolutely. I mean, this is a complex crisis. There are ultimately military dimensions to this, political dimensions to this. Public opinion is going to be critical, not just in terms of who's perceived as the villain, who's perceived as the hero, but what will be the condition both during the conflict as we continue to see it unfold.
