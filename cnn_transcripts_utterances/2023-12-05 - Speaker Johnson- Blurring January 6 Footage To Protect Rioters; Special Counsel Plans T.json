The Justice Department saying that the fact that Trump continues to celebrate and support the insurrectionists shows that his intent was indeed to commit federal crimes.

The Department of Justice already has access to all the footage from January 6th, 2021, unquote.Today, more than 1,200 people have been charged for their actions on January 6, and more than half have either pleaded guilty or been found guilty at trial.

Donald Trump's team is going to say, no, he was merely exercising his rightful, lawful ability to contest the election. Well, here we have hundreds of rioters, people who've been charged and convicted, and in many instances by their own guilty plea, who were on videotape committing crimes.

How might this potentially bolster the prosecution's case, do you think? REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA): Well, I will leave it to prosecutors to discuss the rules of evidence. But the former president has made it clear that he stands with a law violators. He stands with the rioters. He intended the riot to occur to keep him in power.

If this, if the FBI did this, which again not on CNN but on other networks, you still see this surviving constantly, this theory that there is the FBI thing, wouldn't you want everybody's face known? And, by the way, if you're a rioter, if you are an insurrectionist, the second you cross that police line, actually the second you get to Washington, D.C., you know that you are on camera. When you broke the law by occupying the Capitol and trying to stop the certification, there's not a single person in there that would've assumed their right to privacy would've cover their face when they were doing that kind of damage. They knew darn well what they were doing. And if you look at the videos, many of them, if not all them, and we're proud of what they were doing.

Southern Gaza is the area where thousands of the displaced Palestinian civilians are already taking refuge. So, of course, Hamas is seeking their own safety by fleeing into the grounds of these innocent civilians, using their bodies to shield them from Israel's retaliation.And as CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports, some Gazans say the only option left for them is to accept death.
