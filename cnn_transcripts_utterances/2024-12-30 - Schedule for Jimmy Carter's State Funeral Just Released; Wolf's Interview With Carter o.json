There will then be services in the Georgia state. And the Carter Center, of course, his diplomacy hub that he opened for his post presidency period.Then he will be lying in state at the Capitol Rotunda here in Washington, D.C., from January 7th to January 9th, before that state funeral on January 9th with all of the pomp and circumstance afforded to leaders of his stature. President Joe Biden will be among those eulogizing the 39th president. The two had a very close relationship that spanned several decades. Biden joined the Senate just as Carter then serving as the governor of Georgia, was seeking the presidency. And the two often campaigned with and counseled each other during that time with Biden reportedly a fixture around the White House during Carter's single term. Early in Biden's term commemorating the 100th day in office, Biden paid a visit to the Carters in Plains, Georgia, at that time telling reporters it was great to see President Carter. He reminded me that I was the first person to endorse him outside of Georgia. We sat and talked about the old days. Now, just this October, Biden releasing a video commemorating the 100th birthday of President Carter, who, at the time, was still receiving hospice care. In that video, Biden called him a moral force for our nation and the world, and also called him a beloved friend. And then this Sunday, stepping out from a family vacation in St. Croix in the Virgin Islands, Biden delivered public remarks after learning of the passing of his longtime friend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  When I endorsed him for president, I told him why I was endorsing him. And that it was not only his policies, but his character, his decency, the honor he communicates to everyone. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But to the folks here in this community, he was a neighbor. You know, a few years ago before he got ill, he was regularly walking around Downtown Plains or seen teaching Sunday school at the Maranatha Baptist Church. That church tonight held a vigil, as we see community members coming together and reflecting on his life and legacy. And, Wolf, I'll leave you with this. This is a very conservative part of Georgia. As we were driving up to Plains, we saw Trump signs in many of the lawns. But we spoke to a woman today. She said she is a Republican, but she loved Mr. Jimmy. That is what they call him here in Plains. And so the love and the respect for him really transcended politics. That is how people are remembering him here. Wolf?",

And in the State Department, he opened up a human rights office.But what did that mean in a real way? It put pressure on the Soviet Union. Jimmy Carter helped win the Cold War not only because he increased defense spending, but he looked at the Kremlin and said, why don't you have human rights? Why aren't people allowed to go to church or synagogue? Why are Bibles banned? Why is jazz albums not there? And looked at the abuses of starting with the Helsinki Accords of Gerald Ford and Carter carrying it on. So, wherever you go around the world and when you're dealing with Carter's funeral, he's seen not only a humanitarian but a human rights advocate and helped put that term into our parlance.",

Israel and Egypt have kept to the terms of that peace treaty. Even over the last year- and-a-half of the Gaza war, you have seen that not, you know, been stressed, but not break. And that's a very important thing given Egypt's geographic location right on the border with Gaza as well as Israel.

He was the darkest of dark horses when he won the 1976 nomination over what I believe was the biggest field of Democratic candidates ever. And his victory in November over Gerald Ford was kind of the last hurrah for the traditional Democratic New Deal coalition that dominated American politics from FDR in '32 to LBJ in '68.Carter knit together just enough of that, holding enough of the southern conservative whites who were already moving toward the Republican Party as well as a northern ethnics to beat Ford. But once in office, he really could not hold that coalition together. He was kind of whipsawed between conservative southern Democrats in the House and Senate who resisted a number of his legislative achievements, and then ultimately in 1980, a rebellion on the left that led to a primary challenge from Teddy Kennedy. And while all of this was going on, and the foreign policy that Doug and Susan were talking about, you had the neoconservatives, like Jean Kirkpatrick and Irving Kristol, leave the Democratic Party. So, in many ways, you know, the Dean Atchison memoirs were present at the creation, Carter was in some ways, I think, present at the destruction of the traditional Democratic coalition and his inability to win reelection really underscored the centrifugal pressures that were just tearing apart that coalition. He ends up being the one Democrat who could win the White House between 1968 and 1992 but could not sustain that coalition enough to win a second term.",

It's back to the matter is he may have lost in 1980 to Reagan, but the world approved of Jimmy Carter. Hence the Panama Canal treaty that Carter did. Carter's ex- president could go there in 1989 and say that General Noriega ran a fraudulent election and the people of Panama trusted Carter because of the canal.[18:10:05] Carter did free and fair election monitoring in China, and the Chinese respected him, mourning him as we speak because he was the one who recognized the People's Republic of China, not Henry Kissinger and Nixon, as a lot of people presuppose. If Carter didn't do the Alaska lands, saving all this wilderness and lands, by doing that, it gave him a global credential to talk about climate change as ex-president. It goes on and on like that. And so what we're looking at, Wolf, is a great American life with all these different decades and faces in it, but the principle of it is his Christianity, his moral vision, but never forget his tenacity and his steeliness and his stubbornness.

I mean, you know, we were after Vietnam and all the revelations about CIA misdeeds in the 70s, we were the arrogant superpower. And Carter believed we had to earn our respect around the world, not demand it. Trump is really at the opposite end of that spectrum as well. I mean, he views international relations as a zero sum game and that you get what you want by leveraging your power to threaten other people and to try to coerce them rather than convince them into doing what you want. And isn't it like a perfect bookend between Carter and Trump that Carter was the one who signed the treaty to revert the Panama Canal, the control of Panama, as Doug noted?

The gear wasn't down and that's another thing we don't know. The reason why the plane landed heavy along very far down the runway and ran off the end of the runway and into the wall or the beam, as it was, that was holding the navigation instrumentation. Wolf, what we know now, and what I know your guests next, they're going to be talking about is why was the pilot unable to land with not lowering the landing gear? What was it after the bird strike that was so imperative to get the plane on the ground immediately? And then secondary to that, what's becoming clear is that this might have been entirely survivable for those on board. Because if you look at the way the plane touched down, it was textbook in terms of its -- the wings were level, the way it was being managed, but for that concrete beam holding the instrument lights and the instrumentation right at the end of the runway. It was when the -- Wolf, it was when the plane hit that, that it exploded, and at that point, the casualties and the fatalities occurred.",

So, when they made that turn to come back around, they had increased their speed by twice that amount. They lost the headwind and they gained the tailwind, so they gained 30 knots almost immediately as soon as they turned around. And now that aircraft is coming back much faster than when they were going to the north.So, a couple of things on the landing gear, I think the first thing is it may have been that they anticipated a lack of power due to the fact that one of the engines was out. In that case, they would leave the landing gear up and plan to land without it, so that it gets a little bit more range, assure they get back to the airport. So, that's one option. The other option is, of course, a mechanical failure of some kind. But then that third option is that they just were so overwhelmed with trying to get turned around that they didn't have time to lower the landing gear. So, I think those are the three things that they were facing at that time.",

Are birds really capable of causing one of the world's most devastating aviation disasters like this one? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST:  Well Wolf, I mean we saw one that nearly happened about, what, 14 years ago and the Hudson River, when an Airbus A320 leaving LaGuardia lost both engines and Captain Sully Sullenberger put it in the Hudson, that could have very easily been the scenario we just saw. I would suggest to you, Wolf, that that was a very purposeful decision on the part of the crew to keep the aircraft clean, as we call it in aviation, meaning no flaps and no gear, in order to extend the glide range -- didn't have any power at all. They might have lost one engine and then either progressively a second engine failed or something else happened that made them essentially a glider. And so the decision to fly around to the opposite direction of the runway and keep the aircraft from having flaps and landing gear was a sound one. What perhaps they did not account for is that when you land that way, there's something we call ground effect. It's kind of the tantamount to a hovercraft effect as it gets closer to the surface, becomes harder and harder for the aircraft to get down on the ground. It gets more lift. And so they floated down that runway with a lot of speed, which was intended, I think, and ended up hitting the pavement much later than they anticipated. And, of course, then there was that barrier, which is not a safe thing and would not be recommended at any airport. So, I think that's my current theory. There's a lot to unfold. The cockpit voice recorder will tell a lot.",

There was almost no activity that he didn't excel in, and he was a great music lover, from classical music to country and western. In fact, we use that as part of the campaign with the Allman Brothers, with Bob Dylan, with Willie Nelson. They were very important to him.
