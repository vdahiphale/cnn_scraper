Let's bring in CNN Senior International Correspondent, Sam Kiley. He's following this breaking story from Ukraine. Also with us, CNN Anchor and CNN Chief National Security Correspondent, Jim Sciutto. Also CNN Senior White House Correspondent, Phil Mattingly, who's traveling with President Biden in Asia and we have CNN Military Analyst and retired Air Force, Col. Cedric Leighton.Sam, I want to start with you. You're on the ground in Ukraine, what have you been able to learn about this?",

      "sentences": "Well, just as we were coming to air there, I don't know if you notice, but the lights went out here in Kryvyi Rih and that is because we are now a city that is joining 7 million other people around the Ukrainian nation who've been cut off from the electrical supply by this massive bombardment of cruise and other missiles fired by Russia against Ukraine.Now, we know that whilst this has been going on, two projectiles have landed inside Polish territory, causing a considerable devastation on a farm killing two people in or near that location. We understand it's about five kilometers from the Ukrainian border, so inevitably, the speculation will be and this will be what the Polish Security Council is meeting to discuss it them. They'll have their experts already on the ground assessing how or rather what these missiles were and where they came from. And then also NATO's had aircraft in the air, monitoring the airspace over Poland, a NATO country. So that information as to whether who's fired these missiles and how did these missiles or these projectiles end up in Poland, killing people. Now, that is critical, because if they were to assess, for example, that these missiles were fired deliberately against Poland, that would be an act of war that would trigger Article Five of the NATO convention. That would be the one for all and all for one Convention, which means that the other member states of NATO would be committed to whatever Poland would want to do in recompense against whoever fired that missile, the assumption would be Russia. I think that is the doomsday most unlikely scenario, based on what I've seen here, many, many missile interception, sadly, over the - many months I've been covering the war here. The likelihood is that this is the remains of a missile that's been shot down by Ukraine. It doesn't necessarily mean that the Russians will get off on this is a mere accident, because this is a missile that if it landed five kilometers inside Ukrainian territory was very, very close, arguably even already inside Polish territory, if, indeed it was shot down. So this is the areas of speculation and investigation that the experts will be getting into. But just as this has all unfolded, we've already heard from Lithuania, Estonia, two Baltic nations very, very anxious indeed, about this kind of a scenario, reinforcing their commitment right off the bat, ahead of any kind of conclusion reached by the polls, that they are fully committed to the one for all and all for one Article Five convention within NATO. So this is a moment of extreme international tension, not one, frankly, that people who've been involved in this war feel is particularly unexpected, but one that is going to send shockwaves around the world - right around the world from China to Washington as people try to figure out what happens next.",

So if this were, as Sam was laying out. If this were the scenario that a Russian missile was lobbed, Ukraine shot at down projectiles or shrapnel from that came down in Poland and killed two people, then what is the response from Poland?COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, that presents a few problems, doesn't it, Alisyn? And that is probably a likely scenario at this point. What would happen, I think (inaudible) of course, would express a great regret at this situation if they were actually shooting down these missiles. If the missiles were shot down and they were Russian missiles without any interference, if you will, from a Ukrainian Air Defense, then, of course, that's a completely different issue. So the Poles and the Ukrainians would work something out if it were the first scenario. If it's the second scenario, then I think the Poles would - at the very least use diplomatic efforts to go after the Russians and it could potentially escalate into something where NATO develops a coherent response, whether that's a military or an economic or diplomatic response. Of course, it's another issue, but I suspect what we're seeing here is we're going to stay in the lane of the diplomatic and to the economic, at least, for now.",

Lviv is not very far from the Polish border.I think what is also troubling about this statement is that it has come out very, very quickly and it means that the Russians have claimed very long way up the tree of denial. A denial that is going to be very difficult for them to reverse, but it could well be that this is some other kind of military accident. As Jim was absolutely right to point out, we don't know even the much more than the barest facts, which is that two projectiles have landed inside Polish territory, a NATO member, killing two Poles on a farm not very far from the border.

Let me come to you, Colonel, on this what we're learning from this short statement from the Russian Defense Ministry, where they say that there was this deliberate provocation in order to escalate the situation. Frankly, Colonel, that is what we've heard from the Russians at every turn of this invasion. They called the atrocities in Bucha and in Mariupol, and, frankly, the hits on residential buildings and schools and hospitals, they blame those on others when it is clear that the Russians have been responsible for those.So that the line of this is a deliberate provocation is undermined by everything we've seen throughout this invasion over the last eight months.",

The fact of the matter is, as Sam pointed out, it's very clear that the Russians were attacking targets in western Ukraine. They were attacking targets near Lviv, which is not too far from this Polish village that was hit.And it's very clear also that they've attacked these areas before, so it's highly likely that this Russian missile - that this missile is a Russian missile, first of all. And that secondly that - either it hit a target that it may not have intended to hit or that it was shot down by Ukrainian Air Defense or something happened to it in mid flight. But a regardless of what happened, the Russians are clearly responsible for this kind of an attack and they were responsible for this missile being launched in the first place. There's no other source where that missile would have come from. There's no logic to the idea that say Ukraine would have done something like this way or whether the Poles would have done to themselves. So those things would be discarded right away in terms of any investigation of this from an intelligence perspective.",

So those 31 votes he didn't get it really shows you just how much work Kevin McCarthy has to do between now and then. A member of the Freedom Caucus, Andy Biggs, running against him.But again, he is poised to be the Speaker of the House should the Republicans take control, but he is going to have to do some cobbling together to get to that 218 and make some deals. It was - he was always expected to have to do deals with the House Freedom Caucus. But with this margin, likely to be so small, it really makes it all the harder he's going to need the support from nearly every person he can get to get where he wants to go in terms of being Speaker of the House. And I'd also like to take us back to the Senate for one second. I just came over from their policy lunch. They normally meet both parties on Tuesdays. Normally they'd been over by - for hours now. This is the Republican policy lunch is now stretching into its second hour. It's going on much longer than it normally does. Sen. Kevin Cramer telling CNN that it's largely about whether or not to delay the vote on their leadership, which is slated to take place tomorrow. And my colleague, Manu Raju, reporting that Florida senator, Rick Scott, has decided to challenge Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. It's really more of a protest that he's doing. That's still a long shot that Scott would beat McConnell, but it is the first real challenger that he's ever had as GOP leader and it really underscores that as we stand here today, a week after these elections that Republicans both on the House and the Senate are simply not where they thought they would be. They thought they would be in much different positions. There's a lot of blame to go around. And there is a lot of back and forth over what the way forward should be. So it remains to be seen if they will decide to delay those elections tomorrow for the Senate or if they will keep that on task and go forward with it on Wednesday, Victor and Alisyn. We'll, of course, keep our eye on that. We're expecting to hear from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other members of leadership soon.",

Nia, let me start with you. And the reporting from Jessica Dean that Mitch McConnell will have a challenge, symbolic, because it doesn't look like at this point that Rick Scott has enough votes to actually win the minority leader role, but what do you make of that news? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER: Listen, before the midterm results came in for the Senate. You had Rick Scott and Mitch McConnell trying to figure out who's going to get the most credit for the Senate going back over to Republican hands, right. That was the discussion going on between their two camps. And now you got disarray in some ways in terms of the Republican Party, in terms of what happened not only in the House, but the Senate as well. And so I think in Rick Scott, you have someone who has designs on running for the White House in 2024. He very much wants to use his position in the Senate. And as the leader of the reelection campaign for Senators and the attempts to capture the Senate, he wanted to use that as a springboard to run for president and now that plan looks like it's in shambles. But I think he still wants to establish himself as sort of the anti- Mitch McConnell, anti-establishment. We'll see where this goes likely up in flames. He's not someone who's very well liked by the Republican conference there in the Senate. And certainly, I think people have much more confidence in Mitch McConnell, because Mitch McConnell didn't like all of the Trump candidates, right? He's sort of grudgingly backed those people whereas Rick Scott was very much all in on those candidates, but messy, messy, messy over on the Senate side as far as Republicans are concerned.",
