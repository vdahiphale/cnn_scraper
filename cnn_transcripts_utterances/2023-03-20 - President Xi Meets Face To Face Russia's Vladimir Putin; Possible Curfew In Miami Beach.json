And just days after the Kremlin strong man was indicted for war crimes. Now, one of the world's most isolated leaders gets to sit at the side of one of its most powerful. It's a potent alliance. XI JINPING, PRESIDENT OF CHINA (through translation):  It is true that both of our countries share the same or similar goals. We have exerted efforts for the prosperity of our respective countries. We can cooperate and work together to achieve our goals. CHANCE (voice-over):  But China has so far drawn the line at military aid for Russia's war. There are concerns that may change, but right now it's only Chinese diplomacy on the table. The Kremlin-leaning peace plan calling for talks but stopping short of demanding a Russian withdrawal, a key Ukrainian demand. VLADIMIR PUTIN, PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA (through translation):  We have carefully studied your proposals on settling the acute crises in Ukraine. Of course, we will have an opportunity to discuss these issues. CHANCE (voice-over):  But there's little sign Putin is open to compromise. This was the Russian leader on Sunday, driving through the captured and devastated city of Mariupol. Local residents, according to state media, are shown thanking him and asking to shake hands when a heckler briefly makes her voice heard. None of this is true is the cry. It's all for show. But the Russian leader seems undisturbed. And now with one of the world's most powerful leaders at his side in Moscow, President Putin may increasingly feel he can afford to ignore his critics. (END VIDEOTAPE) (On Camera):  But Jake, for tonight, the meetings have already come to an end and the leaders, the two of them, are scheduled to hold more formal talks tomorrow on how to bring these two increasingly autocratic countries even closer together and of course, to discuss that Chinese-backed floated peace proposal. As for Ukraine, they still haven't had a phone call from Xi Jinping about what their role would be in any future negotiations, although I'm told that could change in the days ahead.",

But U.S. officials, certainly White House officials and the National Security Council closely watching every moment for what this relationship will go towards next.And I think we talked to White House officials. They acknowledge the Chinese and Russian officials have certainly gotten closer. The ties between the two countries have grown significantly closer over the last several months and years, but they also believe that this relationship in the words of National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, that is one based on convenience, not necessarily affection. And the biggest question as Matthew laid out, is whether or not the Chinese are still considering or pushing the idea of providing lethal assistance. This was how Kirby framed things today.

So, the peace plan that China has put on the table is kind of dead-on arrival as it sits.
