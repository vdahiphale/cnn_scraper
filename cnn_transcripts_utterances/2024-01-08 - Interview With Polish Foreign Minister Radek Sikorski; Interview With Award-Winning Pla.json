FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Ukraine says Russia has stepped up attacks both on the ground and in the air in the past weeks, killing nearly 120 civilians and wounding almost 500 more since December 29th, according to the U.S. The U.S. claims Russia has even used missiles procured from North Korea to attack Kharkiv in Northeastern Ukraine. Moscow hasn't commented so far, and Ukrainian authorities investigating the wreckage say they haven't yet come to a final conclusion about the missile's origin. Most likely, this missile was either supplied by North Korea or was produced recently using blueprints and technology supplied by Russia to third countries or to North Korea, this official says. Russian President Vladimir Putin celebrating Orthodox Christmas as he escalates his assault against Ukraine. Meeting with families of Russian soldiers killed on the battlefield, and vowing to support the loved ones of all those he sends to the war zone. You know that many of our men, our courageous, heroic guys, Russian warriors, even now, on this holiday, defend the interests of our country with arms in hand, he says.

We rallied around the U.S. Poland sent a brigade to Iraq, a brigade to Afghanistan, and now, we are holding off an aggressive dictator who is bent on recreating a European empire, a concept whose time has passed. And Ukraine is the internationally recognized victim, recognized by the U.N. General Assembly. And the consequences of Putin conquering Ukraine would be catastrophic. First of all, of course, for Ukraine, but also for her neighbors, for Europe, and for the whole system of American alliances. President Biden has been to Kyiv. The United States is present now militarily in Poland. The Ukrainians need to be given the tools to do the job, and they're doing the job extremely well. For a few percent of an annual U.S. defense budget, they've already destroyed half the Russian army. The cost of deterring Putin after he conquers Ukraine would be much, much higher than the cost of keeping the Ukrainians supplied now. So, I urge U.S. lawmakers to pass the law that would enable them to defend themselves.",

And actually Poland, if you count the cost of helping Ukrainian refugees, Poland is number one in contributions on a per capita basis in proportion to GDP. And even without that, we are number three or five. So, a lot is being done by Europe.

And there are hostile troops 250 kilometers from where I'm speaking to you, in Belarus, which has almost been swollen up by Russia, certainly in the middle military field. What's at stake in Ukraine is the principle of not changing borders by force, but it's also the credibility of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and of the United States too. And it can be done to bolster Ukraine, to bolster the morale of the West and of the forces of democracy and of constitutionality. This can be done at a very small cost, relatively speaking. And remember, there's also the practical element. We are testing the weapons that are being used to defend Ukrainian cities, for example, the algorithms of Patriot missiles. And your equipment is actually proving to be much more effective than the Russian equipment. And I'm told $90 billion of new defense contracts have already been placed in the United States since the start of this war.

So, with South Carolina's first in the nation Democratic primary coming up on February 3rd, Candidate Biden is counting on a strong show of support from black voters amidst warning signs that support may be slipping.

And it has reallybecome a sacred civic space because of the massacre that occurred there, and what a reckoning that was. It was in -- I think, a relatively renewal of an old idea that we've debated in the United States, often with violence, unfortunately, which is the resistance that exists to a multiracial democracy that characterized the run up to the Civil War, certainly, but especially reconstruction and the violence around overturning Jim Crow. And we saw it at Mother Emanuel that day, and we see it in more benign and politicized forms to this day. And I think that's what Joe Biden -- President Biden was speaking to. In many ways, it's a companion to a speech at Valley Forge just a few days ago, kicking off his campaign where he said this is about defending democracy. I think this puts a finer point on it. One of the great obstacles to the fulfillment of democracy's ideal in the United States is white supremacy, is white nationalism, is, in some cases, Christian nationalism when it is combined with a racial animus as we've seen too many times. And sometimes you've got to listen carefully to hear those strains. But if you know your history, if you're willing to confront it clearly, then all becomes more evident.",

And I think that's something that we're still getting our hands on around. You know, I think the days of gatekeepers and Walter Cronkite saying that's the way it is are long gone, but that's exactly why I think we need to strengthen guardrails around our democracy, guardrails around democratic norms. We need to call out lies for what they are as we simultaneously recognize that Trump and the drift towards hyper partisan media and maybe a fragmentation via social media has been successful in selling outright lies to people who are susceptible to that kind of confirmation bias. We see new polls every day, Christiane, in the last several days, you know, that a third of Republicans believe January 6th was an inside job, That's a lie. That the President Biden was not legitimately elected, that's a lie. And leading Republicans acting as handmaidens to Donald Trump and supporting his campaign before a single Republican has voted, despite the fact that they know that Donald Trump lies about those things and so many others. As Donald Trump was said -- to have said when the House Whip Tom Emmer came around to endorsing him after Trump had scuttled his own bid to become speaker of the house, they always take the knee. And so, I think that's a corruption within the Republican Party in particular that they need to confront. But we need to shine a light on the hypocrisy that exists between what so many of those politicians say in public and what they say in private. This is a dangerous moment for democracy.

You know, there are persuadable voters, Republicans, who are persuadable, independents, obviously, by definition, persuadable and even disaffected Democrats. You're not going to reach the hardcore third of Republicans who will support Donald Trump no matter what. But the messaging has been lacking. I wrote a column about this for CNN just into the new year about, are you better off than you were three years ago? Think about where America was three years ago, January 2021, reeling from January 6th, COVID death toll in the United States at its highest level, the economy in shambles. America's in far better shape. But the Biden team has not been sufficient in terms offering soundbites and statistics that are sticky to help his -- help just make that stick. And Donald Trump is a very effective communicator through repetition. He's a hype man. He's a marketer.

It is -- I mean, I'm not minimizing the sort of scariness of anger directed at Jews anywhere at any time can feel like it will boil over very easily into antisemitism, because antisemitism is such a pervasive theme in western consciousness. But I think with -- you know, with goodwill and discernment and using your faculties of reason rather than emotion, it's easy to understand where the anger comes from, and easy to also see where our real enemies are. I mean, the spectacle of Elise Stefanik, who supports Donald Trump wholeheartedly, which means that she supports the replacement theory, which is just fundamentally an antisemitic theory, getting up and yelling at the presidents of these three schools about their weakness on antisemitism is ridiculous.",

I have said many, many times that when I came out of the closet as a gay man, the model that I used for claiming this identity that had been -- that was being sort of, you know, disparaged and rejected and despised by the majority was the model that my parents had given me as a Jew, that, you know, if they don't like you, it's their problem, it's not you, it's them, you know, they need to change, you don't need to change, you need to be who you are, and I think it was an important lesson to learn. I mean, I -- you know, I also grew up during a time of busing and integration and what is now called social engineering that even Richard Nixon sort of went along with. And so, my high school was integrated and that taught me a lot about, when a society makes a decision to really go after a great social evil like racism in the Deep South, astonishing change can happen. And I watched it happen in my high school and it -- you know, that changed my life. I mean, I saw my cousins in New York all went to segregated high schools. I went to a high school that was 50 percent black and 50 percent white.
