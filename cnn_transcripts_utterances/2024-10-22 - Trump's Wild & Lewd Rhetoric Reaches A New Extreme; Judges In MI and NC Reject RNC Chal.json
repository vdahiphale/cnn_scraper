Is Trump just being bombastic. Is that just baked in? Is there a point for the basis of political analysis as we're looking for things that may actually sway voters and critically examining his current rhetoric. JOE WALSH, (R), FORMER CONGRESSMAN FOR ILLINOIS: Brianna, good to be with you. Look, he's trying to scare the hell out of the American people. I think that's what he's doing. And, Brianna, you're right. I used to do some of that. That's still the realm of the coin in right-wing media is to anger their audience and scare their audience and inflame their audience and piss off their audience. Look, Trump's an utterly horrible human being, but he is the product of an utterly broken political system. He's appealing to the very worst of us. He's appealing to our fears, Brianna. I used to do some of that. Fear works. My -- my fear is this appeal of his is going to work.",

He's appealing well beyond his base, to white, black and brown voters who are scared and concerned about immigration and crime and threats with our economy. He thinks that he can win through fear. And he probably can because more Americans are really can scare -- are scared and more concerned about immigration now than they were three to four years ago.

There are -- they are suing over how overseas ballots are vetted. The identification requirements, right? You're not required to provide certain identification but you do have to either provide your social security number or your license. And these RNC lawyers who have filed this lawsuit, they would like some of those ballots pushed aside for further vetting. But again, we go back to the war games. Many people think that this could come down to a handful of votes in Pennsylvania, widely expecting that this could go to the courts.

At the time, G.M. claimed that it couldn't meet the union wage demands and remain competitive. But the company eventually agreed to give workers an immediate 11 percent raise and additional raises in the years to come. I want to discuss with Tony Totty. He's the president of the United Auto Workers Local 14 in toledo, Ohio. Tony, thanks so much for being with us. I remember last year when we spoke during the strike your argument and the slogan for UAW was that record profits should result in a record contract. Are you satisfied now with the deal that UAW made and in light of this new record profits TONY TOTTY, PRESIDENT, UNITED AUTO WORKERS LOCAL 14: Good afternoon, Boris. Good to be with you again. We're very satisfied. And, you know, that's the goal of the union, is to just get our fair share. And these companies were very profitable then.

It's something to watch, especially with the E.V. future, where we are in the biggest transformation in this industry since its inception. And now we got to look to E.V. sales to see if this is sustainable or not. But it looks like 60 percent of the trade ins for these new E.V.s are coming from non-G.M. vehicles.
