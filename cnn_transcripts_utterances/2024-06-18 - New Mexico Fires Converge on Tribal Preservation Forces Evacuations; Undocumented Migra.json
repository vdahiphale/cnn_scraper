Do you think going forward, from what you're hearing from this whistleblower in particular, and from other whistleblowers, that this kind of a behavior is still happening there that is putting the public in peril, that they should be criminally prosecuted at some point?SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):  Key question. There's mounting evidence that Boeing should be prosecuted. And I'm going to withhold judgment until we finish this hearing and the investigation. The Justice Department is now doing its own inquiry. But I do think there's near overwhelming evidence that prosecution is important to sending a message, a deterrent message, and also insisting on accountability. Remember that the company paid comparatively very little in terms of criminal penalty in connection with that deferred prosecution. And the families of people who perished in those two plane crashes, 346 people lost their lives, still feel that justice has not been served, and that feeling is pretty understandable. So I think that there is mounting evidence, perhaps overwhelming evidence now, that prosecution should be pursued.",

The alarming promise the two nuclear powers just made.And then words to live by courtesy of Dr. Anthony Fauci -- don't let the bastards wear you down. His revealing new memoir. Plus, a rare and extremely dangerous heat warning in effect for millions of Americans. Kate is out. I'm 18-time champion Boston Celtics fan John Berman, along with Sara Sidner. And this is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. Very shortly, Russian leader Vladimir Putin is expected to arrive in North Korea for the first time in more than two decades. This rare visit is sparking concern as ties between Putin and North Korea's Kim Jong-un gun appear to be deepening amid the war in Ukraine. The White House has said it is watching to see how the trip effects security conditions in Ukraine. The Kremlin says Putin has a, quote, very eventful agenda over the next two days. Already this morning, the streets of Pyongyang have Russian flags and banners with Putin's face. CNN's Mike Valerio is live in Seoul, South Korea, this morning. Mike, a lot of reasons for the U.S. and the White House to be watching these meetings very closely.",

      "sentences": "That's right, John. I think that could be the understatement of the evening here in Seoul. So, you know, John, we're really waiting to see beyond the bromance, what is the deliverable, what is the ultimate result from this meeting? What's going to happen tomorrow? And among the worst possibilities, and we stress this would be one of the worst possibilities, is both sides say they want to reach a new strategic agreement to replace treaties and agreements that have been signed and have gone out of effect or are no longer in effect for years now.But this is one that was signed, John, July 6th, 1961, between Khrushchev and Kim Il-sung, installed by Stalin, the founder, the first leader of North Korea. And it's a mutual defense treaty. So it says essentially something happens to Korea, Moscow would come to the assist and aid of Pyongyang. That is one of the biggest concerns, if this bromance leads to a mutual defense. But there are more and more minds, John, in North Korea, experts, who are saying there's evidence that may militate against something like that happening. Both countries, though, want a lot from each other. So the laundry list, if we start with North Korea at the top of their list, John, they want more help with their satellite and missile programs. Both experiencing a lot of setbacks in recent days, weeks, and months. They also need food, energy help. They want the, quote- unquote, prestige, of standing with the, quote-unquote, strong leader, from their point of view, like Vladimir Putin. What Putin wants, he needs more ammunition to help prosecute his war against Ukraine. But very interestingly, John, we heard extremely publicly from Vladimir Putin last week thanking South Korea for not sending lethal weapons to help Ukraine. [08:05:07] So there are experts who we've spoken with over the past 24 hours show have said, you know what, because everybody in the government in Seoul here has refrained from helping Ukraine with lethal munitions, Vladimir Putin may step back from a treaty like this. He may step back from mutual defense with North Korea. So the environment that we're talking to you from right now, John, very tense over the morning hours. We had 20 to 30 North Korean troops crossover the median demarcation line. It is the middle of the DMZ between North and South Korea. So South Korea fires warning shots. This is the second time in two weeks that this has happened. There's new construction that North Korea is building very close to its outposts along the DMZ, probably to harden its defenses. But John, it's going to be very interesting to see if this is just bromance and all the pageantry therein, or if there is a new deliverable tomorrow that really raises eyebrows here and Seoul and in Washington D.C., John.",

Thank you so much for being here this morning. This is the first time, as you as you heard mentioned, that Putin has visited North Korea in almost a quarter of a century, 24 years. That in and of itself tells a story. What do you think is so necessary as to why Putin has shown up in-person to meet with Kim Jong-un? JULIE IOFFE, FOUNDING PARTNER AND WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, \"PUCK\": Well, you're very right to point that out. The first 20 years Vladimir Putin spent trying to court the west, and proving to the world and especially to Europe that Russia was a European power, a western power, and wanted to be integrated with the west, to sit at their table, to be part of the G8, et cetera. After the invasion of 2014, after Russia's invasion, again, in 2022, that all changed. And now you see Russia shoring up its kind of old- school vintage Cold War era alliances. A couple of weeks ago Vladimir Putin hosted the St. Petersburg economic forum. He shared the stage with the president of Zimbabwe, the president of Bolivia. Again, all old school Cold War allies. After North Korea, he is heading to Vietnam, again, another Soviet era ally. It's a way to show the west that just because he's been booted from their club doesn't mean he has no allies in the world. Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, 2022, he has been saying that the majority of the world's population, which lives in the global south, is actually on his side, not Americas and NATO's.",

And Russia has been, as far as we know, supplying energy and food to the starved nation of North Korea.The question, as your correspondent said, is whether they go further, but so far is I think it's about returning the favor. Last year, Kim Jong-un visited Russia, he visited just the far east because he doesn't fly. So we took his Stalin era armored train to the far east. Putin received him there. And now this is kind of returning the favor. But we'll see how far the visit goes.",

It is actually quite nice yesterday, quite nice this morning, but all of that, according to meteorologists, is going to change here very soon, essentially the highs will get higher, the overnight lows will get higher and that speaks to the unusual nature of this weather event. Basically, the daytime heat, people won't have a chance to actually break that because it is going to continue to be sweltering into the night, and that is where many of the cities in the northeast, where people are not accustomed to those temperatures will be opening up cooling centers.  For example, here in Burlington, officials telling me that they're going to have about six open. That's everywhere from City Hall, the library, and several other locations as well during the day allowing those people on a walk-in basis to go in and just keep cool, use the restroom, and just try to stay out of their homes because there is about a third of the population of the state that does not regularly have an air conditioning at home because they typically don't need it, and that's why officials are issuing these recommendations, especially for those who live with young people and especially the elderly, to take this seriously and stay cool. They are rolling out also a series of recommendations. Of course, one of them exercise early. We've seen it this morning, John, people on their bikes out, walking their dogs right now while they still can. I am sure, a lot of people are there are going to be in the air conditioning later. Also, drinking plenty of water, especially before you start getting thirsty, not forgetting your pets, not forgetting your children in the vehicle that certainly is also worth recommending. And then finally, checking on the elderly. This is a potentially deadly weather event according to experts for those older people, so it is really important to continue to check in with them throughout the day. And that just today, John. From now until Friday, that's when these cooling centers are going to remain open.",
