Another American first, the convicted former president who is now running to oversee the country again just met with his probation officer. And in just moments, I'll speak with ABC News Anchor and former Clinton White House insider George Stephanopoulos. We'll get some unique insights into what a second Trump term may look like. But, first, a play by play of what Donald Trump said in Las Vegas. Let's set the scene for you. The heat spiraled to 100 degrees, six people were sent to the hospital. Two dozen others were treated at the scene. Call it the heat or Donald Trump feeling hot under the collar, but the content of this rally veered wildly into topic after topic. Now, some that actually might matter to you, the voter, and others that matter to Donald Trump and maybe no one else. So, here is an incomplete sampling of what you heard if you happened to have stood in that rally and sweated through all of it, starting with a joke about voters. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't want anybody going on me. We need every voter. I don't care about you. I just want your vote. I don't care. He's a deranged, dumb guy. He's a dumb son of a bitch. He's a corrupt, very dumb person. He's a low I.Q. individual. There's just something missing, and there always has been. If this guy just, you know, goes to the beach all the time, somebody thinks he looks good in a bathing suit. I don't think so. And he has that little chair that weighs about like seven ounces. It's meant so children can lift it and very old people can lift it. And you know what? He's not old. He's incompetent. It's weak. It's ineffective. It's bullshit what he signed. They're totally destroying our black population. They're totally destroying our Hispanic population. I pay all this money to teleprompter people. And I'd say 20 percent of the time they don't work. I don't pay contractors that do a shitty job, and that's a shitty job. That's a shitty job. You can't read a word. What would happen if the boat sank from its weight, and you're in the boat, and you have this tremendously powerful battery, and the battery's now underwater, and there's a shark that's approximately ten yards over there? By the way, a lot of shark attacks lately. Do you notice that? Those J6 warriors, they were warriors, but they were really more than anything else. They're victims of what happened. All they were doing is protesting a rigged election. That's what they were doing. And then the police say, go in, go in, go in. What a setup that was. What a horrible, horrible thing. And, you know, that blows two ways. If we win Nevada, we win the whole thing. I hope the military revolts at the voting booth and just says, we're not going to take it. He should take a drug test because I'm willing to take one. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And it's one of a few notable examples of how the legal system really bent over backwards for Trump, where it would not have for others. Ten contempt violations normally merit more than just. No bail restrictions for a defendant of his means, also an anomaly. A carefully choreographed search of his home to spare him from having cameras capture agents of the law wearing FBI jackets.

And now, you can add yet another mug shot to the list. On the left, this one is from Georgia last year.

There was Rebecca Lobo, Sue Bird, Sabrina Ioniscu, who almost matched Steph Curry in a three- point shooting contest this past February at the All-Star Game. What is it about Caitlin Clark? It's not just that she's white.Steph Curry stood out from other great black stars in the NBA because he played in a way that was appealing and relatable, shooting from the logo.
