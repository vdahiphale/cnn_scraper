Russian President Vladimir Putin says his military struck Ukraine's Dnipro Region with a new medium-range ballistic missile, part of a long week of escalating during in crisis there in danger. Now that was punctuated by today's closure of the country's parliament in Kyiv over the risk of a Russian missile attack. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says use of the new missile amounts to what he calls a severe escalation in this nearly three-year-old war. And in London, a top U.K. military official offered this warning to Moscow. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So maybe that gets tamped down if they look at his nomination as imminent. But I think there's probably be some pushback within that lobbying faction as it filters its way through the Congress. I'd give that more of a jump ball. I don't -- I don't know the democratic-based side of that equation. But, you know, at the end of the day, Trump is the big dog in town. And I think he's going to get his way with most of the nominees, unless there's real pushback based on concern, based on competence, rather than direction. I mean, he's going to pick the direction right now. And I think his view will hold inordinates way within the Senate nomination and clarification process.",

They'd been traveling backpacking through Asia. Laos was on their stop, was one of their stops. And basically what we understand from the \"Associated Press\" is that these two young women were staying at a hostel, were given free shots of alcohol at the hostel before then moving on to another bar to continue their evening. They then spent 24 hours in their room before being found and taken to hospital in neighboring Thailand. One remained on life support for several days but has just passed. She becomes, Bianna, the sixth victim of what is now believed to be this mass methanol poisoning. Now, methanol is basically something that can be used when making cheap alcohol in place of ethanol. It's very toxic and will lead to organ failure very quickly unless you're taken to a hospital with breathing difficulties initially. So a pretty nasty substance. And there have been outbreaks like this before. Generally, where ethanol is hard to come by, methanol is used in the hope of making this sort of illegal alcohol taint a moonshine, essentially. This is what authorities now believe these travelers drank, although there has been no official cause of death announced. We have heard warnings from several consulates now telling people who might be traveling through Laos or anywhere just to be very careful. Essentially, you can't taste or smell methanol. You would drink it and start having breathing problems several hours later and, of course, it can quickly prove fatal. Six people now known to have died, Bianna, but there are, we understand, several others who may have come into contact with the tainted alcohol and been impacted. So we wait to hear more. But, meanwhile, the consulate is urging extreme caution to anyone traveling in that part of Asia and certainly anyone being handed a drink they don't know the exact provenance of. Bianna.",

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WHOOPI GOLDBERG, CO-FOUNDER, ALL WOMEN'S SPORTS NETWORK: Anybody who's interested in sports, well done, because for some reason, it all seems like it's compartmentalized and sports shouldn't be that. It should be the best sports person out there. So I believe that diehard sports fans will get it and say, okay, let's see who's doing what. And because it's international, we're going to have access to watching things that we wouldn't normally see. I mean, I have no problems with ESPN and all those other groups, you know, but they don't really cover. They don't cover some of the things that people are playing out there. And I want to -- you know, I want to be responsible for bringing back roller derby. I want to be responsible for, you know, opening our eyes to what's going on. And, you know, I've gotten a lot older, I think, in the last little while, and I'm tired of waiting. So I figured out that if you want something, you kind of have to go and try to do it.
