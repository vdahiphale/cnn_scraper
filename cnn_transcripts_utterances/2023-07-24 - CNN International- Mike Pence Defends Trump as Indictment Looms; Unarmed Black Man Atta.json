We'll have more on this story ahead on \"EARLY START.\" And this could be a historic week for former U.S. President Donald Trump who is facing the possibility of a third criminal indictment this year. This time, for trying to overturn the 2020 election. Even Trump himself believes the indictment is coming. The question, really, is when. The third indictment could also be a game-changer in the battle for the Republican presidential nomination. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The center-right People's Party is set to come in first, winning 136 seats in Parliament. But in order to governor, a party or coalition must have at least 176 seats in the 350-seat legislature. And because no single party won enough seats from the government on their own, the tough task of trying to build a coalition must now begin.Journalist Al Goodman is joining me now live from Madid.

But the political horse trading as you mention is beginning right now. Although there is expected to be a bit of a break while the horse trading continues.The Parliament building, which is that building way in the back behind me, that will reconvene in the middle of the August before they can swear in the new members of Parliament. Then the King of Spain, the head of state, will meet with the leaders of each party and hear what they have to say about which candidate should be the candidate for investiture, and then he'll propose a candidate. Now even though the main Conservative Party candidate won and did better for his party than in previous elections, it was his first time standing for a national election, he did not get close to the coveted estimated majority. And his only dance partner in the game -- according to most analysts -- is the far-right Vox Party. So the left is very happy right now that the Vox Party, the far right, has been kept out of Spanish government as it has been for more than 50 years going back to the era of Francisco Franco, the late dictator. The person, according to analysts, who is in the best position, although a difficult position, to get back into power is the existing Spanish Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Because although he came in second, he already has a coalition government with other leftist parties and with nationalist parties in Catalonia, that's the area around Barcelona, and the Basque region, the area around San Sebastian and Bilbao, those parties care much about their regions. I jut talked to a senior member of the Socialist Party who said that Sanchez will have a tougher time getting a coalition this time because the national leaders are going to exact a higher price -- Christina.",

And he talks about the idea, the goal of turning Twitter into this everything app called \"X.\"Sort of in the style of China's WeChat. Wanting to make it a place where users, not only communicate but they can also shop and consume entertainment. And so, in some ways I think this moved to get rid of the Twitter branding and to replace it with X is a service of that vision. It's also in timing. Musk said just last week that Twitter still has negative cash flow because of 50 percent decline in ad revenue. And so, I think this is can also be an effort on his part to continue to try to shift the image of the company in the mind of advertisers as a way of trying to lure them back on the platform.
