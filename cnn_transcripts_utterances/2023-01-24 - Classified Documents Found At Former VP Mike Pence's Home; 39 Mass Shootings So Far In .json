By all accounts, the transition as far as vice President Pence was, was careful, was methodical. They did look at the documents they were taking out.

Right now, they're conducting a review, looking at the facts and deciding if there needs to be further criminal investigation. And based on what we're just discussing, I mean, this right now based on what we know this appears to be inadvertent.And the reason that the case for President Trump and former President Biden has gone to special counsels, they did things that made their situations more complicated. Specifically when it comes to former President Trump, he's under investigation for allegedly trying to obstruct this investigation, the amount of material that he had retained, hundreds of pages versus dozens with President Biden. Also he was moving the documents, which is why Mar-a-Lago was searched. President Biden's team, they were more cooperative, they did the right thing, they reached out, they said they were trying to cooperate. But look, it took them a long time to complete their searchers. They didn't even tell the Justice Department that they were going to search the Wilmington home and weren't fully transparent with the American public when this first came out. So they really kind of backed the attorney general into having to appoint a special counsel. None of those complications are at issue currently with what we know about Pence.

But far, our reporting suggests that the lawyers for Pence only found this one stash of classified documents at his home.So what do you think, Tom, do you think this discovery changes the calculations for the Justice Department at all when it comes to the investigations into Trump and Biden? DUPREE:  You know, I do. I really do think it does, because I think that this latest revelation really was going to send a message to a lot of people out in the American public, that this thing happened all the time, rightly or wrongly. I think that's what many people's perception is going to be. That classified documents for one reason or another make their way out of Washington and into places they shouldn't be. So, I think if you are either of the special counsels currently looking into this, I don't see how you can help but factor in what's going on with Pence. Is it calculus in your determination as to what to recommend, whether you think that there's a violation of law that could potentially be prosecuted, because again, this just underscores the fact that these things can happen by accident or inadvertence and any distinctions among the situations of the three main players I think are going to be lost on a large fraction of the American public.",

Privately, officials have been very keenly eyeing the developments over the last couple of hours when it comes to the former vice president.Keep in mind, over the course of the last several weeks, as the White House has attempted to grapple with the repeated disclosures, they have gone through great lengths to make clear just how different they view their situation. The presidents classified documents issues, without of his predecessor -- very different cases, very different issues that the two are dealing with. This is an issue in particular with the former vice president, where I think the company is welcome to some degree, trying to draw parallels here, trying to make clear that this was both inadvertent in both cases, but also underscoring that this is something that can happen, does happen, and in the presidents case, that as this investigation continues, having somebody else that is not the former president and what he is going through, to hold up as an example, is something that has been politically helpful and potentially could be helpful more broadly in terms of how people are looking at things.

Pence is acting like an honest person. Biden is acting like an honest person. Trump is not. He lied. He stonewalled. He denied. They had to execute a search warrant. So, I -- to me, those politically, are very different cases. Plus, there's been better reporting on the Trump documents. There's been reporting that they were very highly classified. I worked in the White House. Lots of stuff is classified that is actually not very important. We know from reporting that up to and including top secret -- higher than top secret information -- nuclear program and other matters we're at Mar-a-Lago golf course.
