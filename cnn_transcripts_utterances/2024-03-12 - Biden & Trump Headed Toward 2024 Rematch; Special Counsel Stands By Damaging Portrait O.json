He only needs 2.7 percent of the remaining available delegates. And we're only on the second Tuesday in March. He's going to cross that threshold, most likely, later tonight, when Washington State reports its votes after the 11 PM Eastern hour, Anderson COOPER: President Biden crossed the threshold, to what he needed, earlier tonight.

We're talking about Georgia, Michigan, Arizona, and Nevada.But the other part of this is really learning how to navigate with these legal issues. And part of that is the trial that's starting at the end of this month. And I'm talking to sources, who say Donald Trump wants to attend every day, of that trial, even the days that aren't mandatory. So, even at the beginning of the trial, when it's jury selection, and it just has to be lawyers, Donald Trump is saying he wants to attend. So, they're looking into plans for that, and also, how he's going to actually compete in a general election and campaign. So, right now, they are talking about Wednesday, and Saturday, being the days that they actually have events, because those are the days that they aren't in court. Now, Donald Trump, he has said that he would go to court, during the day, and then in the evening, he would campaign. When I'm talking to these sources, they acknowledge that that could be very difficult. They just don't know how they're going to get him, in and out of the city, where it's close enough, what kind of rally or event he would hold. So, right now, it's just figuring out how to navigate these several weeks of trial, which Donald Trump is going to be in court. And of course, as we have seen in the past, he is expected to use those cameras, to his advantage. But remember, in this New York trial, this hush money case, this is not the same court, as a civil fraud trial, where there are cameras everywhere that he can go out to. We saw him trying to navigate this, when he was in court, just recently, having to walk all the way out to this pool camera, where he essentially was shouting, it's just not quite as easy. So, they're trying to work around how they're going to use those -- that courtroom, as a campaign stop, but also how to actually work, on the campaign, because they know that this is going to be a very close election, and a tight rematch, with Joe Biden.",

So, I'm going to pick the Republican on this ticket. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION: Yes, we've heard that time and time again. Even Nikki Haley has indicated that if Trump is the nominee, she's going to support him. She definitely would not support Biden under any circumstances. So, what we hear from a lot of Republicans, even those who are critical of former President Trump, is that when it comes down to a match-up, a rematch, they still think Trump is better for the country than Biden. They think Biden is awful. They think his tenure has been awful. They think that they'd rather deal with another four years of Trump than deal with four more years of Biden. And we're seeing that kind of writ large. I mean, I think it's also just like a political calculation. The Republicans, who stood up to Trump, and said never Trump, no way, not anywhere, kind of are in a political no man's land. So, I think in a way that it's understandable that those who still want to be relevant to the party, at some point, believe they have to fall in line, once it's clear that Trump is their nominee.",

And how many are actually potential Biden voters in the fall? But, largely, I think when you look at these two unpopular nominees, that come into focus, tonight, the negative partisanship is going to drive so much of this, because politics is always not an either-or but a both-and. And so, these candidates are going to have to really gin up enthusiasm, in their base. And they're going to do that with the negative partisanship that exists in society, and playing into the polarization a bit.

I mean, one of the issues we haven't really talked a lot about, tonight, is abortion, which we have seen time and again, is motivating both Democrats. You talk about this base issue. It is absolutely an issue that is motivating Democratic base voters, the coalition voters, Biden needs to get energized and come out.

That's the regional bloc of which the U.S. is a member state. And essentially, it's been crafted to, at the end of everything, stabilize the government, enough to have presidential elections. But it's going to be made up of seven different members. And they're going to come from members of different political factions within Haiti. And they're going to appoint, in the interim, a Prime Minister, and then hopefully get to that place of stability. But you pointed out the reaction already, in Haiti. And we're hearing one gang leader, who's very popular, known as Barbecue, saying that he won't recognize anything that comes from a foreign force. That's echoed by a former coup leader, Guy Philippe, who is saying that this is not representative of the Haitian people. And there is frustration that we actually heard more than two weeks ago, when we were in Haiti, in Port-au-Prince, that folks were saying they felt like they didn't have a voice. They'd come up to us, and they'd say, to the U.S., to Canada, to France, let us make the decisions here. So, it still remains unclear, Anderson, if this is really going to create that stability that is so badly needed, on the other side of the border.",

They're trying to stay safe. And they're fearing that at any moment, they'll have to flee, from where they currently are. We were even in touch with a police source, who tells us they're really frustrated. And they feel like they're the last ones holding the line right now. And they point, in particular, to the Kenyan police officers, who were supposed to be deployed any day now. But now we're hearing that Kenya has put that on hold. Well, why are Kenyan officials pausing this? It's because they're looking at this transitional council that is not yet in place. They're saying that Ariel Henry, the Prime Minister, is resigning. So, they're saying, wait a minute, this is not what we signed up for originally. This is not the agreement that we decided to put our police forces to support. And so, they want to see, again, stability, before they're comfortable putting their forces into Haiti. And that remains unclear when it's going to happen. Meantime, you've got the Pentagon, Anderson, tonight. They're warning that this could be a possible mass migration situation. And you've got the World Food Programme, saying at the end of all of this, we've got to look at the humanitarian aspect, the hunger situation. People are desperate. The supply lines are getting cut off. And you have, as they characterize it, a million people now, who are one step away from famine, Anderson.",
