And the Israeli Prime Minister expressing deep regrets for the situation. But there are still many questions that remain about exactly how the -- these three vehicles could have been misidentified, mistakenly targeted by the Israeli military, as they claim.And Chef Jose Andres in this interview with Reuters is making clear that the Israeli military, in his view systematically targeted these vehicles that they were clearly identified, saying this was not just a bad luck situation. He also said that his team tried to communicate with the IDF as these strikes began to happen indicating that as we have seen with our analysis, as well, from the visual evidence on the ground, that this was not just one strike, as the Israeli military has tried to suggest. Not just one mistake, but multiple strikes targeting these individual vehicles half a mile apart in one case, a mile apart in a second case. And so clearly, there are still many more questions that the military is going to have to answer here as they conduct this investigation. [02:05:05] CHURCH: The U.S. Defense Secretary is urging his Israeli counterpart to carry out a quick and transparent inquiry. According to the Pentagon, Lloyd Austin pressed Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant half gallon to share the conclusions publicly and hold those responsible to account. Austin also stressed the need for a rapid increase in aid to Gaza through all crossings, particularly to communities in northern Gaza at risk of famine. U.S. President Joe Biden will speak by phone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the day ahead. It will be their first conversation since the World Central Kitchen Aid workers were killed. One official describes the U.S. president as angry and increasingly frustrated and fully prepared to make that known. Mr. Biden is also expected to discuss Israel's potential ground incursion into Rafah, the ongoing ceasefire and hostage talks, the need for more humanitarian aid and the protection of aid workers in Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEW MILLER, U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESPERSON: It doesn't really matter how they made the mistake. At the end of the day, you have seven dead aid workers who are there trying to deliver humanitarian assistance. So, whatever the reason was, that led to this tragedy, whatever the mistake that happened inside the IDF, it's unacceptable, and they need to do better and they need to put measures in place to ensure that it doesn't happen again.

LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Biden making clear in a statement that he is outraged by the deaths of the seven eight workers in Gaza. CNN is told that the frustration inside the White House has reached new levels. And the President notably explicitly blaming Israel for this incident, saying that the country has simply not done enough to protect aid workers and civilians. And this anger is going to be the backdrop for the President's conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. But despite this anger that the President is feeling, the White House is also making clear at this point, that the U.S. is not changing its position when it comes to supporting Israel in its current war against Hamas in Gaza. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: I can say that nothing has changed. And we've been clear about that since certainly, since yesterday, we are going to continue to have those really tough conversations, right? Important to have conversations about how Israel moves forward with their operation. We want to make sure that civilians are kept safe, that are protected, and also folks who are providing humanitarian aid. (END VIDEO CLIP) LEE: And, of course, earlier this week here at the White House, we saw a vivid display of the anger and frustration over this war that the President continues to confront every day. The White House was set to host an Iftar dinner to break the Ramadan fast but instead, that dinner becoming a meeting with a small group of Muslim community leaders after participants raise concerns about this idea of holding a celebratory dinner when the situation in Gaza is so terrible, and so many people in that region is currently starving and unable to eat out. One of the participants, of course, was a Palestinian American doctor who said that he actually left this meeting early as a show of protest. But before he left the meeting, he says that he handed the President a letter that was written by an eight-year-old girl in Rafah who was orphaned during this war and in that letter, she essentially begged the president to do anything that he can to stop Israel from expanding its military operation into Rafah. This doctor, of course, is one of many Americans across the country right now who would like to see the President change direction when it comes to this war. But again, the White House for now is making clear that that is not something that it is prepared to do at this moment in time. M.J. Lee, CNN at the White House.",

And so, Nasser was overwhelmed.This is a hospital that's supposed to be able to perform multiple surgeries, but healthcare institution after healthcare institution has been raided, targeted and left to (INAUDIBLE) and you can -- I can name you all of them. Shifa, Al Awda, Ranteesi and Nasser. The list goes on and on. 70 healthcare workers have been abducted, over 400 healthcare workers have been killed. In fact, one of the surgeons that I worked with at Nasser Hospital, Dr. Khaled al-Serr who was working on getting Nasser up and running again has just been detained by the Israeli military recently. And so, there is a deliberate attack on healthcare infrastructure. And it's just one piece of making life hell in the Gaza Strip and why the humanitarian crisis is so bad. It's not just that there's a famine in the north, and there's a possible invasion of Rafah in the south. It's that nothing can get in. We can't even get food or water into the Gaza Strip. It's being restricted by the Israelis. Hospitals cannot get fuel for their generators to power on their lights and treat their patients. We're out of medicine. We're out of supplies, we're out of even space and buffer for people to stay. You can't even put pitch a tent if you're a displaced person in the Gaza Strip right now. And so, every aspect of life has come under attack and all of civilian infrastructure had been -- has been devastated. It should be no surprise to anybody that a six-month -- where it -- six months we're in this catastrophic situation here. And that's why people are calling for a ceasefire. That's why they're saying an invasion to Rafah is a red line. And they're saying that we need a maritime corridor, we need air drops.

She says none of that should go forward. She told me that, especially if this moves through a process known on Capitol Hill as under suspension of the rules, meaning working with Democrats and in circumventing some of the hard right forces within his conference that could cause her to move ahead. She said, I think, let me tell you when he forces that vote, again, under suspension with no amendments and funds Ukraine, and people find out how angry little constituents are about it. That's going to move the needle even more. But I'm going to tell you right now, funding Ukraine is probably one of the most egregious things that he can do.

So watching that stripe from Mexico all the way up toward Atlantic Canada, what we are expecting is a developing low pressure center across the Gulf Coast, possibly making clouds for Louisiana, maybe all the way up toward Arkansas. We'll have to see. I'll show you those pictures in a second.Some clearing skies across parts of the Midwest and then more clearing on up toward New England. Now, the stripe wide here is 122 miles. So if you get one or two clouds in your way and you have time, you can still shift your location just a bit, 2,500 miles long. You're not going to be going that quickly. A lot of cloud cover across the northeast and the Great Lakes at a typical time of year in April. But this I think is the problem. The storm down across parts of Texas, this is where the cloud cover will come from and it will likely be quite thick, especially with these cumulus clouds building and maybe even thunderstorms in the afternoon. This is the American model. Keep an eye on your location. I'm going to switch you to the European model. Not a lot of change, still a lot of cloud cover down here. But as we get closer, one or two days closer, all of this will come into better confidence and probably, likely some better resolution. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
