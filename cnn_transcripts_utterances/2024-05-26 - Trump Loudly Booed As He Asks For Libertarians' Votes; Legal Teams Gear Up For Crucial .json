I'm Manu Raju.Last night, just three days before closing arguments in his criminal hush money trial, Donald Trump faced a hostile crowd during an unusual speech he made to libertarians at their convention here in Washington. It was his last major speech before his case goes to a jury. Now, after six weeks, 22 witnesses on the stand and no shortage of salacious testimony, this could be the week we find out if Donald Trump becomes a first former United States president to be convicted of a crime or acquitted on felony charges at a pivotal time in the campaign season. Now, it all comes as brand new CNN polling, new polling out this week shows the race between Trump and Biden still neck and neck with no clear leader. And the big question, what impact, if any, will the verdict have on this hugely consequential race? Now the verdict takes on heightened importance since this is likely to be the only Trump case to reach a jury before November. And Trump's been out campaigning since court went dark last Tuesday, albeit not in those battleground states, actually making a stop in the Bronx last week. And then last night in D.C., whereas reception before libertarians was anything but warm. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Don't make it look like he can just show up to a libertarian convention. And win people over. So the big news from this was that you said he'd put a libertarian in the cabinet. He said he'd give clemency to Russ Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Roads, this online drug, dark web, I should say, drug kingpin, and Trump went in knowing he'd have to make some promises and knowing he get booed. Trump campaign was telling me this is part of a unity tour like Sneaker Con, like the Bronx rally where he's going to show up.

What is interesting is that its all this kind of messaging tour, we're really not seeing sort of ground game and battleground states that reflects this kind of outreach were not seeing the work that you need to do on the ground to turn out the sort of low propensity voters.

We'll see.This is what a recent poll from Quinnipiac said about whether or not people view this illegal. We looked at over time, it's been pretty consistent. I mean, this is just over the last month since coverage is dominated over the hush money trial. About 46 percent of voters believe he did something illegal. That's from April to May, not much difference between April to May about who believed they did nothing wrong, just 21 percent. Then there's the question about whether or not people find Trump did what he did was he is actually guilty of a crime here. Democrats, not surprisingly overwhelming believe he's guilty. Republicans, not surprisingly, believe overwhelmingly he's not guilty, but that independent number, 53 percent, a majority of independence.

The fact that it's a hush money case, Donald Trump already has some negatives. People are like, oh, that's not great. People are like, I wouldn't want to be married to him in that sense.

They have framed the trial the way they would prefer that people see it as something that's old news that's about his personal conduct.

I'm still innocent. I also think you could end up somewhere in this sort of muddy middle where you end up with a hung jury, a jury that cannot reach a verdict.

Now, with respect to Michael Cohen, I think we can expect to see them touching on it. Obviously, because the defense will and their summation, but they're going to have to minimize it. And I think what they're going to do is they have a strategy will they'll say, yeah, Michael Cohen wasn't a perfect witness. However, everything he says can be corroborated by the evidence.
