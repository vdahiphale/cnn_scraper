Also, ahead for you this hour, the Fed expected to cut interest rates here in the U.S. We're going to take a closer look at that impact just ahead. Plus, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs back in court today after being denied bail. And we're hearing from Donald Trump for the first time since Sunday's apparent assassination attempt, why the former president says he believes he was targeted. We begin this hour with Tuesday's brazen pager attack across Lebanon. CNN has learned that, in fact, it was Israel behind that attack. I do want to warn you, some of the video you're about to see is disturbing. That, of course, the aftermath the scenes of chaos at hospitals in Lebanon after thousands of pagers exploded at the same moment, the attack targeted members of the Iranian backed militia, Hezbollah. Here's what we know at this hour, 12 people were killed, including two children and nearly 3000 were wounded. CNN has learned the attack was a joint operation between Israel's intelligence agency Mossad and the Israeli military. A Lebanese security source says Hezbollah bought the pagers in recent months. \"The New York Times\" reporting Israel planted explosives and a detonation switch next to the battery in each device. The IDF and Mossad, though, are not confirming taking part in that attack. Hezbollah, for its part, vowing to retaliate.

Thousands of people were injured in the apparently simultaneous pager blast that took place at about 03:30 in the afternoon Tuesday in areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. Now here outside the hospital, friends and relatives of those injured are waiting for news, not surprisingly, most do not want to appear on camera. But off camera, one told us, for instance, that a friend of his received a message on his pager. He picked it up, looked at it, and it exploded in his face, damaging his eyes and his fingers. Another individual who said he was a supporter of Hezbollah told us that despite these injuries, morale within the group is still high, and that those who were injured will soon return to the front. Now, Thursday afternoon, Hezbollah Leader Hassan Nasrallah is expected to comment on the events of Tuesday. But on Wednesday morning, Hezbollah put out a statement saying that there would be hard atonement awaiting the so- called criminal enemy that was behind what they described as Tuesday's massacre.

All eyes on the U.S. Federal Reserve today, because it is expected, of course, to cut interest rates for the first time since the height of the COVID pandemic back in 2020. And years of high rates have helped to slow inflation here in the United States. Now, though, with U.S. job market weakening, it appears the Fed may stimulate the economy by lowering rates. So, it's worth noting here is only in the past few weeks, at the U.S. central bank has clearly signaled it is ready to make that cut. You know that Wall Street, of course, will be listening closely to what Fed Chair Jerome Powell has to say a bit later today, you're taking a look at the futures markets there, of course.

It's what two months out from a presidential election. And yet, we're still not sure quite what they're going to do today, beyond the fact that, as you quite rightly said, they will cut. Right now, the majority of analysts think they'll cut by around a quarter of a percentage point. Investors far more optimistic. They see a far bigger chance of a half a percentage point cut. And that leaves us now questioning either way. The important point is Jay Powell is going to have to explain the decision that they make. So, we're going to watch what he says about inflation risks, what he says about the jobs market, ultimately, but crucial for me too is how low can rates go ultimately. We're going to get a whole bunch of forecasts here, and that's ultimately what matters to American borrowers.

Yes, it's going to have an impact on all of these things. Credit cards is a great example. It will filter into what banks charge. But right now, the average credit card rate is around 25 percent whether they cut a quarter or half, it's going to be 24.9 percent, these things are so expensive you're barely even going to feel the move. Mortgages' is another example. We're already at what 18-month lows for a 30-year mortgage rate. We've seen them come down already. Today will be good news if you have an adjustable-rate mortgage if you have a home equity line of credit, because they'll tick lower. Another one to mention would be, I think auto loans, astonishingly expensive right now. That will trickle into lower rates, but it also depends on what you're buying.

Now, if themusic mogul's appeal is denied, he will be sent back to the federal detention center, where he spent last night. On Tuesday, a federal judge ruled Combs would remain in custody while he faces sex trafficking and other charges. Combs' attorney asked that his client be released on bond and placed on home detention prior to trial. Prosecutors, however, argued Combs should not be freed because he had previously reached out to witnesses and victims. Here's CNN's Elizabeth Wagmeister with more of the details in this indictment. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, one of music's biggest stars, ordered behind bars after pleading not guilty to a sweeping federal indictment, charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. The grand jury indictment accuses the music mogul of running a criminal enterprise over decades. DAMIAN WILLIAMS, U.S. ATTORNEY FOR SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Between at least 2008 and the present, Combs abused threatened and coerced victims to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation and conceal his conduct.

He has previously denied the accusations of abuse, saying I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. In March, authorities searched Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami as part of a months' long federal investigation by a team that specializes in human trafficking crime that led to today's indictment. Among the items seized firearms, including three AR-15s, ammunition, more than 1000 bottles of personal lubricants, such as baby oil and video evidence of freak offs, according to the indictment. WAGMEISTER (on camera): Now Cassie, who is Diddy's ex-girlfriend, who was shown in that disturbing hotel surveillance footage declined to comment on these new charges against Diddy. I reached out to her attorney, who says that they will not have anything to say about this indictment, but we have heard from some of the accusers and their attorneys.

CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has more now on this attack, and I do want to warn you, the report does contain some graphic images.

Hard to overstate the psychological impact of hundreds of blasts across Lebanon, mostly in Hezbollah areas, pagers exploding at about 330 according to the group. Security forces asking Lebanese to stay off the road so the sheer volume of emergency vehicles could get to hospital. Nearly 3000 patients, at least 170 critical. Easily the most widespread moment of violence to hit across Lebanon since the 2006 war with Israel, who Hezbollah is now firmly blaming for these new attacks on their TV channel. We blame the Israeli enemy with full responsibility, the TV anchor said. For this criminal attack that also harms civilians. Israel themselves declined to claim the attack to blame, perhaps these tiny devices, according to posts on social media, CNN can't verify the race now to work out, how was it just one type of device, a cyber-attack, a battery bomb? Did they just hit Hezbollah areas? It comes at yet another critical time. Monday, Israel's Defense Minister hinted meeting the U.S. envoy, that the time for a diplomatic solution of how to get tens of thousands of Israelis home to the war plagued north had mostly passed, that a military option is all that remains. The hope had been for calm after the death of Hezbollah Commander Fuad Shukr also killed in a violation of Hezbollah's stronghold in Southern Beirut, led to great fury, but minimal fire, with Hezbollah's retaliation restrained perhaps by preemptive Israeli strikes, many felt the moment of conflagration had passed. Now, it seems back again, with Hezbollah once more under pressure to hit back hard. But only because another sophisticated attack has made them look weak. Nick Paton Walsh, CNN, London.

Once we do get that decision, many economists looking at this and what they are expecting is forecasting a quarter point reduction. It would, of course, be the first rate cut in basically four years. There is growing speculation, though this morning that perhaps the rate cut could actually be double cutting at 50 basis points. Lower rates, of course, mean that it will be less expensive for borrowers to get money, that in turn, tends to lead to increased spending. The Fed, of course, had been waiting to act until inflation cooled to a measure that made them more comfortable. And while that has happened, there's also been slowing the job market here in the U.S. So that's creating an unusual amount of uncertainty over the Fed's decision.
