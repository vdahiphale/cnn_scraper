We have plenty of events that you and I need to digest through the course of the hour. A stunning about-face, about-face of proportions in Kenya. President Ruto withdraws his controversial tax plans after deadly protests. Deja vu at the US Supreme Court, a major ruling on abortion appears to be released by accident. And Chipotle just had one of the largest share splits in US history, fifty to one. It is cutting its supersized stock into bite-size pieces. So much in the next hour, just as well, we are live in London on Wednesday, June the 26th. I am Richard Quest and yes, I mean business. Good evening. \"I concede\" says the Kenyan president after days of violence and chaos in the capital, Nairobi. President Ruto has withdrawn the controversial finance bill that sparked the unrest. More than 20 people reportedly killed on Tuesday as protesters were angry at the proposed tax increases, stormed the country's Parliament and set Nairobi's City Hall on fire. The president defended the bill earlier and then admitted a lack of public support. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's 72 percent of GDP, but the problem is not necessarily the total amount, it is the interest payments. They are getting higher as interest rates have being so high, and of course, there are a lot of their debts are in dollars, and that makes it even more difficult. Larry Madowo is in Nairobi.

The now-removed documents shows the High Court is poised to rule that the state of Idaho cannot enforce its abortion ban if a mother's health is at risk. Now, this might all seem very similar in terms of both the issue and the leak, the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Dobbs case was leaked a month before the decision was officially handed down.

You do not have a constitutional right or a fundamental right to an abortion. And so in that decision, six-three, which was released early like this one, it was noted that that was overturned and now comes this, a major decision. And so is it coincidence? Is it carelessness?

And I think it is important to note that this isn't just this -- this in fact, almost certainly isn't the Biden administration demanding that these platforms take content down. In most of the previous case bases, it was just a government worker saying, hey, platforms, look at this false piece of information. It appears to already violate your existing policies. Maybe you should take a look at that. But your question is right in this sort of, does fudge the decision-making here. They've ruled that these plaintiffs didn't have standing to sue, but at least the majority of justices didn't engage with this First Amendment argument here that was at the core of this case, which means that additional cases on this issue could be brought in the future.

But because, of course, you know, the president -- you mentioned Evo Morales,former president of Bolivia, he was also ousted after allegations that he had stolen election. The police and military public rose up against him. That installed a much more right-wing government, transitional government, and there really was a crisis in Bolivia that, you know, goes to the point of this very, very divided nation. There was a democratic election that the U.S. and everyone accepted. Luis Arce is the democratically elected president of Bolivia at this moment. Everyone accepts that like it or not, except that these troops that we're now seeing essentially hammered their way into the presidential palace, apparently looking for him. We don't know what the ultimate goal is, but they have surrounded the presidential palace in the center of La Paz. As of a few minutes ago the president was able to communicate via social media. So we don't know where he is. Certainly if I were him I would be keeping that -- I'll be keeping a low profile until order is restored, if order can be restored. I mean, is this the entire armed forces that has risen up or is this just a certain group of certain commander that are upset, that are acting on their own and so far are not being opposed? We don't know. This is playing out minute by minute. And certainly for many people in the who, region, you know, the hope was this was the past.",

BILL WEIR, CNN CHIEF CLIMATE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): \"Call to Earth\" guest editor Steve Boyes has dedicated his life to exploration and the science of Africa's fresh water systems. Having said comprehensive scientific baselines across the length and breadth of the Okavango, Steve now plans to do the same for the remaining five inland river basins of Africa, the Zambezi, the Nile, Chad, Niger and the largest of them all, the Congo. The Congo basin stretches across 3.4 million square kilometers of the continent, barreling through the borders of up to 10 countries, but its further source is the Chambeshi in the northern corner of Zambia.

It's the unknown, and that's every single corner. And typically of these rivers, no one's ever photographed them. There's no record of what they are. We produce that in the end. Of course, I'm nervous. WEIR (voice-over): Along the water, the stream of data is relentless. Every bird, settlement, boat, bridge, anything that can be seen from the river is recorded by the team, creating a comprehensive snapshot of the ecosystem. Throughout the journey, the team is recording 360-degree imagery and stopping at regular intervals to do environmental DNA sampling and fish biodiversity monitoring.",

So we often find new species or new subspecies of fish. And the Chambeshi River in particular is very poorly sampled with regards to fish diversity.
