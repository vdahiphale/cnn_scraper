For all you treasure hunters out there, now you know where to look next.Next up, let`s talk about what I`m sure is one of everyone`s favorite subjects taking tests specifically let`s talk the ACT, a standardized exam used in many college`s admissions process is considered one of the benchmarks for college readiness. Well, this month, the non-profit that gives the ACT exam released some jarring news, ACT scores for this year`s graduating high school class were the lowest they`ve been since all the way back to 1991, and this is the fifth year in a row that the average scores have been going down. Why? Well, the report noted that several factors are impacting scores like the lasting effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, classroom disruptions, cyber bullying, teacher vacancies and mental health challenges. Now, a separate education report last month pointed to declining math and reading scores for nine-year-olds in the U.S. That report cited loss of in-person classroom time as the primary driver. So going ahead and give a hoot and a holler or maybe a pat on the back for your teachers today. They might not always show it, but they love you. (MUSIC)",
