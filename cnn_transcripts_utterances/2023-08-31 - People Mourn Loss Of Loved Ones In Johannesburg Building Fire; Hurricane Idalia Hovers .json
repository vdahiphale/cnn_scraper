Still even have a few flood warnings and flash flood warnings at the moment, and a lot of that really has to do with how much rain has fallen in the last 24 hours. You're looking at widespread totals of 50 to 100 millimeters, but in these areas here where you see the red and even purple, you're talking in excess of 200 millimeters total and not just in one spot. South Carolina, Florida and Georgia. All of these areas picking up at least 200 millimeters of rain. North Carolina slightly less than that, but remember it's still raining in some portions of North Carolina, so those numbers are expected to tick up a little bit more. For the rest of the day, today, that storm is going to continue its progression off into the Atlantic Ocean, taking with it the bulk of the rain. We'll still have some rip currents and some areas of high surf, likely off the coast for a few more hours, then the storm begins to make its way over towards Bermuda. Now, the interest there are going to have to pay close attention to this storm, because it could still end up bringing tropical storm force winds, likely bringing down some power, some trees and some power lines and also the very heavy rain. And speaking of power, you still have roughly 200,000 people without power across states like Georgia and Florida. That number jumps to nearly 300,000 when you factor in North and South Carolina into the mix, too. So, a lot of areas in the worst part, you don't have power, which means you don't have air conditioning, you don't have access to electricity and fans. And these temperatures here are looking at in the low 30. So, again, it's hot, it's humid, and these for, unfortunately, these folks are looking at areas without air conditioning or power.",

But Joseph Burrell says it cannot be overlooked that the coup happened only moments after President Ali Bongo was declared the winner of what many say was a rigged election.

He said Ali Bongo should never have run for a third term as president. CNN's Larry Madowo is tracking all the developments for us live. So, Larry, what do we make of the timing of this coup?

This building, having been -- it's owned by the city and they sought to try and get order into this building. And they were barricaded and there were attempts that were made. And, but the lesson for us is that we've got to address this problem and root and everything else, root out those criminal elements because it is these types of buildings that are taken over by criminals who then levy rents on -- on vulnerable people and families who need and want accommodation in the inner city. And it speaks to the type of cities that we should have in South Africa as we move forward. Poor people, yes, need to live in the city, but there needs to be order. There needs to be law and order in the inner city. And the initiatives that we are embarking on through our security forces, through Project Chaniela, is one of those that, working with the city and with the province, we are going to ensure that we root out all criminal elements and restore the livelihoods of people who live in the city.

It's just gone 6 o'clock in the evening there in Johannesburg. And he was talking about the fact that this fire is unprecedented. There's never been anything like this in Johannesburg, just in terms of the number of people, the sheer number of people who had lost their lives in this way. I want to bring in my guest again, Lebogang Maile. You know, one of the things that this South African President was saying there -- he repeated over and over again, we have to get to the bottom of this. You know, this is a wake up call for everybody. We have to ensure that people are kept safe. You know, people in some of these sort of dilapidated buildings that are, you know, that exists obviously throughout Johannesburg, they need to be kept safe. This sort of tragedy has to be prevented. One of the tricky aspects of that is the fact that even if city inspectors are aware that these buildings exist, that there's overcrowding, that criminal gangs have overtaken these buildings and are charging migrants or poorer people rent to live in these buildings, the fact is in South Africa there is a rule that if you're going to evacuate or take people out of these buildings, you have to have somewhere else for them to go. And of course, as you know, Johannesburg is in the middle of a really serious housing crisis. There just is not enough space. There's not enough housing for people in Johannesburg. So, how do you square that circle? What can actually be done here?",

We're talking about buildings that lack fire extinguishers, buildings that lack fire escapes, buildings that lack sprinklers. And obviously, the President touched on this idea that, you know, there's going to be accountability and of course there's going to be an investigation. That, again, also takes time. What do you think can be done in the coming days, in the coming weeks for the other people in Johannesburg that are trapped, that are being forced, I guess, to live in these sorts of buildings, now that we've seen what can go wrong?",

Just last big Friday, we were allocating people houses.That's the first, but it doesn't mean it is solving the problem because you have at least 230,000 people coming into our province every year. So, there's a huge problem of immigration and urbanization. And with problems happening in other African countries, you've got a lot of people coming into our country because there are problems in their countries and we have to accommodate them. So, it's a moving target because you build houses and then there's more people who need houses and all that. What will happen now is that those who are displaced from this tragic event, irrespective of their nationality, we are going to allocate them accommodation. We've identified three buildings that are owned by the city which are in a conducive condition and they will be able to be allocated there. The next step is to identify all government- owned buildings that have been illegally occupied and we will be applying for an agent caught in tactic or eviction to evict all those people and we will deal with the cases on merit on an individual basis and those who will not be able to find accommodation will have to do something about it. Because this is in the best interest and for the safety of these citizens who are in our buildings. But you also have private-owned buildings that have been hijacked. We then have to go to the courts to ask that the courts must give us a right as government to take over these buildings so that we can be able to convert them into suitable housing.",

It is the latest in a series of militarytakeovers on a continent that has experienced more coups or attempted coups than anywhere else on the planet. And it comes just one month after soldiers took control of Niger. In the past three years alone, democratically elected leaders in seven African states have been ousted, threatening regional peace and security and stability and creating a geopolitical battle for influence between outside powers. But unlike its counterparts in the Sahel region, which are struggling with an on-going Islamist insurgency, the coup in Gabon is generating popular public support. You can actually see here crowds singing, people dancing in the street, waving flags. This is in the streets of Gabon on Wednesday. Gabon, by the way, is an oil-rich country, one of France's most important allies in Africa, a former French colony, as well. And it's generally considered more stable than other African countries that are currently experiencing political unrest. Time now for The Exchange and my conversation with Rama Yard.

Seven coups inthree years, sometimes several coups in the same country, in Mali and Burkina Faso, for example. For Gabon, it's the same trend, but not the same kind of coup. Gabon is a very special case. It is an old power based on a family transition since 1968, you know, 75 years at the head of the state with the father and then Omar Bongo and then the son Ali Bongo. It's not -- they have never been democratically elected presidents. So, no democratic president to save here. These codes will be very difficult to advocate for. The recent election a few days ago presidential election allegedly won by Ali Bongo has not been condemned by anyone and it is also a rich petrol state of 2.5 million people with the fourth highest GDP per head in sub- Saharan Africa, but unemployment and poverty are everywhere. So, you know, the people of Gabon have lost trust in this kind of country and there have been growing frustrations about the French paternalistic style of influence, like they say, it has never stopped.

And there does seem to be this feeling on the ground that people have had enough of French implements, whether you're talking about Niger, whether you're talking about Gabon, Mali, the list goes on. One of the things -- I've just actually been told by my producer that the A.U. has now suspended Gabon, so we are seeing some sort of reaction. We know that the A.U. has been meeting, also the Central African Political Block has also been meeting about what's happening in Gabon. One of the things I find interesting is the reaction from other sort of autocratic African leaders, as well. You have the Cameroonian President Paul Biya, who's been in power for 40 years, essentially firing his military leadership after hearing about what happened in Gabon, and then you also have the Rwandan president doing the same thing, as well. The Rwandan President Paul Kagame has been in office for two decades. And so, I think this idea that, my gosh, if it could happen in Gabon, in a country tha,t you know, has a family that has been at the helm of that country for more than half a century, then of course a coup could happen anywhere. I mean, how do you interpret how should other sort of autocratic, I guess, African leaders be interpreting what's happening in Gabon?",
