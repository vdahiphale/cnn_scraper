And it`s dry,conditions that are making it extremely difficult for firefighters in this area that are still battling the largest wildfire in Texas history. Containment is still very low, so there`s a lot of work to be done. And in the meantime, you have that grieving process beginning for a lot of the families that have lost everything, the cleanup process. Like, you`re seeing here behind me at the Johnson house, and it`s been difficult to do that cleanup because the winds have been so high. But nonetheless, you`re seeing them right now, as they`re trying to sift through that debris, trying to look for any jewelry, anything they can find of what was left of their home, the home that they`ve built for 20 years. I want you to listen to what Ronnie Johnson told me when he first got here to his home after the fire.",

Air temperature affects the precise mark, but the sound barrier can typically be broken at around 760 miles per hour. Well done. All right. You might remember, we were talking about the speed of sound about a month ago when we mentioned the development of a new supersonic plane, we`re taking a closer look today at what aerospace and defense company, Lockheed Martin has built and debuted for NASA. The experimental plane is called the X-59, and it`s a quiet supersonic aircraft. NASA is looking to possibly revolutionize the air travel industry. And by that, I mean go really fast, so fast that it could travel faster than the speed of sound. Take a look at this piece, profiling the X-59. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
