I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, we begin with new details on the investigation and the impact of that horrific school shooting in Winder, Georgia. Today, the Winder community is gathering to remember two of the four people killed in last week's rampage at Apalachee High School. The families of 14-year-old student Mason Schermerhorn and math teacher Cristina Irimie are holding separate funeral services this afternoon. Yesterday, Barrow County officials released the police 911 calls and more than 500 radio messages between emergency personnel. One of those 911 calls released is from a father who called authorities for his trapped daughter. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's what Barrow County Sheriff Judge Smith said in an interview with CNN affiliate WXIA.As we have previously reported, authorities say Gray brought an AR-15 style rifle to the school that day, a weapon he used to shoot and kill two fellow students and two teachers. Nine others were injured. Sheriff Smith says it appears that very gun was hidden in grace backpack when he left home for school that morning, as well as the bullets he was going to use.

But, of course, it's sad under any of these circumstances where we're now trying to reflect what went wrong. So what's your reaction to the 911 and the radio calls? DANIEL OATES, FMR. POLICE CHIEF OF AURORA, CO: Well, I've looked over what's available and I will tell you this. It appears that from the notice that the shooting started to that -- the subject was in custody was about six minutes. So that's a tribute to the officers, the deputies who responded. They certainly probably acted as quickly as possible. This -- the narrative around how this 14-year-old took a weapon of that size into school and wasn't discovered is very, very chilling. Now, and as is sort of the missed opportunities, it seems in every one of these kinds of events, there are signals beforehand. In this case, there was the call by the mother, you know, half an hour before the shooting started, the efforts by the deputies to focus on another child with a similar name.

And certainly the president talked about that very intensively with his British counterpart yesterday.At the top of his list of concerns is escalation with Russia. Certainly, he very much wants to avoid setting off a wider conflict, but when you talk to American officials, they also have some concerns about the effectiveness of such a move. Certainly, some American officials say that Russia has already positioned some of its highest value assets outside of the range of these missiles, and they question whether this could really change the trajectory on the battlefield. Now, yesterday, neither leader came out to indicate that an announcement was imminent that a decision has been made, although we did hear from the prime minister that a decision could be coming within the next couple of weeks. And he pointed specifically to the United Nations General Assembly talks at the end of this month, where this discussion will continue. Now, looming in the backdrop of all of these discussions is the American election. And certainly we heard at the debate this week President Trump giving several opportunities, declined to say that he was committed to Ukraine's victory. And I think that there is a sense among the Western alliance that they need to do everything they possibly can now to help Ukraine win before the uncertainty of November's election.",

He talked at length about Harris and her record as a prosecutor trying to tie certain issues in the state to Harris. He also, as you mentioned at that Vegas rally, went off script and really rehashed the debate sharing conspiracy theories about Kamala Harris and whether she was wearing an earpiece, things that we know were not true. But I do want to focus on one moment that happened at that press conference yesterday. During it, he gave remarks. He was doubling down on these rumors about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. And at one point, a reporter asked him about how that rhetoric has led to a recent uptick and bomb threats at schools in that area and how many students have had to be evacuated.

They all say that there is no evidence about what he is claiming to be true. So that's the first part.The second part of this, though, where he talks about wanting to start some sort of mass deportation effort in Springfield, that is problematic because a lot of the migrants in Springfield, Ohio are here legally. They have temporary protective status, also known more commonly as TPP. So some questions there about what he is actually calling for. But I think to keep in mind, the bottom line here, the big picture of why Donald Trump is talking about this is because it plays into his larger message about crime. He's largely for many months now been claiming that migrants who are here, whether they're here legally or illegally are the ones who are engaging in these allegations of violent crimes. And when I talk to advisers about this, particularly those rumors in Springfield, Ohio, they say even if they end up being proven false. Even if they are debunked they are being talked about, and that is the goal here. And it's very similar to what we saw in the lead up to the 2016 election. A lot of this rhetoric is fearmongering. He's spreading fear in the ideas of these voters trying to, you know, make them believe that this is a major problem. And so you're going to hear Donald Trump continuing to talk about this. You're seeing people like J.D. Vance continue to spread some of these rumors on social media today. So I think keep looking out for that, Fred.",

This is something that's normally reserved for fallen soldiers in Turkey. And I think we can understand this because when she was killed, the Turkish president said they, meaning Israel, heinously murdered our young child.This is something the president of Turkey, the country of Turkey is taking to heart. The foreign ministry has said that they will bring and hold those responsible for her death and bring them to justice. It's not really clear if the Turkish authorities are really going to have the power to intervene with the Israeli forces. The IDF are actually investigating are actually investigating her killing. But of course, this has caused a lot of interest in the United States. She was -- she was a dual U.S.-Turkish citizen. President Biden has called for there to be an absolutely thorough investigation. He has said very clearly that this was a tragic accident, but from unnecessary escalation of the use of force. And President Biden has said the investigation can only be viewed as transparent and proper by the United States. If Israel continues to share information about the investigation and continues it in a transparent manner. Otherwise, the United States will not be able to have confidence in the outcome. So there's a lot of attention being focused on this. She was 26-years-old. Some of the protesters who we're with her when she was shot say that she was directly targeted, shot in the head by an Israeli sniper from the IDF. The IDF has said that they we're shooting, not directed at her, per say, but they we're shooting at someone who was instigating violence, throwing rocks at them. And they said they run the threat, albeit, they we're 200 meters -- by eyewitness accounts, the IDF were 200 meters up the Hill from where she was shot. But this was a very strong signal from Turkey today that they feel deeply about her killing, deeply about getting justice, and essentially giving her, as you mentioned, this same sendoff that a soldier, that a fallen hero from Turkey would get.",

I think the hidden power of her message comes from what's maybe lost, but comes to those in the new space is she's providing an encouraging basic voter education. Again, as I mentioned, young voters are new voters. And both in her call to action to register to vote and the link to vote.gov, which saw a huge surge in traffic.

Joining us right now, former NASA astronaut and retired Air Force colonel, Cady Coleman. Her new book, \"Sharing Space, An Astronauts Guide to Mission Wonder and Making Change\" is available at bookstores now. Colonel Coleman, great to see you. COL.

And one of the ways to do that is to understand, what does it take to be mobile and actually work in a suit? And that's one of the things they really addressed was by actually forming the suits in a certain way, fabric folding and building the mobility into the actual constructive suit. I think they're hoping to show that there's different ways to attack spacesuit design.",

And what I especially like is that they did it with a crew of two women and two men. And the two women happen to be astronaut trainers and not one person. And by doing that, you're actually training folks back on earth to be the folks that really know about how suits fit, how they work.
