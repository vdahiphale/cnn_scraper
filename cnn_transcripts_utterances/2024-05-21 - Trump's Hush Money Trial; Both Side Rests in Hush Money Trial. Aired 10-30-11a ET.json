Let's hope not.But at the end of the day, just listening to all the legal discussion here, it explains why the politics of this also are so unclear. And if there's any political fallout for the former president, the defendant, or not, he'll be speaking this weekend at a libertarian conference here in Washington, trying to make his case. But otherwise, he doesn't have any campaign stops on his schedule. But the politics of this, as we sit here today, are still just as unclear as the verdict is.",

      "sentences": "The case against Donald Trump now headed for a dramatic conclusion, as both the prosecution and the defense have finished with their respective witnesses. Up next, closing arguments will give each side a chance to lay out the facts, as they have been told, to the jury to kind of tie everything that we've heard over these last six weeks together.On the line is the former president and the presumptive Republican nominee's freedom. We are looking at all of this as we are watching the court. Trump has just left the courtroom. He offered a fist bump as he was exiting and we have two excellent legal experts who are now joining us to walk through everything that we just saw and what could come next, because court has just broken for the day. We have two former federal prosecutors here with us. Alyse Adamson is back with us from yesterday. Now, Alyse, let me start with you before I get Gene's take on everything that just happened, but, Alyse, as we were looking at what happened today, I mean, no one is surprised, but Donald Trump walked out of that courtroom without answering a question about why he did not testify here after he had kind of teased this idea that he was considering it, that he might and then, of course, ultimately, did not take the witness stand himself?",

      "sentences": "Yes. Well, it's actually very common for a defendant not to testify in a criminal case. I think that going into the trial, the former president probably wanted to testify. We saw him testify to civil fraud trial. We know he has a lot to say, but I am sure his attorneys ran down the risk of putting him on the stand, which would open him up to all sorts of cross- examination.He's also kind of an uncontrollable witness. So, he could have gone into areas that were not meant for direct examination and then other evidence could have come in. So, it was just too risky. Why he didn't comment on it? I don't know. I don't want to speculate. Maybe he doesn't want to explain why he ultimately did not want to exercise his right. But it is his right not to testify. And the jury will also be instructed that they can't make any -- take any negative inferences that he decided to not testify in his own defense here.",

Do you think the defense ultimately made a mistake by putting Robert Costello on the witness stand and having him be the final witness instead of it being Michael Cohen yesterday, acknowledging that he stole tens of thousands of dollars from the Trump Organization?",

      "sentences": "Kaitlan, you hit the nail on the head. Instead of focusing on Michael Cohen as a thief and a liar, they made a huge mistake. And I want to talk about primacy and recency, and Alyse knows what I'm talking about.You always start off strong, because you only get one chance at a first impression, and people always remember your last act. By calling Mr. Costello as their last witness, actually, their only witness, they had a minor one, they left with the jury the following. Michael Cohen said, I really didn't trust Mr. Costello. I essentially thought he was a little sleazy and that he was working for Giuliani and Trump. So, I didn't want to give him anything that's going to hurt me in the end. So, that's very understandable. And when Costello took the stand, Kaitlan, and he acted the way he did, in my 30, 35 years of practicing law as a prosecutor and a defense attorney, I've never seen that. He insulted the judge. And frankly, Kaitlan, he insulted the jury. They may not have heard the sidebar. But remember, Kaitlan and Alyse, there are two attorneys on that jury and they figured out why the judge had him leave the room and it was because of the decorum. The defense ended on a horrible, horrible note, and it washed away everything they were trying to do with Michael Cohen. And here's the kicker, they actually rehabilitated Michael Cohen because Mr. Costello did come across as a little bit unsavory.",

They're going to have all of this, you know, on their minds as they are waiting for what next Tuesday is going to look like, but the attorneys will be back in there, the parties back in there this afternoon to talk about what, you know, in the moment is not going to be as captivating as the judge, clearing the courtroom and scolding Bob Costello, but it is going to be highly consequential because it is going to deal with the jury instructions and what that's going to look like. And that is something that both sides here have been incredibly invested in, which is what the judge is going to say to the jury before they take the case and make the ultimate decision here.",

      "sentences": "Kaitlan, I tried a lot of cases and I lost a lot of cases because of appeal issues, bad jury instruction, and there is nothing more painful than convicting somebody. It goes up on appeal and it's reversed because of a bad jury instruction.And the reason it's painful is it's my fault. I got greedy. I didn't listen to the judge or respect the law or I didn't follow the law. These charging conferences, the jury instruction discussions, if you will, in this case, this could decide whether Donald Trump is convicted, whether we have a hung jury or acquittal, but more important, if he is convicted, on appeal, the jury instructions, if they are fatally flawed, we will have a reversal and we're not going to have a re-trial. I don't think America could take another six weeks of this circus. OK. So, if we have a reversal, the case will be over. But the jury instruction conference today at 2:30 is where the rubber meets the road because we got to know what crime are you alleging was trying -- you were trying to hide. Was it taxes? Was it election at the state level? Was it election at the federal level? We got to know that. And we really are not clear about that, but the jury instructions will help. The last thing I want to say is the missing witness instruction, if the defense gets that for either Weisselberg or Schiller, the bodyguard, that could be very important for the defense.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely. That's a great point. I'm glad you brought that up because Keith Schiller and Allen Weisselberg have hung over this entire trial. And obviously, we know why, at least one of them is not being called, Keith Schiller. It's not totally clear. Obviously, they don't think it would be favorable to the prosecution.And obviously, Donald Trump has made clear, appeal is on his mind. He's mentioned it twice before going into the courtroom. It's as if he's already looking ahead to what that's going to be regardless, you know, the jury deliberations that are still yet to happen. Stand by, Alyse and Gene, because that was great analysis of how this morning has played out. But CNN's Kara Scannell was inside the courthouse this morning, she's been in there the entire trial. And, Kara, just -- can you just walk us through what it was like in the room this morning? I mean, you were in there yesterday in that really dramatic moment with Robert Costello. What was it like when Robert Costello got back on the stand this morning?",

The presentation of evidence took weeks, and the prosecution ultimately called 20 witnesses over 19 days, totaling 50 hours of testimony.The defense called two witnesses over two days, totaling less than two hours of testimony, but it still had its impact. One witness we did not hear from, who said he wanted initially to testify here, was the defendant himself, Donald Trump. CNN's Dana Bash is also tracking all of this from Washington. Dana, I don't think anyone is surprised that Trump did not ultimately get on the witness stand here.",
