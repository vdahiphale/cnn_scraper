So, let's take a look at what would happen if daylight savings time became permanent -- which is one of the proposals that's out there. I want you to take a look -- I chose Chicago sort of randomly, a city in the middle of the country. When you look at Saturday when we were in daylight savings time, thesun rose at 7:30 in the morning and it set at 5:30 in the evening. And then on Sunday when we went out of daylight savings time, the sun rose at 6:30 in the morning and it set at 4:30. So, in other words when you are in daylight savings time, the sunrises later, so that's important. Look at that Saturday, 7:30 in the morning. What some sleep experts say is, look. That's not great. The sun rises early. Our circadian rhythms -- our body's rhythms are set to rise early with the sun, and when you make the sunrise an hour later, it's not good for our circadian rhythms. It's not good for our cortisol levels. Then it's -- therefore it's not good for our blood pressure or our heart health. So, there's a whole theory that we start messing around with these times, it messes around with our body clock, but other people will tell you, look, it's an hour, we'll adjust. And we'd rather have that sunlight at 5:30 than, you know, at night. We'd rather have that light, you know, later in the evening. So, everyone has their own opinion on this.",

But let's step back and take a look at the back story.So, all the she escaped from this residential facility on Friday, but previously she pleaded guilty to killing her alleged rapist when she was 15. She was sentenced to five years' probation. And because of a law in Iowa, she was ordered to pay $150,000 in restitution to the family of her alleged rapist. Now her sentence, we should say, she received a deferred judgment and that was from the Polk County District Judge David Porter. But now, because she has escaped from this facility, there's a probation report that was issued, and they are asking, corrections officials with the department of corrections, are asking for her probation to be revoked and the original sentence to be reinstated. Initially she was charged with first-degree murder. She's now 18 and a warrant is out for her arrest -- Victor and Bianna.",
