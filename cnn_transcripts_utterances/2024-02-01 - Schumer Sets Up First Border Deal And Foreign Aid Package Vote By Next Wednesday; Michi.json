I just caught up with the number two Senate Republican, John Thune. He counts the votes on the GOP side. He said it is uncertain whether there will be enough Republicans to break an expected filibuster attempt on Wednesday. He said they have to see the text; they have to review it. And I said, can you overcome Donald Trump's opposition? He said, I don't know the answer to that yet. And he said this decision about whether to go ahead will be made by the Republican conference as the GOP leadership is noncommittal about this so far. Even as a top Republican, Mitch McConnell has pushed for this deal, has praised some of the elements of this deal, has been involved with it and is demanding action on Ukraine in particular at this moment. But can they get there given the divisions within the ranks and opposition that could come from Democrats to the border provisions as well? All huge questions ahead of these key votes next week.",

So, we'll see if we hear what has happened, but it looks like they're about to reconvene.We're going to have continued direct examination of Jennifer Crumbley, and this may extend for the rest of the day because her attorney wants to focus on everything. You know, one thing that I think we have a hold on that we need a little more explaining on is the cable lock for that gun, because we heard from the person that sold that gun at the gun shop that they have to always give a cable lock or another type of a lock for a gun, and a cable lock was given for that gun. Well, when the gun case was found on the day of the mass shooting, it was found in the master bedroom, on the bed of Jennifer and James Crumbley. It was opened, and James found this when he came home because he came home, and he's the one that called up and turned his son in. And the gun case was open. The gun was gone. I didn't see a cable lock anywhere around there in the picture that we saw. So, if the cable lock was always on it, had to have a key to open it, then where was the cable lock when it mattered, right? So, we need to hear an explanation for that.",

And I'm wondering, Areva, as jurors hear these sorts of details about him messaging her that their house was haunted, that he reportedly told them that that sort of stuff that he saw in the house only happened when he was alone. It seemed like he was a lonely kid wanting attention from his parents, even based on her own testimony.",

And a lot of them do not go and shoot up a school, right?So, a question I have is, does it come down to that, sort of the bad parenting, or is it really just the access to the weapon and the not cluing the school in when you see a drawing of a gun and then the not getting the mental help at the very moment that the school is telling you to get that and then not securing the weapon clearly as well as it should be?",

And all of the adults involved in this situation, none of them took the kinds of steps that could have been taken, pretty simple ones, to get him the help that he needed, to get him in a situation were he would not have access to this gun. So, I think there are a myriad of things that went wrong in this case from the mother being very involved with her extracurricular activities, not really paying close attention to what was going on with her son, and a school where they weren't either communicating with each other, principal and staff, and then with the parents. SANCHEZ: Areva and Jean, please stand by. Again, we're waiting for testimony to resume in the courtroom.

Not only are they aware of the political and legal challenges of finding another special prosecutor. They believe that any change in their prosecutorial team would just delay the proceedings indefinitely, and the window for them to try to get a trial started before the November 2024 election is shrinking fast. Look, you know, Fani Willis has not directly addressed these alleged allegations that she had an affair with the man that she appointed special prosecutor, Nathan Wade. But we understand, according to sources, that she is personally involved in this written response to these filings, which is due by tomorrow. That's the deadline that the judge has given her. And we understand, according to those sources, that she is not going to directly address the affair, but rather point out where she believes the attorneys who are trying to get this case dismissed are wrong in their interpretation of the law. So major developments happening here in Fulton County. This case just getting more and more dramatic by the day -- Boris, Brianna.",
