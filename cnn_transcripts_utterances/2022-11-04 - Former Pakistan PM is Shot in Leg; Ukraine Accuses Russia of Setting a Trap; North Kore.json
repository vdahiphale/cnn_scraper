That is according to a South Korean government source. But even if the ICBM did fail, progress was, of course, made since the last time it was tested back in May, according to the South Korean government. It is believed that the same type of ICBM only flew to an altitude of 540 kilometers yesterday. It reached an altitude of about 2,000 kilometer and likely failed in the third and final stage of flight. Those stages include the boost, mid-course, and terminal phase when the missile reenters the atmosphere and strikes its target. But the key here is that no one single test on its own is special. North Korea gains knowledge from each weapons test, and just like anything you do in life, the more you practice, the better you are going to get. So, when talking to experts, they say the aggressive pace of testing by Pyongyang, that is the most concerning thing here, Kim.",

When Donald Trump was president and he was talking to Kim Jong-un, the North Korean halted, there might be sort of a backlog of testing.As your correspondent pointed out, practice makes perfect, and the North Koreans are really leaning heavily into nuclear weapons and missiles in part because conventionally, their military, although large, is somewhat out of date. So, they're leaning heavily into this, and so they need to test on a regular basis. A particular question is, why there has been so much this year? I think some of that is because of the U.S.-South Korea drills. Those are kinds of things that set the North Koreans off. I think also some of it is the turn towards the right here in South Korea. There is a new government, a new president. Conservatives are more hawkish on North Korea, and the North Korean certainly do not like that because they prefer a more (INAUDIBLE) administration that is willing to talk to them and negotiate, which is not happening now.",

And so, I'm actually fairly pessimistic.

That is actually a little bit new. And so, it is important, I think, that we do this kind of demonstration counter shows to sort of remind them.Ultimately, I think that what it does is it contains North Korea. But that doesn't really stop them. They will continue to test again, I think, primarily because the conventional (INAUDIBLE) on the peninsula is sort of eroding and North Korea really needs to step up the equalization benefit of missiles and nuclear weapons, which are much harder to defend against.

There has been criticism that Biden is not really taking it very seriously because he's distracted by inflation and Ukraine war and so on. I think the real issue for the North Koreans, I think they really wanted two things. First, they want sanctions rollback. The sanctions have gotten pretty harsh on North Korea since 2017. They've taken a pretty significant bite out of the economy. This is far as we can sort of gather the data from North Korea (ph).They also want recognition that they are, in fact, a nuclear weapon state. The North Koreans have fought for 30 or 40 years, maybe even longer, in order to climb into this status. They have made enormous sacrifices to get these weapons. They don't want to trade them away. They want us to recognize that they have them and that these things are not bargaining chips at the table, that they are going to keep them. This is something that the Biden administration and U.S. allies just don't want to admit. We do not want to formally say that North Korea has nuclear weapons. We are hoping to get them to some kind of arms control deal or something, and they just don't want them. I think that is why you have a stalemate at the moment.",

We should get some kind of an arm control deal, we should get inspectors, cameras or something. What we shouldn't just do is give things away. All that will do is bring the North Korean back further. So, if we're going to deal with the North Koreans, we are going to make these major concessions and recognitions and stuff like that, then I would argue that we should get something. Something fairly substantial, too, right? If we rollback sanctions, that allows North Korea to reconnect to the world economy and that would help their military and things like that.
