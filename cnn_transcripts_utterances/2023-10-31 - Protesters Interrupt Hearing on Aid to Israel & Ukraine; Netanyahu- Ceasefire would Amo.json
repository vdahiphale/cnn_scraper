And mock not lest ye be mocked Donald Trump quick to make fun of President via Biden's verbal missteps, now Trump making gaffes -- . Hello, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It is 11 am here in Washington Tuesday, October 31. There are 76 days until the Iowa caucus and 370 days until Election Day. This is today's \"State the Race\". And we start this hour in Israel which say they're intensifying military operation in Gaza has hit hundreds of Hamas targets over the past day destroying infrastructure and killing fighters, including what Israeli intelligence says is the commander who directed the October 7th attacks, in which over 1400 people were killed. The IDF says his death significantly harms efforts by Hamas to disrupt Israeli ground activities. Inside Gaza, eight officials say relentless Israeli assaults are dehumanizing the entire population. The U.N.'s Emergency Relief Coordinator calls the trauma they've endured beyond devastating. The expanding operation is complicating efforts to free 240 hostages believe to be held by Hamas in Gaza. One of those hostages and Israeli soldier is free today after what Israel's military calls a successful rescue operation by troops and security forces. She's there in the middle of this photo reunited with her family she is said to be in good health. Jeremy Diamond joins me now from Southern Israel not far from the border with Gaza. Jeremy thanks very much for being here. What is underway right now, in terms of the Israeli offensive against Gaza?",

      "sentences": "Well, as we enter the fifth day of this ground defensive, expanded ground operations as the IDF is characterizingit what we have been hearing and seeing throughout the day is ongoing artillery fire, you may have just heard some outgoing artillery just behind me. And we've also been hearing machine gunfire indicating that there are active battles ongoing inside of Gaza, between Israeli forces and Hamas militants. What's clear, we're getting some a bit of a clearer picture of the advance of Israeli troops who are entering not only from the north, as we saw in the first day of this offensive. Both the Northeastern most corner entering into Beit Hanoun, which is right behind me right now, but also along the coastline, the Northwestern coastline, two lines of advance from the North. But then we also saw a video of a tank spotted just South of Gaza City at a main junction at the entrance to the city, indicating that they are closing in on Gaza City. Hamas is stronghold from three different axes. But they are proceeding cautiously. And we've been hearing as over the last several days, the aerial bombardments have continued but they have subsided and what has taken its place is this heavy artillery fire and then also close air support. So troops on the ground coordinating with the Israeli Air Force to conduct more targeted strikes on specific buildings where they've identified that there are Hamas fighters. Now over the last day or so about 300 targets have been struck by the Israeli military that includes Hamas command posts, as well as those underground tunnels, dozens of miles of which Hamas is using to try and evade Israeli forces to conduct attacks on forces. As well as Israeli towns and cities by firing rockets, but also to potentially ambush those forces as they enter the more densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip. So all of this is ongoing, and we're starting to see a pickup in some of that artillery fire. You may have just heard that boom just now. So again, a very dynamic situation and the Israeli military making clear that they are going to continue to expand this ground operation and continue to add troops inside Gaza, Kasie.",

My question to you, do you think that the Biden Administration is striking the right tone in terms of supporting Israel's right to defend itself on the one hand.

But asSecretary Blinken said, today, it is pretty stunning how quickly people have forgotten the horrific crimes committed by Hamas. 1400 plus Israelis dead, some of them in brutal execution, style murders. And it's just not in accordance with U.S. national security goals for Hamas to get away with this. If they do other terrorist groups that have intent on attacking the United States will feel a permission structure a license to launch attacks against us. But of course, you don't have to choose between holding Hamas accountable and protecting civilians. And so part of this hearing is about getting some answers to, I think, very important questions that we have in the United States Senate. Is Israel's war plan sufficient to beat Hamas? Is it designed to protect civilians? Can we guarantee that more humanitarian aid gets into Gaza? It is not in Israel's interest for this war to be conducted in a way that creates more terrorists than it eliminates. It's not in Israel's interest to get involved in a quagmire here that stains its reputation, and its partner's reputation around the world. So important questions we're going to be asking today in this hearing.",

Joe Biden is for they are going to be against which is why you have a lot of Republicans turning against Ukraine aid. Jack Lew is an incredibly capable and skilled practitioner.

Obviously, Kasie, you know how much gun violence care matters to meet it was President Biden that helped get done the first gun safety measure of any significance in 30 years.

And this is a political problem for him. It's a problem for President Biden. It's a problem for Israel. You said in your interview with Senator Murphy, he said you do not have to choose between responding to those terrible attacks on October 7, and protecting civilians in Gaza.

And it seems to go right to this conversation because you say you note that while he has been with Israel staunchly since October 7th, you say his message has shifted dramatically over the past three weeks, while he continues to declare unambiguous support for Israel. Mr. Biden and his top military and diplomatic officials have become more critical of Israel's response to the terrorist attacks and the unfolding humanitarian crisis. What more can you tell us about this? And how does it tie in to what we heard from Bibi overnight? DAVID SANGER, CNN POLITICAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Well, it ties in directly because the Israelis are quite sensitive to the fact that the tone has shifted within the administration. You're hearing Secretary Blinken, you're hearing Secretary Austin and others say, it makes a big difference how you do this. We heard Jake Sullivan on one of the Sunday shows during the weekend, say hospitals are not a legitimate target at the very moment that the Israelis were sending a notification or hospitals to clear out because they believed just as General Mark suggested that there were Hamas headquarters or command centers within the hospital. So listen to what, Kasie, listen to what President Biden said three days after the attack. He said, speaking about his conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, he said, I told him, if the United States experienced what Israel is experiencing, our response would be swift, decisive and overwhelming. Those are not three words who have heard from American officials in the past week or so, because they are so concerned about being tied to this effort. Now, it is possible that as the Israelis moves more deliberately now in what seems to be a squeeze action on Gaza City, that they'll get more comfortable with it. But clearly, they're not yet.",

This is something that tends to divide Democrats, progressive Democrats and younger Democrats are the least supportive of what Israel is doing and the most concerned about the state of the Palestinians. These are of course, everything is not political. But in this case, these are the base voters for President Biden, if he hopes to win reelection next year.

And in Trump's case, look, he shouldn't be talking about anyone else being senile, or, you know, losing a step. Because he clearly makes all these outrageous statements, some of which are intentional, some are not. And so I think, you know, he's, he's got a real problem, because a lot of voters do think Joe Biden's too old. But a lot of people don't think that Donald Trump has it all together, either.

But to many voters, it does not raise questions about his age or his vigor. We know from all the polling that's been done, how much concern there is about the age of, of not just Biden, but of our politicians generally. You know, we did a poll last week with Suffolk University in which 72 percent of Americans said, we should set a maximum age for federal office holders for the president and for members of congress.

I mean, these two men, and we're, you know, we're making an assumption that Donald Trump ultimately becomes the Republican presidential nominee, his challengers are all much younger.

The thing that will be interesting though in the general election is when they are three years apart, and they both get up there and they make stumbles, perhaps or misstatements. What Joe Biden will be able to do though is say, Trump's misstatements probably will be a little off the rail though. They will be, you know, World War Two, not when we already have fought in World War Two. They will be misquoting who was elected and maybe making some very inappropriate statements saying like Hezbollah is smart. And so Joe Biden can take that and say, this is why he is unfit to be president and then potentially be able to pivot whether you agree with his policies or not. I may be 80, but I have been able to govern by part with bipartisan nature, here's my policy, here where I am. And I think the voters will then be able to make that distinction.

The fact is that and this is also why the White House is so defensive, whenever this is brought up and they bristle at the suggestions because, but the back matter is also that there's a performance aspects of this job in this era.

There is a lot of possibility here for really making voters pretty angry, feel disenfranchised.

That said, I think, ultimately, this is all going to end up in the Supreme Court, they're going to end up making the decision. It'd be very difficult for secretaries of states around the country to determine the eligibility of Donald Trump. I think it's hard, I think most are going to not want to be in that position. They're going to stay let the voters decide.

I also think though, because it is in the state of Colorado, which Joe Biden won by 55 percent, the likelihood that the voters become so outraged in the state of Colorado that they would protest. Because they feel like they've been disenfranchised if Donald Trump is removed off the ballot. Might not have as been as big as political consequence as say if it was in a Wisconsin or a Pennsylvania or a Michigan because those are deciding state. But the other thing is yet again, for Democrats provides an opportunity to say Donald Trump is not fit to be president and to be elected again, because he played a substantial role in the insurrection and it is a threat to our democracy. So there are many cases I think, is another reminder to voters, why we don't want Donald Trump. And honestly I mean, Republican candidates in the primary won't use this right now. But they can use this to their advantages.
