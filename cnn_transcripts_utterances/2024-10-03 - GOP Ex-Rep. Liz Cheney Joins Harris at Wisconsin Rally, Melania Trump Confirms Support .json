He is petty. He has vindictive, and he is cruel, and Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation. KAMALA HARRIS (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Every endorsement matters and this endorsement matters a great deal, Liz, and it carries a special significance because as you said, we may not see eye to eye on every issue and we are going to get back to a healthy two-party system, I'm sure of that where we will have vigorous debates.

Today, with us as well, CNN political commentators, Bakari Sellers and former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger. He served on the January 6th committee with Liz Cheney and like her has endorsed Vice President Harris. Also, CNN's Kristen Holmes, who's traveling with the Trump campaign. So Congressman, how important and maybe surreal is it for voters to see Liz Cheney up on that stage campaigning with Kamala Harris?   ADAM KINZINGER, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well it's, probably pretty surreal. It's very important because again, if this is kind of the Republican base, a significant amount are sold on Trump and they're going nowhere. But there's an amount of Republicans here that are embarrassed by him, but they still think there's some vestige of the old party left. And I just remind them as I'd remind everybody, look, Liz Cheney, I mean, I'm conservative. Liz Cheney makes me look like a raving liberal. She's extremely conservative. Our viewpoints haven't changed from when she was number three in line for the party. She was the number third most powerful Republican when I was called a rising star in the party. So what changed? Well, the answer this is really simple. We did not bow the knee and pledge allegiance to Donald Trump. So, anybody that tries to pretend like somehow this party is the same party and this is the group were talking to. You can't say that. It's literally just do you commit to Donald Trump or not? And after what we saw, particularly on the January 6th Committee and what we saw with the filing yesterday with Jack Smith, this guy is absolutely unqualified to sit again in the Oval Office and have nuclear codes.",

The Democratic Party finds itself at an interesting crossroads today. I mean, you have the kind of ill-fate of losing the endorsement or not gaining the endorsement of the Firefighter's Union. But on the flip side, you see Kamala Harris doing something that is just fundamentally fascinating, which is one, go to places Democrats don't normally go. Fight after every single vote and I'm not sure you've ever seen anyone cobble together a coalition that looks like Bernie Sanders, AOC, Taylor Swift, Bruce Springsteen and now you actually have Liz Cheney and her father, as well as adding Kissinger, as well as Geoff Duncan.

And that, this isn't that big of a surprise to those people. One thing, Anderson, that I cannot stress enough is the fact that Donald Trump privately understands that he's not going to get a lot of these moderate voters. He might say that he's trying to appeal to women, but part of the strategy isn't really going after these moderate in the middle independent voters because there is a belief that they'll never vote for Donald Trump.

She's still an underdog. But the fact that she's going to places in Wisconsin, the Democrats don't often go to. The fact she's standing with Liz Cheney, but she's also talking about making sure that Black men and Hispanic men are heard.

I think that was an election. That may well have been stolen when you look at the rampant, egregious voter fraud in Illinois under Richard J. Daley, in Texas under Lyndon Johnson. I think those states might have been stolen from Richard Nixon. And Nixon came under a lot of pressure from the Republican Party to contest it. And in the end, he decided, no, I got to do what's right for the country, not what's right for me. I can't contest an election. Put it in the courts at the height of a cold war. And he conceded. He met with Kennedy about a week after the election. And most tellingly and shows the resonance and the contrast in 2020 on January 6th of 20 -- of 1961 as his job, he's certified the counting of the electoral vote that John Kennedy, who was in the House chamber at the time, had won, had beaten him and congratulated him and said, this shows the strength of our democracy.",
