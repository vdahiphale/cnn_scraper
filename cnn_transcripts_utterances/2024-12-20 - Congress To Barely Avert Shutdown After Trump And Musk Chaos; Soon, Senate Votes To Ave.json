Americans with different perspectives aren't talking to each other, but here, they do. (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP (on camera): Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about, Christmas isn't canceled, good news. After Donald Trump and Elon Musk threw a grenade into the bipartisan deal to keep the government open, Congress is about to get its act together and avoid a shutdown with just two hours until the deadline, at least we hope so. Any moment now, the Senate is expected to follow the House's lead by passing a clean version of the government funding bill. But it leaves off one big Trump demand, killing the debt limit. Sources say Trump is frustrated tonight behind the scenes and has been warned that he could be blamed if the government did end up closing. Meanwhile, the pressure is off, Speaker Mike Johnson, for now. Elon Musk is showing support tonight for the Speaker, writing on X, the speaker did a good job here, given the circumstances. But the episode has some Democrats calling Musk the real president, a narrative that he tried to put an end to on X. He wrote this, the political and legacy media puppets all got their new instructions yesterday and are now parroting the same message to drive a wedge between Trump and me. They will fail. It's interesting little phraseology there by Elon Musk. He seems worried that this is a scenario in which he could have a wedge being driven between Trump and him, because everybody knows Trump reads the papers, he reads Twitter, he sees what people are saying, and he doesn't like to be anybody's second fiddle. Do you think there's a risk here? CHARLIE DENT (R) FORMER U.S. CONGRESSMAN, PENNSYLVANIA: Absolutely. I mean, there's going to be a collision here between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Elon Musk got way out in front of Donald Trump on this continuing resolution agreement. And, basically, Musk kneecapped Speaker Johnson, and Trump gave an assist. So, I have to think that, you know, Donald Trump can't be too happy that Musk is trying to dictate how the Congress should operate.",

But for Elon Musk, he could actually survive this, because unlike many other people who have been around Trump, who have gotten out ahead of him, even Steve Bannon, who, when he got the Time Magazine cover of Man of the Year, that did not sit right with the former president. Elon Musk doesn't need money from him, doesn't need the T.V. time, is already the world's richest person. So, the idea that he doesn't need anything from Trump could actually work in his favor.KATIE FROST, FORMER AIDE, TED CRUZ PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN 2016: And also people have tried to do this before. Remember, there were a lot of stories going around, he's too visible in Mar-a-Lago. Why is Elon always there? And that didn't work to drive a wedge between him and President Trump.

He's on track to become the first trillionaire, right? He, at a base level, desires attention. He is childlike in that way. It's why he couldn't resist getting out ahead of the president -- excuse me, the incoming president of the United States, nominally and torpedoing this continuing resolution.
