Abortion rights, though, not even mentioned until more than 90 minutes into the debate despite Democrats winning major victories in multiple states in Tuesday's elections.

It's very easy for Democrats to say well, he's talking about 15 weeks now but the reality is that may mean with a Republican legislature or a State Senate, that's 10 weeks, eight weeks, six weeks -- and that's very real political quicksand for Republicans.",

And every person on that stage wanted to see Roe v. Wade overturned. There's no dispute about that.But you also have to acknowledge the political reality of what has happened since the abortion ban was overturned. Every time this has been on the ballot, people in the individual states have voted to protect abortion rights in the states. And that's what Republicans wanted -- pro-life Republicans wanted is to take this issue out of the hands of unelected justices and put it in the hands of people in the states. And now that they have it they are protecting abortion rights. And what Nikki Haley has said -- let's not demonize people on this issue. Let's not judge those who are pro-life, let's not judge those who are pro-choice, but let's find a rational and meaningful limit on abortions that we can all agree to. Not only that, let's be honest with the American people. What could pass in the U.S. Senate? What could pass in the House? What could be signed by a president? And whether or not that is a 15-week abortion limit, whether it is a six-week limit, let's find what works to protect the sanctity of life. And let's also protect and make sure that we have a ceiling on what is too far to allow abortions. And I think that is the sweet spot on this very difficult, very emotional issue.

Honestly, if we're having this conversation a week for now is there a specific line from this debate or any previous debate that any voters remember? No. And ultimately, it's because Republican candidates, by and large, have refused to take the gloves off and go after Donald Trump and they've reinforced him and shored him up to make sure that he is going to be the next nominee.

He's considered kind of the second tier who might not even make the next debate stage.I think that's what scares off a lot of these other Republicans from going too hard against Donald Trump.

Some of those contrasts will sharpen but you still have to make them. And to Tia's point, what we've seen from so many of these candidates is what we know in politics doesn't work.
