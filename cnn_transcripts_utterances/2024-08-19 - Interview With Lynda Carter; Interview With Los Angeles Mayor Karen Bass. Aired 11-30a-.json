I think that having those years under this fear and of disruption and of hate and of misogyny has been so disruptive to our psyche, that having this breath of fresh air come rushing into us, come at this time in our lives, and then with Tim, who is just a wonderful person and so sincere, that it has really changed -- I wake up in the morning and I'm singing.

Wade. What is your sense of where that issue is shaping up and how it will potentially decide this election? What do you think?",

And it's that the government has no place in this decision-making process. They aren't doctors. They aren't -- most -- they are not women for the most part. And the idea of that intrusion into your life is just unimaginable. And I will do everything in my power and in my pocketbook to change that. We have seen the repercussions of it. And that's 40 percent of the United States is under these draconian mandates of anti-abortion, 40 percent of the states. That's shocking. And we have to do something about it. And I hope that we just knock every single Republican off the ticket if we can. Vote blue, vote blue, vote blue. It has nothing to do with anything that is religious. It has nothing to do with that. It has to do with overreach by government. And I'm opposed to it. ACOSTA:  Yes, and, Lynda, I mean, one of the things that we have been hearing out on the campaign trail, Donald Trump engaging in some very personal attacks aimed at Kamala Harris, criticizing her laugh and all sorts of things.
