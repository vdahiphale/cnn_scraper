Jim Acosta is off.And tonight, an attorney for former President Trump blames the media for Trump's claim that he'll be arrested on Tuesday in Manhattan. In a statement to CNN, Joe Tacopina says, \"No one tells us anything which is very frustrating. President Trump is basing his response on press reports and the fact that this is a political prosecution, and the D.A. leaks things to the press instead of communicating to the lawyers as they should.\" Now, this drama began earlier today on Trump's Truth Social page. After predicting his arrest on Tuesday, the former president urged his supporters to, quote, \"Take back our nation.\" And tonight his campaign is already fundraising off of his claims, which have not been confirmed. There is no indication that he will be arrested Tuesday. Now sources tell me and my colleague Kristen Holmes that Trump's legal team has gotten no word from the Manhattan district attorney's office about the timing of any possible indictment. Another source says the former president has been pushing his team to get the base riled up over the idea because he believes it would help him politically. CNN's Katelyn Polantz is following the latest developments in this longtime investigation into possible hush money payments.",

A spokesperson for Trump said this morning in a statement that there has been no indication formally from the Manhattan district attorney's office that Trump is about to be indicted or arrested.However, we do know that this ongoing investigation into possible financial crimes may be falsification of business records at the Trump Organization all connecting back to that $130,000 payment that Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen made to Stormy Daniels to cover up things that she wanted to allege in his 2016 campaign. All of that investigation is nearing the end because Trump was invited to testify which he had the right to do. He declined to do that. That is the sort of thing that happens at the very end of a grand jury investigation like this. But we do know that there is another witness coming into the grand jury on Monday, at least scheduled to be testifying. And so at this point in time, we don't know exactly when or exactly what charges may be approved or maybe asked to be approved by the grand jury sitting in Manhattan in this unprecedented investigation that could lead to a criminal charge against the former president of the United States -- Paula.",

That's directly from January 6th. But the language that he used on January 6th somehow, something is being taken away from me, and I have to fight essentially with violence to get it back. The times have changed. And Trump will begin to realize that. I mean, one is he's not in power so he can't direct law enforcement agencies. Hundreds of people are in jail or been indicted. He cannot promise to pardon people. Law enforcement as we're reporting is clearly on notice. And he's thrown out this Tuesday day. I kind of doubt it.

And I think if you just sort of look back since January 6th, there's tremendous amount of evidence as well that that was the peak. And that he's just not able essentially to fill a room.

And part of that was coming up with a plan for various scenarios. One of them being how to get Trump in and out of New York. The other, preparing for the potential of a remote hearing. As we've talked about, as your sources told you, legal advisers are telling him, hey, you should ask for this remote hearing. But it's unclear whether or not he's going to take them up on that because Trump himself has told some of them he wants to make a statement in front of the courthouse. Now a lot of their plan has also revolved around messaging as it always does with former President Trump. That is what he really cares about. We know that he is considering hiring a TV friendly lawyer to handle all these communications. They've already built up their staff for people who are just going to focus on messaging. And part of that messaging is that this is to make him politically stronger. What we're starting to hear is Republicans kind of getting on board with that messaging.

It is being handled by the Criminal Investigations Division, which is separate from the chain of command at Fort Hood.
