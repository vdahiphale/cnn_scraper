The plot includes also then blaming the attack on Ukraine. Russia denies the allegations. We've learned that also that the U.S. Defense Secretary just spoke on the phone with his Russian counterpart.Let's get over to CNN's Nic Robertson. He's in Kyiv for us at this hour. Nic, talk to me first about what you're learning more about this plot that President Zelenskyy is warning of.",

      "sentences": "Yes. This plot can potentially be very dangerous. There could be downstream and upstream problems and just only a few days ago, it was Russian officials who were saying it was Ukraine that we're going to potentially blow up this dam. Now what the Ukrainian officials are saying is that the Nova Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, a dam on the important and big Dnipro River, just upstream from Kherson is going to be blown by the Russians.They say that they've seen them placing explosives around some of the sluice gates. And they also say that they've spotted two Russian army trucks with like big tents on the back of them that the Ukrainians believe a pack full of explosives actually parked on the top of the dam waiting to be blown up. So if you blow it -- if the Russians blow it, then that is going to -- that is just going to spew a massive amount of water downstream, destroying some villages, pushing people out of their homes, potentially killing them, and also making it harder for the Ukrainians to advance to push Russian forces further out of Ukraine in the coming weeks and months in the direction they're going right now. But upstream, that's a potentially whole other problem that could be potentially much more dangerous. Because upstream of that dam, you have the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. It uses the water and the dam in the river for its cooling system. And what were Ukrainian authorities are concerned if Russia blows the dam, the water washes downstream, washes out all those towns and villages, and there isn't enough water left to run the cooling in that nuclear power plant. And that's very clearly a huge danger.",

One program, however, working against that deficit reduction, wiping out a big chunk of the savings is spending on the student debt relief plan from the Biden administration.That plan saw an important win this week before the Supreme Court. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, rejecting a challenge to the President's student loan forgiveness plan, a challenge brought by a Wisconsin taxpayer group seeking to end the program. As it stands now, borrowers can apply to have up to $20,000 in student loans canceled, and that could start happening as soon as Sunday. Joining me right now is the Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. Secretary, thank you for being here. The loan forgiveness plan has survived this challenge, we see what -- from the court. But there are other lawsuits percolating in the federal courts seeking to stop this effort. Should people carrying this debt that are going to take part in this program, should they be 100 percent confident this isn't going to get blown up by a court case? MIGUEL CARDONA, U.S. EDUCATION SECRETARY: Look, we feel a lot of these lawsuits are baseless. We're going to continue fighting for the American people. And hey, I want to frame it differently than the way you said it. I look at this as providing dollars in the pockets of over 40 million Americans. Middle-class Americans making less than $75,000, we know 90 percent of these dollars are going to folks making under that amount. So it's helping the American people at a time of need as it gets through this pandemic.",

Conservative party leaders in Britain are facing a tight deadline to elect their next prime minister. Moments ago, the first candidate actually announced her bid to replace Liz Truss, but all eyes are still on former Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Yes, that Boris Johnson who is gaining some support from people within Truss's government.CNN's Bianca Nobilo is live in London with the latest development. The hits and twist just keep coming, Bianca. What do we know about who the next prime minister could be? BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: developments are coming thick and fast, Kate because as you say this entire process has now been condensed to just a week. It could even happen before then. Now we have one candidate that has officially declared and that's Penny Mordaunt. She currently holds quite a prestigious position in the cabinet. She's the leader of the House of Commons. She's the first-ever female defense secretary in the United Kingdom. And she's impressed lately when she's had to stand in for the prime minister, in name only, Liz Truss in parliament. People have been impressed with her authority, her sense of humor, and her charisma. And she announced on Twitter just an hour or so ago that she was encouraged by colleagues to stand and she wants to do it to unite the party, and because she believed it was in the national interest and she hopes to win the next general election for the conservatives. She's most popular with the center of the party. So it's interesting now that she's officially declared, it will make it harder for those other candidates and one particular bombastic blonde elephant in the room to get to the threshold they need to get to the next stage of the leadership contest because she will be stealing quite a few of their votes.",
