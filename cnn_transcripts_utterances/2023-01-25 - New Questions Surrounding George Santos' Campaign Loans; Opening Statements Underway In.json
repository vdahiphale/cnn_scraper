Santos who is as you know, in hot water for fabrications about his finances and his biography, and his resume. He previously said that he lent his campaign about $700,000. CNN's Jessica Dean joins us now live from Capitol Hill. So, what do the new filings say?",

So, you just mentioned, Victor, that he had previously said he personally loaned his campaign just over $700,000. Well, in this new, amended filing or filings as it were, there are a couple of loans, one for about $500,000, another for $125,000, and now the boxes to indicate that those came from personal funds are left unchecked. So it raises a lot of questions about where this money came from. If it didn't come from personal funds, where did it come from? Of course, these are very large sums of money, and there were already a lot of questions about where he personally would have gotten some $700,000.

I can barely keep track of the various lies.However, the campaign filings might be in a different category. One of the watchdog groups that looks at these things, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington says it could be that this is the single sloppiest bookkeeping of any candidate we've ever seen. It is the most confusing SEC filing we've ever seen. This is in a different category and maybe will there be repercussions for this one?",

Listen, he's going to run out his Congressional seat until the next cycle. But the SEC will catch up with him on this. This is not something you can play fast in loose with, saying you're contributing -- are loaning your campaign money when in reality, you're not showing where that money is coming from. This is where he's most likely to get caught up.
