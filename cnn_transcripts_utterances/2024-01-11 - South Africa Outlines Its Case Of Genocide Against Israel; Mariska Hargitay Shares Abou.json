And that is what South Africans are trying to change here. By getting this on the public record, they hope it will force the world to get up and take notice.But no sooner had the South African lawyers finished that there was already a rebuttal from the Israelis in the shape of a spokesman for their foreign ministry. We have a listen, first of all, to South Africans and then to what followed. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TEMBEKA NGCUKAITOBI. SOUTH AFRICA'S SENIOR COUNSEL: Israel's special genocidal intent is rooted in the belief that in fact, the enemy is not just the military wing of Hamas or, indeed, Hamas generally, but is embedded in the fabric of Palestinian life in Gaza.",

But for today, it was three hours of chilling testimony about what has gone on in Gaza so far, based on the evidence provided by the United Nations, its agencies, some of its highest officials, people who've been on the ground about what they've seen going on. The idea here is to put before the court these allegations of genocide. They could take years for the International Court of Justice to rule on.In the immediate future, what South Africa are hoping is that this injunction will force Israel to sit up and listen, pause its hostilities, that the rest of the world, and specifically the United Nations, can get in to figure out exactly what's been going on -- Brianna and Boris.",

      "sentences": "She says for years, survivors that watch the show credited her for giving them strength, but those survivors have been her source of strength.With us now is psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, Dr. Gail Saltz. I mean, Dr. Saltz, I think that Mariska Hargitay, as the character that she played for years, she's been such a heroine to rape victims, even starting the Joyful Heart Foundation as well. But even she says that for the longest time, she didn't identify as a victim, she didn't think about this as a rape, she really couldn't process that it had actually happened to her until she started to talk about it and realized, oh my goodness, yes it did. How common is that? DR. GAIL SALTZ, PSYCHIATRIST AND PSYCHOANALYST: Actually, it really is common, and that is because rape is tremendously traumatic and sometimes after a traumatic event, our minds basically repress a memory. It's really a defense mechanism to spare us from becoming so overwhelmingly anxious and depressed in the face of trauma that these memories are suppressed and we don't have access to them. Sometimes it's called dissociative amnesia. You don't remember and then it may be much later, perhaps a trigger happens, something that reminds you in any way of the event and you might then have an intrusive memory and more and more memories. And later you may be able to process that in a different way than you could have earlier and be able to manage, work your way through trauma, develop resilience, coping tools, as she seems to have done, and come out to another place. That's what it sounds like, it is a very common occurrence.",

She said she didn't want it to escalate to sexual violence and then she realized looking back on it that it was sexual violence. And there's this common perception that unless it escalates to this, you know, very violent fighting back situation, that it isn't actually a real rape.And for anything less than that, especially there is victim blaming. It really is something that needs to be changed. But I wonder how you do change that.",

      "sentences": "Well, this is this is a good step because she is a huge celebrity with a following. And so, a lot of people are listening. But generally education, education to potential victims out there, but also education in terms of policy and courtrooms where often, again, women either do not bring it to a courtroom because they're afraid, because they self-blame, or they get blamed in a courtroom because it is not understood that, in fact, freezing is probably the most common thing to happen to a woman during a sexual assault.And that is because the flight or fight response is basically moved into a freeze response because the woman doesn't see a quick exit to the situation and because she fears escalating the violence against her, as this person said she feared. And until I think, you know, lawyers understand this, judges understand this, basically the public at large, it is hard to make a shift. So I think education is important. I think the kind of philanthropic organization she started is important because they do education and they support women and help them understand in the moment that this is what happened. And it means that they are the victim and the person who did this is fully the perpetrator. They have no responsibility.",

When you're looking at that tumor, you're also thinking about the fact that fluid may build up on top of the brain. So sometimes you have to remove some of that excess fluid. And then you also want to actually do an operation to take out thetumor. What you have to assume with these types of tumors, because they're malignant, is that no matter how much of the tumor you've removed during the operation, that there may still be some tumor that's remaining. And that's why radiation is often given, which is something Isabella has already received. And she will be getting chemotherapy as well. So it's an aggressive tumor requiring aggressive treatment.",
