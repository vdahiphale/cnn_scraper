Catherine Cortez Masto gets to stay as the senator from the state of Nevada and with that, the Democrats get to keep and maintain control of the U.S. Senate.Here's how it all went down. The Republican Adam Laxalt was in the lead for days and then on Saturday evening, Clark County released a batch of about 23,000 votes. And here's how those votes were divided, Catherine Cortez Masto receiving about 14,000 of those votes or 60 percent of the vote. Laxalt received more than 8,000 votes or about 35 percent of that batch. Now that put Catherine Cortez Masto in the lead, and CNN called the race at that point in time. Her campaign taking to Twitter saying, quote, \"What did people get wrong about this race? The first Latina Senator knows her community better than anonymous sources. The daughter of a Teamster knows how to fight for working families and CCM's or Catherine Cortez Masto's a formal AG -- and crime attacks couldn't stick.\" Again, the Democrat here, Catherine Cortez Masto, keeps her seat and stays as senator of Nevada.",

After falling short of expectations in the midterms, Kevin McCarthy's path to become House Speaker has become a bit more complicated. And some Republican senators are also calling for a delay in the leadership vote before committing to Mitch McConnell, as minority leader. For more on all this, let's bring in Capitol Hill Reporter Melanie Zanona. So a lot of jockeying taking place behind the scenes, Melanie. Mitch McConnell, you know, was hoping to become the majority leader after the midterms. But we see that's not going to happen. So he is, however, facing dissension within the ranks. Explain.",

They said we need more time to figure out what went wrong, especially after it was just determined last night that Democrats are going to hold on to the Senate and potentially pick up another seat depending on the Georgia runoff. And then there's at least one Republican Josh Hawley, who has publicly said he's not going to support Mitch McConnell for that job. Of course, the blame game is heating up behind the scenes. There is an effort by Trump and some of his allies to try to make Mitch McConnell the Fall Guy. But there's a lot of frustration and finger-pointing at Donald Trump himself.

Speaking of that pillar of bygone Republican ideology. He said, you know, if they lose, it's their fault. If they win, it is, you know, to me. I think, you know, partly, he may be announcing in order to forestall an indictment, but just because you're an announced candidate does not immunize you from an indictment only if you are a sitting president. Moreover, a Trump announcement may hurt Republicans in the Georgia run off on December 6, because it might energize Democrats. And, you know, the big reason why Walker came so close to Warnock in the initial round was that Republicans believed a vote for Warnock might -- vote for Walker rather might give them control the Senate, that's off the board.

LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, you know, President Biden landed here in Indonesia about two and a half hours ago to attend the G20 Summit. And you're right that there is so much on the agenda. Of course, this summit is taking place in front of the backdrop of the ongoing war in Ukraine. We know that leaders will want to talk about the economic challenges that that war has posed across the globe. And we also know that they will talk about other important issues like climate change, and the President Biden essentially will have a very busy couple of days as he meets with various world leaders. But the President's meeting with Xi Jinping of China, that really is said to be the highlight of this summit. Because keep in mind, the two men haven't met face to face ever since President Biden took office, even though of course, they have a working relationship that goes back years back to when President Biden was vice president. And it really does come at a real low point for U.S.-China relations. That tension really was exacerbated when House Speaker Nancy Pelosi recently visited Taiwan. And President Biden before he left Cambodia earlier today explained to reporters that he thinks this meeting could really help the two leaders understand each other's red lines. Take a listen.

Climate Summit in Egypt. But thousands of miles away in the American Southwest, the effects of climate change couldn't be more real. This is Arizona's La Paz County where shallow wells are bone dry, amid a worsening mega drought. Last year when water workers in Wenden, Arizona lowered a camera into the town's well, they noticed the normally still water was moving. The reason, according to officials, the water was being pumped rapidly out of the ground by a neighboring well. That well owned by a UAE-based company Aldora (ph), that farms alfalfa in the southwest to feed cattle overseas. Well one of those officials, Gary Saiter, joining me now from Wenden, Arizona. He is the head of the Local Water Improvement District. So good to see you. So you told CNN that you said you've never seen anything like this before. Tell us what you were thinking when you saw images after dropping that camera into the well?",

And when we were videoing the inside of that well to inspect it, they stop it every now and then and to get a still picture.And I saw water moving through the casing and generally that water it's not like a river underground, is still. And I asked the well guys who had much more experience even than I did, if they had ever seen it before, and they said no. And that was -- that well that was pumping was about a half a mile from where we are. WHITFIELD: And so, let me also put up this graphic, you know, that shows well use typically in Arizona. And you can see how deep residential homes and farms have to drill based on the groundwater levels. And you can also see how much deeper wells have to be in 2022 than they were in the 1950s. So what does this mean for people living in La Paz County and their water use?",

And it has to be below the water level so that the pump and motor that goes inside the well is not exposed to air because that'll burn it up. And a lot of people around our area who had wells between that range, they've gone dry now. And I can tell you that in 1957 where we are right now, the water levels were 107 feet.In 2013, that was 469. And this year, it's now 541 feet deep. That's out of the beach financially for most individual resident. Our Water Department, water wells are 1,500 feet deep. So from a municipal standpoint, we're OK. But if we were individuals drilling here, that would be very problematic.",

And this part of town, the northern part of town saw some severe flooding, which it never does. And what has happened is that they have changed the natural water flow on the farm. And the farm starts not even half a mile from here. It's right on the edge of town.And that change caused the water to flow right down the ditches and down the road into the town, bringing an enormous amount of silt, caused some property damage. And we have a video of it and it looks like a river. And it's about a 1.5 foot deep when it comes in here. Generally, that water naturally would flow into the centennial wash and buy (INAUDIBLE). But because the changes they've made it now comes into town.",
