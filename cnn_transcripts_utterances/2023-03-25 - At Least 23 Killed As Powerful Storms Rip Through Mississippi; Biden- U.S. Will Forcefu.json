So in total, we have 12 tornado reports, just from the last 24 hours and about 60 damaging wind reports. But as you noted, when you look at the bulk of those reports, it really all forms this one straight line starting in Rolling Fork going all the way up just south of Huntsville.Now, it may or may not have been on the ground the entire time, it may be what we call a jump or where it goes back up comes back down multiple times along the path. But there were other tornado warnings in numerous other places. So it's still likely we'll have more than one tornado total. But yes, this one long path here it is very possible. This was just one extremely long-lived tornado that caused such significant damage. The one thing to note is this system is not done yet. Well today, we don't anticipate quite as severe of storms that we had yesterday, the system is still packing a punch on the northern end, the big concern is going to be snow and ice. But on the southern edge, we've still had numerous severe thunderstorm warnings throughout the morning. You've got a lot of lightning with these systems and some potential for still some damaging winds going forward today, there's going to be two separate areas of concern. You've got this one off to the north here that includes areas of Virginia and Pennsylvania, but the secondary system down to the south. One thing to note though, is by late tonight, we will finally start to see an end to the main system, but a stationary front sets up along the southeast bringing additional rain and showers and thunderstorms to this area. So unfortunately, Victor and Amara, some of the same communities may get hit again tomorrow, even if it's not a tornado, just some stronger thunderstorms with damaging winds.",

So banking jitters they continue to rattle U.S. markets, Wall Street experienced that yet more volatility on Friday as investors just wait for the next shoe to drop in this banking crisis. Investors are essentially going from the weakest link to the weakest link in the financial system.Remember, first it was Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, then First Republic and Credit Suisse. And now all eyes are on Deutsche Bank. And Deutsche Bank shares, they tumbled almost 9% in Germany, amid concerns about a spike in the cost to insure the bank's debt against the fall. Of course, that is never a good sign. I would note though that mostly Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank has been in turmoil for literally years. But the bank failures in the United States earlier this month, they really cause investors to take a tougher look at banks everywhere. Officials in Europe they were quick to come out on Friday and say look, there's nothing to see here. Everything's fine. The chancellor of Germany said there's, \"no reason to be concerned\" about Deutsche Bank. U.S. officials they've also been keeping very close tabs on all of this banking turmoil. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen held a closed-door meeting with America's top financial regulators on Friday. And you've got to believe that Deutsche Bank came up. And all of this comes after the Fed pushed ahead with this war on inflation, despite calls from some experts to pause and avoid adding to the stress in the banking system. On Friday, I asked Richmond Fed President, Tom Barkin about why the Fed raised rates in the face of all this turmoil? And he basically said the focus right now is squarely on fighting inflation.

That creates uncertainty. It's frankly exhausting.(END VIDEO CLIP) EGAN: Of course, there are costs to getting inflation under control, potentially job loss. Also turmoil in the banking system like we're seeing now. And Barkin, he conceded that there is a risk that the stress in the banking system hurts the real economy by making it more expensive and harder for all of us to borrow. And he conceded that that could cause the Fed to stop raising interest rates soon. But at this point, no one not even the Fed knows exactly how all that's going to play out. Victor and Amara?",

So you tend to question the most important witnesses last, so I think we are getting towards the end of the witnesses they're going to talk to.

And now experts are telling lawmakers that the continued shortages and lack of certain drugs threatens national security.The Senate Homeland Security Committee held hearings on this issue this week and released a report. It found drug shortages increased nearly 30 percent between 2021 and 2022. The causes haven't changed since the last report in 2019. And those include economic drivers, quality issues over reliance on foreign sources, increased demand and logistical and regulatory challenges. Now the report also found drug shortages are increasing and they're lasting longer and of course, impacting patient care. The short supply of cancer drugs is affecting tests and treatments that doctors are able to offer to their patients. My next guest testified on Capitol Hill telling senators a situation is, quote, a tragedy that's happening in slow motion. Dr. Andrew Shuman is an associate professor of Head and Neck Surgery at the University of Michigan Medical School. We really appreciate you joining us, Doctor. Talk to me more about this tragedy happening in slow motion. What have you been seeing and experiencing at least in terms of, you know, what kind of scans I understand that you have been able to offer some patients at the VA but not to others? DR. ANDREW SHUMAN, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN MEDICAL SCHOOL: Yes, this is really quite a tragedy. And really one that's been lasting for more than a decade at this point. The medications that we've struggled to obtain include everything from IV contrast for radiology scans to (INAUDIBLE) to the medications we use to put patients to sleep for surgery as well as when they're critically ill. And frankly, it has become a situation that makes it incredibly difficult to take care of patients on a daily basis.",
