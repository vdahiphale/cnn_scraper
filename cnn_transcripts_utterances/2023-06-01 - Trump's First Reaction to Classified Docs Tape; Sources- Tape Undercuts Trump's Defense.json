Mr. Trump's former attorney will join me live in minutes. Plus, new federal election interference charges filed against a Republican state lawmaker candidate who's accused of shooting his gun at the homes of several Democratic officials.

The first public reaction from former President Donald Trump in response to CNN's blockbuster reporting, since matched by \"The New York Times\" and \"Washington Post,\" in his classified documents case on the campaign trail in Iowa this afternoon. Mr. Trump refused to directly answer questions about a recording now in the hands of federal prosecutors where Trump is said to be talking about classified materials that he kept in his possession after leaving the White House. But the former president did go after those investigators with his usual complaints of being a victim of a witch hunt. In moments, I'm going to be joined by Trump's former lawyer, Tim Parlatore, who left the legal team just a few weeks ago and played a key role in the classified documents investigation. But first, we are going to start with CNN's Paula Reid who is going to take a closer look at how this recording could theoretically impact the federal investigation into Mr. Trump moving forward.

We hear rustling of paper, not sure if that's the document or not.

Whether it's classified or declassified is not an element of that offense. So, I always kind of looked at the whole declassification issue as kind of an extraneous piece because it ultimately isn't going to change anything.

That's what led directly to documents going to his house. I think that when you take all that together, it becomes a very difficult case to bring.

The document must be shown to the jury and the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element that it does constitute national defense information.If you're doing it in a military courtroom where they have the ability to close it and they have jurors who all have security clearances, that's a different thing. If you're doing it in U.S. district court, as they're doing here, and obviously, the only choice when it comes to this defendant, you really do have to bring it out in open court, you have to be able to show it to them. It's one of the reasons why when you have prosecutions of people like Manning or Reality Winner, things like that, or -- now Teixeira in Massachusetts, you can bring those because those documents have already been put out on the Internet. Cases like this, if the allegations are as they say, where the documents have not been publicly released, it becomes much more difficult.

The National Archives and Records Administration, NARA, rents a facility in the hometown where the president is going to move to. They move all the documents to that secured facility where they're under NARA control. The president and his staff over the next two years, they go and they visit the documents, they go through them and they decide what is presidential, what is personal, and then at the end of the two years, all the presidential documents get sent back up to D.C. In this case, NARA chose not to get a facility in Palm Beach for whatever reason. It's also something they haven't done for any vice president. When they don't get that type of facility, then, GSA has no choice but to take these boxes, and then they bring it to the residence of the now former president or former vice president.

They're not coming down for a search. Moreover, the idea that all the boxes must stay in this room and not be moved at all, it ignores the reality that this is not a museum.

The idea that -- yeah, I don't plan on talking about Boris any more than I already have.But one thing I will say is that our disagreement was over litigation strategy. There is nothing that Boris did that in my opinion amounts to any wrongdoing or obstruction. We were trying to do a voluntary search, and we had a difference of opinion. I'm not going to get into any more of the specifics of that, but there's nothing -- certainly nothing criminal about that. That is a disagreement we had and something that, among other things, led to my decision to leave. But a lot of these other statements and everything else, that really is more political questions, and it doesn't change my opinion based solely on the facts and the law that, whether you agree with any of these things or not, it's not something that he should be indicted for and certainly not something that anybody should go to jail over.",
