Every minute brings us closer to learning who will control Congress. The Senate majority rides on these three states, Arizona, Nevada and Georgia. And in those two Southwestern states, we know hundreds of thousands of votes are being counted as we speak. On the House side, control really comes down to a couple of dozen races that are still too close to call. And for Republicans, it's getting ugly. We have new details about GOP and fighting, a revolt from the right flank seeking to oust both Kevin McCarthy and possibly even Mitch McConnell as the parties' respective leaders in the House and Senate. But, first, let's take you to Arizona and CNN's Josh Campbell at the Maricopa County Elections Center. Josh, where do things stand there?",

      "sentences": "Ana, the counting continues here.In the state of Arizona, we're still waiting on over half-a-million ballots to be counted, 340,000 of those in this county alone, Maricopa, the most populous county in the state. And it's worth pointing out that, of those 340,000, 290,000 votes could tell us much more about what is to come. And that is because that is from a tranche of votes that were delivered by residents here to the polling locations, but they were in envelopes. This was the mail-in ballot selection. But for some -- whatever reason, the voters decided to actually hand those to election workers on the day of the election. The officials here tell us that means that's going to take some additional time to count, because they have to go through the process of checking signatures, of checking voter information, all part of this robust process that's under way. And as we look at that information, that could signal to us where this election is going, because if it starts leading to more Republicans showing up in those counts, or more Democrats, for that matter, that may signal about what the final result may be, because we know some Republicans actually suggested to the reporters that they used their mail-in ballots to vote on Election Day. So, a lot we could be learning in the hours to come and throughout the weekend. This is all coming on as election officials here continue to bat down a host of conspiracy theories, particularly from this Republican gubernatorial candidate, Kari Lake, here, who had suggested that officials here are trying to slow-roll this process, to slow-walk it for political purposes. Election officials here, including the Republican head of the county election, lashing out and condemning those attacks. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BILL GATES (R), MARICOPA COUNTY, ARIZONA, SUPERVISOR:  Quite frankly, it is offensive for Kari Lake to say that these people behind me are slow-rolling this, when they're working 14 to 18 hours. So I really hope this is the end of that now, we can be patient and respect the results when they come out.",

And, of course, as we look at the numbers for the two key races here, the U.S. Senate race between Senator Mark Kelly and venture capitalist Blake Masters, as of last night, the spread with them was about 100 -- 100 -- excuse me -- 150,000 -- 115,000 votes, rather. A lot of numbers we're throwing at you. And then on the gubernatorial side, that is about 27,000-vote spread there. So these votes actually matter. Again, hundreds of thousands of votes, we're still waiting to get. And they're counting. We're waiting for those results. We expect to get a new release of ballots this evening. We got about 80,000 last evening. That shifted the numbers just ever so slightly, particularly in that race with Kelly and Blake Masters, with that 115,000-vote spread. We will see what tonight brings. We will keep watching as the counting continue, Ana. CABRERA:  OK, Josh Campbell, thank you for keeping track of it all for us, because you're right. There are a lot of numbers to get through there. Let's go next door to Nevada, where we could be getting an update to the vote there any minute.

The fight over who could become speaker is getting uglier. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy is facing new attacks as he vies for the job. Trump ally Congressman Matt Gaetz calling McCarthy a member of the C- team, not even in his top 100 for the speaker role, he says. Gaetz is endorsing Congressman Jim Jordan for the job. And the pro-Trump Freedom Caucus is digging in with some key demands. For McCarthy to get their support, they say they want easier rules to oust a speaker, more say on committees, more time on bills and an impeachment probe. All this inflaming party tensions. One senior GOP lawmaker telling CNN today, \"They,\" referring to the Freedom Caucus members, \"are a bunch of selfish, prima donna A-holes who want attention for themselves. They're trading effectiveness for the warm embrace of their social media followers\" -- end quote. And on the Senate side, while current Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is expected to nab the leadership spot, there's a new sign things might not be so peachy there either. Senators Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley are now calling for next week's leadership vote to be delayed, this until after the Senate run-off race in the Peach State, Georgia, is decided. More division now, this time within former President Trump's family. CNN is learning not everyone is on board for a potential 2024 run. This is ahead of a special announcement Trump's planning to make next week. CNN's Kate Bennett joins us with her reporting. Kate, the family is together right now for a wedding, right?

Now, of course, Jared and Ivanka were essential to the Trump administration in the West Wing. Jared Kushner was the gatekeeper. He was the person that everything went through, just about, from Middle East peace talks, to COVID-19 response. And Ivanka Trump, one of Donald Trump's most important and closest advisers, obviously, during his time in the White House, now, people tell me that -- close to them tell me that they are not interested at all and have no intention of being involved in either a campaign or perhaps another second run at the White House. We did not see Ivanka Trump pop up at all during midterm campaigns, even though I hear there were requests for her from others in tight races. She did not want to participate.

It's estimated ultimately that it could cost about $400 billion. But the whole program is now in doubt because of this court ruling out of Texas yesterday. It's also been on hold for the past month because of another court decision out of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals that put this loan forgiveness rollout on hold while all the legal challenges play out here.
