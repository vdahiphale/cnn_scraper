In fact, there's real concerns that all of this could get stalled, could get bogged down, could potentially collapse amid divisions within the GOP and also uncertainty about whether the votes exist for any of packages that are now being considered.Now the split really is between the Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and the House Speaker Mike Johns about strategy and about the price tag about how to move ahead. McConnell wants to include Israel aid, include - along with Israel aid as well as the White House has been pushing for $105 billion as part of that emergency package, including with issues like the southern border, issues with - dealing with the South Pacific and the like. Mike Johnson, the new speaker, wants a separate bill, $14.3 billion, just to deal with Israel. But included in that are spending cuts to the - to IRS enforcement, meant to offset the cost of the price tag. That has prompted a furious Democratic revolt. And the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, they're about to give testimony in a matter of minutes from top cabinet officials. She says that that House Republican plan is dead on arrival. And in talking to the number two Senate Republican, John Thune, he made clear that it is an open question about how any of this will get resolved. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So this idea of tying aid to Israel to cuts in funding for the IRS, your Florida congressional colleague, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, said \"this is playing political games with Israel emergency funding.\" You've said it's akin to having a political mailer. Yet you also say you would vote for this. Why? REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): Well, first of all, they're setting a political trap. It's completely outrageous. It's not serious policy. And don't listen to me. Go listen to the National Republican Congressional Committee. They put out a tweet saying, Democrats are going to have to choose between Israel and the IRS. So, they're admitting that this is a campaign ploy so they can send mailers out for the Democrats that decide not to defund the IRS. This is what we're doing with our national security. This is what Republicans are going to do while there are American hostages. They're going to politicize funding for Israel in their greatest time of need in 50 years. And so that's why we're calling it out. That being said, listen, I am not going to fall for the trap. I am going to support Israel's funding because it's super critical in the world we live in today that we - that Israel - we give Israel the support that they need.",

This also is going to add to the deficit, which is something they're not supposed to be doing. So, they're violating every rule that they've set for themselves all in the nature of politics, not about bringing Americans home, not about helping our ally in the Middle East, not about doing any humanitarian aid by the way for the folks that are in the Gaza Strip.

You know, we -- we're - and the Jewish community is constantly told, you can be anti- Israel but not anti-Semitic. And I would surmise that you could. But what we're seeing in the street is not - what we're seeing in the street is calls to gas the Jews, kill the Jews, cleanse the Jews, from the river to the sea, right? Kill everyone in between. It is concerning. This is what my grandmother, who was a Holocaust survivor, you know, as a child, you know, told me stories. You go to the museums. You think to yourself, there's no way that this could happen again. How could people be so -- blindly hate a religion and people that they don't -- they don't even know.

So, that's where you draw the line. That's clearly now not about Israel, that's clearly about anti-Semitism.You know, as far as Congressman Rashida Talib, that's about the fact that she still went out and told a lie after U.S. intelligence said that it had nothing to do about Israel at the hospital. First of all, let's go through that. The hospital wasn't hit. It was the parking lot. There weren't 500 people that were killed because Hamas makes up the numbers. And, by the way, it wasn't Israel. The biggest part, it was not Israel. Every intelligence agency we have in this country has confirmed that. There were riots all over the place. The president got -- had his meetings canceled with foreign leaders. We see - we see mobs in Russia looking for Jews on the plane from Tel Aviv. All of this goes back to people believing that that hospital was bombed. And so spreading dangerous misinformation is something people in Congress shouldn't do. When Republicans do that, Democrats call that out, OK, and we censure them for when they do that or say they should be censured. And so, you know, that's why I said it was something that I think it should be - should be considered.",

Whether or not it's border policy, historic tax relief, we did rebuilding the military or reforming the courts. But I think today the front-runner of our party has run a campaign based on grievances and there's no real promise to conservatives to how he'd govern. In fact, if you look at his campaign messaging, proposing perhaps the biggest tax increase on American history with a 10 percent tax on all - on all products coming into the United States, abandonment of our international commitments, refusal to address the fiscal crisis that we're in. There's nothing that the campaign is offering to conservatives. Instead, it's basically, you fight -- help me fight my grievances. And I think the campaign afforded the vice president that chance to give caution to our party about the direction that it's headed. But I think that - that the reality is that Donald Trump remains the frontrunner for our party. And, you know, other candidates will have to make decisions about timing for them. But I think some of the conventional wisdom that is out there would suggest that says, hey, we just need to narrow down to one-on-one. And I - I don't think that that applies here.

But I wonder then if this, Pence - Pence leaving the race, coupled with Trump's dominance, and also even Mike Johnson's rise to becoming House speaker, is that confirmation that 2020 election denialism is a prerequisite or at least a big factor in people being able to win leadership positions in the Republican Party?",
