Sitting to his right is Twitter CEO Elon Musk.Not everyone, though, wanted to cozy up to Fox during the Super Bowl. President Biden actually broke with tradition and he declined to be interviewed on the network's pregame show. Typically, it's a tradition for U.S. presidents to sit down with whoever is hosting and airing the Super Bowl for an interview. So now the question has been raised by some critics of whether or not this was a missed opportunity for the president to potentially reach millions of viewers. So joining us now with his take is SEMAFOR editor-in-chief, Ben Smith. That is a good question because it is a lot of people. I think it was 208 million people watched the Super Bowl last year. So how do they weigh a calculus like that of whether or not to go forward with this? BEN SMITH, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, SEMAFOR:  Well, I mean, I think -- I think it's pretty tactical. I don't think this was necessarily them trying to strike some big blow against Rupert Murdoch, although if that's a side benefit, like I'm sure they're into it. But they had tried to get the actress -- they had tried to sort of go to a subsidiary Fox channel and -- [07:35:00]",
