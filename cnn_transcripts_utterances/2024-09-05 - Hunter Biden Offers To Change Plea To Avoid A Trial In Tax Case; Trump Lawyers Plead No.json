      "sentences": "Well, our team had actually reported that plea talks were in the works. I mean, remember, it was justback in June that Hunter Biden was convicted on three counts stemming from his failure to properly fill out forms when he was buying guns. So now Hunter Biden, the current president's son, was facing this other trial where he was accused of nine tax crimes in California. So presumably, he didn't want to go through another trial again. What's interesting is we're just getting information in from our colleagues in the court in Los Angeles. They are saying that prosecutors are telling the judge that they would object to this plea deal. Now, this would be a plea deal called an Alford plea where Hunter Biden would maintain his innocence, but he would say to the judge, I'm maintaining my innocence, but let's get this wrapped up and I'll accept whatever sentence or punishment you impose. So defense attorneys for Hunter Biden had put this forward to the judge just moments ago. And now prosecutors are saying we were not aware of this. There's no agreements. And it's not clear what the judge will do, whether or not he will accept this plea agreement. So the court, we understand, is adjourned for two hours until 2:00 P.M. Eastern, 11:00 Pacific. And it's unclear if this plea deal is actually going to go through as Hunter Biden's attorneys expected it would. Again, Hunter Biden is accused of nine tax crimes, basically not properly filing and not paying about $2 million in taxes all around the time that he was suffering from his addiction. You know, his attorneys have wanted to put into the record that Hunter Biden did eventually repay $2 million. The judge won't let them put that into the record, saying that, you know, the legal precedent, it doesn't matter if you later repay it. The charges are that you didn't initially pay it. So it's going to be interesting, guys, to see what happens once court resumes in just about two hours. Whether or not the district judge, the federal judge here is going to approve this plea deal, because as we're seeing, prosecutors say that they will object and that they really weren't privy to this and that there's been no agreement. So we'll see.",

So I think Jack Smith has done enough pruning of that indictment that it will get over that hurdle that I call the immunity hurdle. So that could take time in terms of filings, oral argument, and a decision by Judge Chutkan. And she will issue a written opinion.
