They issued this updated statement this evening saying, quote, \"The U.S. government assesses that Israel was not responsible for an explosion that killed hundreds of civilians yesterday at the Al-Ahli hospital in the Gaza Strip. Our assessment is based on available reporting, including an intelligence, including missile activity and open source video and images of the incident. Intelligence indicates that some Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip believed that the like -- that the explosion was likely caused by an errant rocket or missile launch carried out by Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Pij. The militants were still investigating what had happened,\" unquote.But Palestinian officials in Gaza maintain it was Israel. And either way regardless of what the facts are, the claims of the Palestinians in Gaza, those claims are being believed by Arab leaders. And those claims are being believed on streets throughout the Arab world. Jordanian and Palestinian leaders, therefore cancelled their plans meetings with President Biden. And because of those claims, false it appears, there are protests ignited on the streets in Beirut and throughout the capitals of other Arab countries. Frustrations, no doubt also because of Israel's bombardment of Gaza, also because, frankly, of Israel's very existence, and also because of President Biden's reaffirmation of us support for the Jewish state today. Another priority for the U.S., expressed today by President Biden in Israel is securing safe passage along the southern Gaza border with Egypt for food and water and medical supplies and fuels to get into Gaza, because of the dire humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and for civilians, including hundreds of U.S. citizens, Palestinian Americans and others, desperately trying to get out of Gaza. Let's get right to Erin Burnett, who is live for us in Tel Aviv. Erin, what is the latest we're hearing from officials about that blast at that hospital in Gaza?",

They put a map out here of rocket trajectories to show that they know exactly where a rocket comes from. They say it came from that cemetery near the hospital. They've put out all their aerial images to show that an Israeli missile would cause a crater and there isn't a crater present here. They put out a map of every single missile, a rocket, I'm sorry, they say, has been fired by a jihadist group in Gaza that has missed its target and landed short in the Gaza strip in the past 10 days.So they've done all of that. But to your point, Arab leaders believing that the Jordanian Foreign Minister today said to CNN, Jake, the quote was, \"The Israeli army is saying it's not responsible, but to be honest, try and find anybody who's going to believe it in this part of the world.\" And that's the challenge. And a former U.S. intelligence official was telling me that, look, you could present this evidence to King Abdullah of Jordan, and he could see it and realize it to be true, if that's how he sees it. But he's not going to be able to go out and convince people in Jordan that this is true, and this is fine and Israel didn't do it. So that's the reality. As you point out, it's a circular situation.

The agreement, he said was to allow 20 trucks through for the time being. And then in terms of the timeline, how quickly this could happen, the president saying literally the roads need to get fix, potholes needs to get -- need to get fixed before trucks can get through this area. So he estimated that those 20 trucks could start rolling into Gaza around Friday. He also said that this purpose was only to get the humanitarian aid through that it would not be to allow a lot of people out.So, clearly, this was a key sticking point in his discussions with the President of Egypt. He called this a very blunt negotiation that he had with his counterpart in Egypt. He said that they spoke for over an hour while Air Force One was on the ground for a refueling stop. Obviously, the President is on his way back to Washington. So, Jake, we were just talking about how the President didn't get an opportunity to meet face to face with some of these Arab leaders. The White House had said when the Jordan piece of the trip was canceled that he did plan on speaking on the phone with some of the leaders and this we are seeing playing out in real time. He had this phone call, he said was over an hour. And now this is sort of the result of that conversation. I should also quickly note, Jake, that over the last few minutes, the White House has announced that the President tomorrow is going to deliver a prime time address from the Oval Office to address both the situation in Israel and the war in Ukraine.

It hasn't happened. There was a vote at the U.N. Security Council, U.N. -- United States ambassador there vetoed it. So, I think the perception here is still on the ground and the support President Biden has given the situation that is still primed, Israel still ready for a ground incursion.
