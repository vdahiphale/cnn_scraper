We just got a statement from the Athens-Clarke County police department indicating that this happened at 2And then Fred, for some reason that car left the roadway, struck this power pole right here. We saw utility crews in the last hour or so replacing and fixing this power pole -- and then that car continued, Fred. You can see the debris, the fallen tree limbs where it struck a tree. And as we make our way over here I'm going to show you the exact spot where this car came to rest continuing past this slope right here and ending at this location right here in front of this apartment complex. Georgia Bulldogs football player Devin Willock, 20 years old, a recruiting staff member, and two other staff members were all inside of that car at the time of the crash. Willock died here at the scene. That recruiting staff member, Chandler Lacroix, 24 years old, she was taken to the hospital but, Fred, later died. Now, Willock according to the football roster, he was an offensive lineman from New Milford, New Jersey, a redshirt sophomore. He played every single game this year. We do have a statement now from the head coach -- the head football coach, Kevin Smart who says, quote, \"We are all heartbroken and devastated with the loss of Devin Willock and Chandler Lacroix. Devin was an outstanding young man in every way and was always smiling. He was a great teammate and a joy to coach. Chandler was a valuable member to our football staff and brought an incredible attitude and energy every single day.\" We also have a piece of sound here we want to play for you from Senator Raphael Warnock addressing the deaths during church service with President Biden marking Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SENATOR RAPHAEL WARNOCK (D-GA): Sad news this morning. After winning a national championship again, we're saddened to hear that death and grief has visited the University of Georgia football team. A Georgia football player and a staff member were killed this morning in a car accident. We lift these families in prayer. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

At about 10:30 local time Nepal, this domestic carrier took off from the capital city of Kathmandu for a tourist city called Pokhara. And within 18 minutes of its flight path, It lost contact with the air traffic control and moments later it crashed into a gorge. Now this city that we're talking about is the second most populated city in Nepal. What the officials are not telling is that 68 bodies of the 72 have been recovered. Four are still missing. Search operations have been called off for the day and will resume Monday morning local time in Nepal. That's when they're going to be looking for the four other bodies. What we don't know as of now is what caused this crash. But I want to go back to the moment of that video that you were talking about which it appears to be from the city of Pokhara where the crash took place. it appears to be from a terrace of a building that someone's taking it and those are just moments before the crash. You can see the plane rolling over and this is quite low for the area that it's in. And this is a densely populated area we're talking about. Moments later it's rolling away from the screen and about seconds later we hear a massive explosion. Now the prime minister of Nepal has, of course, expressed deep condolences over this tragic incident and a five-member team has now been formed to probe the incident, Fredricka.",

They both had sanctions as a result of those aggravating circumstances. If it's accidental and unintentional and just sort of a mishap of the chaos of leaving a high office, then nothing happens. And those are not infrequent, but they're not frequent because one of the things -- this whole episode with Trump and Biden will do -- it's going to shine light on this problem.

DEANmaterial and the search warrant, it's been pretty clear that this is not a scandal anymore. This is a criminal proceeding that's being investigated. The Biden situation right now strikes me as a scandal. It's not been well handled by the media or the press people and the communications people. They should have gotten more out and as much out as they could have and been very candid with what they did and didn't know. Where are there are now -- these things are dribbling out and some of the criticisms are legitimate, most of them are not. For example, that the president should have released this information before the election. Well, that wasn't even possible. It hadn't been referred by the attorney general until November 14th to the special counsel, preliminary special counsel John Lausch he had investigating it.

If there's been criminal intent, if there have been aggravated negligence of some sort.So, I -- I don't think they're going to coordinate with each other and I think the White House -- the distinguishing factor right now appears to be the Biden White House is doing everything they can to cooperate, whereas the Trump -- Donald Trump and his team did everything they could to foil the efforts to recover the documents.

One is that these big days, you know, these calendar moments with which he's associated, each of them in a way paints only a partial picture. So this idea that he was one thing on 9/11 and became something totally different on 1/6 is a little bit of an illusion. There were always elements of Giuliani's leadership and his character even before 9/11 and a lot of people knew about this before 9/11 that were, you know, somewhat troubling. He had an edgy personality. His leadership style was kind of tough and abrasive.",

There was always kind of this shadow to his record before 9/11. And 9/11, while it changed -- transformed his image, it didn't change the fact that there were these other things that were there.I think as time went on, as we get towards 1/6 and the 20 intervening years past, one of the key things that happens is a lot of people who were around him, whether those were his wives, his ex-wives, whether it was a close front like Peter Powers who was also adviser who passed away in those years, a lot of people who gave him advice and surrounded him and modulated some of his behavior were no longer there. So, he kind of -- he sort of went into one part of his leadership style, if you will.",
