Officials saying that about half of them are back online, so that is progress. And it is badly needed progress here in Buffalo because the streets in and around the city, they're still covered with snow.Now, you can tell some of these intersections have clearly been plowed. That is because the plowing operations right now are really focused on making sure that they can carve a path throughout the area for first responders to get to calls. But still, you will see civilian vehicles out and about, you might be able to see one right about now. And so, what we're hearing from officials right now is basically pleading to -- for folks to abide by these travel restrictions, this driving ban that's been in place since Friday night because they want to make sure that the plows can continue to carve those paths and also to access them in the neighborhoods where people have been stuck in their homes since Friday. And as you're about to hear from New York Governor Kathy Hochul, it seems that the worst of it may be over when it comes to the storm. But that snow still going to fall. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. KATHY HOCHUL, (D-NY): The storm is coming back. We're expecting another six to -- six to 12 inches. And in the south towns, the southern part of Erie County, a little bit south of here, they had 30 to 40 inches of snow overnight. So, anyone who declares victory and says it's over, it is way too early to say this is at its completion of -- maybe the severity is downplaying now. And right now, it's not as bad as it had been over the last couple of days, but it is still a dangerous situation to be out. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

In some areas, it's now having to truck that snow to another site. And whether the bigger trucks can get down side roads in order to track that snow out. So, we are seeing and I'm very grateful, all levels of government that are participating, you know, you just had on what we have on our state and, of course, the state troopers and everybody from the county to the city. But it is just overwhelming. I have been out. You know, there were certain emergencies that we had to go out for. It is still devastating. Thank God the wind is not as high so you can see better, but it's still a very dangerous situation because of black ice and people sliding still into snow banks. And so, the call is, if possible, if it unless it is an emergency or you are essential, to stay home. And if you can't, there should be somebody with the proper type of vehicle to get you to the hospitals because we know that the hospitals are overwhelmed right now and understaffed and need those essential workers. So, by working together, the people who need to get to wherever they are, this city and state, and the county is working very hard together. It's the only way we're going to make it through this.",

And things will they're not a whole lot better at the Delta terminal here behind me. This line has been growing the entire day. The folks that are currently standing in this line have been here for several hours. One woman just told me a few minutes ago that she got here around nine this morning, and she's yet to see a gate agent -- a ticket agent to see if she can get on a new flight. Now, when we're talking about the overall number of canceled flights across the U.S. going into today, well, that number now stands at about 2900 flights that have been canceled, and well over 4000 other flights that have been delayed. That number was about 3000 just yesterday. Things are a bit hectic on this side of the airport terminal. But just on the other side, the Southwest Airlines' side, they've got an entire line dedicated to passengers whose flights have been canceled. We caught up with one woman. She finally sat down on the plane she said, she was hoping to take off. And then they told everyone on that plane they had to get out. And that's because there wasn't a pilot.

Carlos Suarez, thank you for bringing us the latest there.And now to Mississippi where the entire city of Jackson is now under a boil water advisory. The city issued the notice after its water system lost pressure due to line breaks that were likely caused by the weather. CNN's Martin Savidge is following the developments. So, Martin, Jackson water system -- Jackson's water system, it has been plagued by troubles for years now. We've been reporting on that here on CNN. What's the latest? MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's still a very fragile system, Pamela, and that's what is the problem we're seeing here. As you mentioned, that extreme cold that everyone's been experiencing manifested itself in the south, and Mississippi what it does, as it's done in other southern states, bust water lines. In the city of Jackson, Mississippi, it appears to be water mains, they've been pumping water into the system but people at their homes are not seeing it come out or barely trickling out of the tap. So, what Christmas Day would people have to do? Go out and stand in line or go in search of water or go to the water distribution points to get it -- just to have water to drink and use for their meals. This is a problem, as you point out, that Jackson has been dealing with. Back in August, you may remember, the system suffered almost a partial collapse. That was after floodwaters got into the water filtration system. Boil orders were in place in that city from July until September. They're in a place right now and no one knows for how much longer. The money is starting to come in to fix the problem. For instance, the latest budget bill that was just passed in Washington has about $600 billion that will go to the Jackson water system. But it's going to take time. And in the meantime, that system still teeters on the brink. And it doesn't take much in this case cold weather that is, once again, forced the residents to suffer, Pamela.",
