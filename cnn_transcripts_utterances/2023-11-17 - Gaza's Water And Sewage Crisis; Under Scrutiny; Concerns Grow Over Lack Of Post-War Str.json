And authorities in Iceland brace for a potential volcanic eruption, how one town's residents are coping after fleeing their homes. Live from New York, it's Friday, November 17th. I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening once again. And tonight, the Israeli government says fuel tankers have entered Gaza after a UN expert warned the water system there is close to collapse. The Israeli war cabinet says that the fuel will be used by UN agencies to operate water and sewage plants. Earlier in the day, Israel was accused of using water as a weapon of war by a UN official. Meanwhile, the body of a second Israeli hostage, Noa Marciano was found near Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. Negotiations for the release of more hostages are ongoing. And two Israeli officials say Hamas has demanded Israel stop flying surveillance drones over Gaza as part of any deal. Jeremy Diamond is in Sderot for us tonight. Jeremy, much to discuss, but let's start with the fuel supplies. Clearly, the critics are going to say this is nowhere near enough after weeks of asking for more fuel supplies and nothing coming. This does feel like a huge breakthrough.",

      "sentences": "It is a breakthrough and it is also a major change in the Israeli position. We have watched now for -- since thebeginning of this war effectively that Israel has resisted sending fuel into Gaza even amid mounting not only international pressure but, in particular, pressure from the United States for Israel to allow fuel into Gaza, which has been one of the main sources of the humanitarian crisis there in terms of hospitals not being able to operate and also, as we're seeing now, in terms of the water and sewage system not functioning properly. And it is on that latter point that the Israeli officials finally decided to allow limited fuel in two trucks per day into the Gaza Strip, saying that it's not because of humanitarian concerns really, but more making the argument that this is to ensure that the war can continue. The country's National Security Advisor, Tzachi Hanegbi, saying very clearly that if there were outbreak of diseases as a result of these sewage problems, for example, that that would force Israel to stop the war. And so, effectively, this allows them to check the humanitarian box, but also to be able to ensure that there isn't some kind of outbreak of disease that would put their troops at risk as well. Now, amid all of this, Israel is continuing its military operation. They say they have full control the northern part of the Gaza Strip. Although we have watched in recent days as battles continue even in the northernmost part of the strip. And then, of course, there is this issue of Al-Shifa Hospital, where Israeli officials say that they found a tunnel shaft on the complex of the Al-Shifa Hospital. You can see a video of that tunnel shaft about 30 meters away from one of the hospital's main buildings. We have confirmed that location. But what we can't independently confirm is the fact that this is indeed a Hamas tunnel shaft as Israel confirms. And we also can't confirm that it leads to a broader massive underground complex that Hamas operates below the Al-Shifa Hospital, which is, of course, the major claim that Israeli officials have been making for weeks now. And they are now saying that it could take days, if not weeks, for them to confirm the full extent of Hamas' underground operation there.",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said a Palestinian civilian government could run the enclave as long as it cooperates with Israel's security needs. He's not provided concrete details of just how that might work. US Congressman Seth Moulton served four tours of duty in Iraq. In a recent column, he said Israel needs a clear end game against Hamas or it will face the same problems encountered by the US during its war on terror. And Representative Moulton joins us now. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us on the show. I read your op- ed almost a month ago, and you recounted your experiences in the Iraq War, and you talked about your second Iraq tour, going back to recapture a city that was already taken a year before. And the difference actually was the fighting was that more fierce, far more fierce than actually what was done a year before. And I think you see echoes of that risk in what we're seeing in Gaza today and more. REP. SETH MOULTON (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  I do. I see a lot of echoes. You know, we went into Iraq thinking that our only job was the military task of defeating the army. And we actually did that very quickly and effectively. But we didn't have a political plan for the day after. And as a result, an insurgency came up, and it got better and better -- stronger and stronger, more effective against us over the months. And so when we came down to Iraq in my second tour, the fighting was even fiercer than we saw during the invasion. You know, what Israel is doing in Gaza runs the same risk. They got to realize this is not just a military operation against Hamas. It's fundamentally a counterinsurgency operation where they got to convince the Palestinian people to accept a different political reality at the end of the day.",

But then you had a choice of putting your own men's lives at risk to go in there and try and take that. And the end result was you decided to destroy it. And it came back to this idea of how do you talk to a population and say, look, as bad as Hamas was, the alternative now is better and rebuild trust that's been devastated through the war period.

Now, to be clear, we knew that there weren't any civilians in the school, so it was an effective way to take care of the insurgents. But we had to have a plan to rebuild the school, otherwise, how could we convince the Iraqis that we had done a good thing? How could we convince them not to join the insurgency, but instead to take part in a democratic future for the country? That's exactly what Israel has to do. They can't just go in and leave Gaza a smoldering mess, destroying Gaza, killing a lot of innocent civilians in the process. They have to have a plan to rebuild. They have to have a plan to give the Palestinians a political future that's different than Hamas. And at the end of the day, it has to be an appealing enough plan for the Palestinians to choose that, to choose that different reality in the future.

We can't just take the funding plan that we had for last year and pretend that it's going to be adequate for this new year with a whole host of new challenges. But that's what we've done. We've just basically copy-and-pasted last year's budget into this year for the next couple of months. That's not something that anyone in Congress should be proud of.

Supporters of both candidates running to become the next president. The (INAUDIBLE) used A.I. to the point that the New York Times wondered whether Argentina's is the first A.I. election of our times. HENRY AJDER, A.I. EXPERT: The Argentinian elections have shown one use case which isn't perhaps the one that people feared most. But it is one that raises some interesting questions about the role of A.I. in political communications and whether they should be doing this kind of stuff. Even if it's clearly fake and it's not intended to fool people. You could swap faces, click by click using an editing tool. Cloning someone's voice though to make them say things they've never said. Unless you've got the best impersonator on the planet in your office, that's obviously something that A.I. has really opened up.",

In particular, through deceptive relisted content called Deep Fake. While Argentina has not experienced widespread use of deceptive A.I. technology, experts believe it will serve as a testing ground for how effective A.I.ees to swing voters intention and how the technology will be used in the future. The contest is closely watched around the region because it paints a far- right disrupter, Javier Milei against the finance minister and career politician Sergio Massa. [15:35:06 A win for Milei could mean a change of momentum for conservatives worldwide and decisively move Argentina to the right. Another way, this election could transform Argentina for good will be on the ballot on Sunday. Right- wing candidate Javier Melei pledging to dollarized South America's second largest economy and shut down the Central Bank. Argentina is once again battling record-high inflation and struggling to repay international debtors. And the plan to switch currency has generated a debate among economic think tanks. The Cato Institute, for example, considers it the fastest way to achieve the reforms Argentina so desperately needs.

Rosalynn Carter's grandson said she isspending time with her husband and their family. Jimmy Carter entered hospice care in February and celebrated his 99th birthday last month. For more on this, let's go to chief medical correspondent Dr. Sandy Gupta. Dr. Sanjay, great to have you with us. What an incredible couple. 96, 99. What do we know about her health and what the family is saying to us here? DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, the thing is, she's been in pretty remarkably good health for most of her life, Julia. It was really in May of this year, just a few months ago, where she was diagnosed with dementia. We know former President Carter, as you mentioned, has been in home hospice care since February. He had a history of cancer, as you may remember. But that's all we really know. I mean, as old as they are in their late 90s, they have mostly been in pretty good health. Home hospice care is what we're talking about. President Carter is in that now. Rosalynn Carter is going to be there as well, which basically means much of the medical care that you'd otherwise get in a hospital or clinics, much of that can be done at home. It can cut down on the number of visits, you know, that you need to actually go to a hospital or a clinic. What it does not mean, Julia, and I think this is really important is that something is happening imminently. I think people hear hospice and they immediately think this means the end is near. And it might mean that but, you know, Jimmy Carter has been in home hospice for, you know, nine months now. So, we don't know specifically what triggered this. They haven't said much, you know, from the Carter center but we know that they will be together at home receiving hospice care.",
