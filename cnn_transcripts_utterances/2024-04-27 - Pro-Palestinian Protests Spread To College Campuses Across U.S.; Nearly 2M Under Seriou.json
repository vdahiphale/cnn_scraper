High tensions and more arrests today at college campuses across the country as protests against the war in Gaza spread at major universities. In Indiana, state police in riot gear carrying shields and batons were seen clashing with IU Bloomington students at an encampment there on campus. Police say they arrested at least 23 people after they ignored six verbal warnings to remove the encampment and leave the area. The university said it quote, \"encourages and respects free speech including the right to peacefully protest\". But added that school members are expected to follow university policy and state law. In Boston school officials at Northeastern University say campus operations have quote, \"returned to normal\" after police detained about 100 people there this morning. Demonstrators across the country want their schools to stand against what they believe are acts of genocide being committed against the Palestinian people in Gaza. But some Jewish students worry that the protests are becoming anti-Semitic, leading to harassment and they fear for their safety on campus. We are covering this from college campuses all across the country. CNN's Polo Sandoval is live outside Columbia University in New York epicenter of these protests. Polo, let's go first to you. And what you're seeing today.",

Similar to what we saw play out in the last several days. In fact, some tempers rising a couple of days ago here on the sidewalk off- campus.On the campus and I ended up visit there just a couple of -- just a few moments ago. It is very quiet. The encampment continues. And I had an opportunity to hear from some for the organizers just yesterday and they do say that those negotiations that are about seven days in or so between pro-Palestinian student protesters and Columbia University are at an impasse, at least for now. That is because they cannot seem to find any common ground in what is the main priority demand for these students that have set up that encampment for about a week and a half now, which is divestment from companies associated with or at least with some Israeli connections. They have, however, seen some progress on at least two other fronts. That is in transparency in terms of the investments that the university is making and also in terms of trying to convince the university to issue a statement possibly from the president of the university addressing the incident from last week when they when they asked the NYPD to step onto campus and to help clear out an encampment that we all know simply came back up which now has triggered other universities throughout the country. The student organizers, they have not received any assurances from the university that they will not once again turn to the NYPD, though they say that they are prepared for that should that happen. But I have to tell you after spending again a couple of hours on campus a few moments ago, Jessica, there was no sign that that is imminent. But there is certainly some uncertainty on campus because you do have campus workers preparing for commencement in a couple of weeks' time. And you hear from some of those students, especially those who are not actively involved in these protests were wondering if their commencement will move forward, which again thus far there doesn't seem to be indication that that will change.",

But that doesn't mean repercussions about the violent arrest on Thursday are over.We took a look earlier at the university quad and it was empty but you can still see messages written with chalk on sidewalks saying things like \"Long Live Palestine\", and \"Ceasefire Now\". After clashes with police resulted in multiple arrests on Thursday, including at least one Emory University professor, there were protests once again here Friday. But they were more peaceful. Now also Friday, Emory tenured faculty gathered on campus to express concerns about Thursday's violent arrests and the fact there were three police agencies here on campus. They were discussing a motion for a no-confidence vote of Emory University president Gregory Fenves that will take place next week. Earlier today, I had an opportunity to talk to Martin Berg, he's a third-year law student graduating in three weeks who was arrested on Thursday and released Friday afternoon.

And here I quote, \"As Emory community members continued to express themselves and protest, we are committed to working with students and faculty, open expression of servers and the EPD to facilitate their peaceful expression.

Now, here at UCLA, things are peaceful, but you are seeing the encampment, you know. There is a large portion of the university that is currently full of tents and a lot of the students here say that they're not going to leave. It's very similar demands that we were hearing from my colleague Polo in New York. It is divestment. It is students who say they want disclosure of where the money in the university is going to and they say they're going to continue to be here in this encampment for as long as it takes. Now, I also want to say that even though they say they will continue to be here, they're also saying they're going to be peaceful. We do not know exactly how long they want to be here, but they say that they're going to continue despite even tomorrow having counter protesters here. That's what scheduled at UCLA tomorrow. And so again, as of now, things have remained peaceful, but there are some people outside of the encampment that I wouldn't always describe as peaceful.

Adam, thanks so much for being here with us. We appreciate it. There are fears that these protests are spreading anti-Semitism and we know that some Jewish students have said they feel unsafe on their own campus. We also know that there are some Jewish groups at some of these schools that are calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. What are you hearing from the students you're talking to? ADAM LEHMAN, PRESIDENT/CEO, HILLEL: Yes, thank you, Jessica. I was with a group of Columbia students just yesterday and every single one of them expressed fear for their safety and it's not based on theoretical concern. We've had students who've been stabbed in the eye with a Palestinian flag at Yale. We have had students who have been pushed, who have been hit, who have been shoved in connection with these protests. And the language of the protests while sometimes peaceful, is often not peaceful, its often expressed in terms of the violent elimination of the state of Israel, in terms of removing all Zionists from those campuses and a Zionist from where we stand at Hillel is someone who believes in the right of self-determination for the Jewish people in our ancestral homelands. So if you're a Jewish student who is hearing threats to Zionists or kill the Zionists as a Columbia student recorded on his own Instagram account, or you're seeing students who are being physically assaulted or followed back to their dorm rooms. Of course, they're concerned. And I should point out that since October 7, we've recorded more than 1,400 instances of hate speech, of assault, of vandalism. So the campus climate is boiling and it really is creating an intolerable situation for so many Jewish students.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And it's really about protecting all students because when these protests or encampments spin out of control, that's disruptive for the entire campus community. So in terms of how universities can and should approach it, we're big fans of free speech. Our whole tradition at Hillel and in Judaism promotes dialogue.What we need is for universities to reassert control over their campuses. That means they've all tried to implement what are known as time, place, and manner restrictions so that there are spaces and time for protest and protesters frankly, under principles of free speech can effectively say what they want to say however, irrational or sometimes aggressive, it can be. But the protesters in this moment are running roughshod over the basic rules that have been provided for all students from whatever background and in doing so, they have to face consequences. So that means we really do believe to promote safety, universities need to eliminate encampments when they are creating safety risk. Number two, students who are so clearly and brazenly violating rules and policies should be suspended or expelled if they continue to do so in a way that threatens other students. And finally, we need universities to reinvest in educating students and promoting dialogue. In sitting with students at Columbia yesterday, they are eager to talk about differences. They are eager to support Palestinian well-being as well as the well-being of Israelis. But often, people should know that when they go to these encampments or when they go to students who are theoretically there to support Palestinian rights, there's a policy of anti-normalization. These protesters won't even talk to many Jewish students because they are treating -- they're dehumanizing them and demonizing them just by virtue of their Jewish identity and belief in the right of the state of Israel to exist.",

They pointed out at these schools, these are bright young people who are getting access to top tier education.Sadly, they're literally reading out of a playbook from Hezbollah, Hamas, and Iran. The chants are coming from National Students for Justice in Palestine and it is not sadly just about supporting the well-being of humanitarian aid in Gaza. In fact, there have been -- there's almost no active warfare being conducted there. The playbook for Hamas, Iran, Hezbollah, is all about the violent elimination of the state of Israel. So sadly, I think a lot of these students do know what they're saying and doing. And that's why it can feel so threatening and anti-Semitic to Jewish students who, as part of their core identity do feel affinity to the state of Israel and do believe in its right to exist.",

But then we went to three cycles, 1964, 1968, 1972 without any presidential debates because the incumbents or front runners didn't want to elevate their challengers. Well, it's a little different in this case. It's really more a way for a Biden, perhaps, to limit the lies that may well be told by Donald Trump. And he's done it many times. And he didn't debate a single time in the Republican primaries. He had some substantial opposition. They were good people running against him. No debates at all.

For almost three hours, you heard the justices really struggled with where to put this line when it comes to presidential immunity from criminal prosecution.And while I think you did see division genes in the court, I heard some agreement that basically neither side was going to win completely, that there would not be a finding of absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts, which is what Trump's team wants. And there probably would be a middle ground, meaning not exactly what Special counsel Smith wants. I heard them really searching. I think you're exactly right to highlight those quotes that talk about the line between official acts and private acts.

I think that's what everybody is asking and it's very unlikely.In part, because - it gets to the first part of the question, which is that I think the court is likely to lay out a new standard for how we determine when an act is an official act and entitled to immunity and when an act is a private act and it's not entitled to any immunity. That could then go back to the trial court judge. Judge Chutkan. And she would have to apply that standard to the facts at issue in the complaint in the case pending before the former president. And then, the party who doesn't like her ruling, they could then go back up to the D.C. circuit court of appeals. I mean, we could talk about what exactly that ruling might look like. I do think it's a complicated issue for the court. And they're trying to figure out what exactly falls within that bucket of official acts. But I think what everybody is asking is, how long will it take? And the answer is, I think it is extremely unlikely we would see a trial before November.",

What he's trying to get at is to say, shouldn't it be that we look back to our basic principle that no person is above the law, that the rule of law applies equally to all of us?AND I think that is compelling. But the truth is that there is Supreme Court precedent that says, in the civil context, that we do treat presidents differently. Now, we've never been here. We've never had an answer for the criminal context. But I think, while that broad statement is really appealing, what the Supreme Courts really doing is going one step below that and saying, but there is actually something different in their view about the president. And they're trying to craft a decision that balances the rule of law, while also balancing respect for executive duties. And frankly, what you've heard a lot is the fear that if they say that there is no immunity, then criminal prosecutions could be used as a weapon against future presidents and future ex-presidents.",

And as we said, we don't think that we're going to have this trial. [17:54:59:] So in this case, whatever happens with respect to the immunity standard, it's a win for the former president. Now, in terms of that concession of, yes, we understand John Sauer saying there are private acts here, I think that's really just an acknowledgment of what Judge Chutkan, the trial court judge, had already said.
