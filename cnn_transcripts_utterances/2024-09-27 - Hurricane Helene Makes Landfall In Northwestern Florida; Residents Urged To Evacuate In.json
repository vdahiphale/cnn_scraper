We know that that eye wall was east of where Tallahassee is, especially where we are here in downtown Tallahassee, but maybe that back, those back bands, outer bands, coming back again, giving us a little bit more of that, a heavy rainfall, a little bit stronger winds here, where I am here, elevated a bit of a hilltop area. Get a great background of the city here of Tallahassee.Still see some areas with power that are on. Here where I am, just on this street couple minutes ago, these street lights went all out. A couple minutes later, we saw them come back on, but it sort of been like that throughout the evening. Now it's been a lot calmer earlier. Now it's getting a little bit stronger, and you mentioned it, the mayor mentioned that as well. The big threat that they were facing also was the wind and how strong that was going to be if we were going to see trees toppled over, power lines down, and then the whole mess that it was going to make to then try to get power restoration back on, because we know they can't start doing that until they clear all these roadways, and then those crews are able to safely start that power restoration process.",

It's going to be a big emphasis going into tomorrow.Now you mentioned deaths. We heard from Governor Ron DeSantis, who confirmed one death in the Tampa area from a person who was driving a car on Interstate Four. He says after a sign fell on that car, killing the driver.

It takes enormous manpower to clear roads and to get power lines restored.And so again, we just asked the community to have patience with us. We know that we will be responding to emergencies.

We haven't received the number of emergency calls that perhaps we might have otherwise if people didn't do again, as we advise them to do, and as and as they're prepared to do, which is to effectuate those, those family plans early and we certainly hope they did so.

And residents in Asheville, North Carolina, are being urged to evacuate ahead of what is expected to be historic flooding in the area. Video there it is there showing a torrent of water rushing down the Swannanoa River on Thursday. The ground around Asheville is already soaked after more than 10 inches, 250 millimeters of rain from a previous storm, that has officials worried about landslides and buildings collapsing due to compromised foundations.

So yes, now is losing some intensity. It was 140 miles- per-hour. Now it's 120. We're seeing some gusts around 99, the highest per, you know, that I've seen so far, so 160 kilometers per hour. But there will be some minor little tornadoes today. Every little storm that comes on shore here could produce a tornado. In fact, two tornado warnings going on right now not that far from Charleston just kind of moving on upstate. So the wind at the surface, 99. The wind aloft -- you had a wind aloft of 160 miles-per-hour from the airplane. I'm not sure how you get the courage to fly an airplane through 160 mile-per-hour hurricane, but they do it all the time.

She may need those three more steps because that water is still coming up. And then the rainfall. This is the fresh water because the saltwater flood were talking about that surge -- that's all salt. This is freshwater. We've now seen in some spots, ten inches, 250 millimeters of rain and possibly another 250 to go.

One thing we are taking a look at right now were rescues in Pascoe County, which is a county right above Tampa, Florida. We're learning that 40 people were rescued from rising waters because of Hurricane Helene. Sheriff's office there says that rescue boats are continuing to be loaded into the water there, making sure that anyone who still needs help is able to get it. That's the big -- the biggest news that we've gotten so far. In terms of rescues at a larger scale across the state. Here in Tallahassee, where we are we haven't gotten any sort of information on any rescues and needed so far.
