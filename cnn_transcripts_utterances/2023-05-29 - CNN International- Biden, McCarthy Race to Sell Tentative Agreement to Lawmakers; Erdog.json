But you've got to be sure you lead on it and you can talk about it but if your top priority is culture wars and not managing spending, creating more opportunities at a localized level. Draining the swamp -- which I was told that was going to happen, never happened a bit. You know, former President Trump blew that. Securing the border -- former President Trump blew that one. Fiscal discipline -- former president Trump blew that one too. So, I just think there's a lot of things within the mantle of the Republican party that we've kind of lost focus on. I just want what's best for the party. It doesn't have to be the Chris Sununu show all time. It's just what's best. So, that's just what I'm narrowing down. Now the money has been lined up.

Something that an advisor to Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the opposition leader, said took polarization to an extreme level. It was also the first time in Turkish history that they've gone to a runoff. Because obviously the first round was so, so close. And Erdogan was not able to get half of the electorate to vote for him on the first poll.In terms of issues, I mean, there was tons of them. They were front and center really divisive issues. Things on Syrian refugees. Obviously, the government's response to the earthquakes. But perhaps one of the biggest one that affected Turks directly was on inflation. It's something that hit 85 percent in the past year. Some say that it was even higher than that. And the government's response to it has been extremely unconventional. To actually lower interest rates, rather than raise them, which is what's happened in much of the rest of the Western world. And so, given all of the issues here, it's actually a wonder that Erdogan did as well as he did. But being the incumbent comes with a lot of built-in advantages. Case in point, state TV in Turkey in the month of April gave Erdogan 32 hours of coverage, gave Kemal Kilicdaroglu just 32 minutes of coverage. And that's why you had Kilicdaroglu saying there were, quote, all sorts of black propaganda and slander. He also in his speech after the results came, he vowed to continue to fight for what he called, quote-unquote, real democracy. And he also said the results, despite a loss, do send a message. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KEMAL KILICDAROGLU, TURKISH OPPOSITION LEADER (through translator): In this election, the will of the people to change an authoritarian government became clear despite all of the pressures. We have been going through one of the most unfair political times of our country. And all of the facilities and all of the resources have been systematically abused by the government.

Pointing out that the number of seats his party holes in parliament has decreased since 2018. He has another five-year mandate now. That means that he will have plenty more confidence not only at home but on the international stage. Where as know, Turkey has become much more of a regional power player. And much more of a country that's been able to leverage its position as sort of straddling the Western world in the Eastern world. And you know, on one hand it's a NATO ally, on the other hand it has good relations with Russia. And so, a lot of focus rightly so has been on this election and will be on what Erdogan does with his new term in power.",

The targets, Ukrainian officials say, were military infrastructure and civilian infrastructure. In this comes just a day after on Sunday, Ukraine says it witnessed the largest assault by drones since the conflict began. Nearly 60 drones, most of those, the overwhelming number of those, shattered Iranian-made drones being fired across Ukraine. Most of those drones, all but one of those drones, according to Ukrainian officials was taken out.So, what do we take from this? Yes, as you mentioned, it seems that there is an uptick here in Russian assaults far from those frontlines on other areas, civilian areas across Ukraine. And yes, this terrifies the citizens, the civilians of Ukraine. But it also forces Ukraine to use up valuable munitions. One of those Shahed drones -- they're very cheaply made -- one of those Shahed drone's costs about 20 times less than the missiles required to take out the drones. You can see there that Russia is forcing Ukraine to use these valuable resources at a time that it really needs them on the front line.
