Iran's semi-official Fars News Agency, citing local sources, says tonight an explosion was heard northwest of Isfahan. That is about four hours south of the capital city of Tehran. And we can't say anything right now about what caused that explosion, but if Israel did in fact strike, that decision would ignore persistent pushing from the United States and its allies all across the world to show restraint. CNN's reporters are here with us standing by. Let's start with Alex Marquardt. He is live tonight in Washington. Alex, what do we know at this hour?",

      "sentences": "Well, Abby, details still very much coming in, but we have had percolating reports about explosions, blasts heard in Iran. Of course, the immediate assumption is this is indeed the Israeli retaliation for Iran's massive strike against Israel last weekend with more than 300 drones and missiles.But what we know so far is simply that explosions have been heard. This comes from now multiple Iranian semi-official news outlets, the latest from press T.V. reporting that an explosion was heard near Iran's central city of Isfahan. The reason is still unknown. And that echoes what we heard just moments ago from another semi-official news agency called, Fars. So, here we have Iranian media itself reporting an explosion or explosions in one of Iran's most prominent cities. Isfahan, it is in the middle of the country, towards the western part of the country. It does have a prominent nuclear facility, but I will note that this was near Isfahan. So, it is very much unclear what the target may have been, indeed how this was carried out. We have not heard anything, Abby, from the IDF, from any Israeli officials. We have not heard anything from any American officials. We, of course, are checking with our sources. This is something that we have been anticipating for several days now. It has always been a question of how Israel would try to thread the needle of responding to this historic attack by Iran without escalating the situation. That has certainly been the priority of the U.S. and its allies that Israel should be allowed to do what it wants to, because it's a sovereign country, but not escalate this already incredibly volatile situation. And, Abby, I would just note that about two and a half hours ago, right here on CNN, the Iranian foreign minister said in no uncertain terms that if Israel were to strike Iran directly, that there would be an immediate and maximum response from Iran. But for now, Abby, we are still trying to learn what these explosions, or this explosion was, that is now being reported by Iranian media. Abby?",

As Alex was saying there, the Iranian foreign minister just a few hours ago saying that there would be a decisive immediate response that essentially Israel would regret it.The skies over this city are quiet. There're no sirens going off here. We're not aware of sirens anywhere else in Israel at the moment. We are beginning to get a few more details of the strikes, all these explosions, at least, as far that we know about now, in Isfahan, northwest of Isfahan, is what the Fars News Agency in Iran, semi- official news agency there, is reporting. So, we are beginning to build up a slow picture. And I think a couple of other details to bring into the picture that we've been tracking over the past few hours, flight radar, tracking of flights in the skies above Iran, have indicated within the past hour or so that flights have been changing their flight paths to avoid Iranian airspace. We're also aware that, in the last half an hour or so, a NOTAM, a no- fly declaration has been made for the west of Iran, which would be the side of Iran that, if there were Israeli fighter jets on their way into Iranian airspace, they would be coming from potentially from the west of Iran. They could come from the south as well, but perhaps a more direct, more covert route for them might be from the west. So, that piece of information, I think, is telling and important. And I think what first caught our attention here earlier on this evening, which could be completely unrelated, but a number of small earthquakes were recorded in several Iranian desert locations outside of cities. Now, there's no detailed information that we have about these yet, but this evening, this sort of gathering picture of strikes or explosions heard in other cities, we know of at least two other cities where the local population that we cannot confirm at the moment, I should stress that, cannot confirm, have reported unexplained explosions. Now, of course, in Iran, people can be concerned about the possibility of this pending Israeli airstrike threat, and people can misread things that can be as much as an exploding tire on the road outside of where they live. So, I stress all this information has to be tracked down. And, of course, Iran controls the information flow inside the country, and the internet is not ready available, and Twitter is not ready available. And a high-speed cellular network connection is not so ready for people. The Iranian government controls that because they want to control the message and information, whether it's about protests on the street or the explosions that may be happening in the country. So, the fact that we're only through the news channels that are sanctioned by the government of Iran hearing about explosions in one city or close to one city, Isfahan, is only as far as we can tell at the moment part of the picture of what we think may be happening. But it's going to take time for us to look at what we're hearing, look at the details we're getting, cross-referencing them, and try to get some better clarity on them.",

That is in the sort of central western part of Iran, south of Tehran as well. I want to bring in now former DNI, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Director Clapper, this is a very serious moment as we wait to find out exactly what has happened here. The reports, as of right now, of explosions, are obviously not in a vacuum. It's in the context of this intense counterattack by Iran on Israel over the weekend. The United States had been trying to push retaliation off.

We do need more clarity on what the targets are and the nature of damage done, were there casualties, et cetera.I think there are two major questions that the president will look to his national security team for. One is to intelligence. Okay, the Israelis have attacked, apparently attacked Iran. How will the Iranians retaliate? And secondarily, that's a question for the intelligence community. And then from a policy perspective, we had stated that we would not support an attack by Israel against Iran. Well, will we support Israel when Iran counter-retaliates? So, we could be in for, you know, a tit-for-tat that could rapidly get out of control. So, this is, you know, a pretty serious turning point. I had commented earlier that, you know, it looks like the Iranians crossed the Rubicon by attacking, or attempting to attack Israel proper. Well, the other side of that Rubicon appears now has been crossed by Israel. So, you know, where do we go from here?",

We haven't gotten confirmation or information about what they're seeing in this case, but I certainly agree with James Clapper that it's difficult to see this very much so as anything other than Israel's response, which had been promised by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, by Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.So, it's difficult to see the situation we're playing out right now with reports of explosions in Isfahan, Iran, as well as some explosions in Syria and Iraq as anything other than the Israeli response that they had been promising. A few interesting points to make here. Over the course of the past six months, we have seen Israel openly talk about some of its strikes in Lebanon, a smaller number in Syria. Here it seems, if this is indeed Israel, Israel once again choosing to be quiet. This is a policy they had followed for many, many years, not talking about actions and strikes that they would carry out in Syria, sometimes in Iraq. There were a number of reasons for that. One of those was simply not to be seen as boasting or bragging about an attack, not to add insult to injury. So, potentially, Israel once again following that policy right now, aware of not only how sensitive the entire situation in the region is, but also the desire of the United States not to see the situation escalate anymore here. Now, the question of explosions in Syria and Iraq, if Israel were to have attacked Iran, how would they do so, knowing that some of the countries that aided in the defense from the Iranian attack several days ago did not want to see anything coming through their airspace once again. Jordan, for example, would be an example of that. So, how would Israel, if it wanted to, seek out to strike Iran? Obviously, the obvious choice there is going through Syria and then over Iraq directly into Iran, likely with some sort of long-range missile taken from a fighter jet. Now the question of where does this go from here, I'll go back to Erin Burnett's interview with the Iranian foreign minister, which as you pointed out just a couple of hours ago, despite the fact that that was a completely ineffective Iranian attack on Israel, the foreign minister claimed victory. So it will be interesting to see how they describe this attack when they're able to say more. Do they simply call it a complete failure and what does that mean for their response? That's something the U.S. and, in all likelihood, Israel are right now watching very closely. Abby, one more question. The countries that participated in the defense of the Iranian attack, given the fact that this was or at least appears to be the Israeli response, do they do so again given what we're looking at here? And that's another question that the U.S. and others have to answer.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Again, we're trying to sort of piece together the limited information we have. Our assessment is that the most recent explosion sighted in the sky near Isfahan is about within the last half an hour.So, this does seem to be, as best we can read the situation, somewhat ongoing, although we're not quite reading it in real-time. We're also getting information more about the general picture in the skies above Iran. We know that a number of flights have now been canceled out of Tehran airport. That's significant that the airspace around there seems to have been closed. We know that there has been a NOTAM alerted for the west of Iran, for the skies above the west of Iran, so a no-fly zone for aircraft there. We're also seeing through flight tracking that some flights have been diverted from the airspace. So, it certainly gives the impression that there is unusual activity in the skies above Iran tonight and reason for the Iranians to be cautious about putting up commercial aircraft, which perhaps indicates that they are not in control of these unusual, unspecified events in the sky above Iran. My language is incredibly careful here, because we don't know what's actually happening in the skies there. We don't know what aircraft are there. There's a broad supposition that this could be an Israeli strike, but we don't have confirmation of that. We know Israel has been talking about striking back, but we don't know what's happening. We can piece together the picture. Something untoward is happening in the skies above Iran, and there are explosions close to a city that has a principal nuclear research facility, as well as multiple military bases. Again, we don't know the precise locations of these explosions, but we do know that they appear to be ongoing in pattern, at least as recently as the last half an hour. We also know that we have been tracking some other reports that have not yet come on Iranian state media. These have been social media reports. They have not yet come on state media in Iran in a couple of other cities. So, let's be cautious about that information for the moment as we try to piece together at least what we know the state media is reporting in Iran.",

      "sentences": "Well, just to answer the general's question there, Abby, there was a sense among U.S. officials that if there were a counterattack by Israel against Iran that the U.S. would be warned about it, not just as a courtesy because the U.S. is Israel's closest ally and its biggest supporter in terms of military aid and certainly in this war in Gaza, but also because an Iranian retaliation could significantly put American troops in harm's way.Of course, there are American troops and Syria as well as Iraq, there are American ships throughout the Middle East. And so there was a sense from senior officials who I've been speaking with for the past few days that if Israel decided to carry something out that they would be told. So, that's why, of course, we are reaching out to all of our sources now to get a sense of what the U.S. knew and when. So, again, to underscore that we do not know right now whether Israel has carried out any kind of strike. But I want to emphasize something that I learned a couple days ago, Abby, and that is the U.S. expectation, they had been told by Israeli officials that were there to be a counterattack, and, that was the expectation, we have been expecting something from Israel over the course of the past few days, that it would be, to quote one official, limited in scope. And what that would mean is essentially, we think, a handful of strikes. Another official was saying a kinetic attack against, say, military targets. Again, back to Israel's efforts to try to thread the needle in terms of sending a message to Iran, hitting back at Iran without escalating this situation, I was just speaking with a senior U.S. official just moments ago about that limited scope. And the understanding from the U.S. was that that would not include civilian or nuclear facilities. So, we're talking about Isfahan. We're talking about the nuclear facility that is there. And I'm being told now by a U.S. official that their understanding from Israeli officials was they would not go after any nuclear, any new facilities in our counterattack. Again, we do not know that the explosions happened near there or at that facility, and we again don't know whether Israel carried out any kind of attack. But that certainly was the understanding from U.S. officials. One more thing, Abby, is that the U.S. thought that Israel was going to do something and strike back at Iran because of that attack last weekend, but the U.S. firmly did not want Israel to this. And in speaking with this senior official just moments ago, that person said, you know, there was no green light from the U.S. for any kind of retaliatory attack against Iran. Now, the US is not saying that Israel needs their permission because Israel is a sovereign nation. They can do whatever they want. But in this moment, with such massive U.S. support for Israel's war in Gaza, the U.S. certainly has a large amount of leverage. And the United States, along with close allies, France and Britain, who, mind you, helped out in that -- helped defend Israel last weekend, other members of the G7, they all wanted Israel to, in the words of the White House, take the win, recognize that they had been attacked by Iran on a massive scale and done a very, very good job at defending themselves, knocking some 99 percent of projectiles, the drones, and missiles out of the sky, and that that Iranian attack was in response to Israel's attack two weeks prior in Damascus. So, in the view of Biden administration, the score had essentially been settled. And at this extremely intense moment the U.S. did not want to see any more action by Israel against Iran. And so, of course, there is profound fear that that is exactly what we are seeing right now. We don't know it but there's a good chance that Israel is carrying out some kind of operation and then, of course, we have to get a sense of what that strike looked like, whether it was indeed in that narrow scope. Because if it was, that will tell us that Israel is hoping that that will be the end of it. But, of course, as I and others have said in these past few moments, the foreign minister of Iran saying very clearly right here on CNN that they are very willing to hit back, hit back hard, it back quickly and expand the kind of targets that they tried to go after last weekend, which as far as we know, were just military.

Now, as far as Tehran was concerned, after the drone and the missileattacks of last weekend, almost as that attack was still ongoing on Israeli soil, we heard from Tehran that they said this has been concluded. So, as far as they were concerned, at least as far as they said publicly, that was in response for the Israeli attack on the diplomatic compound in Syria, which they said they felt as if it were on their home soil, on Iranian soil, as they said it was a diplomatic compound. And that was their response to that. They were very clear that they believed that that was the end of it, something which Alex reporting has shown as well, that the U.S. was hoping would be the case. But clearly we have heard from the Israeli side that that is not the end of it, that they would be responding at some point, as well. But from the Iranian side, we have also heard just yesterday, local time on Thursday, from a Revolutionary Guards commander who's in charge of nuclear security in Iran, saying that if, and it is an if, Israel were to go after some of its nuclear assets, then it could, in fact, rethink its nuclear doctrine, its nuclear policy. Now, Iran has been saying up until this point that its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes, something many countries do not take at face value. But they have said that if there is this case where Israel does go after its nuclear assets, then that could change the equation quite significantly. Also, this commander saying that they know where the Israeli nuclear assets are, for example, and that they could go after those assets. Now, of course, a lot of this could be posturing, a lot of this is for public consumption, even domestic consumption within Iran, as well. But this is the response that we have been hearing over recent days from Tehran, that if Israel goes after its assets, then the response would be more significant coming the other way. Abby.",

And to General Marks' point, did they attack with a cruise missile?I likely think that they used manned aircraft in this kind of operation to ensure that their targeting was very precise. Maybe they did not want to hit that facility on purpose, but they went after the military targets there. So, the kind of military is there, is there to protect it just from what Israel did, which again, the why becomes sends the signal to Iran that says, we can come after this facility if we want to.",

I mean, I think what you're really seeing is that the rules of the road at the Middle East are being rewritten in real time. You're seeing red lines suddenly become very, very blurry.Last Saturday, the Iranians launched a massive attack on Israel with over 300 drones and missiles. That's something that's never happened before. Iran and Israel have been fighting a shadow war since 1979, but they have never directly attacked each other's territory. You've seen a lot of Israeli airstrikes on Iranian assets in Lebanon and in Syria. You've seen Israeli covert action inside Iran. You've seen Iranian-backed terrorist attacks on Israel, but never an actual attack from Iran into Israel. And now, you're seeing something in retaliation, most likely, that you've also never seen before, which is most likely a direct attack from Israel into Iran. Now, I would imagine that both Iran and Israel are trying to calibrate their actions to avoid a wider war, which neither side really wants. But it may be very hard to do, because I'm not sure they have a great idea of what the new rules of the road are or how to prevent misunderstandings. But I would infer two things from the reports that we're seeing, Abby. One is that if, in fact, Israel has been striking fairly recently, that's very early in the morning, right? So, I'd assume they're striking early in the morning in part to avoid casualties, to avoid killing a lot of Iranians, probably trying to target sites without causing mass casualties. The other thing I would note is if these reports are accurate about explosions inside Iran, that suggests the Israeli airstrikes are getting through, which is not what happened with the Iranian airstrikes on Saturday. When 99 percent of the Iranian projectiles were down, this suggests, obviously, that Iranian air defenses are not as good as the Israeli air defenses, and the Israelis have more potent air power than the Iranians. But where this goes from here, I think, remains very much undetermined. And now, just as on Saturday it was up to Israel, now it's really up to Iran.",

The Israelis had no response, had no idea that the Iranian response would be to launch 300 drones and missiles at Israel. They expected that Iran would stay within kind of the rules of the game and have a much lower level response. But they didn't. Iran escalated. Now, Israel feels compelled to escalate in turn. And so, you know, both sides are maybe hoping, okay, maybe we can turn it down eventually. But this could easily spiral out of control because, again, you've been showing the video yourself of the Iranian foreign minister threatening devastating responses should Israel attack Iran, which it certainly looks like they have done now.",

He's standing by reiterating the news here for folks who are tuning in right now.Three explosions have been heard near an army base inside of Iran near the city called Isfahan. That is a very large city, the third largest in Iran. It's one where we know there is a nuclear base, but there is also a military base, as well.

And also, when you go back to the nuclear deal that was signed a number of years ago that the United States then invalidated and walked away from, there were conditions in that in that that prohibited unannounced inspections, which means the Iranians had the ability to do the enrichment and then transport or move that enrichment to a military facility.In other words, right outside the gate into another compound with very short movement requirements, distribution requirements that what that might be difficult to detect. So, it's not surprising at all. And so going after an enrichment facility like that, ideally, if we certainly don't know what took place, but there will be a requirement to do some very thorough bomb damage assessment to make a determination of what the possible next steps are. Look, if the Israelis wanted to achieve a result to degrade the Iranian nuclear progress, the development of this capability, there has to be an assessment of what they accomplished. If it was simply to describe a capability that the Iranians have, it's no mystery to the world that the Iranians can conduct military operations along multiple lines of effort simultaneously. We see that right now, Hezbollah, Hamas efforts elsewhere in the region and then conducting this strike into Iran. I mean, this is quite amazing, not surprising entirely. The Israelis have this incredibly capable military force. So, if they're not sending a message, they're trying to achieve a result. We don't know what that result looks like.

I take the Iranian officials, notably the foreign minister, at their word, and I don't think they're going to respond in kind, but they're going to respond with a larger attack that in their minds would be more effective than the first one.",

But air defense platforms, there's other air defense platforms thatcould have attacked along that border. They could have been Republican Guard forces. They could have been other military units that the Israelis thought was high-value targets, and this was an opportunity to go after them. But again, in most cases, they would have to take out multiple air defense platforms along the way, along that axis of attack, if they're especially going to put their own pilots in harm's way in order to conduct this kind of attack. So, we have to see. We'll get more information. But from my perspective, the why, I think, comes back to a warning to Iran that they will go after their nuclear facilities.",

But how are they going to create a long- term peace in Gaza? They don't seem to have any concept of what happens after the guns fall silent. They don't have any idea of who's actually going to govern in Gaza. And I kind of feel like they have a similar problem with Iran. They feel like, okay, we've been attacked. We have to show, don't mess with us, we're going to hit back. But where does it go from here? If Iran hits back, how do they prevent this larger war from breaking out, which is Robinson (ph). I think that's right. Neither side really wants that larger war, but both sides are determined to show, you can't push me around. I have to establish my deterrence.
