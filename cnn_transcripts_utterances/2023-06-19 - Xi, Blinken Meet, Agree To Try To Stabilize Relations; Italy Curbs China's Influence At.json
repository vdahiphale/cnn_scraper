And a search mission is underway for a missing submarine that host tours for the wreck of the Titanic. Coming to you live from New York, it is Monday, June 19th. I'm Zain Asher, in for my colleague, Richard Quest and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, China and the United States have agreed to try to stabilize ties in a bid to stop their growing rivalry veering into conflict. The rare meeting of America's top diplomat, Antony Blinken and Chinese leader, Xi Jinping in Beijing did not however, lead to any many rather breakthroughs. The two powers still have no direct military communication and Beijing has rejected Washington's de-risking policy towards China. Still, the US secretary of State praised the progress made.

Exports fell seven-and-a-half percent in May compared to a year earlier. Retail sales and manufacturing output came in below expectations as well. The property market is still struggling after last year's slump. Last week, Beijing cut rates and more stimulus is expected and it is in growing competition with the United States over semiconductors and the supply of critical minerals. Let's bring in Kevin Liptak in Washington and Ivan Watson in Hong Kong. Ivan, let me start with you. One of the most important things especially going into this meeting was really to try to develop open lines of communication between both US and China especially, especially during times of military crisis.

The Chinese Foreign minister accepted his invitation to come to Washington sometime in the future. There are further agreements to kind of set up working groups on kind of low hanging fruit issues like student-to-student exchanges, business exchanges, academic exchanges, and resuming a senior level dialogue, so it worked there. He succeeded in having meetings with the Chinese leadership at the very highest level, Xi Jinping himself, who talked about the need to stabilize this deteriorating relationship. And that word, \"stabilize\" was echoed by Blinken himself. When it does come to military-to-military relations, well, that's where the meeting fell short. Blinken said the Chinese have not agreed to move forward on that, and a senior Chinese diplomat has responded saying the US knows what to do to fix that. The US currently has sanctions on China's Defense minister, Li Shangfu and the Chinese are arguing that's why these two militaries cannot talk face- to-face right now.",

These are huge, huge trading partners, and they quite literally can't afford right now to not deal with each other at some level even though there is a tremendous amount of mistrust. The bounce back of the Chinese economy after it did away with its Zero- COVID Policy that's only about six months ago, that it was isolating itself from the rest of the world, it has not bounced as much back as it would like. It has record high youth unemployment right now, it needs business. And Beijing has been watching the Biden administration engage in just real diplomatic progress, strengthening military and political ties with all sorts of countries here in Asia, from South Korea, to Japan to the Philippines, Australia, and on and on, but also watching the ties grow between the US and Europe over the Ukraine war and feeling perhaps somewhat left out and isolated to some degree. China's premier is in Germany right now on a trip there trying to play nice over there. So China has illustrated that despite the fact that not long ago, it was talking about wanting to rewrite the international order with its close friend, Vladimir Putin, it does seem to need the US to some degree and is acknowledging that even though there are still huge levels of mistrust in this bilateral relationship.",

The US paused interest rate hikes, the EU raised and China cut. The latest outlook from the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development says headline inflation in the OECD will continue to fall this year and will cool to 4.3 percent in 2024. OECD secretary-general, Mathias Cormann told Julia Chatterley earlier, central bankers are heading into a crucial period. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATHIAS CORMANN, OECD SECRETARY-GENERAL: Certainly, the US Federal Reserve went very hard earlier and for some time, and indeed, I mean, you know, obviously, as you go forward, you need to give yourself the time to properly assess as the risks of doing too much or too little become more equally balanced. You know, it's important to really focus very carefully on the data that's coming through. I mean, in Europe, you know, we see that there is some more tightening that is likely to be required. But again, of course, you know, these decisions will be informed by the data as it comes through. You know, in relation to China, you know, obviously, they are assessing the data that they're looking at as they are making their decisions. I mean, no two economies are entirely in the same stage. And, of course, you know, relevant decisions have got to be made based on the relevant data in relevant economies. JULIA CHATTERLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR, \"FIRST MOVE\": Part of the debate that's being had in the United States is whether the targets for inflation, even bear relation to the world we're in today with the energy transition that you've mentioned, that's taking place, particularly in places like Europe. But if we talk specifically about the United States, the shift in supply chains, changes in globalization, do you worry that Central Banks in particular are pushing towards inflation targets that aren't really relevant for today's economies, and the danger is perhaps they go too far?",

But I mean, what we see is that the supply chain pressures in the context - - in the aftermath of the pandemic, in the context of the war of Ukraine, I mean, supply chain pressures have actually eased and it is very important to get inflation durably under control and to ensure that inflation expectations are well anchored. I mean, in the end, it's the lowest income people in economies around the world that get hit the hardest and get hurt the most when inflation gets out of control. And so in terms of stability and the capacity to sustainably grow the economy moving forward and offer the best possible opportunity for people to get ahead, having a stable inflationary environment is a very important ingredient. So, you know, I would certainly caution against any suggestion that, you know, the inflation targeting approach by central banks is no longer required. It's a very central and important feature of our economic stability and will be so into the future. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the Caxton card actually enables you to take advantage of those rates and preload now. Regardless of how far in the future your holiday is. And meaning that you'll be able to save even more on the exchange rate rather than doing what most people do and leaving it to the very last minute. And one of the things that the survey really hit home with was looking at what banks but in particular charge you just for accessing your funds abroad, particularly when utilizing ATM machines. And we found it really surprising, especially in the current economic world that we're living in, with price -- food prices rising. Just the general cost of living. And more now than ever, people are really wanting to understand where every penny is going. And ATMs abroad have increased significantly over the last five to seven years. And there are two types of fees that people need to look out for. And one is the actual fee that the ATM owner charges. Now that's normally a standard fixed fee, and one that's almost unavoidable now, but the one that people really do need to keep an eye out for them and where they can particularly save with the Caxton card and where we've been true for the last 20 years to what we stood by is not charging anything conditional.

That's really important information, Zain. As you said, they're supposed to descend and again, we're talking deep water exploration here. This is about as, you know, technically complex is trying to go up in space. You have to think it's two -- nearly 2-1/2 miles to the bottom of the sea. So an hour and 45 minutes. Hard to know exactly where they were. And they're trying to pinpoint that right now. And this submersible has lost communication in the past with the vessel that is escorting them. In this case, it was called the polar princes out there. Obviously right now it's a former Canadian icebreaker, and it is assisting in the rescue efforts. At issue here, Zain is pretty old-fashioned concept of time, right? It's been about 24 hours. They have about four days food, fuel, oxygen, 96 hours, that's in the best conditions. You also have to think about the weather a concern quite dramatically in that location. It is about nearly 400 miles or 600 kilometers southeast of St. John's Newfoundland. All the assets that they can muster right now in the air and at sea being brought to bear on what is essentially still pretty rough seas. The Coast Guard says that they will have a briefing in about an hour from now, Zain. So we should know more. Again, we believe the Coast Guard says that there are five people missing at this hour. And I don't want to leave people with the impression that this is a tourist excursion like you go look at whales. No, not only is this very expensive, it's very intricate. It takes a lot of expertise and technical know how to get these people who are tourists but also explorers down to see the bottom of this wreck. And it is all a few. OceanGate says that look our expeditions are all in the name of research. They have not had -- they've had difficulties before but certainly nothing is serious. And so again, both Canada and the United States and quite frankly, Zain, expertise from all over the world bringing to bear right now the information that they can in order to help which with what will be a very complicated deep-sea rescue.
