And while the allegations of cash, the gold bars, even the convertibles are getting all the attention, the other end of those alleged bribes is downright chilling.Good evening. I'm Abby Phillip. The Justice Department, indicting Democratic Senator Bob Menendez and his wife on federal corruption charges. Among those allegations that he sought and received sensitive information about U.S. diplomats in Egypt, information that eventually made its way to people with ties to the government there. Now, in addition, prosecutors say that he gave non-public information about U.S. military aid, and he's also accused of ghostwriting a pitch to senators on behalf of a foreign government. Now, that would ease restrictions on arms and ammunition to Egypt. Now, those restrictions were in place, in part due to concerns about human rights and democracy. All of this as he is chairing the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, one of the most powerful positions in the entire government. These schemes allegedly ended with stacks of cash, more than a dozen gold bars, help on mortgage payments, a Mercedes-Benz convertible, and you're seeing right there pictures of the evidence. But the timeline is important and also stunning here. This alleged conduct started not long after Menendez escaped conviction on previous bribery charges when a jury deadlocked, but also it allegedly began around the same time that he said this about then-President Donald Trump. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ):  The American people deserve to know who they elected to be their president. They deserve to know if he's, in fact, putting America's interests first. And they deserve to know if Donald Trump is wittingly or unwittingly an agent for the Russian Federation. Congress must carry out its constitutional duty to fully and thoroughly investigate where the facts lead. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The number of Democrats calling on him to resign is growing, both from Congress and from his home state of New Jersey, but Menendez is maintaining his innocence and he says his ethnicity is to blame. Quote, those who believe in justice believe in innocence until proven guilty. I intend to continue to fight for the people of New Jersey with the same success I've had for the past five decades.This is the same record of success these very same leaders have lauded all along. It is not lost on me how quickly some are rushing to judge a Latino and push him out of his seat. I am not going anywhere. As for the man in charge of the United States Senate, Chuck Schumer is praising Menendez's work. He says he is temporarily stepping down from the Foreign Relations Committee. And he says that Menendez has a right to due process and a fair trial. That may be so, but many of his fellow Democrats aren't as forgiving, including my next guest. Joining me now is New Jersey Democrat Steven Fulop. He's the mayor of Jersey City and also a candidate for New Jersey governor in 2025. Mayor Fulop, thanks for joining us. You are now a part of this growing course of Democrats calling on Senator Menendez to resign. What did you find to be the most damning allegation in the indictment against him? MAYOR STEVEN FULOP (D-NEW JERSEY CITY, NJ):  I mean, I think your intro was pretty spot-on. And if you read the indictment, I mean, it was 40 pages. It read like a movie script. It was really hard to kind of take in from DNA on money and gold bars and, of course, cars and then giving information to the Egyptian government. So, it was kind of really kind of a salacious 40 pages. And, you know, it makes it really hard to say that everything in there is not true. Maybe Bob Menendez or Senator Menendez could defend some of it. But it will be really tough to say that every component of that is defensible, if any of it. It seems like none of it --",

But the question is what platform and what paradigm do we use to engage that negotiation. I believe that we should negotiate each agency of government and each appropriation bill separately so that we get to a programmatic level of analysis.What I disagree with is the notion that we should start with the premise that we just fund everything the way it's been going the prior year, whether it's worked or not, whether it's exceeded, it's expended, it's expected distributions of funds or not. You see, that just leads to more of the same. It's actually precisely the reason that we are $33 trillion in debt, facing $2 trillion annual deficits. We cannot go on as a country that's spending $7 trillion and bringing in $5 trillion. So I hope we can get bipartisan agreement to reduce spending.",

What do you think?FRENCH-GATES:  I think it's ridiculous that when a woman reaches the position that she has reached, that they're asked whether they have the skills or they're qualified. I mean, one of the things that to me is outrageous is that we have a Senate in the United States that has no female black senators, not a single black female senator in our country.

We're sending women and women of color into a broken system. And until we can get them to all these positions of power, we're not going to fix and change that system. I want to ask you just more broadly. I mean, we are also sitting at a time where we're in the middle of all these strikes, right? Auto workers, actors, directors, you name it. It seems like in this country there's a question about fairness in our economy. You've had the, you know, the pleasure and luxury of being a fabulously wealthy person deciding also to give a lot of that, most of it, away. But when you look at the broader society, especially here in the United States, what do you see? Is it fair? FRENCH-GATES:  It's not working for us. What we're hearing from workers is these wages aren't working for us anymore to raise our families so that we become middle-income or we go from middle to high- income. That's the American dream. That's what my grandfather lived, my parents lived, and I've been fortunate enough in the situation I'm in. Everybody should be able to live that dream.
