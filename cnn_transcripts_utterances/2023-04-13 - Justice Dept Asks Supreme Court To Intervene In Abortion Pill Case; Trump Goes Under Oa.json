      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to Inside Politics. I'm John King in Washington. Remarkably busy news day. Thanks for your time today. Just moments ago, the Justice Department asking the Supreme Court to intervene in an abortion pill case with ramifications everywhere you live.Plus, today, Donald Trump goes under oath. The New York attorney general deposes the former president. He likely faces hundreds of questions with $250 million and the survival of his family business on the line. And the Democratic Party clash over age ambition and a stalled Biden priority. 89-year-old Senator Dianne Feinstein says, she won't resign after missing a month plus of work. And after a California colleague says, she's no longer fit to serve and that she should quit. Up first for us though, the Biden Justice Department just moments ago is saying it will ask the Supreme Court to step in, that after an appeals panel dramatically changes, how women can get an abortion again. The Biden Justice Department now wants the High Court to sweep aside this. A 42-page order from the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals filed just before midnight, that delivers some relief from a Texas judge's ruling that would have taken an abortion pill off shelves starting Friday. But that ruling also imposes hard to ignore obstacles to getting the drug. It outlaws sending the pill in the mail. It ups the number of doctor visits to get a prescription and it bars non physicians from administering the drug, and critically, it makes the drug unavailable to women after seven weeks of pregnancy. The likely result if this ruling stands well, far fewer women who want to will actually be able to use it. Our senior Supreme Court analyst Joan Biskupic is here with the important new details. Joan, a big ruling last night and then a big decision by the Justice Department. JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYST: That's right, John. Things are moving so fast, and I think we can expect that over the next 24, 36 hours. Because the original order in this case against the FDA approval of the drug was set to take place at the end of Friday at midnight. And let me just tell you what Attorney General Merrick Garland just put out. He said the Justice Department strongly disagrees with the Fifth Circuit decision to deny in part a request for a stay pending appeal. We will be seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court to defend the FDA scientific judgment and protect Americans access to safe and effective reproductive care. The key here is that this case is now right on the doorstep of the Supreme Court, a Supreme Court that 10 months ago, completely removed the constitutional right to abortion, rolling back nearly 50 years of precedent. So, we know where the court was at for that case. The question is where will the court be at for this case that doesn't go to deep constitutional issues, but rather goes to the FDA approval, its expertise to take science, its own scientific determinations to decide which drugs are effective and safe. It was the year 2000 that the FDA first said that this first pill of the two-drug medication abortion that now most women used nationwide to end a pregnancy could go into effect. At issue, as you said in your chart, certain new restrictions that would be put on women's access to the pill. Those came later in 2016 and beyond. And that's just about where the rubber meets the road for this case. It's in terms of access, not the core approval for the drug, but women's access to it. And obviously, the Justice Department thinks that what the Fifth Circuit did last night is restrictive enough that it has to come and step in. And I have to say there's this broader issue, not just about abortion access, as important as that is to both sides. But to the FDA's core approval of any existing drug and new drugs, who and when can challenge those. Those are the kinds of issues here. We're about to see the filing from the Department of Justice that will go to the Supreme Court. And then we're bound to see actions very quickly, John, just as quickly as we've seen already this week.",

Donald Trump left Trump Tower. You see him there in New York City this morning. He is sitting right now for potential marathon deposition. Hundreds of questions from the New York State attorney general about his business and an alleged decade long pattern. The attorney general says of lying to lenders and to others.

Let's move on now some important developments being reported about a very different investigation. This is the special counsels' federal investigation of Donald Trump.One of those is about the Mar-a-Lago documents. The other one is about 2020 election interference, trying to overturn the election. The Washington Post reporting this. It's about the fundraising the Trump organization was doing, as it was contesting the election results. The fundraising prong of its investigation is focused on money raised during the period between November 3, 2020, that's Election Day, and the end of Trump's time in office on January 20, 2021. Prosecutors are said to be interested in whether anyone associated with the fundraising operation violated wire fraud laws, which make it illegal to make false representations over email to swindle people out of money. So, if you knew that he lost fair and square, and you were raising money saying the election was stolen. Is it Donald Trump who is potentially liable for the campaign people sending up those emails?",

And that here in the course of political fundraising.You know, the interesting thing here, John, is that also this question of, did they know they were lying? And did they know they won the election also plays in Georgia, another matter in which the foreign president is being investigated. When it comes down to the question ultimately, of did the president and his team know they lost the election? It's a very important point and wire fraud here carries huge penalties.",

ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: That subtext there is really, really interesting and important here. We know that even before this news story, there was growing concern and calls for whether or not Congress in the current age of Congress represented, including with the Democratic Party, specifically represented now the sort of coalition of that party throughout the country and the base. Also, when you look at just the data that you just pulled up of judicial appointments, I think it's important to remember that, especially in December of last year, one of the things the White House was celebrating and talking about the most were judicial appointments. There was even sort of countdown to with the -- if they would get to a 100 before the end of the year. Now you have these two things kind of coming to a head, both whether or not Congress represents the growing sort of base of the Democratic Party.

He apparently worked in the intelligence wing of the air -- of the Massachusetts Air National Guard.Now, the Times is reporting that the FBI has zeroed in on someone on him, specifically as someone they would like to speak to about the leaks, so not going as far as to say that he is the leaker. However, we did learn from the Washington Post just last night that the leader of this group chat had been the one who was leaking all of these classified documents over the last several months, according to a friend of his who was in that chat room who spoke to the Washington Post. This is someone who, according to that friend, again was trying to impress the younger members on that group chat who was very suspicious of government overreach and who wanted to share all of these classified documents on this server, so that he could convey to his buddies essentially the kind of access he had as well as what he saw as government overreach. Now, it is unclear at this point whether the FBI has zeroed in on him as a suspect. But we are told that the FBI has narrowed the pool of suspension -- suspected leakers substantially and they are homing in on individuals that they believe could have been responsible for this.
