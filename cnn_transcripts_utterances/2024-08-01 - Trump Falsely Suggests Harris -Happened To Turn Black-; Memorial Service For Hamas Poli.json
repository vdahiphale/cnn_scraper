Of course, they said all of this off record. They didn't want their names in the stories because they played this game before. We've all played this kind of vein before. I think the real thing to answer is, is this the time when they're real political implications? But now, we've seen a lot of polling in the last couple of days does lead is nationally had been erased. The Bloomberg swing state tracking poll the other day had Kamala Harris up and some of these states. Are there political consequences for that? Is that momentum for Democrats are going to continue.

I mean, she knows that especially as Democratic base, lots of surprise by a lot of the actions that they're seeing from the Republican Party.So, really, she's trying to turn things. She's trying to turn this narrative and we've seen it over the last week, not just with the racist and sexist comments from Trump, but we're seeing it with just Democrat sort of uniting over a more concise message when they're -- when they're being critical Republican. I mean, we've seen how much Democrats have now adopted, calling Republicans weird, and how that seems to have really triggered a nerve with Republicans. So it seems like as we head into these final months, she's trying to focus in on okay, they want to attack her for her identity. They want to see Trump's running mate, J.D. Vance, focusing on, oh, if she lived in Canada for part of her teenage years or wants to focus on all these intricacies of, oh, well, her identity this or if she's a chameleon or she faked a Southern accent -- I mean, they're trying to grasp, but these different things. And what the -- what the Harrison this campaign and her allies are saying is, okay, let them do that, let them do that while were actually on the road doing events on an almost daily basis, let them do that while we just say, look at what they're saying, we don't have to give a descriptor for what they're saying.

And I want to show you those pictures once more because there is amessage in those images from Tehran. Iran is clearly saying, you did not just kill Haniyeh, because remember, they are accusing Israel, which has neither confirm nor denied this assassination. It is saying you have messed with Iran at large. You have violated the sovereignty of this country, and Iran supreme leader has promised, has vowed to fight back, to retaliate. But what does that look like? What are Tehran's options? It could directly strike Israel. But as you can imagine, that only escalates things further as you heard the warnings there from the United States dates saying, look, we have to be cautious. This could cause the region to spiral deeper, further into violence. The other option is that Iran could indirectly strike Israel, that is via its proxy militias. It could activate its tentacles in the region from Yemen to Syria, to Iraq to begin launching their own attacks. But that only expands the conflict which already has reached to Lebanon and across the region. So you are seeing a movement in time now, when there are serious fears that this only begins to rise, this escalation only begins to rise. And if you ask, well, how do we cool this down? How do we bring down the temperature? It's very difficult to see how that can happen when the mediator for Gaza himself, Ismail Haniyeh, is the one who was assassinated.",

So it basically follows that path. You can see it right about there, and some of the resulting wind storm reports that have been in place now. There's been over 500 reports of wind, hail, and even for tornado reports included in that. These are impressive numbers. Look at Omaha clocking in a 90 mile per hour wind gusts yesterday, that's equivalent to a category one hurricanes. So, powerful stuff, enough to knock down some power lines. And, of course, trees he saw that a moment ago. That means 2,000 or 280,00 people, customers, I should say, without power this morning. So here's our severe weather threat today, encompassing a large population density, Chicago, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, to Paducah, large hail damaging winds, all the possibility.
