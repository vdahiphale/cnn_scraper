He's pinned this on the state of New York and other legal entities as well.And then you have his opponents who say he's not treated -- he's very much being treated fairly. In fact, some would even say he could be treated probably -- maybe some institutions are being too soft on him. So, Trump is very much the -- trying to portray himself as the victim of that and I think there are voters who are certainly buying into that. The question I have is that how does this impact voters' choices when they go to the polls. I really don't think it does. You know, obviously, there is very low trust in our institution -- institutions this day and age. But at the same time, I don't think voters are tuning into these trials and thinking oh, Donald Trump's -- listening to Donald Trump's campaign messaging, and that's influence their vote.

But look, this is like -- Donald Trump is playing this out like a mafia boss, right? He's -- it's not that he's denying any of these things happened, like January 6, fake electors, documents, hush money -- hush payments. It's all happened, it's just well, I was above the law in that particular sequence and that day and that job description. It's all a series of technicalities. He still has a math problem with the suburbs, right? The suburbs are listening to this play out day after day after day and he's going to need women, especially in the suburbs, to show up and vote for him. I don't know of a single woman in the suburbs that I live in that says oh, you know what -- that Donald Trump -- he actually is a pretty good guy. And now that I'm hearing the facts of these cases come out, they're just not doing it. And I still think he has a math problem. Donald Trump does not win in November.

And Nikola Jokic -- his normal dominant self but he was an assist shy of a triple-double.The Nuggets would win game three 112-105. No team has ever come back from down 0-3 in NBA history. All right. In the third game of the night, the Magic handed the Cavs their worst playoff loss in franchise history. Paolo Banchero had Orlando up by 16 at the half. The lead only grew from there. The Magic would win that one by 38. The Cavs still lead that series, though, 2- 1. Three games on the schedule tonight with an early start. Bucks and Pacers are going to get things started with a 5:30 Eastern tipoff. Then you've got Clippers and Mavs at 8:00, followed by T-Wolves and the Suns at 10:30. And I'll tell you what, Kasie -- my boys very happy to see a 5:30 Eastern tipoff. They never get to see the end of games. They're always yelling at me they want to stay up.
