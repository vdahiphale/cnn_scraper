The second is that they don't believe the ongoing Special Counsel investigation is something really many people, outside of Washington, actually care about. They take it seriously. They're not dismissing it. But they believe that the issues and, what the President ran on and, they think, has delivered on, is what matters most. And it's not just the advisers that think that.

So Evan, we saw that exasperation, I guess, from the President, frustration, impatience, whatever, from President Biden, yesterday, when he was questioned about the Special Counsel investigation. It squares with our reporting that he's been frustrated about it, behind- the-scenes. How much do you think the investigation will factor into his decision? Or do you think it'll factor into the decision whether to run? EVAN OSNOS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR, BIDEN BIOGRAPHER, AUTHOR, \"WILDLAND: THE MAKING OF AMERICA'S FURY\": I think, as it stands now, he really does not see it, as an impediment to him running. That was, as Phil rightly said, I think, a pretty candid moment, a picture of that frustration that he feels not only with the focus that is now it's generating, this much, in Washington. But also, let's face it. He's frustrated also with the fact that this became an issue at all. The coin of the realm for him has been defining a contrast between him, and the man, he evicted, from the White House, Donald Trump. And to the degree to which this issue has allowed those two, to be put side by side? That makes it harder for him. But I don't think, at this point, there is anything to indicate that they believe that this is going to be an impediment, to what they consider to be a very strong record that they can run on, in 2024. And part of the reason why they're pushing back hard on it is that they want to make it clear that this is not the same thing, from their perspective. It's a fine line, though. Americans want to see, as he said, that there's no there there. And that means transparency, and being very cooperative.",

They don't want to talk about these documents. And quite frankly, they're going to say, \"There's not a lot to say, at this point. The Department of Justice is investigating.
