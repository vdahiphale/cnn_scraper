As we await their arrival, we'll talk to someone, who knows firsthand what they've been through. Trevor Reed is here to join me. Plus Vice President Harris is closing in on a running mate, as the contenders are clearing their calendars. The very latest on the veepstakes. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Soon tonight, three Americans, who were wrongfully detained in Russia, for a collective of eight years, will touch down on U.S. soil for the first time since being released. This is a live look, at the White House, this hour, where President Biden will soon depart, to go greet those now-former prisoners, at Joint Base Andrews, where they will be reunited with their families, who have been waiting for this day, for so long. Vice President Harris will also be there. We'll take you live to the tarmac in just a moment, where that plane will soon touchdown. But among those that you'll see step off that plane. Wall Street Journal reporter, Evan Gershkovich, who has been held since March of 2023. Also Marine veteran, Paul Whelan, who has been held since December 2018. And Russian-American journalist, Alsu Kurmasheva, held since October of last year. All detained on sham charges by Putin. Also released today was the American green card holder, and resident, Vladimir Kara-Murza -- Kara-Murza, who along with other Russian dissidents was also part of that release. This was the largest prisoner swap that we have seen since the Cold War. And it took years of negotiations to happen. It also took seven countries, to get this over the line, with many, many calls and meetings happening, behind-the-scenes. Officials that we heard from today said that they would only breathe a sigh of relief, really, once these Americans actually did touch the ground. In total, 16 political prisoners, held by Russia, were freed today, in exchange for eight Russian criminals, held either here in the United States, or elsewhere, that Putin also wanted to get back. That includes maybe the one that he wanted the most. Vadim Krasikov. He's an assassin, and Russian intelligence operative, who murdered somebody in broad daylight, in Germany. Putin literally rolled out the red carpet, when they made it back to Russia, earlier today. Here at home, President Biden was surrounded by the families, of those freed Americans, celebrating at the White House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

What we are about to see, later tonight, of course, comes after months of painstaking negotiations that required the U.S. to convince a number of other countries, to release Russian nationals, in their custody.We saw the President talking about sort of the gravity of this moment, and the significance of this deal coming together. We know now that President Biden and Vice President Harris played big roles, in privately putting pressure on German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to release a man, named Vadim Krasikov. This is the Russian assassin that we have been talking about, all day, who had been detained in Germany. And we know that when Scholz finally told President Biden that he was going to get to a yes on this, he said, quote, \"For you, I will do this.\" Another key country, of course, is Slovenia, who also had some key Russian nationals, in their custody. And we now know that President Biden, on the day that he announced that he was going to be dropping out of the 2024 race, actually, moments before that public announcement, placed an important phone call, to the Prime Minister of Slovenia, to push them and urge them on those two Russian nationals that are -- that were released as a part of this deal. Which means, Kaitlan, remarkably, on the day that the President announced that he was going to be dropping out, he knew that it was very likely that this huge prisoner swap was going to be probably cemented into his one-term legacy. Now, where we are, right now, of course, is JBA. And behind us, on the tarmac, is where the plane is going to land, carrying those three Americans. When they get off the plane, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and of course, most importantly, their families are going to be waiting for them. And while the first thing that they're really going to do is spend a little time, with their families, that have been waiting for their release, for so long. Their next stop, tonight, is going to be at San Antonio, where they are going to be taken to a medical center, so that they can be properly examined. And we're told, take all the time that they will possibly need, to get the care that they need. Of course, all of this is a reminder of all of the things that these three Americans had been through, as they had been in detention, in Russia, and hoping that they would get out. But again, right behind us on this tarmac, is where we expect to see, in just two hours or so, history unfolding, and a joyous reunion of three Americans, and their families, Kaitlan.",

And had he been in a position to have to negotiate, for the release of these Americans, he would have had no allies to lean on. The reason we got this deal done is because we had friends. Donald Trump couldn't have asked the German Chancellor, to release Krasikov. The phone would have been hung up, before he even got the question out. The only leverage that Donald Trump would have, if he gets elected, is giving away Ukraine. Putin probably will be in a position to do some favors for Donald Trump, because Putin will ask, in return, for America to abandon Ukraine, and Ukraine to be handed over to Russia, which would be cataclysmic for U.S. national security. So, it's just not true that Trump was any better negotiator. And it is true, that there's no way Donald Trump, or J.D. Vance, could have pulled off this agreement, because our allies will not pick up the phone, when Donald Trump, or J.D. Vance, calls.",
