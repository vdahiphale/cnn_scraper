Tomorrow's coronation could be a washout.Meteorologist Allison Chinchar, she's taking a look at this, tracking the weather and the rain that could be moving in. What's it looking like? ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST (on camera): I did the full meaning of rain on your parade may come to fruition tomorrow, unfortunately for a lot of those people that are standing outside, hoping to catch a glimpse. Now, when we look at today, we've already had some showers kind of move across the area. We're not talking a washout per se, but we have had several scattered showers move across areas of England also Ireland, and Scotland as the system continues to make its way off to the east. Here's a look at the radar. Again, the good news is we're not talking incredibly heavy rain. It hasn't been a washout. But you've had some patches here and there of some light to moderate showers. The problem is going forward. Now, in the morning. For a lot of those folks hoping to catch a glimpse before a lot of the festivities take place, you may get lucky. Things are expected to be much drier tomorrow morning. Once we get into the afternoon, though, look at that surge of moisture really starts to come in right around lunchtime locally there, and then continues through the afternoon hours. Unfortunately, that's when so many things are happening is really that key time between noon and say four to 5:00 p.m. tomorrow, a lot of people outside and unfortunately not really going to line up with a lot of the nicer weather. And then additional heavy rain pushes in on Monday. Overall, however, temperatures will be mild but really you're likely on the warmer end of some of the more recent coronations. You're just going to need the umbrella handy to go along with it.",

That session wraps up today.CNN'S Steve Contorno is in Florida for us. He's joining us now. Steve, what about the state legislature, their agenda really could be teeing up DeSantis for a presidential announcement. STEVE CONTORNO, CNN REPORTER (on camera): Kate, DeSantis handed off a long list of priorities that he wanted to see through -- get through this legislative session before he made an announcement for governor. And this legislature which is controlled in both chambers by Republicans largely delivers for him. Let me go through some of the priorities that have made its way to his desk. There are -- many of them are very contentious. It includes universities can no longer spend money on diversity programs. K-12 schools will restrict transgender teachers from using pronouns and -- you know their preferred choice and generally discouraged pronoun discussions in general. Abortion in Florida will be banned after six weeks with limited exceptions for rape, incest, and the life of the mother. It also allows people to carry -- they will also allow now people to carry a concealed weapon in Florida without training or a permit. The legislature also saved some of their most contentious items for the end, including a number of bills that will change the way -- change lives for transgender people in the state of Florida. There is a prohibition on children receiving gender-affirming treatments in Florida going forward. And it also prohibits transgender people from using the bathroom that matches their gender identity. And DeSantis has -- is actually holding a press conference right now where he is taking sort of a victory lap for everything he was able to get accomplished. And he wants to take these legislative accomplishments and basically turn them into a platform that can -- that he can run on against the Republican field. You know there are -- Kate, there are a lot of formers currently running for president. Former President Donald Trump, former Governor Nikki Haley, former Governor Hutchinson, but DeSantis as a current governor has had this ability to set the agenda, to get a lot of stuff done, and he is going to use that to his advantage as much as possible if and when he jumps into this race.",
