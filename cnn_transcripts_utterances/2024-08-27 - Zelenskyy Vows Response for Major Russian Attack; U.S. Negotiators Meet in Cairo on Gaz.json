One missile seen here hitting a reservoir and hydroelectric plant near the capital Kyiv. And now nationwide rolling blackouts are in effect. According to Ukraine's Air Force commander, Russia launched at least 127 missiles and 109 drones. The Russian Defense Ministry says among the targets storage sites for weapons sent to Ukraine by Western allies. And now the Ukrainian president is once again calling on Western allies to lift restrictions on those weapons so Ukrainian forces can strike deeper into Russia.

That didn't work.It looks like the Russians are trying the same thing again, but of course they now have additional missile capabilities with North Koreans providing ballistic missiles. The Iranians providing ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. So these attacks are being stepped up and it's a question of how long can the Russians keep this up versus how long can Ukraine's critical infrastructure will stand these attacks.

On paper, success on shooting down around 90 percent of incoming fire seems pretty good.

And also the administration also assesses that Ukraine does not have enough Army Tactical Missile Systems, ATACMS, to strike the high-value targets in Russia and the U.S. has a limited stockpile of ATACMS it can draw on to send Ukraine.I mean, that is the logistics involved here. It seems like a sensible argument, but if the U.S. did lift restrictions, wouldn't that effectively see the rest of NATO and other allies lifting their restrictions as well?

Yes, of course, the Russians can shift some capabilities for (INAUDIBLE), but that reduces their operational flexibility as well. And if you've got them the F-16s operating with their beyond visual range, air to air capabilities, they have some capability as well to blunt these Russian attacks.So overall, I would argue that these constraints being imposed by the U.S. on Ukraine's ability to launch strikes deeper into Russia make little sense in a tactical operational military perspective. And they reduce Ukraine's ability to ultimately defeat Russia, which then makes little sense strategically, so it is really nonsensical for the Biden administration to keep these constraints imposed.",

If you have the return of President Trump to the Oval Office, then suddenly the strategic picture changes for Putin because he has a U.S. president that is more likely to impose some sort of negotiated ceasefire on the Ukrainians, withdraw military aid to the Ukrainians, and that negotiated ceasefire would then benefit Russia.So that would then give Putin the opportunity to actually achieve some sort of victory without necessarily going down the path of mobilization. And then if Putin does mobilize the end path for mobilization, then that could draw opposition from some aspects of the Russian people. So I think from Putin's perspective, it makes eminent sense to play a waiting game to continue to essentially rain destruction down on the Ukrainians and exploit the constraints that the U.S. has imposed on the Ukrainians' ability to fire back. And then maybe think in terms of 2025, a much more amenable political and strategic picture emerges for Russia that Putin can then exploit.",

And frankly little movement in efforts to narrow the gaps between Israel and Hamas. Following talks here in Cairo over the weekend, working level discussions are expected to continue, focus on the finer details of a proposed agreement.However, there are still believed to be significant sticking points. Hamas has once again stressed that any agreement must include guarantees for an eventual transition from an initial six-week pause in fighting during the first phase of the proposed deal to a permanent ceasefire in the second phase. Israeli officials have yet to provide such guarantees with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in June indicating that Israel would seek a continuation of the war following an initial pause. Now according to officials, there also continues to be disagreement on the term surrounding the longer-term presence of Israeli forces within the Gaza Strip. While Israel has proposed to station a reduced number of troops along the Philadelphi Corridor, a buffer zone between Egypt and Southern Gaza, Hamas has reiterated that it wants to see a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. However, one senior U.S. official has told CNN that negotiators believe Hamas may be more flexible on an Israeli troop presence in Gaza during that first phase of the deal. With ongoing debate as to whether parts of the Philadelphi Corridor should be considered densely populated areas and therefore areas where troops should not be present under the terms of the proposed deal. Now, officials say mediators expect that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar will receive a copy of the latest proposal in the coming days, though the timing of any expected response remains unclear. For now, discussions continue to try to hammer out those final details of the proposal and to bring Hamas and Israel to some sort of agreement. But there is no indication that that agreement is in any way imminent. Nada Bashir, CNN, in Cairo. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

And although he didn't rule out further retaliatory attacks, Nasrallah sent a clear message to those in Lebanon who have been on edge for the last month. People he said can take a breath and relax. Who can't relax are the more than 100,000 Lebanese civilians who've had to flee their homes in the south since last October. Hezbollah has repeatedly stressed it will halt its strikes against Israel if there's a ceasefire in Gaza and given that little progress has been made on that front, the shared border lands of Lebanon in Israel seem to be settling back into their grim routine.

So from an influence standpoint, you know, Telegram or anything else, these things do represent a very powerful force for either both information and disinformation. So it is a real thing.
