They will have to play well. They still have to play their best game to beat Philadelphia. Philadelphia will run the football and run, and they will run and they will run. And they will play great defense. And their quarterback Jalen Hurts is excellent. The ball thrower. On the other hand, the last time we saw Kansas City go up against a great defense in a Super Bowl was when they lost to Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and they could do nothing like against that great Super Bowl -- in that Super Bowl. So I'm going to go back with Howie Long and we're going to look at the Tampa Bay game, and then look at the defense, and see what we can learn and how it applies to Kansas City.

We have to stand in there and trust a bunch of people around us or else we just -- we just get slammed and they still get that today but the NFL has done I think a really good job of promoting taking the head out of the equation. You can't hit with the head. Protecting the quarterback. And so the improvement in the helmet is certainly better.
