He's appealing a court ruling that would force Mark Meadows, former National Intelligence Director John Radcliffe, senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller, and others to testify.CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers is joining me now. Hi, Jennifer. So, how do you expect Trump's appeal to play out? I know you've said that the arguments over the executive privilege that Trump's been making trying to prevent, you know, his former aides from testifying have been quite weak.",

And it centers around his legislative role as president of the senate and whether he has a privilege based on that. So, the lawyers need to think about if they want to expand that privilege, in other words, have him testify about less than Judge Boasberg ordered that he testify about, they could appeal and try to get that ruling from the DC Circuit.The problem is it could also go the other way. Judge Boasberg's order was the first time that a federal judge has recognized that a vice president has this privilege and need not testify about legislative activities. So, the circuit could also say, you know what, he doesn't have any protection from that. So, they're probably weighing which way they think it will go. I mean, which of course is some guesswork and also what the political consequences is. Because of course, he's probably running for president.",

In another, they claim TikTok's algorithms deceive consumers and promote adult content, including nudity and profanity.

And I've been doing that. We're the first state in the country to file the lawsuit against Meta. So, let me just say this. Schematically, all three of these lawsuits have one thing in common, and it's not the content, it's not the data, it's the deception. That's the issue. Parents have the primary responsibility to raise their children. But at the same time, companies in the marketplace cannot mislead and deceive parents and Americans in our case, Arkansans about their product, what that product does, and what the company is doing.

And so now they're saying that they're going to keep their resort open until the end of July because there's been so much snow. And this is good news for the drought because the drought here in California, the new numbers are off in the U.S. Drought Monitor. And just 1 percent of the state now is in severe drought.
