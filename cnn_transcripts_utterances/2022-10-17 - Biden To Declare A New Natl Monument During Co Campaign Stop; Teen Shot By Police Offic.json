A one stop will be in Colorado where critical Senate race is underway. And instead of holding a rally, he plans to designate a new national monument. So what do you make of this rather unconventional, a double pronged kind of campaign choice and stop?",

      "sentences": "Fred, this seems more like insurance to me. Senator Bennet has an eight point lead right now over the challenger, O'Dea. Coloradans know him. He's a Democrat who is seen as a moderate, not as someone who's far left, so he's hard to attack on that front. And President Biden is going there to commemorate Camp Hale as a national monument. This was a World War II training ground. So it sort of emphasizes the patriotic nature of President Biden's agenda. It emphasizes that Senator Bennet was one of the people pushing for this, and it helps put the focus on the Colorado race, which has not gotten a lot of national attention.But you also have a situation in this race. Even though Senator Bennet has a comfortable lead, that where O'Dea, the challenger is not a full blown Trumper, he is not an election denier. He is actually a pro- choice. And so we're going to see exactly what formula here works for Republican challenger. If somehow O'Dea upsets in this race, I think you're going to see Republicans looking at that formula, something like the Glenn Youngkin formula in Virginia and figuring out if that's a winning combo going into 2024.",

Well, let's talk about Georgia's race for the U.S. Senate, which has become, I don't know even more interesting or intriguing or something, you know, with reports that Republican candidate Herschel Walker, you know, paid a woman to have an abortion and allegedly also asked her to end the second pregnancy, two years later. He is denying the allegations. But for a candidate who has campaigned on a national abortion ban, this controversy is taking center stage in the race.And this week, Senator Rick Scott plans to come to Georgia from Florida to campaign for Walker. So, you know, at this point, does Walker even need a Donald Trump, I mean, Donald Trump is why he's in the race in the first place, does Trump or do you even see that Trump will be coming to Georgia to rally for a Herschel Walker?",

On the one hand, President Trump is keenly aware that some Republicans quietly or not so quietly, blame him in 2020 for Democrats winning both Senate races, tying the Senate and tipping the Senate balance of power with Vice President Harris's vote to Democrats. That might motivate him at the 11th hour to go in there and campaign for Walker and maybe drive up Republican turnout.On the other hand, former President Trump is, you know, if nothing cagey, if it looks like these scandals are going to bring Herschel Walker down, and it's not clear quite yet, if they're going to bring him down, Warnock has this a little bit of a lead but not a commanding lead in this race. You might see former President Trump back away, not withdraw his support from Walker but also not expose himself to the idea that he may have put his thumb on the scale in a losing cause. At the end of the day, we know that President Trump is about President Trump and President Trump alone. So these two candidates go into a debate this week in Georgia where you are. And we'll just see what Georgia voters, you know, think of what they say. Warnock would probably be wise to let Walker's scandals speak for themselves and not attack him that ferociously on that. Walker, a political neophyte, we'll see how he responds.",

And that's when that police officer shoots five times.Then when the car is driving away, five more times, that teen, as you mentioned, in critical condition. The attorney saying that they're literally waiting and he is fighting for his life, he is saying that they need all the blessings they can get. And they're focused on bringing him back home.

CNN's Nadia Romero is live for us in Fort Myers. So Nadia, this is a very difficult journey for so many. What is being said? NADIA ROMERO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Fred, one of the bright spots was literally turning the lights back on. Just yesterday, the neighbors say they finally got electricity more than 10 days after the storm hit. The biggest issue in this neighborhood, storm surge that came in so quickly and filled their homes. And as you walk, you can see right down the street, everything that people had to pull out of their homes. And it is just hard to imagine until you are able to really see what we would make, haul debris or damage. But these are people's belongings, this is the carpet, this is the walls, this is the furniture, these are their books, their sheets, their bedding, things that make their house a home. They've had to gut their homes. And now they're all lined up along this street. These are things that are waiting to get picked up. And that's part of this process as you try to clean up. You're trying to figure out what do I do first, second, third. I have to remove everything out of my home, because mold is starting to grow and accumulate on everything. And you can see it on this mattress and on some of the furniture, some of the mold that is coming into all of these different areas, this is what makes it so unlivable and unsafe. You can't breathe this in. But there are so many items that people are trying to hold on to because it meant something to them. We spoke with a man who had a vintage Volvo that he had been working on. Well, that was taken through the storm, after that storm surge that has been permanently damaged. And so many people in this neighborhood were not able to get insurance. One man told me, he had insurance. And then that insurance company dropped the state of Florida all together. So now they're trying to figure out if they can get help from FEMA or other areas of assistance. But the cleanup process, this is going to take quite some time, Fred. We're in Fort Myers, Fort Myers Beach not far from here. Finally, people are being able to come back. Take a look at the damage there. But there is still a curfew for so many areas because of concerns of looting. Fred?",
