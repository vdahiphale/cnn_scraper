Andrzej Duda, I would like to say to you that I'm so pleased and so impressed by the outstanding leadership, you show and your visit to Kyiv sent a clear message or steadfast support to Ukraine, and America's iron tide, ironclad commitment to the security of Europe. Let me also thank you for hosting the next NATO summit after winners in the United States. One year since the launch of Russia's invasion, President Putin is not preparing for peace. On the contrary, he is preparing for more war. So we must sustain and step up our support for Ukraine. We must give Ukraine what they need to prevail. We don't know when the war will end. But when it does, we need to ensure that history does not repeat itself. We have seen the - pattern of aggression over many years. Georgia in 2008, Crimea and Donbas in 2014, and then the full fledge invasion of Ukraine last year. We cannot allow Russia to continue to chip away at European security. We must break the cycle of Russian aggression. NATO allies have never been more united. We will protect every inch of allied territory based on Article Five commitment to defend each other one for all and all for one. Thank you so much.",

He's of course spent the last several days with allies and a show of support for Ukraine and reiterated. I think that message there you heard for the NATO Secretary General impressed by the leadership that President Biden showed in actually being in Ukraine. In the past week, he reiterated the message that he's already given a number of times over recent weeks, which is that Putin isn't preparing for peace. He's preparing for more war and that's why Ukraine must be supported. It was a message echoed by President Biden too that the support is absolute from both NATO and the United States. And this is about shared values to the freedom of democracy in Ukraine and around the world too. And you heard from the President of Romania and of the Slovak Republic there too echoing that this is about security, avoiding gray zones, in particular in defense. And looking ahead towards that meeting in NATO later this year in July, Clare Sebastian joins us now who is also I know listening into that meeting. And its, part of a broader discussion between these key nine nations that are watching what's taking place within their region they know the history of how Russia has behaved in the past. And I think the message here today from them to the United States is more the same, more supports required because there's palpable fear of what could come if that's not support is not forthcoming and continuing?",

What is interesting, if you look at these countries is despite their proximity to Russia. They have been very much at the forefront in this conflict of providing support to Ukraine. And Estonia, for example, has committed more than 1 percent, or the equivalent of more than 1 percent of its GDP, in terms of military aid in comparative terms far outpacing what the U.S., for example, has committed. They have also been at the forefront of the economic pain that this war has wrought. On Europe, inflation rates in the Baltics, for example, have in some cases and continue to in some cases exceed 20 percent. Despite that, they have shown their resolve, perhaps given their proximity to try to keep going in their support to deter, as they said in these comments just now future aggression from Russia. And that is critical, because I think you saw before this conflict, Russia issued a number of demands to NATO, asking them to prevent any future eastward expansion to prevent Ukraine from ever joining NATO. What we see here is repudiation again of those demands an sign that Russia's goals in this conflict are not coming to pass, Julia.",

So we're certainly pushing for higher defense budgets in particular as far as NATO is concerned as well. But the other thing as well is that many of these nations have also provided support to displaced Ukrainians, too. So it's actually not just about support and aid for Ukraine itself.

And on that military aid, Julia, we are as well at a point where we're seeing the level of military equipment, ammunition and all of that this conflict is burning through really up the ante when it comes to these countries and what they can provide. This is in the words of the NATO Secretary General and now a battle of logistics. It's not just about political will to provide it; they have to increase production to be able to provide it.

I mean, at least 10 killed, we know of something like hundred injured by the Palestinian Ministry of Health says live ammunition. So we have to keep in mind that the death count may go up. This may end up being one of if not the deadliest days in the West Bank, definitely potentially this year, if not yet even further years. And what's even already been a very deadly and violent year so far. We know of, as I said, at least 10 injured and when you look at sort of the breakdown, people are asking, you know are the civilians caught up in this as well.

We're still getting briefed by the Israeli military. But it's been a very violent year already so far here. It's only February, the Palestinian Ministry of Health saying something like 61 Palestinians have been killed. Meanwhile, 11 Israelis have been killed the cycle of violence just seemingly continuing. Now, what's also important to note about today is that the Islamic Jihad said that two of their commanders were killed and the Islamic Jihad in Gaza, you have to keep in mind that they do have a foothold in Gaza, and that we may very well get a response from Gaza tonight, perhaps in the form of rockets. And keep in mind; it was just in August that there was that brief sort of two, three day de-escalation, rockets fired and the Israeli military responding with airstrikes. And so there's a very good chance that there may be that sort of escalation, potentially in the next couple of hours where Islamic Jihad militants may fire rockets we're hearing from the armed factions in Gaza. They said essentially, that their patience is running out. So we may see that sort of escalation coming. As we've been noting for so many days now, there have been so many violent incidences between Israelis and Palestinians, the ground here has been very right for some time for some sort of escalation. And then just take a look at the calendar and look what's coming. Ramadan and Passover are once again, overlapping, that will likely bring that tension and potentially even more escalation here to Jerusalem to the holy sites, Julia.",

OK, in themeantime, let me give you a quick look at what we're seeing across the U.S. stock markets. Wall Street is currently higher the NASDAQ outperforming there stocks trying to bounce after Tuesday's painful 2 percent slump across the board. Investors nervous I think as U.S. bond yields rise due to fears of more aggressive central bank action and of course, yesterday a disappointing outlook from retailers Walmart and Home Depot weighing on broader sentiment too. Now we discussed this yesterday on the show and to the Supreme Court showdown, which could upend the world of social media as we know it. In two separate cases the families of two terror attack victims claimed that social media companies have helped terror groups in violation of U.S. law and should be held responsible. Yesterday on the program, we heard from the family of Nomi Gonzalez, who was killed in an ISIS attack on Paris in 2015. The justices will hear arguments in the second day of their case against Google. And a decision could impact big tech companies that are currently using laws like Section 230 to shield themselves from user lawsuits. Our Justice Correspondent Jessica Schneider joins us now. Jessica, it's complicated. And there are two cases. There's the Google case and there's the Twitter case, I think you and I accurately predicted yesterday that the U.S. Supreme Court was going to be challenged with this. And I think they sort of honestly admitted that they were pretty clueless yesterday not interpreting the law, but just understanding I think the implications of any change?",

And they say that this family says that YouTube not only allowed ISIS videos to be posted on their site, but also that YouTube recommended those videos to certain viewers. And the family says it's because of that specific action of recommending videos. They say that should wipe away any protections that social media currently has. The court though, they seemed very hesitant to step in here and make changes to the way the internet works. They said they're really not the experts. And maybe Congress should really be the ones making any changes. Here's Justice Elena Kagan saying just that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ELENA KAGAN, U.S. SUPREME COURT: Every other industry has to internalize the costs of his conduct. Why is it that the tech industry gets a pass? A little bit unclear. On the other hand, I mean, we're a court. We really don't know about these things. You know, these are not like the nine greatest experts on the internet. Isn't that something for Congress to do? Not the court. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And the justices also warned that if they wiped away protections for social media companies like under Section 230 it would create possibly this wave of lawsuits and would really create chaos online. So today, there's another related case, it takes a broader look at the responsibility of big tech. This is a case that is also being brought by families of terror victims. They're saying more broadly, that social media companies assisted ISIS by allowing terrorist groups members to post their videos and other content online. And they're saying, Julia, that that particularly violates the federal Anti-Terrorism Act right here in the U.S. So it's really taking a more broad argument, whereas yesterday was asking to kind of chip away at the protections of Section 230. This is saying more bluntly, that overall, tech companies should be responsible for any content posted that promotes terrorism, Julia.",

This is an industry that has a much extended global supply chain. And of course then you had material price volatility. STEWART (voice over): For companies like EDF, the French energy giant that runs this wind farm in the East of England, there's a risk of progress getting stuck at a crucial time. MATTHIEU HUE, CEO EDF RENEWABLE UK &amp; IRELAND: I think we're at genuine risk of saying the allotment or deployment of renewable slowing down, which is exactly the contrary of what we need. We did an acceleration was the need for investment is absolutely massive. What we have seen over the last 10 years is a technology evolving, but as you said, we had some disruption and we need to make sure that people understand that the government global these challenges are understood because unless they can be overcome, the investment will go elsewhere. STEWART (voice over): Europe is being squeezed from all sides. From the East, cheaper turbines from China are entering the market. While to the West, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act is tempting companies with big subsidies for those who build green tech in the United States. Now the European Union has been spurred into action. In February it announced a Green Deal Industrial Plan, offering billions of dollars in funding the net zero tech.

I think most Europeans right now have seen that the independence of energy supply is not insignificant important if we all have to rely of a - take of Russia on gas into Europe. I don't think any of us wants to do that. This is the beginning of one of the largest transformations the world has done. So I see the growth coming and if you get it right this time, then of course there is much more growth to come in Europe. STEWART (voice over): That's does expect the challenges to continue in 2023.

And then we can produce energy with those small turbines that we have on board. Our systems are so much smaller are flying higher and you only actually see them when they produce energy, right? If we're not producing energy, we just land the system and then it's basically invisible.
