President Zelenskyy has just penned a new Op-Ed, in \"The Wall Street Journal,\" thanking the United States, for providing both, support to his country, and setting an example of liberty. We are now 16 months, into the Russian invasion. And tonight, there is an ominous new estimate. 180,000 Russian forces, making a push, on two Eastern fronts, in Ukraine. That's according to Ukrainian military spokesman. And for context, that's more than twice the size of the British army. President Zelenskyy has been openly addressing the difficulties that they have been facing, on the front lines, but he does still maintain, progress is being made. He's also making news, in a new exclusive interview, with Erin Burnett, who sat down with him, in Odessa, as he told her that he does believe President Putin's power is diminishing.

So, when President Zelenskyy tells our Erin Burnett that Putin is weak, perhaps politically, in Russia, but on the front lines, that weakness is not being felt. Now, behind the front lines, today, the Russians fired Iranian-made Shahed drones on the northeastern city, of Sumy. There, they killed at least two people, injured 19, including a 5-year-old child.

It seems, this is an attempt, to, first, keep retaking territory, as we see the counteroffensive, making slow progress, but also then to enter negotiations, from a position of power, to be on the stronger side, to have more leverage there, by the end of the year. And it's apparent that that's what Ukraine is looking for, or at least, that's the message they telegraphed, to Bill Burns, while he was in Ukraine. Of course, that comes with all the challenges we just spoke about.

But the Administration moved forward, with that prisoner exchange, last year, believing it was, at that point, the right thing to do. And now, this is what the concern was that Bout was never going to go quietly, into the night. Instead, he's at least more directly entering politics now. And I want to get the name of the region and the party, right. He'll be running for the Deputy seat, at the Legislative Assembly, of the Ulyanovsk region of Russia. So, I looked it up in a map. It's a bit east of Moscow. But he has certainly entered party, in this Kremlin-loyal, ultra nationalist party, where we've kind of seen him before, sort of stumping.

But Democrats and anti-Trumpers say that a third party could just end up playing spoiler, in all of this, by siphoning votes, from President Biden, in swing states, and therefore, handing the election, to Donald Trump. Joining us now, is a longtime associate, of No Labels, the former Michigan Republican congressman, Fred Upton. I know you told me not to call you, \"Congressman.\" So, let's talk about this group, and No Labels, as \"The Wall Street Journal\" is writing, in its latest report, says \"It is called No Labels, but many political strategists have their own label for it: spoiler.\" Is No Labels going to end up being a spoiler? FRED UPTON, (R) FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE: No, I don't think so. And No Labels has been around since about 2008 or 2009. It was very involved with the Problem Solvers Caucus, which is a House caucus, which I was a Vice Chair of. It's equal number of Republicans and Democrats. You've had Josh Gottheimer and Brian Fitzpatrick on, a good number of times. But literally 55, 60 members, so, this is a little larger group, bipartisan, bicameral. And they've been, until now, very focused, on the issues. Actually, they still are, whether it was the debt ceiling, immigration, keeping the government open, a whole bunch of very -- CHIPS bill, Infrastructure. But now, the polling that we've done shows that literally 26,000 people, around the country, it draws equally -- unlike Perot, and the basic tenet back then, in 1992, 30 years ago, was that Perot basically took from Bush, and allowed Bill Clinton, to win the election. The polling now shows that we draw pretty much equally, between both sides, the Republicans, as well as the Democrats. And our focus, right now, is to like Perot was successful, getting on the ballot, in all 50 states. It's not going to be a down-ticket deal.

Police say one person is in custody, and a weapon has been recovered.But, right now, we don't yet know if there are any confirmed fatalities. We are monitoring this incident very closely. We'll bring you those developments, as we're learning them, tonight. But unfortunately, this also comes as we are following another shooting, as Baltimore Police are still searching, for at least two suspects, in a deadly mass shooting, there, Sunday, after a community celebration. Reward has now been amped up to $28,000 for tips that could help lead to an arrest, of those two suspects. We know that 20-year-old Kylis Fagbemi (ph), and 18-year-old Aaliyah Gonzales (ph) were killed. 28 More people, most of them just teenagers, were also injured, in this shooting, on Sunday. One of them, just 13-years-old. CNN's Danny Freeman is live, in Baltimore. Danny, what are we learning more about this manhunt that is very much still underway? What a possible motive could be?",

And, at this point, they're still looking at an all-out manhunt. 28 people injured, two people killed. And the Mayor promised today unequivocally that they will not stop looking for these people, until they have them behind bars. But Kaitlan, just want to recap, and step back, for a moment, and remind viewers exactly how this all started. It really happened, and started, I should say, on Saturday afternoon. And Saturday evening, there was a block party, in Baltimore's Brooklyn neighborhood. It was called Brooklyn Day. It's an annual event that's been happening for 20-plus years. Normally, a very festive event, attracted hundreds of people. But then, police say, at around 12:30, early Sunday morning, so just after midnight, on Saturday night, gunshots broke out, and that's when chaos erupted. We've been seeing and showing surveillance video, all throughout the day. 28 people injured. And of course, those two people that you mentioned, Miss Gonzales (ph) and Mr. Fagbemi (ph), they were both killed. Now, at this point, Kaitlan, like you said, there have been no arrests. But we heard from police and city officials, earlier today. And, like I said earlier, they are putting all of their resources, right now, to finding at least two, if not more potential shooters, in this case.",
