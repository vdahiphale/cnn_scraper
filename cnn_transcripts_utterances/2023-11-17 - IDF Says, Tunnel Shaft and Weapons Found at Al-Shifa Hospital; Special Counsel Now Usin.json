Whether there was or wasn't intelligence or indications that the hostages were held at the hospital is almost a different question.Israel has asserted for so long that Hamas used the Al-Shifa complex as cover for a command and control headquarters, a facility, a complex underneath the hospital, that that was clearly a major target of the operation. The first bit of evidence they've put forward a couple days ago was simple weaponry, ammunition vests, in no way showed Hamas used it and had infrastructure below it. Now, they're showing evidence of a tunnel shaft that they say was an operational tunnel used by Hamas. We have geolocated to within the Al- Shifa complex. The key question, though, what is inside that shaft? They say they found, as you pointed out, weapons and ammunition in the area. But the key now is what is in there and can we get a look inside independently verify that and see what sort of complex is below the hospital. Meanwhile, the conditions in the hospital growing increasingly dire. The director of the hospital told Al Jazeera that doctors there are having to make what they called harrowing decisions and some patients who come in with injuries face amputation because they can't be prevent them from infection.

So, it's an active, ongoing investigation out in Los Angeles apparently around Hunter Biden's business dealings. Now, one of the things that's really notable here, Phil and Poppy, that we hadn't seen before is we do know of this subpoena to James Biden, the president's brother, Hunter Biden's uncle. The connection those two men have, Hunter Biden and James Biden, is that they have some business connections. It's possible that James Biden had some insight into the income that Hunter Biden was bringing in at a time where he wasn't really paying his taxes. So, putting this together, we don't know exactly what the special counsel, David Weiss, is looking at, whether he would bring charges and what those charges might be. But the meaning of this is that he certainly is moving forward on what he indicated he would do before, which was when the plea fell apart for Hunter Biden, he said, we're going to keep looking at tax issues and others, perhaps somewhere else, outside of Delaware.",

Trump is not doing so well with professional voters, Nikki Haley. Communities of color, Nikki Haley. She's really sort of positioned herself and the timing couldn't have been better in this last 90 days really before the whole thing gets underway to really try and see if she can be an alternative.That's the lock that everybody has been trying to pick. How do you go at Donald Trump? You can't do it by out-insulting him. That's not going to work. You can't do it by imitating him, which is what Ramaswamy has tried to do. What you could possibly do, though, is pick up the elements of the voting base that don't and never really did like Donald Trump all that much, and then see if you can grab some other people from his base. I don't know if I like her chances, but it's a rational, logical thing that seems to be paying off.",

Remember, they're still treating patients there, by the way. He says there's no access to milk for babies. Insight into the dire situation unfolding there, that's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [07:25:00] HARLOW:  So, you're looking right there at new video. This is filmed by the IDF given to CNN. Israel says it shows a tunnel shaft inside the Al-Shifa Hospital complex. The IDF says this video is evidence that Hamas was using the hospital as a command center. The Hamas-run government in Gaza calls that claim by Israel a baseless lie. CNN has geolocated the video. We just can't independently verify the IDF or Hamas claims, nor have we been able to get in touch with people inside the hospital right now. But in the wake of the IDF going into that hospital, that raid, the question of Hamas' possible operations at Al-Shifa, that is crucial, right? Hospitals are protected from attack under international humanitarian law, but that protection only goes so far. It can be temporarily revoked if the hospital is being used by combatants to commit acts of war. And right now, communication services are down in Gaza. CNN has been unable to reach its contacts on the ground. The U.N. says this is due to a lack of fuel to run the generators. David Harden is with us. He served as a USAID director for Gaza and the West Bank in Israel from 2005 until 2016. So, you have had eyes and ears, and you were on the ground, and you know Al-Shifa Hospital, Dave, really well. Does this track -- I know you can't say what's happening now, but does this track with your experience there?",

And either they're able to present the evidence to independent observers, like CNN, like Nic Robertson, who will be able to get down there and kind of check it out, and there will be sufficient evidence that it was a fundamental command and control center for Hamas, or it isn't.But at the end of the day, this will kind of shape the Israelis' credibility now and going forward.

And you wrote about this saying as far back as 2014 in that conflict, Israelis and Palestinians were telling you that they suspected Hamas have major operations there in the hospital. Can you help people understand how they could actually do that in one of the biggest, and, by the way, one of the most technologically advanced hospitals within Gaza? How, if this is the case, was Hamas able to do that? Was it just accepted because it had to be by powerless people to fight it in Gaza?",

We don't know.But it was long suspected that Hamas was operating in Al-Shifa. And, by the way, I know for a fact that they used ambulances at times as well to kind of escape attacks.

This is precisely where you need an independent international investigation, because we have different narratives.
