Former Vice President Mike Pence and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez will be in Iowa. Senator Tim Scott, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, they're going to be crisscrossing New Hampshire.So, let's bring in New York - former New York Congressman Max Rose, and \"Semafor\" politics reporter Shelby Talcott. Shelby, since I always go to you for telling me what's actually happening on the ground and what voters are saying, what was striking yesterday was the statement from -- the comments from the DeSantis super PAC, acknowledging to Steve Cortes' credit, reality to some degree. But I want you to listen to him. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) STEVE CORTES, SPOKESMAN FOR PRO-DESANTIS \"NEVER BACK DOWN\" SUPER PAC: Look, right now, in national polling, we are way behind. I'll be the first to admit that. OK. I believe I'm being really blunt and really honest. It's an uphill battle. I don't think it's an unwinnable battle by any stretch, OK, but clearly Donald Trump is the runaway front- runner. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
