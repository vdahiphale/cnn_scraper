The latest CNN poll of polls released shows that Donald Trump maintains a huge lead. 58 percent support among likely Republican primary voters in this polling average.The candidate closest to Trump isn't really close at all right now, as you can see. Ron DeSantis is his dick -- is a distant second with 15 percent support. And all the rest, still in single digits. Joining me now from Simi Valley, California, where tonight's debate will take place, CNN Political Director David Chalian. So glad you're there, David. So, the polls reinforced the reality that we have been seeing in this primary, which is Donald Trump has a big lead. What does that mean, though, for a second Trump-less stage?",

Yes, they are far back but they are in a battle for second place to try and consolidate support and emerge here as a Trump alternative, even if a -- one that is far behind Trump at this moment in the polls.And that's what this opportunity presents. An opportunity for millions of Republican voters to tune in and hear from these candidates directly. As you know, Kate, Donald Trump dominates not just the polls but the national narrative -- the headlines.

If you're a candidate not named Trump -- not named Trump, you have a theory of the case, which is that if you can draw blood in some fashion in the early States of Iowa or New Hampshire, you can change the dynamic of the race.Now, I don't know if that's true. We'll see if that's true. But I do know, there aren't really other theories of the case available to candidates running 30 or 40 points back. So, if you look at the CBS poll that came out yesterday from early States, Iowa, and New Hampshire, you can see why these other candidates believe there is a path. Which is that you see, yes, there's a quarter of the Republican electorate in those two early states that are locked into Trump, only Trump, that's all they'll consider. But then there's like a third that says they don't want to consider Trump. And actually, Kate, the plurality, if you see in the 40s in both Iowa and New Hampshire in this CBS poll, you see are -- yes, they'll consider Trump, but they are also considering other options. So, if you take the Trump and others category, and the non-Trump category, that's a significant swath of Republican voters that are at least available or potentially open to these other candidates.",

And that could be that sort of broader approach, whether it is on issues of abortion or other issues where she tries to present something that doesn't lock her in to a position that would be hard to get away from if she is the Republican nominee. Could be part of that.Also, she's the only woman on the stage. That's an immediate differentiator. She's obviously got skills and is a good communicator.

Now, he has to surrender his personal passport and travel documents but he can keep his official passport. And he is allowed to travel for anything related to his official duties as a U.S. senator. Now, his wife is being released on a $250,000 personal recognizance bond that is being secured by her personal residence in New Jersey. Now, she has far more strict limitations on her ability to travel. She can travel to certain parts of New Jersey, New York, Washington, DC, and Florida but if she wants to do any other traveling, she may be able to get permission to do that. But she has to ask the government. Now, as you noted both the senator and his wife through their attorneys entered pleas of not guilty during today's arraignment. We expect they will come out.

He points to the fact that he previously faced a corruption case from the Justice Department. He was not convicted. And he insists that prosecutors have gotten out over their skis here.But if you look at the allegations laid out in this indictment, the evidence that has already been made public, it is damning. Particularly those accusations about sharing sensitive information with a foreign government, perhaps against U.S. interests. For someone who is a sitting U.S. senator, chairing the Foreign Relations Committee, that is a grave accusation. So, I think going forward, going to be a lot more questions about particularly that aspect of the case. Now, he may learn more about the evidence that the government has during that process of discovery. But I think his constituents and certainly his colleagues are curious to learn more about that. Was he targeted by foreign intelligence? So, was he especially vulnerable, they thought? Is there some sort of counterintelligence investigation here?

Those details are just coming out.But it'll be really interesting to see if the senator wants to address cameras or if he's going to not answer questions. I think most good lawyers with a client in this particular situation would certainly prefer that they not take questions after a federal arraignment. Now, they did not talk to the press. But the senator has been talking quite a bit over the past few days. So, there's a lot of reporters assembled here. One or two protesters. Pretty tame so far.
