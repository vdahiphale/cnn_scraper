And we know the Chinese are incredibly opaque and their numbers make no sense.When you look at the numbers coming out of certain regions in China, it suggests that the growth of the pandemic in China is now explosive. In the eastern city Chengdu, which is where maybe a half a million people a day are becoming infected. That's a city of about 10 million people. So from outside sources and from looking at sort of regional reports, we do have the sense that the virus is just widespread throughout China. The Chinese all along have been very opaque about the variants and the degree of disease. The Chinese are not reporting deaths. We think, unfortunately, the mortality toll in China before this surge is done may reach 500,000 to a million people.",

Which is why I think what the world should be doing is urging China to put in place a measure to more fully vaccinate their population with more effective vaccines than they've used. They've used sort of homegrown, old technology attenuated live virus vaccines. They have shunned the predominant mRNA-based vaccines that have been used in other parts of the Western world. And the net result of that is going to be a massive loss of life in China.",

Dallas Mavericks star, Luka Doncic, making NBA history with the league's first ever 60, 20, 10 triple double.The 23-year-old guard racked up 60 points, 21 rebounds and 21 assists, and his team needed every single one of those numbers to pull off a thrilling overtime win over the New York Knicks last night. The final score, 126-121. Pretty incredible. Now, for some less upbeat news. The U.S. housing market is not putting up numbers like Luka unfortunately. According to a new report out this morning, pending home sales dropped by a monster 4 percent last month, marking six straight months of declines. And compared to a year ago, sales are down 38 percent. CNN economics and political commentator, Catherine Rampell, is joining us now. Catherine, this drop was worse than the estimates of 1 percent to 2 percent. What does that tell us about where this economy stands right now? CATHERINE RAMPELL, CNN ECONOMICS &amp; POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The numbers were certainly -- the drop off, rather, was much larger than expected. But the direction is what people had forecast. As interest rates goes up, it gets much more expensive to borrow to buy a house. And therefore, you see the market cooling off. So this was a feature, not a buzz. And it's part oof the reason why you see home sales prices falling not quickly enough, in fact, to get to the volume of sales that we have seen it's in past, but they are coming down. It's just gotten a lot more expensive to buy a home.",

The pandemic pushing people to decide they need more space. They suddenly want to own their own home, and, ideally, a bigger home. You had a lot of reasons why demand that went up that make total sense, that are not artificially inflated by the cleansing of the need to speculate on the housing market. And on top of that, you also had, of course, very, very low interest rate, which is made it easier to buy a home. Now, you still have a lot of people who want to buy houses. You still have the same structural factors, like Millennials wanting to buy homes, having kids, needing more space. But it's gotten more expensive to borrow. Again, interest rates have gone up. This was by design, by the Federal Reserve. They're trying to cool consumer demand. And the housing market happens to be the most interest rate sensitive part of the U.S. economy.",
