Prigozhin was on a plane that fell from the sky yesterday with 10 people on board.CNN's Nick Paton Walsh is in Ukraine. So what did Putin say, Nick?",

      "sentences": "Yes, I mean, extraordinary. After nearly 24 hours silence, we are now hearing from Vladimir Putin, not necessarily directly declaring Yevgeny Prigozhin dead, but talking about his desire to express his severe condolences to the families of all the victims of that particular air crash.And then he mumbles mid this sentence, it seems, and he says, indeed, if they were there, it seems -- here he mumbles -- preliminary information suggests that Wagner Group employees were also on board. Now, that's important because it is essentially him confirming and amplifying the initial information we got from Russian officials about the death of key Wagner employees on this aircraft. He goes on, importantly, to talk about Prigozhin himself and refers to him, it seems, in the past tense as part of this same conversation. I knew Prigozhin for a very long time, since the 90s, he was a man of a difficult fate and he made serious mistakes in life. But he also praises the contribution, he says, that both Prigozhin and Wagner made. And so while this is, I think, far, it's fair to say from any confirmation from Putin that indeed Prigozhin is dead, he's definitely adding his voice to the narrative. He's taken a very typical Putin pause between the events and him speaking, in which he's been noticeably absent from the commentary around this. But I think if you were observing this, you might see it as Putin trying to project himself as in control of events. I should point out again, we don't definitively know Prigozhin is dead. It seems pretty likely at this stage, and there is no evidence that Putin was involved in that. But so much commentary, including that of President Joe Biden, points in that direction because of what Prigozhin did with his Wagner mercenaries about two months ago. But startling, frankly, to hear Putin talk about him when in what seems to be the past tense. Dana?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think that Vladimir Putin taking a pause and taking a little while to comment is certainly something that we might have seen before. I mean, one of the things that I thought was really interesting, as we were covering this event yesterday after the plane crash took place, is that no one in official Russia has -- had actually commented on it.There was supposed to be a Kremlin phone call with the spokesman for the Kremlin that didn't happen. Other Kremlin officials that I tried to get in touch with also not commenting on it either. And of course, some of the visuals that we saw yesterday of Vladimir Putin where he was at an event commemorating soldiers killed in World War II, and there was a moment of silence for them. But at that point in time, he still had not commented on this plane crash and the possible death of Yevgeny Prigozhin. It certainly seems as though he did take quite a long time to now put these words out there. And if you read some of the statement that Nick just obviously did, it certainly does not feel extremely heartfelt. He said he knew Prigozhin since the 1990s. He said he was a man of difficult fate. He was a businessman who did well for himself in business, and then they had a common cause, which obviously he means the war in Ukraine and putting the Wagner mercenaries there on the front line. So, really, Vladimir Putin speaking in a very matter of fact way about Yevgeny Prigozhin. He did offer his condolences to everybody, obviously, who was on that flight. And I think a lot of that also, quite frankly, reflects the mood in Russia as well, where many people, when they heard the news about the possible demise of Yevgeny Prigozhin, of course, also some of the senior leadership of Wagner as well, they did kind of feel like it wasn't surprising. It was certainly something that was shocking, but not necessarily something that was surprising. And, of course, Yevgeny Prigozhin is someone who was quite well respected, actually, by a lot of Russians. If we look around the country today, there are a lot of memorials that are coming up. Certainly flowers being laid down in front of the Wagner headquarters in St. Petersburg, also at some Wagner bases. But there are very few questions that are being asked publicly as to what exactly happened, how it happened. And I think we saw that in Vladimir Putin's statement as well, where he was saying, look, there's an investigative committee that is working right now, will await the results, and then we'll know more. It certainly doesn't seem as though he is pressing to find results very quickly. Dana?",
