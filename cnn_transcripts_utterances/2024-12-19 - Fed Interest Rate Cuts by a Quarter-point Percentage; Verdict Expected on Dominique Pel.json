The president- elect followed the lead of tech billionaire Elon Musk, telling his Republican allies in Congress to reject a bipartisan government funding bill. Now this comes just days before Christmas, as Trump and his team make new demands to keep the government from shutting down. Meanwhile, the Dow fell more than 1,100 points, extending its losing streak to 10 days. That is the longest since 1974. The U.S. Federal Reserve announced a quarter-point interest rate cut, as expected. But Chairman Jerome Powell warned that Trump's tariffs and other factors could keep inflation high through next year, meaning fewer rate cuts in the future. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JEROME POWELL, U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN: You ask about 2025. I think that the slower pace of cuts for next year really reflects both the higher inflation readings we've had this year and the expectation that inflation will be higher. You saw in the SEP that risks and uncertainty around inflation we see as higher. Nonetheless, we see ourselves as still on track. The point about uncertainty is it's kind of common sense thinking that when the path is uncertain, you go a little bit slower. It's not unlike driving on a foggy night or walking into a dark room full of furniture. You just slow down. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Our thanks to Marc Stewart joining us live from Beijing.Well the woman at the center of one of the darkest criminal cases in modern French history is expected in court any moment now. Prosecutors say Gisele Pelicot was raped by more than 50 men at her home over nearly a decade, and that the abuse was organized by her husband, who is accused of drugging her and inviting complete strangers to assault her. We're now awaiting the verdicts against Dominique Pelicot and other suspects in the case. So let's turn to CNN's Melissa Bell, who is standing by inside, or just outside the courthouse, we should say, in the French city of Avignon. So Melissa, what are the expectations as we await these verdicts? MELISSA BELL, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, as you can see, perhaps behind me, Rosemary, a huge amount of interest. There has been throughout this more than three-and-a-half-long month trial, not just the many journalists who turn up day in, day out to follow the proceedings, but also many people who just come to stand outside and show their support for Gisele Pelicot, and again here today. We've also heard chants of rapists, we see you, against some of the accused. This is a trial, Rosemary, that has really captured the imagination of people, not just here in France, but elsewhere, partly because of its nature. We're talking about 51 men, one of them still on the run, but the 50 others expected here this morning to receive their sentences. The sentences that have been requested by the prosecution range from four years to 20 years. The longest sentence, the 20 years for a couple of men, including Dominique Pelicot, who's accused of having, over nearly a decade, invited dozens of men to rape his wife after having given her prescription pills to sedate her. The nature of the trial, not just the scale of what happened, the horror of what was visited upon Gisele Pelicot, but of course her extraordinary decision, Rosemary, to waive her anonymity, thus waiving the anonymity of the 51 men on trial here in Avignon today. There are also a further 21 men, by the way, who were seen on some of those horrific videos by police, but that they have failed to identify. Of the 51 identified, 50 of them in the court behind me will be finding out how long they'll be spending in jail. The point is, though, that by waiving her anonymity, what she did is she waived theirs. And her idea, her plan, her strategy behind that, her reasoning was that it was time, as she put it, that shame changed camps. And also, so in a way, almost whatever the verdicts today, whatever the sentence in these particular men received, the fact that it has been as public as it has really has turned it into something of a societal reckoning, taken it far beyond this simple courthouse and the precise nature of what happened to Gisele Pelicot. And I think one of the most remarkable things about it is how humble she's remained, saying, look, I'm just normal. I'm doing this for other women so that they can look at if they've been victims of sexual abuse, have the courage to speak up and say, if Madame Pelicot could do it, in her words, so can I.",

Houthi officials say at least nine people were killed and three others injured in those strikes. The strikes come just hours after the Iran- backed militant group launched its latest attack on Israel. (VIDEO PLAYING) The IDF says a missile launched from Yemen was intercepted early Thursday morning in central Israel. The Houthis say they targeted two sensitive Israeli military targets in Tel Aviv with missiles and the strikes achieved their goals. The group also says Israeli strikes in Sana'a will not deter them from responding and continuing to support Palestinians in Gaza. Tensions between Israel and the Houthis have escalated since the war in Gaza started last year. Lawmakers now have less than two days to come up with a new plan to keep the U.S. government funded into March. They also have to address Trump's new demand to raise the national debt ceiling before he takes office. Trump's critics argue he's been too heavily influenced by Elon Musk on this spending bill. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DANIEL GOLDMAN (D-NY): Donald Trump has been asleep at the wheel. This is being negotiated intensively for weeks now. I find it hard to believe that Trump was not clued into what was going on, but probably more likely just paid no interest until his benefactor, the one who spent nearly $300 million to get him elected, the one multibillionaire richest man on earth who has numerous federal contracts, chimed in to oppose this bill. And all of a sudden, Donald Trump scrambled to try to kill it because his puppet master said so. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He's expected to take questions from Russian citizens about domestic issues like housing and the economy. But it's unclear whether he will talk about the assassination of a top general in the streets of Moscow earlier this week.Russian officials have detained a man who allegedly confessed to planting the explosive device that killed Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov and his aide on Tuesday. CNN's Matthew Chance brings us the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): On Russian TV, news that Moscow police have already detained a suspected bomber. This 29-year-old Uzbek citizen arrested in a village outside the capital has now confessed, according to prosecutors, to planting the explosive device that killed Igor Kirillov, one of Russia's top generals and his assistant. [03:20:06] UNKNOWN (through translator): During interrogation, he explained that he was recruited by Ukrainian special services, then arrived in Moscow and received an improvised explosive device. He placed it on an electric scooter, which he parked at the entrance of the apartment building where Igor Kirillov lived. CHANCE (voice-over): Video released by the Russian security services purports to show the suspect setting up a surveillance camera in a car outside. The camera is said to have live streamed the attack to Ukrainian intelligence, which has indeed claimed responsibility for the killing. The suspect's then shown on video, possibly under duress, saying he was promised $100,000 and a European passport for, in his words, pressing the button. But the bombing on the streets of Moscow is only the latest in a series of assassinations of prominent figures supporting Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine, starting with Daria Dugina, an outspoken advocate of the conflict and daughter of a pro-Kremlin nationalist killed in a car bombing in August 2022. Ukraine denied involvement, but the shooting just last week of Mikhail Shatsky, a Russian missile developer outside Moscow, was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence, according to a CNN source in Kyiv, as was the car bombing in November of Valery Trankovsky, a senior Russian naval officer in Crimea. There have been numerous other killings, too, as Ukraine steps up assassinations far from the front lines, cementing a reputation for vengeance. Matthew Chance, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The two men met in December 2016 at Trump Tower. By the time Trump ran for president again in 2020 he'd rebooted the jabs aimed at Bezos. When news of Bezos' impending divorce was published in the \"National Enquirer\" in 2019 Trump saw an opportunity and crowned Bezos with a new nickname referring to him in a tweet as Jeff Bozo. More recently their icy relationship seemed to thaw. After the first assassination attempt on Trump's life in July in Pennsylvania Bezos wrote on X, \"Our former president showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire tonight. So thankful for his safety and so sad for the victims and their families.\" And just last month Bezos congratulated Trump on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory in the 2024 election.
