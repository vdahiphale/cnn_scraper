Ukraine's president says major cities,including the capital, Kyiv, were targeted by a total of 36 Iranian made drones. None of these drones reached their target, likely infrastructure and military sites in the west of Ukraine. This comes as Ukraine's defense ministry confirms that Wagner fighters have begun withdrawing from around Bakhmut but says some fighters remain inside the embattled city. Earlier the head of the mercenary group said its forces will withdraw by next Thursday and congratulated them on their efforts there. Let's get more on what this means. We've got Fred Pleitgen, who is in Kyiv. Fred, lots coming through today. I want to start off by talking about the initial withdrawal of the Wagner Group from Bakhmut, what this means for the fate of the city.",

Certainly one of the most brutal that this continent really has seen since World War II. And some that has seen some tactics that a lot of people were shocked by when they sought some of these mercenaries from Wagner charging Ukrainian positions with what Ukrainians say were human waves of fighters. Some were recruited from prison. All that could now be coming to an end. We were able to speak to the eastern grouping of the Ukrainian armed forces about this. They said they really can't confirm yet whether this total withdrawal of Wagner fighters is really taking place. But they do say that, if it is taking place, it could offer an opportunity for the Ukrainians. The Ukrainians are saying that, yes, Wagner has been very effective on the battlefield. But they say that has been the case because of those brutal tactics, because they have lost so many of their own mercenaries, who were charging those positions. That's how they managed to make a lot of that headway. Ukrainians now believe that, if this is really true, they could start making some gains. The Ukrainians, of course, over the past couple of days, have been involved in a bit of the counter attack on the outskirts of Bakhmut, which they say so far they've managed to take some territory back. They obviously want to continue that. Yevgeny Prigozhin was pictured earlier today in a video released by himself, congratulating, as you, said his fighters and saying the withdrawal would be completed by June 1st. I want to listen to some of what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YEVGENY PRIGOZHIN, FOUNDER, WAGNER GROUP (through translator):  We are withdrawing the units from Bakhmut. It's 5 am on May 25th. By June 1st, the main part will be relocated to the rear camps. We are transferring positions to the military. The ammo positions, everything, including dry Russians (ph). (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And whether or not it could open up some opportunities for the Ukrainians, possibly a counterattack as well. An interesting tidbit of what Prigozhin said, he said his units would withdraw to replenish, to resupply and also to rest. Then they would get new orders. It certainly seemed as though, while Prigozhin and his mercenaries may be leaving the battlefield, now it appears as though he is vowing to come back.",

Essentially the U.S. is taking the chatter thatthey've picked up from Ukrainian and Russian officials and combining that with assessments about who would have the motivation to do this kind of thing. And they are lumping it into an assessment of, well, it was likely a Ukrainian group. Importantly, the U.S. does not believe that President Zelenskyy or any other senior Ukrainian government official was orchestrating this operation or were aware of it beforehand. But the fact that they had picked up intercepted communications of Ukrainian officials, speculating that perhaps Ukrainians special operations forces conducted this, has been instrumental in their thinking, as has been the history of Ukrainian groups carrying out some operations on Russian soil. The U.S. has attributed that to Ukrainian intelligence and special operations services in the past. I'm thinking, of course, of the car bombing in Moscow a couple of months ago, that killed the daughter of a prominent Russian political figure, Darya Dugina, that the U.S. did ultimately attribute to Ukrainian special forces. There is also other instances in which Ukrainians have carried out operations on Russian soil that the U.S. is aware of and that were made publicly available in classified documents that leaked earlier this month. So there is a pattern that the U.S. is also relying on when they think about who might have done this. Importantly, they do not believe that this was an assassination attempt. They don't buy that line by the Russians that the Ukrainians were trying to kill Vladimir Putin because Putin was not even in the building at the time, according to Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov. And it's pretty widely known that he doesn't spend a lot of time in that building anyway. So U.S. officials don't necessarily buy that. But they don't know, either, who did this. They don't have definitive proof of the specific unit or group that carried out this attack. So waiting for more information on that. But signs right now are pointing to some element of the Ukrainians carrying this out.",

Exactly who shot at whom, how this all unfolded, again, is not very clear. But at this point the focus is on this home in central Japan for this gunman who is inside or believed to be inside. Some perspective for you, as you mentioned, gun violence in Japan is very rare. Last year in 2022 there were four gun related deaths through acts of violence, one of which involved former prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who was assassinated by a man using a homemade weapon. But I'm giving you the status so you can put this all in context. Gun violence in Japan is very rare. In Nagano, which is a prefecture in central Japan, there is a lot of outdoor space, a lot of green space. Hunting is very popular. While hand gun ownership in Japan is not very prevalent, if anyone owns a type of weapon, especially in that area, it would be some kind of hunting rifle. In order to get that, it is a very strict and stringent process. Again, the controls of guns in Japan is something that is closely watched and held. At this point we are hoping to get updates throughout the evening from police but, at this point, a gunman is believed to be barricaded in this home after three people are shot dead here in Japan.
