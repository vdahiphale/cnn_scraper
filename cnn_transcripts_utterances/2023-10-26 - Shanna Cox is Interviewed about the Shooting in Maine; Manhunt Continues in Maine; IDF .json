And as soon as I turned and saw that it was not a balloon, he was holding a weapon, I just booked it down the lane and I slid basically into where the pins are and climbed up in the machine, and was on top of the machines for about 10 minutes until the cops got there. I don't know how to explain it. You know, I don't think you're supposed to see that in real life.Over ten. At least I knew they were shots. And then when I got on top of the bowling machine, it was a lot of ruckus back there. So, I don't really know from that. But heard the first one, . it was probably 15 feet behind me.

So, there was a lot of frantic activity from myself and so many others in the early moments where you collected your loved ones, you brought them home, you notified your family that you were safe, and you checked on your staff, your colleagues and the people that you care about.

We're all very close-knit. This community is close-knit. We're a resilient community that's overcome tragedy before. I have faith in our ability to respond smart and strong to what we're going through now. But it's challenging when the lockdown order is still in place andit's not resolved. There's a -- I'm receiving an outcry of support and willingness to buy coffee and buy pizzas and support first responders and health care workers and cover funeral costs.

My most immediate circle is accounted for. My staff, their family, my family, my closest contacts. But it's a - it's a tragedy that you - you are wondering when you will understand the extent of it. And I think that's the only way I can describe it. I think many of us, my - my kids included, are wondering who they know. Both of these locations last night are family locations.
