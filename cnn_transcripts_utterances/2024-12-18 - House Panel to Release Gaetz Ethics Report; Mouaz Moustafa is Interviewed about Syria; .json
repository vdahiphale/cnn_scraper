CNN has confirmed that a House panel took a secret vote to release the ethics report on former Congressman Matt Gaetz. You'll remember that investigation looked into allegations of sexual misconduct, drug use and possible bribes. It is now set to be made public, this investigation, soon.CNN's Alayna Treene and Manu Raju are joining me. As I said, this is a reversal of we - what we thought this was going towards. Alayna, you broke it. What are your sources telling you?",

      "sentences": "That's right. So, we have learned, John, that the House Ethics Committee secretly voted earlier this month to release the report into Matt Gaetz's conduct. And as you mentioned, this is a reversal from where they were. They voted last month not to release it. And the decision now to release it, this change, does suggest that some Republicans ultimately voted with the Democrats to make this report public. When they voted last month not to release it, I would note that it was a - the vote was along party lines. So, keep that in mind.Now, we are told that this report is expected to be made public once this session of Congress ends and lawmakers leave Washington to return home for the holidays. But I think the timing of this is very notable. We know that when the committee first voted last month not to release this report, Matt Gaetz was still Donald Trump's pick to be his attorney general. Since then, he has withdrawn his name from consideration. He has also made clear that he has no plans to return to Congress next year, and has also said that he is planning to join One America News Network to be an anchor for them in January. Now, just to get a little bit into this report. The Ethics Committee has been working on this report and investigating Gaetz's alleged conduct for about a year now. Here is some of what they've been investigating, whether he engaged in sexual misconduct, whether he used illicit drugs, and also whether he shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, accepted a bribe, use - had improper gratuity or impermissible gifts. And that is according to an announcement from the panel while they were investigating this. So again, this is a reversal for them. We had no idea, after they had initially voted, whether they were ultimately going to vote on whether to release this report. We now know that they voted secretly to do so.",

Even more rare to do it over the objections of the speaker of the House. Mike Johnson didn't want this. So, what happened here?",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right. In fact, that's what Mike Johnson cited. He said that, yes, there is precedent for releasing this ethics report, but he said it was bad precedent. That was his argument, trying to shelve this report while Matt Gaetz was considered as the attorney general nominee.There have been a couple of instances. There's one in the House back in 1987 where that occurred. Also one of the Senate Ethics Committee back in 2011, then Senator John Ensign had resigned. It was released after the fact. But the argument was that a lot of members believed that Matt Gaetz ultimately decided to resign - really abruptly resign to try to bury this report altogether. And some Republicans believe that they sided with Mike Johnson's belief that they should not move ahead with this report because of that fact. Now, it's also important to note that Gaetz is someone who has maintained frosty relations with Republicans and Democrats alike on Capitol Hill. We don't know if that's the precise reason for this reversal, but that's one of the things that can't be ignored here. He, of course, led the charge to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the House last year. That angered many Republicans. He is someone who has often attacked very directly, aggressively, Republicans and Democrats alike. His relationships are one reason why he didn't appear he had the votes to get confirmed as attorney general amid these - all these allegations that - questions about whether they would come out drip by drip, or the entire report. But now we can potentially see this whole report as soon as this week. The House is voting this - today. We don't know the exact final day of the session. But the sources are telling us that they expect it to be released after the final votes of this year. That could be today. That could be tomorrow. That could also potentially be Friday or even afterwards. But no doubt about it, this is going to be an explosive report. And Gaetz is someone who's still active in Republican politics, has an eye on other offices as well, potentially down the line. So, we'll see how he reacts. But he has denied these allegations for months, called this a witch hunt of sorts of an investigation. But this will get a lot of reaction when it ultimately comes out, John.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think we have to wait and see exactly what this report says. But I can tell you, I mean, look, part of the reason Matt Gaetz withdrew his name for consideration as Donald Trump's attorney general is because it was made very clear, and this is to Manu's point about the frosty relationship that Gaetz has with many of these members, it was made clear very early on when he was meeting behind closed doors with Republican senators that Matt Gaetz was not going to have the votes to be confirmed. Thats ultimately what led Donald Trump to calling Gaetz up the morning before he withdrew and telling him, look, the math isn't there. The writing is on the wall. It does not appear like you're going to be able to get through.So, that's where things stand. Now, again, Matt Gaetz remains, though, even though he's no longer Donald Trump's pick to be his attorney general, he is still very close with Donald Trump and many in his orbit. And Donald Trump still believes that he is someone who will continue to be a strong ally for him. Unclear whether or not, you know, what that will look like moving forward. But they will definitely have a reaction to this. I just think we have to wait and see exactly what comes out in this report. John.",

What one advocacy group is saying about just how many people the former regime tortured and buried in those graves.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:41:30] KATE BOLDUAN, CNN ANCHOR: So, Syrians are starting to uncover mass graves across the country. Now, this discovery is now beginning to confirm the long held fears that hundreds of thousands of bodies could be buried there. Also beginning to shed light on the sheer magnitude of the atrocities committed by the now former dictator, Bashar al Assad, and his brutal regime. More than two weeks after Assad fled Syria. Syrian families are still searching for answers about so many of their loved ones taken by Assad's secret police over the years. Some perspective here, guys. Some 150,000 people in Syria are unaccounted for, most of whom were kidnaped or detained by the Assad regime. And this is according to the International Commission of Missing Persons. CNN cannot independently verify this number. But let's get to it and what this means for this new day in Syria. Joining me right now is one of the top advocacy groups helping to find some of these answers, a group that has long supported the Syrian people in the face of Assad's brutality, the executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, Mouaz Moustafa. Mouaz, thank you for coming in today. You were just in Syria. You just returned to the states. And I heard you say that you're aware of at least eight mass grave sites in Syria. Talk to me about what is being uncovered and what you're hearing from Syrians now that they can start speaking freely.",

And then we used to only be able to see them on open source Google Earth, where you go back and you see these massive trenches being dug. Today, we were able to go to these locations, you know, and what we're identifying is multiple mass graves, Qutayfah, Najha, south of Damascus, on the airport road, and all these places where hundreds of thousands of bodies, men, women, children, and elderly, had been not just shot in the head, but mostly tortured to death, really a sadistic regime. And now is the time to secure these places, and we need the world's help to help preserve the evidence, to help understand how, you know, to exhume bodies and to help identify for their loved ones, you know, who has passed.

But he has been jubilant, so excited and he has committed to the new government and to help the international experts to bring these criminals to justice.As a matter of fact, you know, those mass graves were the answer to the Caesar photos. We never knew these thousands of people where they ended up. And I went to the exact place where Caesar took the photos. And it was just surreal to be there as he guided me to that exact location.
