And we're just going to put up a couple of things, that clearly there are no elected officials out there yet, Democrats, elected Democrats, out there saying that he should bow out of the race. I think my -- our colleague here at CNN, Paul Begala, said that the first Democratic politician to do that would basically be shot. It would be political suicide.But here was \"The New York Times\" editorial board, saying to serve his country President Biden should leave the race. James Carville says, behind the curtain, the Biden oligarchy will decide the fate. We pressed Carville on whether he thinks Biden will be off the ticket. He said he thinks so. And he invoked a famous quote by the late economist Herb Stein, which Carville paraphrased as \"that which can't continue, won't.\" There was Maureen Dowd, who said very simply, \"He's being selfish. He's putting himself ahead of this country. He's surrounded by opportunistic enablers, and he has created a reality distortion field where we're told not to believe what we have plainly seen.\"",

The driver's cause of death has not been released. Residents of New Mexico waking up to more extreme flooding this morning. Water levels reaching up to six feet high in some city streets. The state's National Guard has been called in to help after rescuers were unable to reach some of the victims. All right. Take a look at this. A very patient sheriff's deputy in Eastern Oregon waiting for a group of baby skunk siblings to cross the road. In a post on Facebook, the Baker County Sheriff's Office says the deputy gave the hardworking mama plenty of space -- smart -- while she was trying to wrangle per babies. That's actually extremely adorable. OK. This morning, the Caribbean bracing for Hurricane Beryl. It is now a Category Three storm. The National Hurricane Center says the storm weakened overnight, but still warns of potentially catastrophic wind damage as Beryl heads across the Windward Islands later this morning.
