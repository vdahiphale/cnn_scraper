And we begin with the dangerous weather situation in Texas that could get even worse this weekend. Several days of downpours have damaged homes, swept away cars, and forced people to evacuate. Some areas got hit with almost two feet of rain, causing widespread flooding. And more rain is on the way. Let's bring in CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar. So there's more you're tracking.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Unfortunately, the last thing this this place needs is more rain, but Texas is about to get a bunch of it. Take a look at the video behind me. This is from Livingston, Texas. Again, you can just see all of that widespread water flowing into homes and businesses and covering the roadways.But it's not just the rain that fell onto the roads. You also have to worry about the rivers, creeks, and streams, because those swell after that much rain. Take a look. You've got 39 river gauges at minor flood stage, 16 at moderate, and about a dozen river gauges at major flood stage. And these take time. In fact, some of these have yet to even peak and likely won't for another day or two before you start to see those numbers come down. It's all this rain that led to that. Take a look at this, widespread totals of about six to 10 inches, but there were some spots that picked up 15, 20 even as much as 23 inches of rain in just the last five days. Now, we do have new flood watches and effect for much of this area, and it's because you can start to see some of these showers beginning to fire up that section right there across east Texas, right there along the Louisiana state line, and some other showers across western Texas. The flood watches do extend into Oklahoma as well as portions of Arkansas. We may see that shift into Louisiana and some other states in the coming days as this rain begins to progress forward. But yes, take a look at all this rain. This is now what we expect just through Sunday evening. You can see most of the target point is between Waco, San Angelo, and down through San Antonio where you're looking at an extra maybe four inches. Even Houston not expecting quite that much. But at this point, even an extra inch or two on top of 20 really doesn't help. So it's not going to take all that much. If that wasn't enough, we also have the potential for severe thunderstorms, and that stretches from Texas all the way up through southern Wisconsin. That includes Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, back through Austin and Midland, very large hail, damaging wind gusts, and even some strong tornadoes. One thing to note, we've already had nine straight days of confirmed tornadoes here in the U.S. If we get another one today, that would be the 10th day straight. But look at this number. Overall, Fred, you're talking 224 total tornado reports just since April 24th.",

She did have some warm words for her former boss, praising his ability to message. He deserves the credit for the different messages that the campaign focused on in terms of the agenda that he put forth. But she never looked at him during most of her testimony, instead, focusing directly on the lawyers asking her questions.She testified at length about the impact of the \"Access Hollywood\" tape ape on the 2016 Trump campaign, and how it was a crisis. She was the first person in the campaign to learn of the tape what she was contacted by a reporter. \"I was concerned,\" she said. She also witnessed Trump's reaction to the story. Asked if he was upset, she said, \"Yes, yes, he was.\" She also told the jury about conversation she had with former Trump fixer, Michael Cohen, and Trump when reports of Karen McDougal and Stormy Daniels first surfaced in early November 2016, saying Trump wanted to make sure that there was a denial of any kind of relationship. In a significant moment for prosecutors, Hicks revealed Trump communicated directly to her about the payment to Daniels. \"I only know about one instance. Sometime in the middle of February, Mr. Trump told me about it.\" And Trump was relieved that the story did not come out before the election. It was Mr. Trump's opinion that it was better to be dealing with it now and that it would have been bad to have had that story come out before the election. Hicks appeared nervous throughout her appearance on the stand, and after that key exchange, as defense attorneys were starting their cross-examination, Hicks broke down in tears. \"Sorry about that,\" she said, as she returned to the stand. And when Trump's attorneys had the chance to question her, they got her to confirm that he was worried about his wife Melania's reaction to some of the stories. \"President Trump really values Mrs. Trump's opinion and she doesn't weigh in all the time. But when she does, it's really meaningful to him.\" Now the big question is who will take the stand on Monday. Next week is actually the first full four-day week of court that we've had since this trial got underway. But prosecutors are keeping it tightlipped on who they plan to call next and when they plan to call the man at the center of this alleged conspiracy, Michael Cohen. Paula Reid, CNN, New York.

And that's kind of what we're seeing play out this weekend.Now, one person who also isn't here is Marjorie Taylor Greene, and that's something that one congressman told me is very noteworthy. And look, this all comes as Donald Trump behind the scenes, I'm told, has been frustrated by this intraparty feuding. He does not want there to be division in the party right now. He actually tapped RNC Chairman Michael Whatley to go to the capital earlier this week and essentially tell the House Republican Conference that he wants them to be united, and that that was a message he was delivering on behalf of Donald Trump.

They say one strike hit a home in northern Gaza, another was on a building in an area east of Rafah, a city where more than 1 million Palestinians have been sheltering. Israel Defense Forces said the strikes were aimed at dismantling Hamas capabilities in the area. The strikes come as Hamas negotiators arrived in Egypt for new talks of a possible ceasefire in Gaza.
