      "sentences": "Good evening, everyone. I'm Laura Coates in Washington, D.C.A pivotal, unprecedented night in America. Three weeks ago, there was the consequential presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. It's hard to believe it's only three weeks ago, but it was, in fact, three weeks ago. And now the sitting president dropping out of the race for the White House and, in short order, then turning around and endorsing his vice president, Kamala Harris. Well, tonight, Democrats starting to rally around Harris as she, quote, \"intends to earn and win the nomination.\" Democrats greeting Biden's exit with an avalanche of cash to the tune of more than 46 million bucks and counting, energized by even the prospect of a Harris top-of-the-ticket campaign. I want to bring in CNN White House correspondent Priscilla Alvarez. She's in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with the president of the United States. Priscilla, what have you learned about how this seismic -- and I do mean seismic -- announcement even came to pass after weeks of defiance?",

      "sentences": "Well, ultimately, the last 48 hours were pivotal. The president is self-isolating in his Delaware residence here because of his positive COVID diagnosis.And it was during that time that he was also deliberating and reflecting. We're now learning that the president, on Saturday evening, huddled with his senior advisers, who were here in Rehoboth Beach, and they assessed the polling. They talked about what Democratic lawmakers had been pleading the president to do, which was to step aside. And it was during that time that the president was starting to come to the decision that he was going to drop out of the race. He also, of course, consulted with his family. They have always been pivotal in almost all of his decisions over the course of his political career. But then today was ultimately the day that the president decided to announce that he was going to drop out of the race. And this was so tightly held that it was only one minute before the president published his letter publicly that he was on the line with the senior White House and senior campaign officials to advise them -- or sorry, to notify them that he was going to withdraw. And of course, this shook the political world as the president announced that he was not going to seek reelection. And then shortly thereafter said that he was going to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris and urged the Democratic Party to get in line and to support her. Now, sources also tell me that the vice president didn't know about this decision until today. That's when she was informed by the president that he was going to step aside from the presidential election -- for the presidential race. And then they spoke multiple times over the course of the day. And Vice President Kamala Harris has since then been making multiple calls to Democratic officials over the course of the day to try to earn their endorsement. Now we should also note, Laura, that in that letter from the president, he said that he was going to address the nation. We're still trying to get clarity on when exactly that is. Of course, the president is still recovering from COVID. The White House doctor has provided routine updates to say that he is improving, that his symptoms are improving, but we still don't know when or where the president wants to address the nation. The White House putting out his guidance this week, which doesn't shed any light in terms of what his schedule is going to look like as he is in recovery. But certainly, that is going to be a speech that all eyes will be on as the president tries to seek some sort of unity in his party, which for weeks now, has been completely divided on whether or not he was the best candidate for them in this divisive election year.",

Let me begin with you here, Ashley, because it was probably an incredibly hard decision.

Finish strong.\" You still have executive power to do executive orders, to continue to forgive student loan debt, which is such an important issue for so many young Americans and people my age suffering with that debt. Of course, it was a hard decision. Joe Biden believed he could get the job done. But he talked to some of his closest advisers and family and came to the conclusion that it's not about him. It's about our country. It's about our party. Unlike his former opponent, Donald Trump, who continue -- who had lost in 2020, continues to be the party nominee, continued to put candidates up in the midterms that lose. So yes, it was a terribly hard decision for Joe Biden, because he cares what happens to this country, but he also did something extremely historical in passing the torch to Kamala Harris, his vice president. And I think history will remember him well.",

There are lots of questions about whether she can beat Trump any more than Biden could. But I think Democrats felt a certain amount of, you know, inevitability to the Biden situation. They have -- they have the airwaves to themselves this year, Laura, in the swing states, almost completely, almost unrebutted, spending tens of millions of dollars. And Biden's approval rating in those states was no better now than it is nationally, which suggests that there are an awful lot of voters who are basically -- who are basically done with him and had tuned him out. At least with Harris, you get a chance to reset the race, creates a new contrast. Suddenly, Donald Trump is the -- is the older guy. And I think the -- the version I've heard from -- from many Democratic strategists and pollsters and consultants is that, yes, her floor might be lower. We don't know how good she will be. She was not a great candidate in 2020. But her ceiling is almost certainly higher. And that was a risk that seemed, I think, to most Democrats, worth taking at this point.",

Every major media news outlet in this country is now deeply reporting on all the steps that were taken to try to hide from the public what was going on with Joe Biden. And you've got a litany of people from this White House, from the Congress, and the top-ranking Democrat who was part of this litany going out into the public and lying to us about how he is was Kamala Harris. So, I suspect what they're going to say is not only is she in on all of the policy deficiencies you're mad about, she was also in on the lying. And that's going to call into question her credibility.

Joe Biden has decided to step out of this race, because his close advisers told him that there is not a path to victory. And so, rather than making it about himself, he is saying I understand the threat that Donald Trump poses to our democracy. And if I can't beat him, I'm going to give a pathway for someone else to -- to beat him. I think in terms of the record, look, the narrative around the border -- Maria Cardona, our colleague, just was saying that border crossings, illegal border crossings are lower now under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris than they were under Donald Trump.

Now, Harris is going to end up with a nomination through what they're calling a process, but it's obviously rigged.

And in my experience, given what I've shared with you, I will also say to you that I have seen fathers bring their sons up to me and say, she is the first, in a way that is to also speak to those sons about the fact that they should not ever be burdened by what has been. And they should see what can be. And I think that's really the most important takeaway, which is that, with each barrier that we break, it is saying to all of us don't be burdened by what has been. See what can be, and strive for that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They didn't ascend to the vice presidency or the presidency, but they were the first in many aspects, and they certainly were not the last.And so, I appreciate what the vice president's mother shared with her, because there is a sense of hope and possibility of what this country can do when folks are given the opportunity. I want to say that, when vice president or then-senator was selected to be the vice president, she went through a rigorous vetting process. She was the attorney general for the second largest Department of Justice in the country, second to the Department of Justice that the attorney general sits at. She was on the Judiciary Committee where -- going over important Supreme Court confirmations. She has the credentials. She also happens to be a black woman. And so, she is not in this position because she is a black woman, but she does have -- happen to be a black woman. And so, I think that all of those things put together will be really important. Who she picks as her vice president, folks always say V.P.s don't matter. I don't necessarily agree with that. But I think people will look to see, is she going to do like a Donald Trump and pick a MAGA person like J.D. Vance, who was anti-abortion, and who won't actually say the election results of the 2020 elections are fair and accurate? Or is she going to look for someone, maybe from a battleground state? Maybe somebody from a different racial background than her and say, I can bring America -- America together. Look at this ticket. This is what America is, and you all are a part of it.

I mean, Harris, you know, the high watermark of her short-lived campaign for president that you were previewing a minute ago was when she had a debate and effectively implied that Joe Biden was a racist on the stage. That was the high watermark. So, I don't know if they consider her to be a good debater or a bad debater. I'm not sure how they view it.

Joining us now is CNN political analyst Juliann Zelizer, and CNN presidential historian Tim Naftali. Glad to have both of you here. Let me begin with my alma mater, Professor Juliann from Princeton. Let me ask you this question. At 78 years old, Donald Trump now becomes the oldest nominee in U.S. history. How significant is this shift, considering all that we have talked about for months now about that -- that contest?",

Whoever the nominee is -- and it's looking like Vice President Harris -- it will reflect one party that is pushing forward with new ideas and new issues and new faces, compared to the top of the ticket with the GOP, which is still the politics, in some ways, of yesteryear.

They decided on their own that they wouldn't run again. And they decided when to tell the world that they weren't running again. Yes, there were, in both cases, Democrats who were seeking to challenge the president, but the leadership of the Democratic Party wasn't pushing those presidents out. Nor was there a whispering campaign that made clear there was a coalescing of most Democrats around the idea that the incumbent president shouldn't run again. That's what makes what happened today so extraordinary. The other thing that's important to keep in mind is the decisions made by Truman and LBJ happened in March of the election year, not just a few weeks before the nominating convention, where the incumbent president already had more than enough votes to be renominated. And that's what puts President Trump [SIC] -- President Biden's decision in real context. President Biden didn't want to make the decision he made today. President Biden realized he had to make it. And what a contrast to former President Trump, who held onto power even when it would come at a cost to dividing the country. Today, President Biden decided not to inflict that cost on the country but to inflict the cost on himself, because this must have been personally a very difficult decision.",

We have seen yet another unprecedented moment with a very human element to it. In the end, President Biden had the power and the authority to stay atop the ticket. There was no system by which he could be removed. This was not a story of impeachment or removal. He hadn't done anything wrong. He'd just gotten old. And he came to the conclusion that our country would be best served by his standing aside. What is incredibly interesting and important -- and I know Julian knows about this, too -- is that in 1968, when Lyndon Johnson stepped aside, he didn't endorse his vice president until after the convention. Indeed, Lyndon Johnson held out a sliver of hope that he might be re- nominated at that convention by draft. In this case, what we're seeing is a coalition -- a coalescing of support for Vice President Harris very quickly, not simply because the president endorsed her, but because leading Democrats see her as the correct standard bearer at this moment. So, we're not in a 1968 situation. We're in a unique 2024 situation.",

KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT/ANCHOR: Laura, well, across the world and here in Asia, people have been hanging onto every single detail about the election. And world leaders are responding, especially allies, who say that they respect President Biden's decision to drop out of the race. In fact, this is what we heard from the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who took to X to say this. Let's bring it up for you. He said, quote, \"My friend Joe Biden has achieved a lot for his country, for Europe, for the world. Thanks to him, transatlantic cooperation is close, NATO is strong, and the USA is a good and reliable partner for us. His decision not to run again deserves respect,\" unquote. And from the U.K., we heard this from the relatively new British prime minister, who said, quote, \"I respect President Biden's decision. I look forward to us working together during the remainder of his presidency.\" We also heard from Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who issued a lengthy post on the social platform X, saying that \"Ukraine is grateful to President Biden for his unwavering support for Ukraine's fight for freedom. Many strong decisions have been made in recent years, and they will be remembered as bold steps taken by Biden in response to challenging times. And we respect today's tough, but strong decision.\" Look, under President Biden, the U.S. has bolstered ties with allies around the world, also here in Asia to counter a rising China. And as such, allies here in the region have also weighed in, including the Australian prime minister, who calls Biden a, quote, \"incredibly decent, honorable man of integrity.\" On social media, we heard this from Anthony Albanese. He said, \"Thank you for your leadership. Thank you for your ongoing service.\" He also adds that \"The Australia-U.S. alliance has never been stronger with our shared commitment to democratic values, international security, economic prosperity, and climate action for this and future generations.\" Albanese also called Kamala Harris a good friend. Now, South Korea and Japan, they said that they don't wish to comment on domestic politics in the U.S. But they also emphasized the need to work with the U.S. And we also in the last half-hour, heard from the president of the Philippines, who called Biden's decision a demonstration of genuine statesmanship. Now the U.S. says it stands with the Philippines, especially now as tensions grow with China over the South China Sea. And Laura, we are still waiting for a response from China later in the day.
