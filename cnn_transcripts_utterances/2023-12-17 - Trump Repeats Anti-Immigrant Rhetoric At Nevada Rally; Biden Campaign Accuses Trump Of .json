One day after he accused immigrants of poisoning the blood of this country the former president is now claiming tonight that the influx of migrants across the southern border is a, quote, \"invasion.\" He vowed to implement the strongest deportation operations, as he puts it, in U.S. history. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Given the unprecedented millions of Biden illegal aliens who are invading our country, it is only common sense that when I'm reelected we will begin, and we have no choice, the largest deportation operation in America. They come from prisons, they come from mental institutions and insane asylums. Many are terrorists. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But, look, he is leaning heavily into his hardline immigration rhetoric, but also policies that he's previewing for a potential second administration. We know through our own reporting, my reporting, as well as what other outlets have reported that Donald Trump wants to massively expand some of his immigration policies from his first term including rounding up undocumented immigrants in the U.S., placing them in deportation camps, and then sending them on to be deported after that.And we know that he also wants to divert resources, more resources to immigration enforcement in the United States in order to do that plans that we're hearing him kind of talk about here on stage tonight. And you made a good point, Jim, this comes after his very violent rhetoric yesterday while speaking in New Hampshire where he said that immigrants are poisoning the blood of the country. We heard immediately a lot of people come out and criticize him for those remarks. He's used that language in the past and of course it's associated with white supremacist rhetoric. Now we did see the Biden administration as well as the Biden campaign come out and criticize him over that language. They said that it's parroting Adolf Hitler and referred to him as using authoritarian language -- Jim.",

It's the opposite of everything we stand for as Americans.\"Now, Jim, of course, some of the rhetoric from former president Donald Trump is not new. This is something that the president has -- or the former president has said before in the campaign. The Biden campaign and the White House have been prepared for that exact possibility. In fact, President Biden himself in private events with donors has told them that this language is likened to Nazi terminology. And president also taking the opportunity through his reelection campaign to issue a statement condemning the former president's travel ban on predominantly on Muslim countries. So they are fully aware, they being the White House and the Biden campaign, of where the former president stands on immigration and they have been blasting each of those policies, those controversial policies as they have been rolled out and calling them un-American and inhumane in the process.",

And of course the problem is the border is a real crisis, it is a problem, it does need a solution. But Trump is not aiming for any of that. Trump is aiming for emotion and just to, you know, kind of set the issue on fire because that's good for Donald Trump.

I resisted that word for a long time and I wrote an article a few weeks ago saying it's finally time to accept that Trump has crossed the line into fascist rhetoric and basically presents himself as a fascist.And so part of the reason he does that again is to set everybody's hair on fire about it but also to signal to the people, to his base, to the people that he wants to reach and to keep a solid grip on that he is in fact talking about racial supremacy and he is talking about, you know, this Hitler rhetoric.

You know, he's had some health problems along the way, just as anybody would in their 70s, but he has always recovered from that well. He has maintained his athlete great shape and you can tell that when you sit and talk to him. I just saw him a couple of months ago. I actually used to work with Kareem on the show. I had a basketball show on ESPN. He used to come on sometimes as a panelist. And just to give you a little window into his sense of humor and his personality, the greatest Christmas gift I have ever had was from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. I'm sorry, to my family to say that.",

We've seen this happen with other teams, I mean, twenty, thirty years ago, you would see professional sports team build the big stadium, build the big arena in a downtown area of a major city. Now you're seeing almost the reverse happening. The Atlanta Braves, they left Atlanta, built a big stadium out in the suburbs. Is this part of a trend?

The rain already heavy, starting to spread into Delaware and Maryland near DC, starting to see some of those downpours. The flood alerts for 60 million people go through Monday up to Maine for a widespread two to four inches of rain, and some totals could be even higher than that causing some risk to some river flooding, too. Here is that heavy rain look at tomorrow morning from Philly to New York, Boston, just nasty, really tough commute. And then we get a punch of snow possible behind it headed into Tuesday and some of that cold air starts to rush in. We've got wind alerts in effect for Brooklyn, Queens, Long Island, Cape Cod up into Maine where you see that deeper kind of brown color. We're talking about 65-mile-per-hour gusts. So very windy. Farther in land, you're talking 45-mile-per-hour gusts, but the winds just really pop as we go into tomorrow and then into Monday as the storm system starts to strengthen like it like a top and the winds start to pick up even more. So if you had early travel plans for the holidays, look at this, from DC, Philly, New York, and Boston, it looks like you're going to have hefty delays not just from the heavy rain, but those gusty winds. And if you do take off, it's going to be quite turbulent -- Jim.",

CNN inside a closed-door briefing with senior intelligence officials in Taipei. Beijing's goal they say, boosting the chances of candidates seen as friendlier to China to win next month's crucial presidential race. A senior security official tells CNN, Chinese leaders held a secret meeting in the Mainland last month hashing out election interference plans. The meeting chaired by Wang Huning, the fourth ranking leader of China's Communist Party. Wang ordering officials to be more discreet, Taiwanese intelligence tells CNN. They even say the Chinese military is involved claiming PLA Base 311, a psychological warfare unit in the Mainland is targeting the self-governing democracy with disinformation. The Mainland's Taiwan Affairs Office says Taiwan elections are purely China's internal affairs and allow no interference by any external forces. Taiwanese officials say the secretive gathering just days after Chinese leader, Xi Jinping traveled to San Francisco, a four-hour marathon meeting with President Joe Biden.
