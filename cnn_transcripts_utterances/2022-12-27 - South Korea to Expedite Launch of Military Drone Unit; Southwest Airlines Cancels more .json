As we begin ripping out the old andbringing in the new Investors of a challenging year consumers certainly did to the big question for next year will global inflation subdue. Mark Zandi may have a clue Moody's Analytics Chief Economist joins later for his thoughts on the outlook for next year. And a new year brings fresh hopes for a more just and peaceful world too. Meditation expert and bestselling Author Deepak Chopra has urgent advice to Russian President Putin and other world leaders. Nine rules they can utilize to help resolve conflicts. Deepak obviously says no time to wait and we agree my special interview with him coming right up. And from hope is for a more peaceful world to at least some green arrows unfurled, European stocks were getting the holiday shortened trading week higher. As you can see there U.S. futures a little unsettled the NASDAQ, a touch lower now but hopes for a legendary Santa Claus rally this year spring eternal with the Wall Street bulls hoping to break a three week losing streak in fact. U.S. sentiment getting a little bit of a boost I think from solid holiday spending numbers up by a stronger than expected 7.6 percent. Thanks in large part to a reservation rush at restaurants. It's all about the services sector. Yes, that remains one of the most resilient segments of the U.S. economy right now. Now news too, that China is further lifting zero COVID policies adding to the sentiment boost Asian stocks all closing higher. Beijing announcing that it will drop quarantine requirements for all international passengers entering the country beginning on January the eighth. Other countries are reacting with something you would expect some caution so far, Japan and India are now imposing testing requirements on travellers entering from Mainland, China that said oil prices are reacting positively. Investors assuming I think that this will help support broader global growth and therefore energy demand along with it. Be careful however, what you wish for Higher Chinese crude consumption could further boost inflation in the New Year of course, if supplies tighten. And that is where we begin today's show in China, where some families who have been separated for three long years are looking forward to reuniting in the New Year.

China is dropping quarantinefor all international arrivals from January 8, and promising to gradually restart outbound tourism for Chinese citizens. Inbound travellers still need to get a 40 hour negative COVID test before boarding, but they dropped all of the other cumbersome requirements to understand why these changes are such a big deal. We have to look at what the reality has been in China during the pandemic. The country has been severely limiting who can go in and out of the country with strict border controls. Flights have been very limited and expensive. All arrivals have to go through quarantine and government facilities. I went through multiple quarantines myself, including 21 days earlier this year. And we're talking about harsh quarantines, no choice and where you get sent. No opening your door except for food pickups and COVID tests. All of that is now going away. This new change would effectively also end the ban on Chinese citizens from going overseas for non-essential reasons, but the timing is still unclear. Authorities have not said when they'll restart issuing tourist visas are allowing foreigners to apply for business study or family reunion visas. But finally, people are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Online searches for popular international travel destinations on China's travel booking site. See tripped jumped 10 times within an hour of when this announcement was made. I've also spoken to a few Chinese citizens who've been stuck overseas for years, they are overjoyed and relieved that finally there's a way for them to see family. But there's also some bitterness over how long this has taken. They've already missed so many important moments, family deaths, births, reunions, but in response to this change, other countries are starting to issue restrictions on travellers from China. Japan announced travellers from the country will be tested for COVID. Upon arrival, Japan's Prime Minister also said the country will restrict plans to increase flights in and out of China. India announced similar COVID testing guidelines. Authorities in India said the guidelines are aimed at ensuring COVID does not spread as quickly as it has been in China. Selina Wang, CNN, Beijing",

So we've been told that five came across the border one approached the Capital Seoul, and then four of the others were flying around Ganghwa Island, which is just off the West coast of the Peninsula. Now South Korea's reaction was that they scrambled fighter jets and attack helicopters. In fact, one of those fighter jets did crash, but the Defense Ministry say there was no injury to the crew itself. And also what they did from the South Korean side is that they sent reconnaissance assets aircraft into North Korea, as well as some just along the inter-Korean border. But some went into North Korean airspace and filmed and photographed military installations. So a tit for tat response to what North Korea had done as well. The spokesperson saying it's a clear provocation and an invasion of our airspace by North Korea. Now, it is unusual for this to happen but it's not unprecedented. The last time that a drone was detected by the South Koreans was back in 2017 and that is when they discovered a crashed North Korean drone. And at that time, the military said that they believed it had been photographing a U.S. built missile defense system in the country. Also a similar situation back in 2014, when they also discovered a crashed drone from North Korea. Now this has been a concern from the South Korean side but it is also coming at a time and historic time when North Korea has been continually firing missiles and launching missiles throughout 2022. Never in its history have we seen what we have seen this year and it also comes at a time when relations between the two Koreas are particularly bad. Paula Hancocks, CNN Seoul.",

Sergei Lavrov threatened Kyiv sayingUkraine must accept Moscow's demands, which include giving up territory Russia now controls, or he said it will be decided on the battlefield. Lavrov's comments come just one day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said he was open to negotiations aimed at ending the war on his terms, and advisor for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned Monday that any peace talks coming from the Kremlin cannot be trusted. CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now on this. Clare, I think President Putin has made it very clear and will reiterate it there that any peace negotiations that he's foreseeing have to be on his and on Russia's terms.

Again, as you say, we heard from the Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in an interview with the Russian news agency TASS. On Monday saying that the proposals by Moscow which Ukraine needs to meet in order to end this are the demilitarization and de-Nazification, he says, of the whole of Ukraine and the elimination of security threats to Russia. And that includes he says those four illegally annexed territories Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Kherson, which of course Russia doesn't even fully control. So Ukraine, on the other hand, wants to return to its 1991 borders, which include Crimea, those are red lines on both sides. So it's really unclear at this point, how they would come together? I think a key question is why would Vladimir Putin say that he wants talks if he doesn't really want to compromise? Perhaps, to nudge Ukraine's allies in the West to sort of push Ukraine towards some kind of ground giving some kind of compromise to try to end this? We know there are concerns in some quarters in the West about how long this is going to go on? How they will continue to arm Ukraine said perhaps that's what he's trying to do? But Ukraine for its part, the Foreign Minister, in an interview with the Associated Press, saying that he wants peace talks in February, but only if Russia admits to a war crimes trial.

It makes their military defense look less humiliating, but certainly that makes coming to the negotiating table more difficult because they continue to paint Ukraine as a sort of pawn of the West. And this kind of narrative flipping is really part of the playbook here. There was another comment from Sergey Lavrov and then to you that he said, as far as the length of the war is concerned, the ball is in the court of the regime.

They have largely blamed that huge winter storm and yet they're the only U.S. airline that still dealing with this massive fallout. Just take a look behind me at this board cancellation. After cancellation Southwest has already cancelled more than 60 percent of today's flights. Most of that was done last night and they've already could gone ahead and cancelled more than 60 percent of tomorrow's flights. The company telling me they're only going to fly about 1/3 of their scheduled flights in the coming days, as they try to regroup. Take a look behind me at just how many stranded lost pieces of luggage there are here in Baltimore as there are right now in so many airports because of all these flight issues and cancellations. Again, Southwest has said, this is largely because of that winter weather, because of the storm. And yet their pilots union, the union that represents Southwest pilot says this is not about a winter storm. This is about outdated processes, and outdated IT and CNN actually did obtain a video message or transcript of a video message sent out by the CEO of Southwest to the company on Christmas acknowledging that they were having issues. And it was largely because of issues where they needed to modernize their operations where they were having those operational issues. So we're waiting to get more information from Southwest but it's, really little relief for the tens of thousands of passengers who are just left stranded right now. They can't reach customer service many are waiting hours and hours. And as you said right before my hit here, many people can't get booked until close to New Year's Eve. So it is just a brutal situation messy obviously for the airline. The Department of Transportation says they're now going to examine if Southwest did everything they could.

The big questions, of course for Investors continue to include, can we avoid a U.S. recession? Will inflation continued to ease and at what pace? And will the Federal Reserve make a market friendly pivot? Well, Mark Zandi joins us now. He's the Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics, and he has his crystal ball with him as always, at least I hope you do. Mark, welcome to the show, and happy holidays as well. You're actually joining us for a reason because you are quite optimistic on the U.S. economic outlook for a number of reasons. But you do believe that a more material downturn can be avoided. Explain why, please? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS: Well, Julia, I've got two or three crystal balls. I'm not sure which one is worse, but yes, I've got a few of them. Well, it's all being optimistic is relative these days. I mean, obviously, when inflation is high, and the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates aggressively. Recession risks are, you know, uncomfortably high. So the optimism has to be put into some context. But I do think the chance to get through this, I mean, key to the entire economic outlook is inflation and how fast that comes down from the high levels right now? And at this point in time, we've been getting some pretty good news. I mean, oil prices are down gas prices, which peaked at $5 a gallon are now down close to $3. Of course, it's the news out of China and the fact that the COVID restrictions have been relaxed. Take a little bit of time before China gets up to full speed given that the lot of folks are getting sick there, but you know that feels like that means supply chain should ease the rents have gone flat, which means housing costs should moderate. And I do think the job market is starting to weaken sufficiently to get wage growth down to a place where the Fed won't be so concerned about inflation. So I guess bottom line, just feels like inflation is moving in the right direction fast enough to allow us to get through this back going into recession.",

Middle income households that, you know, that's where the, you know, the bulk of this. In high income households, that's where the bulk of the spending occurs in the economy pretty good shape. You know, you pointed out a lot of excess savings built up during the pandemic, sitting in people's checking accounts. They've been drawing that down to pay for the higher cost of goods and services because of the higher inflation but there's still a lot there. And leverage is low, you know, there has been a pickup in borrowing by low income households to supplement their purchasing power, given the high inflation, but middle and high income households have not borrowed. And they've done a pretty good job of locking in the previously low record interest rates, you know, through various mortgage refinancing ways they've been able to lock those in. So they're insulated from the run up and rate. So, you know, taking in its totality, looking at the American consumer across the board, feels pretty good.

And that is - those are the situations where they're encountering people that sadly did not survive this storm.

And so those plow trucks are able to get out clearing the streets clearing the highways but nonetheless there is a driving ban that is still in place here in the City of Buffalo, which we have to remind our viewers, was basically the ground zero of this massive storm that affected millions in many states. And so now is the point where they're moving forward on recovery. And many people here are hopeful that today will be a significant improvement in terms of clearing up the roads and also getting more resources and assets into the area. You see Governor Kathy Hochul here in the State of New York basically calling on resources and communities around Buffalo to be able to come in to assist with the plowing to assist with those door-to-doors, and also with food. You see there are many people here that have been hunkered down us included for now five days.

Today's stock laggards include Tesla once again its shares are falling after an 18 percent plunge last week. The big concerns today include news that production will be cut at the EV firms Shanghai plant next month. And shares of Southwest Airlines also grounded. Southwest far and away the most impacted of all the major U.S. carriers as we were discussing earlier on in the show during this historic winter storm that continues to impact travel nationwide across the United States. Southwest plans to operate just over a third of its schedule in the coming days that it attempts to reboot operations. It canceled some 70 percent of its flights on Monday alone. OK, let's go to Iran now where the family of an Iranian football star was prevented from leaving Iran mid-flight according to an Iranian news agency. The flight was carrying the wife and daughter of Ali Daei (ph) who is a critic of the Iranian government and was forced to return to Iran after setting off for Dubai.

Now there are serious concerns around what perhaps they may face now upon their removal? But what we do know so far is according to state run media Ali Daei's wife had a travel ban placed on her. This has reported this in a now retracted article, saying that she had been asked to inform authorities of any plans to travel out of the country but failed to do so. Now that article has now been retracted. But separately, the - Official Taslim News Agency has reported that Ali Daei's wife faced a travel ban over participation in riots or so called riots in November and December across Iran. Of course there is concern around whether or not this was targeted? Ali Daei, as you mentioned, there is a government critic very vocal in his support for the protest movement. But he himself has said that he is not aware of any travel ban placed on his family or in particular on his wife and has not been given a reason as to why they were removed from this flight?",

They began in September, and despite the crackdown, they are continuing. And of course, Ali Daei himself has been a very vocal critic of the Iranian regime in general, more so of course of the Iranian regime's crackdown on protesters. He was recently refused an invitation to the World Cup in a show of solidarity with the protest movement. And he shared this post on Instagram. I can read you just a quick bit from that saying instead of repression; violence and arresting the Iranian people solve their problems, a direct message there to the Iranian regime. He is a hugely notable figure in Iran and has taken a very clear stance in solidarity with the Iranian protest movement, the anti-regime protest movement. The concern now was this could be another repercussion, faced by another notable Iranian figure for standing up to the Iranian regime.",
