Governor DeSantis yesterday, he shifted several of his events -- postponed them, and instead just did a morning event and then met up with some volunteers. Vivek Ramaswamy.

I mean, this is a difficult situation because depending on you know, who you're supporting or who you're looking at, there's a couple of different ways you could say this would go, right? I think there's -- I think the argument that Trump's supporters are very devout and passionate and will show up, no matter the conditions, I think that theory holds a lot of water.But you also have to consider the fact that the coalition they've been trying to build over the past few months in Iowa includes a lot of first-time caucusgoers. They really want these folks to turn out maybe who haven't participated in caucuses in the past but support Donald Trump. And I would say that is one of those populations that is most at risk of seeing the health -- you know, the weather conditions on Monday and deciding to stay home if they've never caucused before. So, you can come at it from a couple of different angles. Certainly, with the polling lead that we've seen Trump have, I think, you know, they certainly have a little bit of that margin to lose. But you know, you also worry if you're Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis about making sure you know, recently converted voters or folks who are maybe not super enthusiastic or maybe you weren't their first choice, maybe decide to stay home as well.

And that's why a lot of those folks have -- you know, flocked to either DeSantis or you know, more recently in the last couple of months, Nikki Haley, who has sort of touted a similar message. You know, wanting to leave behind what she calls the chaos that Trump leaves in his wake and, you know, wanting to put up a more -- you know, a more sure-footed candidate against Joe Biden.But the polling has indicated that as far as in Iowa, the polling leads and the leads that he has among just about every demographic group shows that Iowans still want Trump as the candidate, at least a majority of them do. They aren't incredibly concerned about his ongoing legal battles. If anything, we've seen as he appears in court more, his numbers in our Iowa poll in the last few months have gone up.

They need to break out into a clear second, right?It's going to be tough if both of them end up hovering around the high teens or the -- you know, the early 20s, just to sort of based on what we've seen on polling. If neither of them is able to break out into a clear stack in and sort of come into these next few states as the leading alternative, I think it is difficult to see a clear path forward. Now, if Nikki Haley is able to capitalize on this surge and emerge to the second, or if you know DeSantis after all, his investment is able to break out and get into a clear second, you can maybe see how they could capitalize on that going forward.

I believe it raised Nikki Haley's support by one percent. And that was about it. So, I think a lot of those folks are -- you know, who are supporting Christie are pretty fervently anti-Trump voters. And so, I think they're going to be looking at the candidates and decide which of those sort of suits their needs best. Maybe they don't see a candidate not necessarily they like. Maybe some of them go toward Nikki Haley. It's difficult to say.

Right now, we're still focused on a lot of the snow that's still ongoing across the Midwest and the northeastern portion of the country. So, places like Chicago, Saginaw, Michigan, Buffalo, all looking at snow right now. You've got some heavy rain across Boston, as well as Providence, Rhode Island.But this isn't the only area that's looking at that snow. As we widen this out, you'll see we also have some snow showers beginning across portions of Kansas, Nebraska, and even Denver. The airport reporting snow right now because you've got multiple systems across the U.S. And that's why you have such a wide swath here of so many winter weather alerts. But it's not just for snow and ice. It's also the incredibly cold air that's going to be sliding in behind some of these systems. Look at all of these areas, you're talking over 80 million people under some type of windchill alert. Some of these areas could see those windchills that 40 to 50 degrees below zero. And for some of those areas, it's lasting for multiple days. Here's a look, just to show you how widespread this cold air is really going to be. Yes, about a quarter of the country. The population in the lower 48 is going to have temperatures below zero. But even areas outside of that, you're looking at three-quarters of the population, 75 percent of the lower 48 population is going to have temperatures below freezing. So, even places like Florida, Georgia, other states, far south are still going to be very cold for this time of year. Looking at these temperatures, it's already starting to set in Bismarck. The temperature is minus 22 right now, feels like minus 50. Very balmy there. Des Moines right now, the temperature itself is four. It feels like 16. But the concern for Des Moines and really the rest of Iowa becomes Monday for the caucuses. This is a look at the Monday evening temperatures, not the wind chill, the temperatures. Des Moines looking at minus 10. Then you factor in the wind gusts that are around that, that feels like the temperature drops to minus 28 in Des Moines. And really for the rest of the state, you're talking the vast majority of them with those wind chills of minus 20 to minus 30 degrees throughout the evening as all of those folks are getting together for the caucuses.

Because it is Iran that is behind financing the Houthis. They're not calling the shots with every attack, but they're certainly enabling this. It's Iran behind the Hezbollah militias in Lebanon, the attacks in Syria, and the ones coming out of Iraq. And my guess is as the campaign goes forward, you're going to hear them on the question of what's he doing to go deal with the source. And of course, an attack on Iran would by its nature be escalatory. And the president wants to do everything he can to avoid that.",

The two parties that were considered friendlier to China, they have both conceded this presidential election, which now paves the way really any minute now for the Democratic Progressive Party, the DPP, which is the party that has held power here in Taiwan for the last eight years under Tsai Ing-wen, and now has a new presidential candidate Lai Ching-te, paving the way for him to, at any moment, declare victory in this presidential race.Which means it would be an unprecedented third consecutive presidential term for the Democratic Progressive Party, and perhaps, unprecedented anger from the other side of the Taiwan Strait from Beijing, because they have essentially, spent the last several months and years, vilifying both the presidential and vice-presidential candidate. The V.P. candidate was the former U.S. envoy. She is actually sanctioned twice by China, and is forbidden from even traveling to mainland China. She is the presumptive vice president if, in fact, the Democratic Progressive Party confirms that they have won this election, which is expected to happen any moment now. And the presidential -- the presumptive president-elect, also has been basically vilified by Beijing. So, essentially, what this means is that at the highest levels, there will continue to be absolutely no dialogue at Beijing's choice. Beijing has chosen to essentially cut off dialogue with this ruling party. And now, that it seems clear that in just any minute now, the ruling party will likely declare victory in the presidential race. And the excitement is so intense back there, the crowd. We had to step all the way over this way just to be able to get a signal out of here, because the crowd is growing very quickly. But this is going to be something that Beijing is going to definitely respond to. Intelligence officials that we've been speaking with here in the Taiwanese capital, say they do not expect an immediate response from Beijing, frankly, because the weather right now on the Taiwan Strait is -- it's winter, and it's quite choppy, it's very difficult weather to pull off those kind of massive military drills like what they did, when Nancy Pelosi visited this self-governing democracy last year. However, in May, the weather is much better, and that's when this new president will be inaugurated. So, we have to keep very close eye on what's happening in this region. A really potential flashpoint here. But we have to see how Beijing responds to all of this.",

Obviously, fans get disgruntled quickly if that person doesn't emulate the success of the previous coach, their legendary star like the Bear Bryant at Alabama years ago. It was very tough to replace him, until they found Nick Saban. There were a couple others that were very good, but it takes a while.And so, it is going to be very interesting to see especially with DeBoer, if he can recruit the young players, the high school players the way that Nick Saban was so successful, like a magnet, bringing them to Alabama. And especially now for the college game with name, image, and likeness, with the transfer portal, all the upheaval, there is conference realignment. It is a very, very chaotic time in college football. And DeBoer is going to have to navigate that. Obviously, an excellent coach, took Washington that to the national championship game on Monday. He is an excellent coach. But he's going to have to navigate all that while dealing with the expectations and the pressure that is going to come upon him, because he is Nick Saban's replacement.",

I don't think many people thought it would become so soon, but the terrible season the Patriots had four and 13, I think that, of course necessitated or hurried along the process to have Mayo replace Belichick.And he is the first black head coach that the Patriots have ever had. And he is a former player, a former team captain, and just it -- he very much emulates and represents what the Patriots are today.
