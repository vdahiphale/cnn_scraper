Iowa Republican voters tend to be more conservative and more evangelical and they have, so far, very clearly broken to Trump, Trump, Trump.

But this tactic also comes with potential risks to the hostages. CNN's Nic Robertson has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over):  The tunnels themselves are big -- big enough for fighters and their weapons seen here in this Hamas propaganda video, which was also posted by the Israel Defense Force. They are reinforced with concrete, too. Two years ago, Hamas claimed to have built 500 kilometers -- more than 300 miles of them. The tunnels are spread all over Gaza. This map, over two years old.

ROBERTSON (on camera):  The idea of flooding the tunnels using the abundant seawater that's along the many miles of Gaza's Mediterranean shore is apparently a creative idea not just to destroy Hamas and quite literally flush them out, but also to reach the parts of tunnels that might never be discovered from above ground. Now, it's not without its risks. There could be hostages in those tunnels. There are very few details about how precisely the water is getting into the tunnels, how much water, and how fast it's going in, or what you do if you suddenly discover you're flooding hostages, other than the IDF say they have begun carefully testing it and that this method is being trialed on a limited, limited basis.",

This elderly hostage helped by her daughter. YOCHEVED LIFSHITZ, FORMER HOSTAGE (through translator):  We began walking inside the tunnels with the wet ground. It was moist all the time. There are huge networks of tunnels underneath. It looks like a spiderweb. ROBERTSON (voice-over):  The IDF says it will proceed cautiously to make sure they are not flooding tunnels where the hostages are being held. ROBERTSON (on camera):  It's significant that more than six weeks into the ground campaign this full scale of the tunnel problem is only now really becoming apparent. Even controlling the streets above is not enough to locate all the tunnels. So flooding seems to be the new best option to really prove the extent of the invisible subterranean network, both destroying Hamas hiding there and denying it their use. Of course, a key caveat in success here is if you can't find a tunnel and it's not connected to a system you're already flooding, how effective can you be about flooding it and knowing that you're hitting -- destroying the whole of the tunnel network?
