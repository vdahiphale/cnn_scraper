The charges remain the same, four counts related to Trump's alleged attempts to stay in power after losing in 2020 but now prosecutors have narrowed the focus of their case to comply with last month's controversial ruling by the Supreme Court, which granted presidential immunity for all official acts while in office.Trump allegedly tried to interfere with the certification of the 2020 Electoral College results on January 6. That's when a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. And at 36 pages, the new indictments are nine pages fewer than the original, and among the many changes, removing all references to official acts and the 45th president.

      "sentences": "The Justice Department has rewritten the charges against Donald Trump related to the 2020 election, focusing around his role as a candidate as he tried to spread lies of election fraud. So, this is the case that's existed for a year in federal court in Washington, DC, and was on hold as the Supreme Court looked at questions of presidential immunity.They said that Trump couldn't be prosecuted or taken to trial on things he was doing while he was president, officially after the election, while he was still serving, even on January 6. And so the Justice Department has now responded by going to the federal grand jury in Washington and cutting down the charges against him. They have cut out things like what Donald Trump was saying to the Justice Department and officials there about spreading allegations of election fraud across the country, and instead they are making the focus be about Donald Trump and what he was told by his campaign and what he was telling private advisers of his to do to try and spread this idea of election fraud, especially in battleground states, and to block Congress from certifying his loss of the election. One of the things though, that is very important going forward, in the coming days, we're going to see a lot of discussion about this is the role of Mike Pence as the vice president. Pence is still in this charging document against Donald Trump, the rewritten pared down version, and Pence is very likely to be a witness both in the coming weeks, in upcoming proceedings that have yet to be scheduled, and then if the Justice Department is allowed to bring him in as a trial witness before a jury, that's because the Justice Department now says Mike Pence was not always just in the executive branch. Under the Constitution, he was working for the Congress, or he was presiding over Congress as President of the Senate on January 6, and that's how Trump was trying to pressure him to block the election result.

All of the references, there were over 30 references, John, to the Department of Justice, those have all been removed of the unindicted co-conspirators.

I've also been informed by my attorneys that you're not even allowed to bring cases literally right before an election a director solved a democracy.

We know that pretrial hearings are likely to be scheduled forthwith, and this judge is going to have to make this determination, and ultimately, John, this case is probably headed back to the Supreme Court, because no matter what this judge determines with respect to actions that are private versus official, we can expect and count on Donald Trump's team appealing the decision by the trial judge and taking this case all the way back to the Supreme Court.",

You can watch that here on CNN, Thursday, 9:00 p.m. Eastern. It's happening as the Harris campaign travels through the state of Georgia. 52-year old Israeli Bedouin hostage has been rescued alive from the tunnels beneath Gaza. Farhan Al-Qadi is in stable medical condition after being held for nearly a year. His brother says he was shot in the leg when he was kidnapped October 7. Appears that wound was poorly treated and was operated on without anesthesia. Al-Qadi spoke with Benjamin Netanyahu by phone thanking him for getting him home, reminding the Israeli prime minister that other hostages still waiting. CNN's Nic Robinson has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): The moments after his rescue, the first to be recovered live from a tunnel, 52 year old Qaid Farhan Al-Qadi, a Muslim Bedouin Israeli, surrounded by Israeli Special Forces quickly rushed to a helicopter much thinner than he was when Hamas snatched him as he guarded a packing facility in a kibbutz near Gaza, almost 11 months ago. His family's agonizing weight almost over, rushing through the hospital to greet his helicopter. Soldiers and medics carefully stretching him towards doctors and the hospital and this family. The look on both brothers faces saying it all the rescued hostage, gaunt but smiling, his elder brother, beaming ear to ear. KHATEM AL-QADI, BROTHER OF FARHAN AL-QADI (through translator): I can't explain these feelings. It's like being born again. God bless and we say thank you to everyone. ROBERTSON (voice-over): The IDF describing the troops involved in his rescue as daring and courageous, saying Al-Qadi was found alone without his captors. REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAELI MILITARY SPOKESPERSON: We cannot go into many details of this special operation, but I can share that Israeli commandos rescued Qaid Farhan Al-Qadi from an underground tunnel, following accurate intelligence. ROBERTSON (voice-over): At the hospital, the first readout from doctors, Al-Qadi is doing well. PROF. SHLOMI CODISH, CEO, SOROKA MEDICAL CENTER: He appears to be in general good condition, but will require another day or two of medical tests to make sure he is still OK.

They are negotiating with Hamas through the Egyptians, Qataris and the United States for a deal, but I must comment that they are negotiating a bad deal, because the deal that's on the table is for a six-week ceasefire, during which time 32 hostages would come home. In other words, another 76 would be left in Gaza for further negotiations. This is not the way to go. We need a deal that's going to end this war in three weeks, a maximum of three weeks, and bring all the hostages home. And that's the deal that they need to be negotiating now. And my message is to the United States government, to the Qataris and the Egyptians to put that deal forward, because I know that Hamas will agree to it. I know that the people of Israel will agree to it. We only have our prime minister who probably won't agree to it. We need to pressure him to agree to it.",

I mean, it's quite staggering.So Netanyahu is being really honest when he talks about every effort being made to bring those hostages home, then that would mean every effort is being made by Israel to get that ceasefire.

Telegram says Durov has nothing to hide, but Russia's Foreign Minister now insinuating that the arrest may be politically motivated, even though France's President denied politics were involved.
