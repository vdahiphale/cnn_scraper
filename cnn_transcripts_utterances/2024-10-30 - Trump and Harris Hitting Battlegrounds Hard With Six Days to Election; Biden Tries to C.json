But her message was almost immediately complicated by President Biden, who is now trying to clean up after making this remark during a virtual get out the vote event yesterday.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Well, let me tell you something. I don't know the Puerto Rican that I know or Puerto Rico where I'm in my home state of Delaware. They're good, decent, honorable people.

Certainly, there are the political imperatives, Harris is trying to put some distance between herself and the current administration. But at the end of the day, so many Democrats are wary of President Biden because they think he's a liability because he does have a tendency to say these things on the campaign trail that can be misconstrued, that can be turned by Republicans into an attack line on Vice President Harris. And that is exactly what's taking place today.And certainly I don't think it's unreasonable. The explanation that President Biden has put out that he was talking about that single comedian, but that doesn't mean that his words aren't damaging. And certainly because they're on video, they speak for themselves in a way. Now, Vice President Harris was out this morning. She's on her way to a battleground state swing, as we're seeing there. And she was asked to clarify and asked to respond to what Biden said. Take a listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I think that, first of all, he clarified his comments. But let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for. As you heard in my speech last night and continuously throughout my career, I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

If he is elected on day one, Donald Trump will walk into that office with an enemies list. When I am elected, I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities about what I will get done for you, the American people. And at the top of my list is bringing down your cost of living. That will be my focus every single day as president. I will give a middle class tax cut to over 100 million Americans, enact the first ever federal ban on price gouging on groceries, and fight to make sure that hard working Americans can actually afford a place to live. And if you are caring for an elderly parent, my plan will cover the cost of home care under Medicare so that seniors can get the help and care they need to stay in their own homes. And my plan will lower the cost of child care, cut taxes for small businesses, and lower healthcare costs, because I believe healthcare should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.",

They have already been getting a lot of mileage out of that gaffe from President Biden. Donald Trump also addressing those remarks on Truth Social yesterday, writing, quotes, Vice President Harris has spent all week comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history. Now, on top of everything, Joe Biden calls supporters garbage. You can't lead America if you don't love the American people.And, yes, I expect him to continue to harp on that message when he takes the stage later today in North Carolina. We're just about an hour down the road from where Vice President Harris is holding her event. So, these two campaigns are colliding on this critical battleground state where about 3.4 million ballots have already been cast, but more than 40 percent of the number of registered people here. So, clearly, a lot of people are already taking advantage of voting early here. And you see this sign behind me that says vote early, Donald Trump encouraging his supporters to take advantage of those methods of early voting even as he continues to cast doubt in the safety and security of these elections. Yesterday in Pennsylvania, he continued to push this false narrative that there is something untoward already happening in Pennsylvania, because some election officials in one county discovered some ballot, or excuse me, some voter registration forms that had some discrepancies on them. So, you can see, even as he is continuing to push those conspiracies, he wants his voters to get out there and vote. He calls it swamping the vote, and that is his message here in North Carolina with just five days to go before Election Day.",

You have to remember last week, he talked about former Representative Gabby Giffords in the past tense. She's still very much alive. He went to New Hampshire, said that they need to lock Donald Trump up, then tried to clarify. Again, we're getting this pattern, right, where he says something and tries to clarify.And then last night, you know, she had this big speech, 75,000 people, got a ton of earned media because she made it about January 6th. She did it on The Ellipse. It was very well received by the crowd. She also got a ton of coverage and basically was delivering her stump speech with a little January 6th done in, and now we're here talking about this. The truth of the matter is that Joe Biden now is no longer able to deliver a consistently coherent message at his age, the reason he's not the nominee and she is, and she knows that. But, you know, Joe Biden knows that his legacy is wrapped up in her winning and he wants to get on the trail. He wants to help her. And that's where this tension is coming in.",

I mean, ahead of Trump's rally in Allentown, a lot of the narrative wasn't about what Donald Trump's closing messages are really about Donald Trump. It was about the anger and outrage around this and if it would cost him votes with Puerto Ricans and other Latinos, and just seeing, you know, just the way it happened last night. You know, I was at the rally in Allentown and saw when Senator Marco Rubio came on stage and he was able to amp up the crowd by saying this just in, you know, Biden called us garbage. And that is something we're going to be hearing Republicans talking about nonstop from here to Election Day. And I think that's what's also really important to keep in mind.

You know, we see that, yes, she has a lead with Latino voters, but it's still in many polls is short of what Biden's performance was in the exit polls in 2020 and that of Democratic nominees and in recent election cycles.So, I think there's still this concern about her shoring up that support, especially in a place like Nevada, where she will be tomorrow. So, I think just seeing that rally that she has planned tomorrow, you know, it's the combination of two things, you know, huge Puerto Rican star, Jennifer Lopez, and then as well as Mexican rock band Mana, so clearly trying to hit at these two groups within the Latino community and hopes of shoring up that support that right now is not guaranteed.",

And that's because all of those states are within the margin of error, you can also hit multiple of them in one day. And so you are seeing the campaigns really double down in these states, most in Georgia today. She's obviously in North Carolina.

There's another poll that came out a couple days ago that show that she's bounced back from some of the attrition we saw with black men, and that's because she's not taking these votes for granted.So, I think at the end of the day, when exit polls are done for this race, we're going to see that she was able to have much more of the black community behind her side, not just because she's a black candidate, as she said, but because she actually has a platform that's speaking to that community as well.",
