But, boy, John and Kate, that's an extremely delicate balancing act. BERMAN: To say the least. All right, Jim Sciutto, who is in Northern Israel near the Lebanese border. I want to go now to Beirut. That's where our Ben Wedeman is. And Ben, you've been monitoring this speech from the Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, tell us what he has said.",

      "sentences": "Well, it ended about half an hour ago. And basically said, all possibilities are open as far as the situation on the border between Lebanon and Israel. He described Hamas's attacks on Israel on the 7th of October, as an earthquake, a political military psychological earthquake. He said that, for instance, that what may be going on the border between Lebanon and Israel in terms of cross border fire, cross border fire between Israel and Hezbollah is, in his words, modest, but he said that it's resulted in the evacuation of 43 Israeli communities along the border, and essentially tying down a third of the Israeli army in the north.But by and large, he didn't come out and actually say any concrete steps that Hezbollah is going to take going forward. In fact, what was interesting is that just when his speech began, we heard a huge volley of celebratory gunfire here in Beirut, massive. When it ended, it was somewhat more muted, which seems to indicate that perhaps those who anticipated a much more fiery speech, one that actually laid out a plan might have been disappointed. One Hezbollah supporter I've been in contact with basically said, the message to Israel is, we are ready if you want war. It doesn't appear, however, that this speech is going to really change the situation dramatically at this point. But certainly, what we saw yesterday was Hezbollah claiming 19 individual strikes on Israeli targets on the other side of the border. And perhaps we may be able to -- we may be seen in the coming days, a continuation of that heightened level of cross border fire. But it does appear that for the time being Hezbollah is going to maintain what's known as the rules of engagement, an unwritten understanding between Israel and Hezbollah that both sides can strike targets along the border, but not too deep into the other's territory. Now, he also did say that he held the United States responsible because of its military, diplomatic, political support for Israel, in its war in Gaza. But regarding the U.S. two carrier strikes in the eastern Mediterranean, he said, they don't scare us, and they've never scared us.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, as you said Israeli forces say that they have been circled Gaza City. But even as they have done that, we are still hearing active fighting north of Gaza City. Clearly, Israeli forces are still battling Hamas militants right behind me in the northeastern most city of Beit Hanoun.And what we have also seen is that as Israeli forces have said, they have broken down Hamas's northern defensive lines. But last night was very intense operation, military operation being carried out by Israel on the ground on -- by sea as well as from the air in that city of Beit Hanoun. Today, the fighting is markedly calmer, but we are still hearing some bursts of artillery fire as well as small arms fire in the distance. But what is clear is that the Israeli military is not looking for a ceasefire, not looking for a pause in its operations at the moment. And the Israeli Prime Minister moments ago made that very clear after his meeting with the Secretary of State Tony Blinken saying that even as Blinken was pressing him for some kind of a temporary pause to allow for humanitarian aid, to allow for more time for these mediations over the release of hostages, the Israeli Prime Minister's effectively saying the only scenario in which he would agree to some kind of a cessation of hostilities is if indeed, some of those hostages are released from Gaza. And so in the meantime, until and if that even could happen, Israeli forces very clearly still pursuing their objective. They are destroying Hamas tunnels as they discover them. They're finding weapons caches of Hamas, destroying those as well. And they say that they will continue to pursue their objectives by any means necessary. Kate?",

Here's the latest read on the labor market. 150,000 jobs were added last month in October that's lower than September's stronger than expected total and also slightly lower than what economists were expecting this time around. Let's get a read on this. Joining us right now for more is the Acting Secretary of Labor, Julie Su. Secretary, thank you so much for coming in. What's your take on this job report? Is the U.S. economy out of the woods yet in your view?JULIE A. SU, ACTING SECRETARY OF LABOR: This is a very solid jobs report, 150,000 jobs last month brings the total since President Biden came into office to 14 million. The three month average is 204,000. And recall that over a year ago, President Biden said that in light of the really what was then your red hot jobs numbers, it was 500,000 or so at the time, that once we got to the point where it was about 150,000, it would signal a transition to steady, stable recovery with sustainable growth in jobs.

And that those numbers coincided with a period of the strike. But what we saw was that the United Auto Workers got historic gains at the bargaining table. And between them and the big three, wages are increasing in ways that were never before seen other benefits. And, you know, the security that we want for every single worker to have, that was something else that the UAW won.And together, they are charting a path for the future of this industry, which means that during and after transition, the auto industry will still be built by good union auto workers.",
