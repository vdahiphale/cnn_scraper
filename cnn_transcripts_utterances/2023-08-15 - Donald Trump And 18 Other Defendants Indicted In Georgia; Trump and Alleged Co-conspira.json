I'm Kaitlan Collins.The indictment 98 pages and what it contains is stunning. 45th President of the United States indicted on state charges stemming from his and others efforts to overturn Joe Biden's election win in the state of Georgia. Prosecutors alleging tonight that Trump and others joined in a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the 2020 election. 18 other defendants are named in this indictment, including Trump Attorney Rudy Giuliani, Mark Meadows, John Eastman, Kenneth Chesebro, Jeffrey Clark, and Jenna Ellis just to name a few. All 19 are facing racketeering charges, and prosecutors allege that they participated in a criminal enterprise with 30 unindicted coconspirators. Let's begin tonight's coverage with CNN's Paula Reid who is outside the courthouse there in Atlanta. I mean, Paula Reid through these 98 pages, but what's remarkable is that we just heard from the district attorney Fani Willis, and she was saying that she is going to try all of these 19 defendants together, she says.",

And Kaitlan, as we know, the calendar is getting quite crowded with all of the possible trials, both criminal and civil that the former president is facing. Now, looking at this indictment as sort of about 20 pages in, she lays out her theory of the case and highlights the key areas that she then goes into really specific detail on, including the efforts to install fake electors to put forth fake slates of electors to undermine the electoral college process, the harassment of election worker Ruby Freeman, also alleged efforts to solicit the Justice Department. We know the former president was leaning on his own Justice Department to try to interfere here in Georgia. And she also points to the pressure campaign faced by former Vice President Mike Pence. She also talks about breaching voting equipment, and then filing false statements. So, at a high level, that's how she lays out her case. And Kaitlan, one of the things that really struck out to me is she doesn't just include details from Georgia, she also includes details from Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. So, this is a case that, yes, it's being brought in Georgia, but the conspiracy that she is laying out, the story that she is telling stretches across the United States.",

It's pretty startling. And when you think about Georgia, for Trump, all the -- I mean, this is -- this is a waterloo place for him. You know, he lost in 2020, failed to house Brian Kemp the governor, his handpicked candidate for the Senate lost. And now he's indicted in this sprawling indictment. And so, you think about the role that the state of Georgia may play in his, you know, ultimate downfall or resurgence if he somehow beats all this. And I'll just say one final issue. This case, the January 6 case, the documents case, I don't see how the American people cannot know the outcomes of these things before they vote. I recognize you can't get all these things before the primary.

I want to bring in right now David Schoen, who is the lead counsel for then President Trump in his second impeachment trial. David, it's good to see you on another, frankly, well, history continues. And it continues to be in the making when it comes to Donald Trump. By my tabulation, and it's a rough one, it's after midnight, we're talking nearly a hundred different charges in total for this former president. Here alone 13, he's been accused of participating in a multi-state criminal enterprise. This is in addition to the other cases against him, how is he supposed to or is he going to defend himself? DAVID SCHOEN, LEAD COUNSEL FOR DONALD TRUMP 'S SECOND IMPEACHMENT TRIAL: Well, it certainly has to break down each case, you know, on its own merits. I have to say, I know that you and Kaitlan are scrupulously fair at all times. So, I was disappointed to not hear any member of the panel talk about the presumption of innocence. We're talking about this indictment as if, you know, everything is a fact in here. But beyond all that, let me just raise a couple other issues too, for you, if I may. I don't think it's going to be possible to try them all together. Your panel, I think, accurately discussed the logistical problems, the Young Thug case, you know, as months and months of jury selection, we learned a lesson in organized crime cases in New Jersey about the problems with these mass indictments. But I also think as a practical matter, former President Trump is going to move to remove this case to federal court. This case is much different from the New York case. I think this case clearly fits within the statute 28 USC 1442a, as an act performed under color of office. The Eleventh Circuit construes that pretty broadly, it doesn't require a causal connection.

How do you defend against when it's on tape? SCHOEN: It's a great question, tapes are very powerful. I think in this case, though, the clear answer is especially playing to a juror who feels this is piling on or politically motivated, you play the rest of the tape, and the rest of the tape, you know, this is the snippet that's always played. But the rest of the tape reasonably could be construed by a listener as saying, he President Trump and others on the tape. You know, there were these lawyers on the tape to believe that they were in several kinds of irregularities in the election, that votes were stolen, whatever it is they believed or said on the tape. And that, therefore, all we need to come up with is the difference of this amount of votes. Even though we on that tape, the folks on the tape, believed that there were many more votes that were stolen or lost or improperly cast, or whatever the theory is.

And by the way, and we have to point out very clear in the RICO law, they're going to have to prove more than a conspiracy. But anyway, so you have them part of the indictment, I think you're going to see people flipping left and right, probably in this case, over to the other side of the case, because they don't want to be defendants in the case if that's possible. And then therefore, that's the other twist on it. That's going to affect what they say the advice was that they gave. Remember, he was heavily going to be rely on the fact that several of these lawyers were on the call, people whose advice he got before the call. And during the call were actually on the call, and you can hear them interrupting. You can hear him asking for their advice during the call.

But certainly, you know, if you notice, I think, act seven involves acall to top officials in Arizona, right, again, trying to address the election results there. At eight, it has to do with a meeting that happened in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania with Pennsylvania -- Pennsylvania legislators. Act 50 involves a call to Wisconsin's senior officials in Wisconsin state. And then, of course, act number seven is -- happened here in Washington, where they were pressuring top officials at the Justice Department to say that there was fraud, and then let us take care of it. Right? And she said that, basically, the reason why she was using all of these -- these acts that did not happen in her jurisdiction was because they were all in the furtherance of trying to overturn the Georgia election results. And so that explains it. And I think that that's a very -- it's a very interesting and, certainly, expansive way for her to approach this. Because a lot of us, I think, before we saw this document, were anticipating that this is going to be a lot more limited, right? That they were going to, like, just home in and drill down on everything that happened in Georgia, including of course, the fake electors, and the effort to get into those Coffee County election machines.
