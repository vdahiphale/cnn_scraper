But so far, there's been no breakthrough in talks in Cairo aimed at reaching a deal to pause the fighting and free the remaining hostages in Gaza. That's according to a U.S. official who says the negotiations will press on.CIA director Bill Burns traveled to Cairo for those talks. He discussed the situation in Gaza with Egypt's president who also had met with Qatar's Prime Minister. The hostage talks have failed to bridge gaps between the parties, with one key issue being a disagreement over the ratio of Palestinian prisoners to hostages that would be released as part of a deal. Towards commerce international concern and opposition grows over Israel's expected ground offensive on the southern Gaza City of Rafah. The U.N. aid chief says such an operation could lead to a slaughter or the U.N. Secretary General says it would have devastating consequences. Meantime Israeli officials say they've obtained CCTV footage showing Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar inside a tunnel below the southern Gaza City of Khan Younis. He was there with his wife, child and another unidentified man. The IDF says the video was recorded October 10. CNN cannot verify the video shows Sinwar and when it was actually recorded.

The Israeli team is on their way home. We understand from U.S. officials that it's been productive. It's been serious, but some gaps do remain.In particular, one of those gaps is the ratio between the hostage release and Israeli prisoners of Hamas prisoners, how many Hamas prisoners should be released, that still remains an issue. And Hamas had indicated if the tools are gone? Well, they send a delegation over to Cairo fairly quickly. The early indications from them from Hamas is at the moment that they aren't going to be sending a negotiating team to Cairo. In Rafah, however, the population there 1.4 million, some of them beginning to leave the area because they're concerned about this possible IDF ground offensive coming. The IDF has not set a date for that yet. There's growing international opposition from that the Secretary General of the United Nations said there would be devastating consequences. The Italian Foreign Minister raised concerns, the German Foreign Minister raised concerns as well. And of course, President Biden has said it shouldn't go ahead without proper planning to avoid civilian casualties. The IDF in the meantime, however, has released a video showing Yahya Sinwar, the political chief of Hamas, what this tells us about where Sinwar is at the moment really isn't clear. But it's indicative of the fact that the IDF continues to gather information about where the leaders of Hamas are. And we heard as well from the Army Chief of Staff today saying that so far, they believe they've killed 10,000 members of Hamas, including commanders, but Herzi Halevi, the IDF Chief of Staff said that he was expecting this to be a long war a lot more to come.

So, I think that the army is being cautious right now in terms of submitting its plan and being very careful in order not to have massacres take place and in Rafah area.

So it was a very narrow margin here in the House and three Republicans crossed party lines to vote against these Articles of Impeachment for Americans that includes Tom McClintock of California, Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, and Ken Buck of Colorado. Those are the same three Republicans who voted against impeaching Americans last week.But we should note there was one key difference here tonight, and that was Steve Scalise, the House majority leader. He has been absent from the Capitol. He's been out battling cancer receiving treatments. But he was back tonight and I got a chance to sit down with him for an exclusive interview ahead of the Mayorkas vote where he talked about how important his vote was, and just how narrow the margins are in the House right now. But he disputed the idea that the House is rushing through this vote ahead of a special election in New York tonight, where a key seat is up for grabs. Now in terms of Mayorkas impeachment, it's going to head to the Senate. But we're being told it's dead on arrival in the Senate with Senate Republicans and Democrats collectively saying that they just don't see the support and the appetite in the upper chamber to impeach Mayorkas. Republicans have accused him of mishandling the situation at the southern border and the flow of migrants that have crossed the southern border but some Republicans saying that that is a policy dispute and it does not rise to the level of impeachment. So the Senate has some options. They can vote to just entirely dismiss the trial. Or they could have a trial and go through with the process. But either way, very clear that even though Alejandro Mayorkas was impeached in the House, he is not going to be convicted in the Senate. Melanie Zanona, Capitol Hill, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Look, Joe Biden's problems in polling are real. They are sustained. And they are not erased by a special election in New York.But I take two big things out of this. The first is that Democrats keep winning races in suburban areas in the Trump era. Despite all the unease about the party's performance, in some ways, this was an especially difficult district for them to win because immigration and crime are so hot in the New York Metro, and concern about abortion being banned is lessened because of the extent of democratic dominance of the state. And yet they won. They want a special election tonight more even more easily outside of Philadelphia that ensure they continue to control upstate health in Pennsylvania, who was what was the state legislative rush of elections last year in Virginia, and there was constant state Supreme Court elections and the key swing state elections in 2022. The Trump era, Republican Party has a problem in suburbs, especially white collar suburbs. And the other big thing was in that sound bite, I mean, you can begin to see how Democrats including Biden, may be moving toward running against a do nothing Congress, Harry Truman in 1948. A Congress that because it is in thrall to Trump is more interested in scoring political points and solving problems was he kind of ran as a Bill Clinton era Democrat, who was talking about bipartisan solutions to problems including immigration.",

Despite the enormous and obvious failings of Joe Biden, we just lost another winnable Republican House seat because voters overwhelmingly reject Donald Trump. And this is a problem for the Republicans. There's this disconnectbetween the popularity for the former president, and which doesn't seem to translate to these local races. And what we saw back in 2022, of the midterms, when all those Trump endorse candidates fell one after the other. That's when the Republican Party became very critical of Donald Trump.

The best estimate is at 93 million separate human beings have come out to vote against the Trump era Republican Party at some point in the last three elections, and that is a big number. The dynamic that you saw again, in this district where Biden as Tom Suozzi himself said was underwater is as we saw in 2022, there were a significant and unusually large number of voters who said they disapproved of Biden, and maybe were unhappy about the economy, maybe weren't happy about the border and still voted for Democrats anyway, because they view the Republican alternative as too extreme. That is the pathway to a second term if there is one for Biden, and we saw that dynamic continuing to function tonight as it did in '23 and certainly as it didn't '22.",

She says her daughter-in-law should never have had access to firearms in the first place. More details now from CNN's Ed Lavandera. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The mother-in- law of the 36-year-old woman who opened fire on the Lakewood Megachurch here in Houston says this event was a completely preventable horror. Police say 36-year-old, Genesee Moreno showed up here on Sunday, opened fire, and that's where two off-duty officers shot and killed her just after she unleashed a barrage of gunfire inside the church. The mother-in-law of Genesee Moreno, details an extensive list of mental health issues and efforts that the family underwent for several years trying to get her help. In a Facebook post, the mother-in-law says that Moreno suffered from a form of schizophrenia that caused her to be violent. Investigators here have been saying that they also have an extensive history of mental health issues. But despite all of that, what frustrates the mother-in-law, according to her Facebook post, is that she was legally able to obtain the weapons used in all of this. The investigators also say that they had found anti-Semitic writings that belonged to Moreno, but the mother-in-law says that she believes -- the mother-in-law is Jewish, but she does not believe that that hate aspect of this is what is central and what caused this horror at the Lakewood Church in Houston. She believes that this is much more an issue with a Genesee Moreno's mental health issues that she struggled with for years. And also her son as far as we know, the seven-year-old son who was shot in the head remains in critical condition. Ed Lavandera, CNN -- Houston. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
