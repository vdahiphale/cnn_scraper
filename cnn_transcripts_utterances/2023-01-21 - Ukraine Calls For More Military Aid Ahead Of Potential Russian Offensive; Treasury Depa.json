      "sentences": "The White House announced on Friday that the U.S. will designate the Russian mercenary organization, the Wagner Group, as a transnational criminal organization and will impose additional sanctions next week against the group and its support network across the world.The administration also released newly-declassified images of Russian railcars traveling from Russia to North Korea and back in November in what the U.S. believes was the initial delivery of infantry rockets and missiles for use by the mercenary organization. Wagner for months has been fighting an absolutely punishing battle against the Ukrainians in an effort to take the town of Bakhmut. Now this matters because the war in Ukraine and the fight in Bakhmut in particular has increasingly become a grinding war of attrition that military and intelligence analysts say is likely to be decided by who is able to maintain enough ammunition to continue the fight. According to one senior western intelligence official who spoke to CNN, there are sometimes several thousands of rounds expended a day in Bakhmut alone, which is a staggering expenditure. The U.S. does not believe that the equipment is likely to change the overall battlefield dynamics in Ukraine at least not immediately, in part because Bakhmut is not seen by the west as strategically significant for either side. But the concern for the U.S. and the West is that this kind of weapons delivery from North Korea might continue. And again in a fight where access to ammunition is absolutely critical, not just for Russia but also for Ukraine, this is something that the U.S. and its allies are going to want to do everything they can to stop. The hope for the U.S. is that this terrorism designation and the coming sanctions will make it more difficult for Wagner to do business abroad. And it's important to remember that Wagner does operate internationally beyond Ukraine. They have operations across Africa as well as in Syria. So this designation does have the potential to impact Russian activities beyond the borders of Ukraine. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Last thing, Fredricka, morale. The Ukrainians are fighting for their land. They are fighting for their existence. And the Russians, they are not sure why they are fighting.

This is about the trust and faith in the U.S. Government. So the debt ceiling is the limit that on the borrowing essentially that the U.S. government can do to pay bills. So if we default on that debt limit, we default on our debt because we don't raise the limit, that means the governments that lend us money lose faith in the U.S. and that causes stock market volatility, it makes interest rates go up. We saw that actually back in 2011 when we had a showdown during the Obama administration. We got right up to the edge and then eventually that debt ceiling was raised. But even that created chaos in the markets. Now what does this mean for the average person? There are some think tanks who have done research on this and say that it could add $130,000 to the average carrier of a 30-year mortgage because rates would go up so much.

You know, all of our retirement income, you know, that's sitting in the stock market, that becomes much more vulnerable because essentially if the U.S. doesn't, you know, make good on its own payments of its debt, that means trust leaves the markets. And when trust leaves the markets, a volatility increases. You could see stock prices going up and down, up and down.You know, if you are somebody depending on that money for retirement, that's a huge deal. And you're going to see interest rates at a time when they are already having gone up, you know, quite a lot, have made debt more expensive, they people, they could go up more. They could be volatile. It would just be very, very difficult for folks to plan, you know, on a month to month basis, what's going on with your own finances.",

The Never Kevins, the idea that you know, you can now filibuster longer than you could in the past, we could see a lot of varying interests holding up that passage even within the Republican Party, let alone what the Republicans want to extract from the Democrats in order to say, yes, we are going to raise that debt ceiling.

Now, very few people can swing that. But get whatever you can as a safety net in case you do have credit card bills that start to go up or you do have a mortgage payment that starts to go up. Other than that, think about your retirement savings and when you're going to need that money. You know, if like me you are not going to need it for 15, 20 years maybe, I wouldn't worry so much about but what's happening in the market But if you need that money the next one, two, three years, I would think about moving that into, you know, more safety assets, maybe pulling some of it out.

We want to make sure we don't miss anything. DR. SILLS: It's always about the right people, the right plan, and the right equipment. We have almost 30 medical professionals and everyone has a job to do. DR. GUPTA: E.R. doctors, orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, paramedics, x-ray techs, and airway specialists like Dr. Justin Deaton. DR. JUSTIN DEATON, AIRWAY SPECIALIST: This is the bag that I carry. And it's got a number of things in here that we could use. The first thing is a portable video laryngoscope. We have a portable ultrasound machine that we can use. And we also have ability to perform surgical airways. I really have all the resources available here that I would have in an emergency room. DR. GUPTA: What's the biggest challenge of that scenario versus being in an emergency room? DR. DEATON: The biggest challenge is the external environment and the chaos of the situation. When you have a larger than average sized person that's laying flat on the ground and not able to be elevated to a certain level with extra equipment plus cameras and other people around. Those are really kind of (INAUDIBLE) -- the things that make it more difficult to manage. DR. GUPTA: How does everyone know you're the guy in charge? DR. DEATON: I wear a red hat on the sideline. And that signifies me as the emergency physician, the airway physician, so that even the other team knows when I come out what my role is. DR. GUPTA: Every game comes with new lessons.

GUPTA: And as the teams all warm up, there is one final crucial step. Every time I'm in the operating room, we do something known as a time- out. Everyone stops what they're doing, makes sure that everyone is on the same page. This is the same sort of thing that's happening here behind me. It's called a 60-minute meeting. It happens 60 minutes before every game, a chance for all the medical professionals to make sure that they know who each other are, to make sure that they know who's going to do what if there's some sort of crisis out on the field. DR. KEVIN KAPLAN, ORTHOPEDIC PHYSICIAN: All right. So let's start with introductions so that everybody is familiar with the medical staff that's here in the game. I'm Kevin Kaplan, head team physician, orthopedics with the Jaguars. DR. DEATON: Justin Deaton, airway management. DR. KAPLAN: So the most important thing, Justin is going to be on our 30 yard line. He's to our right. If a player goes down, obviously, he won't know if it's orthopedic or internal medicine. He'll step out onto the field. Our all call sign is an x. So if you need him to come out, he will come out with an X. All of the important equipment, airway, defibrillator, all the medications are all behind him with our paramedics on our sideline. If a player needs to get taken off of the field, the ambulance is going to be in the tunnel to your right. If you need anything at all, we'll be out there for you guys if you need us. Otherwise, hope we have a safe and healthy game. Good luck. DR. GUPTA: Keep in mind the medical team was able to get to Damar Hamlin within ten seconds, and speed really matters here. Every additional minute that someone in cardiac arrest goes without CPR, mortality goes up but up to 10 percent DR. SILLS: This is a process that's in place for every single game. And we train in the off-season and just like the players train and practice, we do as well. So I have tremendous confidence, but you always want to see a game with no injuries. You want everyone to frankly be bored on the medical side. That's a good game from my standpoint. DR. GUPTA: I hear you. Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN -- Jacksonville, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
