(END VIDEO CLIP) GOLODRYGA: But Trump and Republicans continue to label the prosecution by New York DA Alvin Bragg as a political persecution. Today, the Secret Service met with New York officials to discuss security measures for Trump's court appearance. CNN's Paula Reid is outside the criminal courthouse in lower Manhattan. So, Paula, what do we know about what will transpire on Tuesday? PAULA REID, CNN SENIOR LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, Bianna, on Tuesday, we expect that former President Trump will arrive here at court for his arraignment. There is an effort here to treat him just like any other defendant. So, he'll go through a variation on the usual process, which is expected to include fingerprinting, a mugshot, and an appearance before a judge. This is also when the charges are expected to be unsealed. Because right now, even the former president's attorneys don't know exactly what he has been charged with. And what we're told, he intends to fully participate and cooperate in the initial appearance in the arraignment. We're also told that following this court hearing, his lawyers intend to fight. They said that they are going to file a motion to dismiss, other motions possibly as well. Their goal is to kill this case before it ever sees trial.",

He is a key witness in their case. And look, he is a complicated person.He clearly has a personal grudge against the former president. He has been convicted of nine different felonies. But he argues that this case does not rely solely on him and that there were also documents that will support this case. But at this point, we don't know the charges or these alleged documents. But again, a key witness in a trial of this significance going out and talking about the case to the media is not going to sit well with prosecutors. By contrast, Attorney Robert Costello, who was of course the one defense team witness who went before the grand jury last night after this indictment, he declined to comment saying, look, I'm likely to be a witness in this case. I can't be out there talking about it.",

Now, look, based on what he appeared to be saying that the idea of stacking one crime into another, it's a relatively straightforward New York state statute that allows for the charging of a misdemeanor and possibly elevating that to a felony if that misdemeanor were used to aid in the commission of a crime.No one has seen what any misdemeanors or felonies being talked about in the context of the president might be out. So, you know I think it's a little premature to even be talking about that. Then, on the statute of limitations point that he's raised. If a defendant in New York is not present for an extended period of time, from the time of the commission of the offense, the statute of limitations is paused. So, I just -- you know, he's sort of confusing the public on matters that simply we do not know about. And frankly, I would urge as a former prosecutor, people to wait, see what everything says, and then start fighting the legal fights.

They have the barricades up, they have horses, they have thousands of officers that can devote to it.And so, it's straightforward in that respect, but it is anything but routine in two areas. One is the rhetoric around this. The statements that are being made to vilify the prosecutor and even to call into question the legal system really does affect the rule of law and the government's ability to maintain control. And then the other complicating factor. I've worked in that building. That is a very, very difficult area. It's tight. And there are a number of government offices they have. The City Hall is right there. The police department -- One Police Plaza is two blocks away. The federal courthouse. So, there's a lot to be concerned about in this particular incident.",

But for Donald Trump, it may be just one the opening bell of what may be a series of potential indictments over the course of this year from federal investigators, from the Georgia investigation, potentially even further charges in New York having to do with financial -- other financial matters. And so, what we saw in this initial reaction was virtually the entire Republican Party going to DEFCON five, and you know, preemptively declaring this invalid, a hit job coming, you know, a politically motivated witch hunt. They may have to do this three more times before anyone actually votes. And you do wonder, while there is a rallying around the flag effect for Trump in the polls of the Republican primary initially, ultimately, does the cumulative weight of all of this eventually wait even on Republican voters to say nothing of the swing voters who will decide the 2024 election?",

Elliot, let me get you to respond to what Joe Tacopina, the former president's attorney said on the Today Show this morning.And he was talking about this as a business filing, that that was misfiled as a legal expense, and sort of suggesting that there was nothing to see here because it was only filed internally within the company organization and that no third parties were involved. This didn't go to the IRS. This didn't go to any insurance companies, and he didn't try to file any expenses from this. If that can be proven, then can the former president be vindicated? WILLIAMS: You know, I think once again, he's attempting to litigate a case that has been -- that has gone to a grand jury that found some basis beyond a reasonable -- (INAUDIBLE) -- but probable cause to establish that that crimes were committed there. Now, I -- you -- I mean, I think what he's doing is attempting to minimize for the public the seriousness of, number one, the record-keeping violation. The law is clear that one an individual cannot -- or a business cannot misrepresent how it keeps its books as a means of evading tax or campaign finance laws or otherwise. And again, it simply makes sense to wait and see what the charges are, and then respond to them directly. But I think, you know, what he -- what he's attempting to do is say that well, you know, we were accused of breaking the law here but what we did really wasn't that serious, so it's not really breaking the law.
