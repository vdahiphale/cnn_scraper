They came down to heartbreaking penalty kicks, like you just saw. A game of inches at the end. This thing could have been completely different. Fans here, drinking, celebrating early in the morning. But I spoke to a pair of women, a couple minutes ago, who were actually college teammates with defender Emily Sonnett, who made her first start in this game on the biggest of stages. That she played great, she played phenomenal. And the whole women's team played incredible. Even though this is heartbreaking, to see them exit the world cup, so early, something we haven't seen ever from the U.S. women's side. I think a lot of fans were still really proud of the effort they put in. There were so many chances in front of the net for the U.S. women, and unfortunately, they just ran into an absolute brick wall in the Swedish goaltender, until the very end. And the penalty kicks are always a crapshoot, and you have them go beyond 5, into 6, and 7, and then some confusion around the very end of the game to have it in this way. I think a lot of people here were really just shocked, and then making a quick exit out the door. So, an unfortunate end here, but still, a really fun morning. We got here around 4:00 in the morning. The bar was already a little bit full. Some people drinking their breakfast, some people eating their breakfast. And the energy was really, really up. So, it was so entertaining.

They're out? That doesn't happen to this team. There was a lack of cohesion from the beginning. Certainly in those 3 group stage matches. They then got it together. I think it really must be said, today's performance was excellent. They easily could have scored. Even Alex Morgan, who seemed to have a tough tournament at times, she had a header that could have been in. Any other goalkeeper who was not playing as well as the Swedish goalkeeper was, would have probably not been able to get to it. So, there were other chances for the U.S. And the U.S. fully could have won this game, 2 or 3-0. Having said, that they didn't. They didn't score. The Swedish goalkeeper was there and was playing fantastically. And the U.S. kept firing a way. So this game was reminiscent, I think, of many U.S. national women's team's games. But the problem is, those 3 group stage games were not. And then they got themselves into the jam of playing Sweden, number 3 in the world, U.S. was number one, Germany's number 2. So now Sweden is the best team left in the tournament. As opposed to playing against South Africa, which is what they would have had if they had been able to win the group. So, a series of mistakes that led to this.",

This was their first World Cup. And that's tough. The veterans maybe didn't step up as much. Lindsay Brand certainly did. There were other moments that were great. But in general, they didn't mix well. The really good news for U.S. soccer fans is that the Olympics are only a year away. The Olympic tournament for the women's the real deal. The man, not so much. But the women, absolutely, in terms of the age restrictions that FIFA has. So, this will be a chance to come right back at the Olympics in Paris, less than a year from now, and prove themselves all over again. I'm sure they are just be chomping at the bit to get into that Olympic tournament, and probably with the new coach, and probably with certainly some new players.

That's why she has so many moves named after her.And I think what we're seeing here, she's 26 years old, should be 27 at the Paris Olympics. And, yes, I fully believe she will make it to the Paris Olympics and, be one of those stars of the games that we -- at least, going into the pre-game and the prelude to the Olympics. It's because of her continuing to push herself, with these absolutely majestic moves that no one else on Earth can do. And again, think about that, of all the gymnasts in the world, this woman, at this stage of her life and career, is still able to push the envelope, and do things she hasn't done before, and no one's done. It's truly remarkable what we're watching as, by the way, she's also the conscience of her sport. She, of course is a survivor of Larry Nassar and the horrors of sexual abuse, sexual assault, by the USA gymnastics team doctor. And she has spoken out for victims. So in many ways, just like the U.S. women's national soccer team, fighting 4th off of the field of play, so too has Simone Biles and distinguish herself in that matter.",

He called him, quote, deranged, as well as mentally ill. He also made an appeal to Congress, specifically Republicans on Capitol Hill to, quote, step up and do something in light of the recent indictments. Now, one key difference about his Saturday remarks is that he continued to talk about this for less than 24 hours after Jack Smith and the court filing Friday night had asked the judge to set limits on what Donald Trump could do with the evidence shared with the election produced. The filing had pointed to on of Donald Trump's Truth Social post, where he wrote, quote, if you go after me, I'm coming after you. Now, Victor and Amara, the judge ultimately ruled that Donald Trump's team has to respond to that proposal by Monday afternoon, despite the former president's team wanting to extend that through Thursday. One other thing I think is important to note in this, I think, Donald Trump's team wants to keep talking about the charges. They do think it benefits them politically from this, at least among his Republican primary voters. But it was very unclear going into tonight whether the former president would be swayed by these recent court filings from the special counsel's team, and would kind of shift his rhetoric.

They're continued to be paid while they're a prisoner.In King's case, he willingly deserted into North Korea when he was about to undergo some legal actions. So that is a different category. We've seen this before. And it is a tough call because certainly, you know, the United States wants to take care of all of its citizens but in this case this was a willing desertion by a soldier to go into a foreign country. There was no taking of him as a prisoner. He walked across the line. That is going to cause some interesting legal debates within the Pentagon and the State Department. But we'll see what happens. I personally don't believe he should be declared as a prisoner of war.",

      "sentences": "Victor and Amara, here's an unexpected consequence of this summer's historic heat wave. It's making life more expensive for drivers. Extreme heat is actually increasing the price of gasoline, which has surged to nine-month highs.Here's why. Refineries, much like humans, can't handle persistently sweltering temperatures. These are complex facilities that turn crude oil into gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel. And they start to break down in triple-digit heat. Some refineries have had to limit how much gasoline they're churning out, just when it's needed the most. Analysts tell me that this situation has contributed to the spike in gas prices. Another factor, Russia and Saudi Arabia, they're are holding back supply, driving up oil prices. AAA says the national average for gasoline has surged by roughly nearly 30 cents since early July. Now all of this shows how not even big oil, an industry that scientists blame in part for global warming -- not even big oil can escape the consequences of the climate crisis. Of course, it's consumers that are paying the price here. Even though gas prices are still well below the record highs of last year, they're clearly creeping higher, and that is threatening to undo some of the progress on the inflation front. But I'll leave you some cautiously optimistic news here. Experts are hopeful that the worst of this gas price spike is over. Veteran oil analyst Tom Kloza, he told me that gas prices are likely either at or near the peak. And they should cool off as the summer winds down. The one catch, if there's a major hurricane, perhaps one strengthened by record high ocean temperatures, there's a major hurricane that threatens the Gulf Coast and its hub of refineries. And that could cause even higher gas prices. It would also be yet another costly consequence of the climate crisis. Victor and Amara.",
