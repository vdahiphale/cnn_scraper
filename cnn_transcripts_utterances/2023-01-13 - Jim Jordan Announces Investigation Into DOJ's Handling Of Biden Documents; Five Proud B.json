      "sentences": "Well, the new House Judiciary chairman, Jim Jordan, announcing he's launching an investigation into the DOJ's actions related to President Biden's handling of classified documents. He's demanding the department turn over a variety of information, including all communications related to yesterday's appointment of special counsel.It's hard to believe this is what's happening one week ago. But at just about exactly this time, there was a complete chaos on the House floor. A lawmaker lunging at another lawmaker. And we still didn't know way back then because last year was a whole year -- last week -- a whole year -- didn't know if Kevin McCarthy would actually become speaker. What a difference a week makes. And, of course, when we think about in Washington, D.C., every minute seems to be a new, well, crisis to avert or try to maintain. I want to bring in Mychael Schnell, congressional reporter for \"The Hill,\" CNN political reporter and commentator Ashley Allison, and Liam Donovan, former National Republican Senatorial Committee aide. Mychael, let me bring you into this conversation because, look, we're talking about what happened last week. I bet this week, Biden wishes there were maybe a 16th, 17th, 18th round of the speaker votes. It just goes to show that, you know, (INAUDIBLE) high in April, shut down in May. He had a higher approval rating this week than he had in the past. But this is a crisis now that's starting to spiral. What do you make of it?",

      "sentences": "This is a big deal. And again, you mentioned last week the focus was on the speaker's race. It was on the chaos and the disarray within the republican conference. That got squared away.And this week, we saw Republicans dominate the House floor, bring up a number of bills, some of which passed with bipartisan support, some of which were party line. But Republicans had that success on the floor, so they moved the waves for them. And now, it's Democrats who are in the spotlight as having some troubles with this handling of President Biden's documents and it now bleeding over to, as you mentioned, the House Judiciary Committee. This is headed by Jim Jordan, a close ally of President Trump and someone who has made looking into the federal government and looking into those investigations a priority of his in the 118th Congress. So, Republicans right now are excited at the prospect of being able to look into this investigation and look into this mishandling of documents by Biden, particularly after they had a pretty chaotic week last week. So, as you mentioned, change -- quite a difference that a week can make, but it also shifted the tide in terms of how Democrats are doing and how Republicans are doing.",

It reminds me of the 2020 election where it did seem like anyone who was in the news was losing ground. So, the goal was to stand back and let the other side kind of fumble things away. But the more the spotlight is on the president, his actions, and that split screen of the comparison to former President Trump and the muddying of the waters there, I think, is unhelpful.",

They have similar variables but very different, I think, intent and knowledge when we talk about the way we describe how President Trump has handled the situation and how President Biden has handled the situation.Look, we can't ignore the fact that with -- coming out of the midterm, as successful as the Dems were, people probably thought that, within the first couple of weeks of the new year, the administration would announce a re-elect, and this might have delayed it. Do I think this puts him out of the running? No. But do they want to get ahead of this? And if there are any more documents, let the process play out. Now, here's the one thing that I think could be interesting. Trump's case could get finished before Biden's case. And so, if Trump is not indicted or is not convicted, he's in the clear, and then you have this lingering in the news cycle for Joe Biden, and they may both be presidential candidates. That's not good for the Biden campaign or potential Biden campaign. So, I think they want to be transparent, continue to -- people are asking questions, tell the truth.

You're talking about the debt ceiling, of course. You do have Secretary Yellen saying, we're going to hit it, I think, the 17th or next Thursday, right, it's coming. But some economists were saying, hold on, you're not going to default until maybe June if that's an issue. That doesn't give a lot of people a lot of confidence.

So, that, of course, frightened some Democrats. We saw the White House press secretary today said that we want to raise the debt ceiling with no condition. So, I think that what really people are realizing on the Hill was that this is not going to be an issue that gets resolved overnight, even likely in a month or month and a half. This is going to be a long debate and negotiation. As things typically go on Capitol Hill, you don't see too much progress, unfortunately, until you get to the last minute. I think that's an indication Secretary Yellen coming out and saying, we're going to be hitting it soon but then those extraordinary measures coming to place.

It depends on how the story unfolds and it depends on how you tell the story to the American people. Coming out of a midterm, Republicans promised to deliver for Americans lower prices.

And I think what you see is political communicators' instinct when they see a fire, is to try to put it out. And that is often the exact wrong thing because what that does is give it oxygen. You find out that something that was true on one day may not be true on the next day.What they should do, I think, and I think you're seeing this in the last couple of days, is just turn it over to the Department of Justice and special counsel and say this is the proper place for it to be looked at and not spend every day answering whatever the question of the day is. I think the second thing they need to do and then should do is draw contrast. I think on two fronts, they can do that. They are not in a position to criticize Donald Trump any longer. But they can act much differently than Donald Trump did. Donald Trump spent months and months and months trying to stonewall the Department of Justice. This White House should be cooperative at every turn. The second thing, and I think this is just as important, President Biden can't get bogged down in this. He has to show the American public that he's focused on them and contrast that with someone like Congressman Jordan who will, you know, take his jacket off, roll-up his sleeves and scream and yell. And, you know, it's one of the most dependable things, I think, in Washington, which is this crowd of Republicans will always overreact.

January 6th was their last stand for the president they'd been fighting for in the street for years up until that point. And so, certainly, they started amassing recruits, they started amassing equipment, and then on January 6th, they stormed the Capitol. They showed that today.

Some people suggested, okay, have these two teams, the Bengals and the Bills, the teams that were on the field when the Hamlin incident happened, just have them play this week while everybody else sits around and waits.That would be not just inconvenient but would be competitively difficult for the other teams involved in the playoffs. Plus, it would have compressed the two weeks between the conference championships and the Super Bowl to one week. And the Super Bowl is such an extravaganza now. The logistics, when you don't know which two teams are going to be involved until two weeks before, then it would be just a week before, the hotels, the tickets, all the logistics of that would be almost impossible or at least very daunting to undertake. So, what they decided to do was just say, look, two teams, the Bengals and the Bills, played 16 games. Everybody else played 17. Now, had the Ravens beaten the Bengals last weekend, then they would have had to reflip a coin to see which team was home for their playoff game this weekend. But the Bengals eliminated that problem by beating the Ravens. They will play again in the playoffs this weekend, but it will be in Cincinnati. The more interesting thing was the Bills and the Kansas City Chiefs, the Chiefs finished 14 and 3, the Bills finished 13 and 3. It wouldn't be fair to either suppose a victory and the game that wasn't played to completion against the Bengals or suppose a loss. But if the Bills had won that game and finished 14 to 3 -- 14 and 3, I'm sorry, they would have had the number one seed because they beat Kansas City in a regular season game. So, they would have had this weekend off as the Chiefs now do, and they would have had home field against Kansas City should they meet in the AFC championship game. The way it is now, if both teams make it to the AFC championship game, the league has decided that that game will be played at a neutral site, which hasn't been decided yet, which seems to be the most -- in a difficult situation, the most reasonable way to resolve it.",

Everybody knows that dating back to the days of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union and now Russia have run a sophisticated state-operated doping program.In fact, they did it right under the noses of the IOC when they hosted the Winter Olympics in Sochi, changing out urine samples right there while they were hosting the games. And they'll do it again in some form or fashion because that's just what they do. On the other hand, them saying, this tribunal saying that Valieva had no fault or negligence of her own probably make some kind of sense because, unfortunately, 15 years old, she's just at the mercy of this sports machine. She may well not have known what was being administered to her. And even if she did, she had no choice to say, no, I'm not going to do this. This is brutal system. In fact, those who watched the Olympics may remember that when she faltered and she was favored to win the gold medal, when she faltered in the singles and finished fourth, she began to cry and she came off the ice. And here was her coach berating her. Why did you quit? Why are you so soft? Why don't you try harder? This is not a warm and fuzzy situation. So, I don't think much of the world accepts this as credible. I don't think they want to blame a 15-year-old girl for it, but they know what the Russian sports machine is about. So now, WADA, the World Anti-Doping Association will appeal to the court of arbitration for sport, which sort of rules on these international things. And what's at stake would be the gold medal in the team figure skating, which Valieva helped the Russians win. The Americans, by the way, finished second and took the silver. If they overturned that, then the American team would be awarded the gold.",

Dr. Reiner, I'm glad that you're here and to lean on your expertise. There are so many unanswered questions.This was a 54-year-old woman dying of cardiac arrest, which I know really is the heart stopping. But I'm wondering, when you look at a case like this or hearing about it, how should people be thinking about this? Is it the same as a heart attack or is the language distinct for a reason?",

      "sentences": "So, first of all, this is obviously a tragedy. A 54-year-old person dying suddenly at home is unexpected and really sad. It's important to understand that cardiac arrest, which literally means the heart stopping, is not the same as a heart attack. Now, heart attack is when the heart muscle dies, when the supply of blood to the muscle is interrupted, and that can cause the heart to stop, that can cause a cardiac arrest.But there are many, many possible causes of a cardiac arrest that don't have to do with a primary cardiac problem. And time will tell. If there's an autopsy and, as Kyung said, if there's toxicology, we'll have a sense whether there was a noncardiac etiology, a noncardiac cause for Lisa Marie's death. And I think in an otherwise healthy 54- year-old, noncardiac causes rise to the top of the list.",

In with these high- profile cardiac arrests, I think it's important for the public to understand that many of these lives can be saved if the first responders, even when they're not trained medical professionals, immediately start CPR.So, when someone has a cardiac arrest, the clock starts.

And there was some concern the cat might venture away from the Dallas Zoo. And some parts of the zoo are surrounded by residential neighborhoods. So, there was some concern.
