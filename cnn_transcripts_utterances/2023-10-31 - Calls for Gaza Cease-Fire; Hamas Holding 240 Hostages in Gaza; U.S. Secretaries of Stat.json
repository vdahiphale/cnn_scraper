That is according to a statement from the Israel Defense Forces and a security agency a short time ago. The Israeli government, intent on destroying Hamas, the IDF says, it hit around 300 Hamas targets overnight while pressing on with an expanded ground campaign. There also reports of civilian areas being struck, including Gaza's leading cancer hospital. Meanwhile, Israel now believes Hamas militants are holding 240 hostages in Gaza. That update is coming after the Israeli military's first hostage rescue since that massive Hamas attack on October 7th. Continuing now on Capitol Hill, we showed you a few of those images, the U.S. secretary of state and the U.S. Defense Secretary are calling on lawmakers to approve a new aid package for Ukraine as well as Israel. As we told you, they are appearing at a U.S. Senate committee meeting on national security funding. The proposed package is worth more than $100 billion, with a growing number of Republicans skeptical about further spending for Ukraine. The package's approval is in jeopardy. We have Natasha Bertrand in Washington with more. We saw a bit of that testimony specifically from Antony Blinken. We can see Lord Alsen (ph) also testifying at the moment. And the important news that came out, yes, there is a big aid package for both Ukraine and Israel but also other lines is, you've got to get humanitarian aid into Gaza and focusing in on that as well. And funding critical for bolstering deterrence and, of course, ensuring that the U.S. maintains its position in terms of leading the deterrence there. Could you give me a sense of some of the outcomes that we are hearing at the moment?",

      "sentences": "But he said that the U.S. wants to see Israel doing everything it can to protect civilian lives in the Gaza Strip.Now it remains to be seen just what happens here in terms of the funding and the supplemental request, because there is so much opposition in the House of Representatives right now to linking Israel and Ukraine funding. The House GOP, they introduced a bill last night that only provided supplemental funding for Israel, about $14 billion. That, according to the administration, according to many senators, is a nonstarter not only because it does not include any funding for Ukraine at the moment when the Pentagon is running really low on funds for the war in Ukraine but it also rescinds $14 billion  from IRS funding. So that is something that the administration says is not going to happen. The Senate says that that is essentially dead on arrival when it gets to that chamber. So we will have to see how this all plays out. But it is a really key moment, this congressional testimony here, because it is the first kind of public test of the support or lack thereof that the administration's over $100 billion supplemental request has in the Congress -- Eleni. Important points of public test in terms of support there, that testimony on the go. We will stay on top of that story. Natasha Bertrand, great to have you on. Thank you. Now as the war rages, on the humanitarian crisis is worsening by the day in Gaza. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz has been tracking the deteriorating conditions. She joins us now live. Salma, good to have you with us. You've been monitoring the devastating impacts of civilians caught in the middle of this. Give me a sense of the latest.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Since that war was launched, of course, after those brutal attacks on October 7th that left 1,400 peopledead in Israel, that conflict has resulted in some 1 million Gazans, that is half the population of the Strip, to be displaced. Essentially people who are on the move, seeking shelter, trying to find refuge. I know over and over again, you've heard that refrain, Eleni. There is no safe place. We wanted to dive into that by taking you into one neighborhood for one hour, as people try to shelter in a hospital. I warn, you the images in this report are graphic. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (voice-over):  Where do you go when the bombs won't stop? Where do you shelter your family when the shelters are full? For many Gazans, the answer is a hospital. The head doctor shows us around. \"All that separates these families and the ICU is this door,\" he explains. \"These are not proper, sterile conditions.\" Some 12,000 displaced people are camped out in this hospital in northern Gaza and every single person you see here has been told by Israel's army to leave and move south. An evacuation order, the U.N. previously called, inhumane. \"This is not a place for children to play; this is a disaster,\" the doctor says. \"Look, these are sick people. \"How can a man on a walker be evacuated?\" Hospitals are protected under international law. But Israel claims Hamas uses medical facilities as command centers. Aid groups and Palestinian officials deny these allegations. Either way, this is still not a safe place. Step outside the doors and this is what you face, nonstop Israeli artillery and airstrikes. Everyone here fears the explosions will only get closer. But there is nowhere else to run. Across the street, desperate people steal basic supplies. The war in a suffocating siege is causing civil order to break down, the U.N. says. \"Families cannot be expected to flee into this chaos,\" this father says. \"This is a war against our children. \"See how scared he is from the bombs? \"Now we are alive but, tomorrow, we could be dead. Please, save us,\" he pleads. Less than a quarter mile away from the hospital, this is the aftermath of one of those strikes. Residents pull people out of the rubble of their homes. They can depend only on each other. Comms are down. No one can call an ambulance. \"Just try and carry him out on your shoulder,\" someone shouts. \"Are my mom and dad alive?\" the wounded man asks. The sound of war never ceases. You could die trying to help the living. This is one neighborhood during one hour in Gaza, a tiny glimpse into the horror. The humanity and dignity of more than 2 million people that live here casualty of a war so many people did not choose. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

That's why you hear those repeated calls for a cessation of hostilities, for a pause in the fighting to allow people to move. Even if they could get south, where do they stay? What does that look like? And then the second thing that is concerning to those families and to Palestinian officials is these allegations, these claims made by Israel's military against hospitals. The fear is that they are laying the groundwork through these allegations for hospitals potentially to also be in the crossfire. That, health officials and Palestinians tell us, would be an absolute massacre, considering the number of people sheltering in hospitals across the Gaza Strip -- Eleni.",

So a German Israeli woman who was kidnapped from a musical festival by Hamas and later found dead has been described as \"beautiful, lively, person.\" Israeli officials say Shani Louk was tortured and paraded around Gaza. We must warn you, what you are about to see is disturbing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIOKOS (voice-over):  Shani's mother gave CNN permission to air this video, to show the world the brutality of Hamas. And we are blurring the image of her body. The 23 year old appears to be unconscious in the back of a truck, being driven by Hamas terrorists. Her mother, Ricarda, spoke to CNN's (INAUDIBLE). (END VIDEO CLIP) (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RICARDA LOUK, SHANI'S MOTHER (through translator):  After three weeks that you -- you have no idea where your daughter is, what they're doing to her, what is happening, what is -- you don't know if she's alive or not or injured, nothing. There's just like you're in a vacuum for three weeks, just hoping to get some signs or life signs. And then suddenly you get the worst news. But in one hand it's really, OK, now it's final.

IDF jets struck Nisam Abu Ajina, the commander of the Beit Lahiya battalion of Hamas northern brigade. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GIOKOS (voice-over):  That is according to joint Israeli intelligence. At the same time, Israeli troops say they are pushing deeper into the enclave. You're looking at IDF video, showing Israeli tanks and soldiers on the ground. It was released a short time ago as the IDF announced an update on the number of hostages believed to be held by Hamas. That has now risen to 240 captives. Earlier today, CNN teams saw numerous large explosions in northern Gaza, with Israel saying it had struck hundreds of Hamas targets, including military compounds inside underground tunnels.

I want to go back to my initial question in terms of Benjamin Netanyahu saying, look, there is no chance of a cease-fire or a humanitarian pause. We've just heard from the U.S. secretary of state that there must be some kind of pause in order to get humanitarian aid in. How important is it right now to get Israel to agree to a pause or humanitarian cease-fire or some kind of cease-fire that clearly was voted on at the U.N. Security Council yesterday but not legally binding?",
