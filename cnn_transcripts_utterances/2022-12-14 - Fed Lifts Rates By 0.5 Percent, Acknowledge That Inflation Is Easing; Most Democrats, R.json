      "sentences": "Yes, I think that's right, Victor and Bianna. The Fed is saying that there's more work to be done here. It's interesting because even though the White House and Wall Street have been celebrating the signs of cooling inflation, the Fed Chair took a bit of a different approach. He said, \"It will take substantially more evidence to gain confidence that inflation is on a sustained downward path.\" In other words, they're not declaring victory anytime soon. And Powell, he also stressed that the jobs market remains hot. He said that the labor market is \"very, very strong.\" He said we haven't seen much softening. He said wages are high and all of that, of course, supports inflation.So the Fed is now penciling in another 75 basis points of rate increases next year. That is more than the Fed had previously been penciling in. It means higher borrowing costs for everyone mortgage rates, credit cards, car loans, it does mean more downward pressure on the economy and so Fed officials are also projecting some more negatives for the economy. They put out a new round of economic projections and they were downgraded across the board. The Fed now sees at near zero growth next year in terms of GDP, that forecast was cut in half. They bumped up their unemployment forecast. They now see unemployment going from 3.7 percent today to 4.6 percent next year. That translates to the loss of millions of jobs and they also bumped up their forecast for inflation. So I think if you put all of it together, the Fed is really trying to drive home this message that more work is going to be needed to get inflation back towards healthy levels.",

Scott Perry, a Republican from Pennsylvania.We know the Justice Department investigation took an interest into Scott Perry and his phone, particularly this summer. There was a search and seizure done around him and then after that, CNN has been able to confirm that there was a confidential proceeding in court in this fall, where the Justice Department was pursuing data from Scott Perry's phone. Now we know he was the type of person around Trump who was not just in touch with Meadows, but he was interested in getting in touch with lots of people to push forward this idea that there may have been - there should be not trust in the elections or that there may be election fraud.

The clear majority 62 percent of Republicans say, no Trump should not be the Republican nominee. But it's also interesting when we look at the favorable ratings among Republican voters. Look at this, the favorable rating of Ron DeSantis, who obviously has not declared, but there's a lot of whispering that he will run in 2024.

We see that back in January and February, 45 percent said yes, in July, it's at all the way down, my goodness, to 25 percent.Now, it's back up to 40 percent. Still, the majority say, no, Joe Biden should not be the Democratic nominee at 59 percent. But the big difference between the Democratic and Republican side is Joe Biden is still the most well-liked Democrat at this point, his favorable rating 82 percent, some other potential 2024 nominees among Democrats, Kamala Harris 62 percent favorable rating, Gavin Newsom with just 47 percent of favorable rating.

People don't know a lot about him. He hasn't been out on the campaign trail. They knew that he won overwhelmingly in Florida. Republicans overwhelmingly believe he did a good job there, but obviously, they have an alternative. And that, again, is another difference with the Democrats, because while the Democrats may say, okay, we want someone other than Joe Biden to run. When you ask that same question to them, they really have no idea who their favorite is. I mean, according our poll, 72 percent of Democrats say they have no particular favorite. So it's really different in the parties. If the Democrats had someone else to point to, Dana suggests and I agree with her, that if Biden decides to run, somebody might decide to challenge him, then they'll have a choice.
