And then, with the AR, here we -- I told him, \"Push the AR. Get the AR away from him.\" The kid pushed the AR. I don't know what his name was. And then, I proceeded to take his other weapon, the pistol, and then just start hitting him, at where I could.I lost my kid's boyfriend. I tried. I tried to -- everybody in there. I still feel bad that it's five people -- there's five people that didn't go home.

And I want to start with Juliette, as we sort of set the stage here. You heard the District Attorney say that they are still collecting evidence, to try and figure out whether this mass shooting can be charged, can be considered a hate crime.

So, whatever he says will be relevant, and then, of course, whatever trail he left.And there'll be two pieces to this. One will be, did he -- did he say anything, do anything, with other family members, with friends that would then leave witnesses, who can testify that he had animus, had targeted the bar, had targeted the community. The other is, of course, his online presence. And so, what is online? What caused him to be radicalized? Just within a year, he's attacking his mother. This is the case that we know about. He's focused on sort of a family issue. Within a year that becomes a mass killing, which we have to remind everyone, could have been so much worse. I mean, over a dozen people have bullet wounds, and we're just lucky that they're alive. And so, what radicalization happened? Did it happen online? And who was he following? Who was he communicating with? That will capture the picture. I was surprised that -- I'll be honest with you. I was surprised they didn't charge today. These cases can -- you can start with a hate crime. But I would suspect that they will likely do it, in the next day or two, if they have evidence that this was targeted, because of the kind of bar it was. And it's hard to believe it wasn't. It was a unique bar. Not many gay -- LGBTQ bars in the community. It wasn't like he randomly showed up, at a bar, and decided to shoot who was in it.",

The local Republican members of Congress have been very vocal against the community. And so, I think it feels particularly scary, and personal, for members, in Colorado. But, look, I don't want to be glib about this. I don't, you know, I'm gay, and I stand in solidarity with those children in Uvalde, and the shoppers, in the supermarket, in Buffalo, and the folks, in the movie theater. I mean, we have to look at what these crimes, these mass shootings, have in common. And the thing that they have in common isn't hate. There is a lot of hate in the world. And there's a, you know, there are a lot of mentally-ill people. But what we have in common here, in these mass shootings, are high-capacity magazines, and guns, and the easy access to them. And I think until we actually face that, we're not going to stop this. We don't do mental health resources.

So, there's that. But I think what you're starting to see is this split, stylistically and kind of brand-wise, among the Republicans, who would like to seek the nomination. There are the candidates, like Ron DeSantis, who don't have to say Donald Trump's name, and who are firmly kind of in the forefront, of this ridiculously early stage. There are the candidates, who have always branded themselves as critical of Trump, or willing to speak outside the box. You've got Larry Hogan. And then, there's like the Mike Pence lane, the Mike Pompeo lane, people who've served closely, in the Trump administration, helped legitimize him, for years, until the very end, when they had no choice, really, but to step away.",
