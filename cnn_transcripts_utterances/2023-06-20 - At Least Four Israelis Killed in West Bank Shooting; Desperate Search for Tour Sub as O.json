They -- the attackers arrived at the gas, station and then opened fire at civilians, four civilians were declared, dead and a number of civilians were injured. xxx The ambulance service Magen David Adom saying that four have been, injured and they have been taking to hospitals. Additionally the IDF saying one of the attackers was neutralized, in its words; given the footage we've seen, seems like he was killed by a civilian. IDF soldiers are now pursuing additional suspects and they put out roadblocks. They've also instructed people living in the settlement of Eli to remain indoors while this is going on. So this is a developing situation. And from what we can gather, it seems this is the worst attack on Israelis since the beginning of the year. So an attack, killing with this many Israeli casualties, has not taken place since about January.",
