Both sides have doubled down on the left. They've doubled down on the progressive perspective with that ticket. And President Trump doubled down on his ticket.

So he may be looking to lay down a marker in terms of his negotiating tactics.Let's not forget that he's seen to be much closer to Iran and much more of a hardliner than others in the organization that may have replaced Ismail Haniyeh, who was assassinated on the 31st of July in a guest house in Tehran. As far as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is concerned, I think it's worth remembering that even in the wake of President Biden's grand announcement that this framework agreement between Israel and Hamas, you know, was going to be agreed upon, you know, and everyone thought that a deal was going to happen. Imminently, Prime Minister Netanyahu did actually come out and say he accepted what President Biden had said. But at the same time, he, at least from his perspective, his view was that what President Biden was saying didn't preclude Israel from doing the things that it said it wanted to do and that Hamas said it didn't want to allow to happen, namely for Israel to have the option, if you like, to go back to war after this six-week temporary ceasefire. But certainly, Prime Minister Netanyahu, when he goes into these negotiations or his negotiators are there, even if whether they do or don't have someone to negotiate with via the mediators, he will want to be able to insist that he is sticking to his war objectives and not giving up on them, namely to destroy Hamas's military and governance capabilities to get all of the hostages home, 115 or so still in Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead and to prevent the Gaza Strip from posing a threat to Israel in future. And if he can stick to those, then he will feel that he can sell it to the Israeli people, even if he can't to the most right-wing members of his coalition, Wolf.",

And why can we analyze, perhaps, the ground behind this assessment? Iran has said, and this is contrary now to what they were saying last week, they seem to accept this principle that if there could be movement on Gaza, then they could hold off their retaliation. They're now saying that their retaliation and Gaza are two separate issues. So add to that the possibility that Hamas is signaling that these talks are going to be just like every other set of talks. So the Iranian leadership is going to sit there and say, well, what are we waiting for, because nothing is actually changing.

We have also demonstrated that we are willing to send our men and women in uniform to fight on foreign soil to protect our allies who are fighting for freedom.What we are not, I think, eager to do is have our men and women come under attack when there is an opportunity for a peaceful resolution or a path to peace and our allies fail to take that, putting our lives on the line, our men and women in uniform on the line when there was a path to peace. So I'm hoping that the Israelis understand that we are with them, but we are not going to be with them to the extent when they have an element in their government who says we don't want any peace. We don't want any deal, but we're willing to risk a regional war, which by the way, is not regional. It will be global in its consequences. It will affect the lives of every person on this planet in terms of inflationary pressures, joblessness and despair. So nothing is regional. It's global in impact. So I want to make sure that the Israelis and the Palestinians understand there's an opportunity here for pursuing peace.

They follow the lead of the bigger, better funded, better trained agencies that, you know, execute in new directions. Once you see that happen successfully, as it certainly was for the Russians in 2016, you can expect smaller services to follow suit in the years to come.That seems to be what has happened here with the Iranians. As I said, they tried it in 2020 along very similar lines, and they seem to be following the same playlist today.",

It's very unclear at the moment.But obviously, this would become a major headache for the United States. It would become a terrible thing for the entire region. Obviously, all options should be on the table. That's what the president should be communicating. But it's his decision. It's the Biden-Harris administration's decision to figure out what we want to do. But you could be sure that President Biden, Vice President Harris is going to make sure that Israel's security is protected and that Iran is not going to get a win here. In fact, that's why they built this coalition the first time Iran tried to do this. And as I said previously, Wolf, it's interesting, right? Israel had specific strategic targets, people who were responsible for October 7th. They went and they killed those specific murderers. And now, Iran wants to come with a completely disproportionate attack on the entire country. And so that is the escalation. That is the real concern. How the Israelis respond to that? Well, look, this will be the second time Iran does a major attack on the country. That just cannot continue to go on for free without Israel deciding that it's a time to eliminate the nuclear capability of the Iranian regime, which is what I think the Israelis are probably thinking about.",

That medal instead going to go to Romania competitor Ana Barbosu. And it comes after a court of arbitration for sport ruling Saturday, which said the initial inquiry made by the U.S. over Chiles's score was filed four seconds too late after the one-minute deadline.CNN sports analyst and USA Today sports columnist Christine Brennan joining us now live from Paris. Christine, there's so many questions about this. Is the U.S. -- the U.S. Olympic Committee is appealing, but who are they appealing to? Do they have a strong case?

This is very similar for anyone following the Kamila Valieva figure skating drama over the last two and a half years.We're kept going back to cast the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the Supreme Court, for sports in the world. That's what's going to happen here. The United States, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee is going to throw its full weight and might and money at this. And they also have some new evidence, Jessica, that USA Gymnastics has announced in the last couple of hours, that they have video timestamped evidence of the coach putting the appeal in at 47 seconds, not at 64 seconds. So, it's a lot of minutiae here, but what that means is that's within the one minute, 47 seconds, 13 seconds before the minute deadline, and if that evidence is what the U.S. says it is, and I certainly believe it would be, then that would prove that the U.S. did file the appeal, which then I've asked two sources with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, what on earth were they looking at if they, in fact, had the appeal filed before the minute deadline that apparently the U.S. had failed to meet when the U.S. now has evidence that they did meet that deadline?",
