Al-Shifa Hospital was said to be the beating heart of the militants command infrastructure.Visuals also telegraphed and Israeli military raid was coming, and now promised that concrete evidence from that precise and targeted operation will be made public soon to prove that Hamas use the medical facility as the terror headquarters. Around the world though there has been loud a growing condemnation over the Al-Shifa Hospital incursion. The World Health Organization called it totally unacceptable, and a possible violation of international humanitarian law. Pressure is now growing on Israel to justify the raid. On Wednesday, the Israel Defense Forces revealed weapons and military kit. They say belonging to Hamas was found inside the hospital along with unspecified technological assets. But so far, no evidence of the underground tunnel network buried beneath the hospital. Hamas describes Israel's claims about uncovering weapons as a blatant lie. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF SPOKESPERSON: These weapons have absolutely no business being inside the hospital. The only reason they're here is because Hamas put them here because they use this place like many other hospitals and ambulances and sensitive facilities inside the Gaza Strip for their illicit military purposes.

But at Shifa Hospital at least there are no indications the Israelis will be leaving anytime soon.

Doctors at Al-Shifa working under impossible circumstances caring for hundreds of patients as Israel's military incursion moves inside the hospital. DR. MOHAMMAD ZAQOUT, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF HOSPITAL IN GAZA (through translator): The occupation soldiers are still on the ground floor. They are searching employees, civilians, even the injured and patients. Some were stripped and placed in dehumanizing and miserable conditions. BASHIR (voice-over): Israel's raid on Shiva has been described as precise and targeted, focused, they say on claims of a Hamas command center beneath the hospital. But it is civilians including medical staff and patients that have been caught in the center this unrelenting battle. AHMED EL MOKHALLALATI, SENIOR PLASTIC SURGEON, AL-SHIFA HOSPITAL: We can't look through the windows and doors. We didn't know what's happening. Tanks are moving within the hospital.

You asked whether this is consistent with international humanitarian law. I'm not a lawyer. I'm a physician and I'm a humanitarian. We have grave concerns even if a military force has concerns about the use of a health facility for military purposes. The hospital or clinic does not lose its protection under international humanitarian law. There are certain principles that apply, such as proportionality, distinction, and precaution. Essentially, what we have to do is ensure that the health consequences are minimized in any military operation that may, the military force may wish to justify. And in the instance of Shifa, we can see that the health consequences have not been minimized. It's been under enormous pressure for far too long.

Of course, we've been advocating since day one for the unconditional release of those hostages and appropriate care for the hostages while they remain in captivity.

I must also add to that, we have been calling for weeks for the citizens of Gaza to move to the southern part that is safer, south of the Wadi of Gaza. Hamas has also heard this and they knew that we were coming also to the hospital. And had an advantage that we give up for reasons to be the most accurate and safe with the people and the patients that are in the hospital. And they could have used that to clear up. Like we found, for example, a uniform that were left on the ground when they fled that area, probably wearing civilian clothes. But still, we are looking and whatever we will find, we will share.

So that has already been made very clear.I think what is also added to that is how Hamas deliberately uses these civilian installations -- be it schools, be it mosques and also hospitals -- to carry out its terrorist activity while hiding behind the most vulnerable and the sick to carry out a terrorist attack. And that is why we are there, to stop them from doing that and not being able to attack us ever in the future, which we also believe will bring a better future for the Palestinians living in the Gaza.",
