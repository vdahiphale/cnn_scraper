As you guys already mentioned right now, the Ukrainians are saying that about 1.5 million people here in this country are without power as their services are trying to restore that power as fast as possible.I spoke to a senior Ukrainian official last week, and he told me, look, when the strikes happen they do have forces out and they go there quickly and repair things. But as long as the strikes continue to happen, in many cases it's too dangerous for them to work and sometimes it just tends to be overwhelming. In fact, just last night, again, after those massive strikes that happened on Saturday the Ukrainians are saying that they took down 16 of those Iranian Kamikaze drones, the Shahed-136, just this past night. Of course, those mostly used to attack that energy infrastructure. So certainly it's still very much going on. There are a lot of people who are without power right now and there's also a lot of power rationing that's going on in many cities around Ukraine where the government is saying, look, people really need to use as little electricity as possible right now because they're in such a crunch at the moment to make sure they can get the power to as many people as possible. The main power outages that we're seeing in Ukraine right now after those big attacks yesterday are in the west of the country, but certainly the situation where I am further to the east is very little better than it is in other parts of Ukraine, guys.",

Obviously, that's not going to happen, as the Court of Appeals has given the White House until Monday, which is tomorrow, to respond to that hold and then those states who brought the challenge have until Tuesday to respond to the White House, fully pushing the White House's timeline for folks to have relief closer and closer to the midterm elections just under three weeks now.[06:05:10] Now the White House has encouraged people to continue to apply, really reaffirming that they are not backing down from this issue. Instead, they are moving forward. Now secretary of education, Miguel Cardona, he was really forceful in an op-ed that was published in \"USA Today\" yesterday, really slamming the Republicans for what he called hypocritical or basically outlining as hypocritical actions. I want to read you some of it. He said, \"These same Republican attorneys general and officials, however, didn't file lawsuits when $58.5 billion in pandemic relief loans were forgiven for their state's business owners. They didn't oppose $2 trillion in tax cuts to the highest earning businesses and individuals as part of the Trump tax giveaway. And they didn't complain when Republican members of Congress got millions of dollars for their own Paycheck Protection Program loans forgiven by the federal government last year. It is only when relief is going to working and middle-class Americans that these elected officials have a problem.\" So again, from the White House here, no sign that they are backing down, despite this temporary hold, as they believe that this issue galvanizes voters, particularly young voters, and young Black voters, ahead of the midterm elections.

      "sentences": "Yes, that's right, Amara and Boris. John Fetterman held an event here in key Chester County on Saturday night. He spoke at length on stage with Senator Amy Klobuchar. It is a unique event for Fetterman who, as you noted, had a stroke in May, returned to the campaign trail in June, has mostly headlined rallies where he had a stump speech, you know, litany of things he wanted to hit.This was a different kind of event. He was up there. He did not have necessarily notes, did not have issues he wanted to hit and was kind of led in the conversation by Klobuchar. Fetterman did acknowledge he used closed captioning technology which allowed him to read what Klobuchar was saying as she spoke. Now why does that matter? Everything right now in Pennsylvania is pointing to the debate on Tuesday between Oz and Fetterman. That debate is going to be key because of the Oz attacks on Fetterman's health and closed captioning technology will be used at that debate. That's why in many ways this event was almost a dry run for the debate. Now Fetterman and Klobuchar spoke on a number of issues including abortion, the economy, their personal backgrounds, but one of the fieriest moments came on crime when Fetterman really unleashed on how the Oz campaign has hit him repeatedly on crime. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN FETTERMAN (D), PENNSYLVANIA SENATE CANDIDATE: He literally doesn't have a plan. Other than to talk and that's been a hallmark of his campaign. Just not any plans, just cheap photo ops or just empty kinds of arguments. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But as recently as 2012, this county voted for a Republican presidential nominee in Mitt Romney.That is why Fetterman is here. He and his aides know this is going to be a critical county if they are going to defeat Oz in November. Hanging over all of this is the fact that polls have tightened of late. They have closed -- since over the summer when Fetterman had a double-digit lead. They're now neck and neck here in Pennsylvania between Oz and Fetterman and that just ratchets up the tension as we head into the debate on Tuesday.",

The question is whether that issue -- whether that answer is going to resonate with voters and how many -- I mean, like it's two things. Voters will be paying to this. If Fetterman stumbles it could be a problem for him.The challenge with debates and you're seeing this play out this cycle, is that, you know, campaigns have real questions about whether debates can help a candidate. I think in this case if Fetterman emerges strong from this debate it unquestionably will help him. The question is just, will it help him enough to counteract the tide? But Pennsylvania went for Biden. And don't forget Pennsylvania went for Obama strongly in his two elections. Trump did win Pennsylvania the first time around, but by really narrow margin. Abortion rights actually really do matter in Pennsylvania, more than in many states, and so it is really a close race. It really is. There are probably a couple Democratic contests that are closer. This would be a flip for Democrats if they won it. So it's just hard to say exactly how things fall within the margin of error. It's hard to predict what's going to happen. That's why the next few days matter so much. And I think it's why you're seeing Obama now focusing on Pennsylvania, just anything to turn out those base and younger voters of color, independent voters across the state.",

This is a once-in-every-five-year meeting, as Boris said, this is meticulously planned, it is highly scripted. That's why this was such a bizarre and astonishing moment. And if you take a look at that video again, the man seated next to Xi Jinping, that is China's former top leader Hu Jintao. There are several confusing moments. In the close up, he appears to be very reluctant to leave and then he is led out. Now, he also appears to say something to Xi Jinping. We don't know what. And then he pats the shoulder of the Premier Li Keqiang. After this, there was a firestorm of speculation overseas. And Chinese state media later said, look, this was because of health reasons. But I've been talking to several experts who say they don't buy that explanation, especially because of the timing here. This dramatic moment happened after journalists were allowed in the room, and that's why all of this is caught on camera. But regardless of the explanation here, this is a highly symbolic moment. It is the physical manifestation of the exit of a man, of a leader who represented an era of collective rule. Xi Jinping, he's all about one man rule. At the Party congress earlier today, we saw him get formally reanointed for that unprecedented third term as a country supreme leader, General Secretary of the Communist Party, and then we got the big reveal of who his closest advisors are. And they're all his closest allies. They're all Xi Jinping loyalists. So, we've seen him even further consolidate his near absolute power. So, what does this mean? This means that in his third term and the next five years and beyond that, because potentially he's being set up as ruler for life, he's going to further increase his iron-clad authoritarian rule. So, expect more tensions with the U.S., more intimidation of Taiwan. The reality is the world is dealing with a more confident and aggressive China.",

You hear chants of death of the dictator, death of Khamenei himself who is Iran's supreme leader. And the youth aspect of these protests can't be understated. The fact that you have this new generation of Iranians that have come to the political scene at least, Gen Zers, people in their late teens and early 20s, who are really leading these protests. And that's why we're seeing so much of it occur on university campuses where you see young people. But the addition of strikes and the labor movement that, by the way, predates what we're seeing right now. There have been ongoing labor protests and strikes in Iran for several years.

At the same time, and this is true of every Gen Zer in the world, you have a new generation that has come of age with the Internet. They've been raised with social media. So, while Iran is a country that may have been cut off from the world in many years -- for many years, the internet has closed off that gap. And so, you have young people who are -- they're on Tik Tok, they're on Instagram, they're seeing the world through the internet, and they can juxtapose the world that they live in, in Iran, this closed-off society, with the world that they see outside of that. And I think that combined with their youth, being less risk averse, the fearlessness that we're seeing, the fact that you have acts of civil disobedience that we haven't seen in previous iterations of protests, such as women taking off their hijab, burning their jobs, or just a simple act of civil disobediences that we've seen as you know, a young woman going outside, older woman going outside, doing their normal daily activities, but without their hijab and without abiding by the compulsory attire.",

There are activists who have long been on the scene for political rights for social rights. And of course, that's why you see these wider crackdowns taking any form of descents.And even in these protests, you have mass arrests. You have 12,000 people who have been arrested, you have deadly force being used, nearly 250 people that have been killed. According to rights groups, those numbers are likely higher. So, while the state is going to use every form of oppression to try and squash these protests, I think what you'll see and when you contextualize this in Iran's history, this is a struggle that has gone on for over a century. Iranians wants a government that serves its people. And they have attempted reform and where this state has refused to reform. They have been forced into a position where now toppling the government is the only option that they see as a viable option.

There was big miscommunication early in game three, Yankees' Aaron Judge and Harrison Bader. We can see better saying, I got it, I got it. Well, it pops and drops. Judge took blame for it afterwards for what would have been the end of the inning, a third out. Instead, next batter Chad McCormick says see you later. Houston was up two-zip. 335 feet, that's the shortest playoff homerun in five years. New York had just three hits in this game. They're batting 161, the worst average to eight games in MLB history in the playoffs. Houston wins five-zip, looking to make their fourth World Series in six years. Phillies-Padres now in South Philly, a slug fest. Neither pitcher made it out of the first inning. San Diego had a big lead early but Rhys Hoskins ties it in the fifth with a two-run shot. And then Bryce Harper rolls up and he rolls one into the gap scoring J.T. Realmuto. Harper is pumped. Philly winning 10 to six in the end, a three-one series lead now, looking at take the (INAUDIBLE), the first NL pennant in 13 years.

Cuse's Ja'Had Carter taken DJ Uiagalelei's fumble for 90 yards, Uiagalelei would be benched later in the game. Syracuse was up 21-10 At halftime but here comes Will Shipley and the Tigers. 50 yards for the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter. Orange had a chance late but Garrett Shrader's pass is picked off by RJ. Mickens. Clemson holds on 27-21. But look, Syracuse is still 6-1. They're still going to be ranked in the top 25.
