This is THE LEAD. This afternoon, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced he has appointed Robert Hur as a special counsel in this case. Hur is a D.C. lawyer right now. He previously served as a U.S. attorney in Maryland until 2021. He had been appointed by President Trump, the previous administration. The announcement from Garland came just a few hours after the White House announced classified records had also been found at President Biden's home in Wilmington, Delaware, including some in his garage. This discovery was in addition to the classified records that had been found at Biden's private office in Washington, D.C., as Phil Mattingly reports for us now, the White House says it is confident the documents were, quote, inadvertently misplaced.

MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  We really have no choice because he had so un-evenly handled this. It really is outrageous when you look at what happened with, you know, former President Clinton, Hillary Clinton, thousands of emails, and classified documents on a server in their home, President Trump's house being raided, and then we now have President Biden when he was vice president apparently took classified documents are in his home that he has had for a period of almost six years, maybe longer, we don't know when they came into his possession, or when he took them home. Having appointed a special prosecutor for the Trump issue, he had really no choice to do this.

I mean, this is now we're talking years that these documents have been in these locations, presumably, since that time he was vice president.
