It's a typically mundane process, but it takes on added significance this year because of what happened four years ago when supporters of Donald Trump tried to halt the certification of Joe Biden's electoral victory. The date also marks two weeks until Donald Trump is officially sworn in during his inauguration, and Republicans are already planning how to push through an aggressive agenda in his first 100 days.That includes sweeping tax cuts, border security enhancements and raising the debt limit. However, there is already some differences among Republican leaders on how exactly that can be accomplished. REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA), U.S. HOUSE SPEAKER: I think at the end of the day, President Trump is going to prefer, as he likes to say, one big beautiful bill. And there's a lot of merit to that because we can put it all together. One big up or down vote, which can save the country quite literally because there are so many elements to it. And it'll give us a little bit more time to negotiate that and get it right. SEN. JOHN THUNE (R-SD), U.S. SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: We have the same set of objectives. We want to get to the same destination. But I think at times there will be differences in how we get there. And understanding the unique aspects of how the Senate operates is something that I'm going to have to be able to share and convey to the president.

I just thought as an afterthought to go up and watch it on my own TV. We were all horrified. It was shocking, not something that we could have ever anticipated. And I think many Americans will wish to see accountability and others really think that it's been overblown and would like to move on. I think the pardons will go ahead. And, you know, pardons are not unusual. The bigger question is the broader process surrounding that, whether you also seek to erase the memory and the history. That January 6 commission that we saw on our television screens has ensured and the report has ensured that it will be in the history books. I think in the short term there will be an attempt to rewrite history and to move on. But I think in the longer term, it's there and it will be remembered by, you know, Americans in many generations to come.",

But really, President Biden, his national security team, his government really is shoring up their legacy.President Biden is set to make, I think, two speeches. Many -- Jake Sullivan is in India today. That's a policy trip. But there are also a number of efforts that are being undertaken in these last two weeks until the inauguration of President Trump to really put a stamp on Biden, Harris and their legacy. The Presidential Medal of Freedoms. Those were, of course, awarded in recent days, including to Liz Cheney, who co-led that commission on January 6th, George Soros, many others, Hillary Clinton. And we've seen on Twitter, Elon Musk and others really criticizing those announcements. So that legacy is one that is partisan in the short term. The incoming Trump administration is really not letting go of their antipathy towards President Biden and his team. And again, President Biden is seeking really in a last minute effort to really shore up and tell the world, and especially to tell Americans what he's accomplished, what he has aimed to do and what he wishes to see for the U.S. going forward. And I would also note, of course, this is an extraordinary day, but just tomorrow, America is going to turn the page and really look back at President Carter as he as he will be in Washington.

Many people think that the rioters, many of the rioters did not use violence. Those who did, they don't all believe that it was directed by President Trump.But I think in many ways, you know, Americans are very pragmatic. They're very forward looking. They're very driven and determined to get ahead and move. And when it came to voting, we know that people made their decisions for a deep variety of reasons. And part of it was, you know, it was a very slim majority. You know, we point to the fact that President Trump has these majorities in the House and the Senate and the White House. They're slim majorities that the overall outcome was very much less than it appeared on that first night. But Americans who voted for Donald Trump voted for very different reasons. And we know that there's a group of those who supported Donald Trump, probably despite what happened on January 6th, because they think he's the better leader for the U.S. economy, for delivering a deregulated return to neoliberalism, tax cuts, and really charging the U.S. economy. And they didn't like what President Biden was trying to do with Bidenomics. Others are just deeply committed to President Trump, the MAGA wing of the party. And others just vote Republican because that's what they and their families have done forever. And then, of course, there were many people who simply didn't want Kamala Harris. So it's a complicated picture. I don't think that, you know, none of the polling suggested that January 6th ranked at the top of people's reasons for voting on either side of the ledger. It was really, you know, about complex factors, obviously inflation, obviously the economy, but who they identified with as a leader. And Americans are very divided. It's a divided country. The legacy of January 6th is a legacy which people carry very different interpretations. It was a dangerous, sad, traumatic, deeply disturbing day for so many of us, something that we never could have imagined seeing. The good news of the story of that day was that the legislators, that joint session of Congress, everybody returned. They voted. They certified the outcome of the U.S. election as they were mandated to do. And we, after an extraordinarily disruptive assault on the U.S. Capitol, we saw a smooth transition to President Biden. So, again, people move on. They look forward. It's not a country that spends a lot of time looking backwards. It's a hard-charging, forward- looking, deeply pragmatic country.",
