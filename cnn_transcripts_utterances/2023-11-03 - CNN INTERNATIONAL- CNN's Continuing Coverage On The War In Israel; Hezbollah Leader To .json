Flares overnight lit up northern Gaza in one of the most intense periods of Israeli bombardment since the war began. The IDF says 23 of its soldiers have died in the Gaza operations.The primary objective now is locating and destroying the Hamas tunnel network and eliminating explosives and other obstacles. But the Biden administration is increasingly concerned about the climbing civilian death toll in Gaza and warns it could undermine international support for Israel. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is due back in the region on Friday to discuss U.S. concerns directly with Israeli officials. CNN's Scott McLean is covering all this for us from London. So Scott, first of all, what is the latest in the war between Israel and Hamas?",

      "sentences": "Hey, Kim, yeah, the civilian death toll continues to rise, and so those American fears are well-founded. The Palestinian Red Crescent says that when it comes to children alone, more than 3,700 have died in Gaza since this conflict began, and there are still more than 1,000 who have been reported missing under the rubble. And just to put that into perspective, 500, or more than 500 children have been officially killed in Ukraine since that conflict began a year and a half ago. So now you have Antony Blinken going into Israel today, trying to makethis delicate dance, continuing to maintain support for Israel, but also seeming to apply some pressure wherever he can on the Israelis to try to really limit the number of civilians who have been killed. Yesterday, the political leader of Hamas, Ismail Haniyeh, came out with a statement proposing his vision to end the war, which would involve an immediate ceasefire, but the Israelis, look, they have said that this war will end when Hamas is completely destroyed. So that seems like a non-starter. In terms of the war and where we're at so far, as you mentioned, Kim, the Israelis say that they have surrounded Gaza City. You also showed that video earlier, if we can bring it up, of the flares in northern Gaza. This is just inside the border, a community called Beit Hanun, not far from Gaza City. And in that video, you can see what looks like a smoke screen on the ground that perhaps could suggest the movement of Israeli troops in that area. Obviously, the IDF is saying precious little for obvious reasons about the precise location of their troops, but we have at least one marker, one reference point to go up by on the ground, and that is the Al Quds Hospital, which is located on the outskirts of Gaza City. It is the second largest in Gaza. And the Red Crescent reports that it has seen -- it has been fired upon, or at least the vicinity of the hospital has been fired upon recently by the Israelis. It says the troops, it figures, were stationed about a kilometer away, fired at the hospital, wounded a child and a young man who were standing outside pierced the walls of the sixth floor as well. This is the same hospital that received threats from Israel earlier this week to evacuate, otherwise the Red Crescent in their telling of the story would be responsible for any civilian deaths there. So implying that it could be bombed. Now the Israelis haven't responded to these specific latest accusations of the firing, but they had previously said that Al Quds and other hospitals have been sheltering Hamas. That is something that the hospital very strongly denies though. But look, that hospital also says that look, it cannot evacuate because there are so, so many wounded civilians there, including babies and incubators and thousands of civilians taking shelter there as well. So wherever we go with this ground invasion, Kim, those hospitals are likely to be another place where civilians continue to cling, figuring that they are likely one of the safest places remaining in Gaza.",
