We begin this morning in Vatican City, where thousands have gathered for the first mass of 2023 just one day after the death of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. Benedict passed away Saturday at the age of 95 at his home in a monastery on the grounds of the Vatican.And beginning Monday, his body will be moved to St. Peter's Basilica where for three days, the public will be able to pay their respects before a funeral on Thursday, that will be overseen by Pope Francis in St. Peter's Square. The Vatican has said the ceremony will be a, quote, solemn and simple affair after which Benedict will be buried in the papal tombs under the Basilica. This morning, three NYPD officers are recovering after a man attacked them with a machete. According to the NYPD commissioner, a 19-year-old man carried out this unprovoked attack just outside of Times Square New Year's Eve security screening zone. And that's where the man approached an officer and attempted to strike him over the head with a machete. He then hit two other officers before one of those officers fired his service weapon, that bullet hitting the suspect in the shoulder. The suspect is being treated for his injuries. The FBI, NYPD, and the FBI's JTTF are all investigating. Meanwhile, in Alabama, one person was killed and nine others were injured in a shooting in Mobile, Alabama. It happened just last night, blocks from where people had gathered for the city's New Year's Eve celebration. The conditions of the injured are not clear, however, police said that the surviving victims were all transported to local hospitals. A motive for the shooting is still not clear at this point and no arrests have been made. New this morning, the suspect charged in the deaths of four University of Idaho students is currently being held without bail in Pennsylvania. That's where he was arrested on Friday. 28-year-old Bryan Kohberger's lawyer says he will waive extradition back to Idaho, where he's charged with four counts of first-degree murder as well as felony burglary.

U.S. officials did not estimate how long they expect these rules to remain in place, saying only that they would monitor the situation and then they would adjust if they need to.Right now, in California and Nevada, more than a quarter of a million customers are without power after heavy rains and high winds slammed the region. Those conditions also prompting flooding in several areas. That includes this highway that you're looking at in the Bay Area that had to be temporarily shut down, although it has since reopened. That storm system will continue to impact the west before pushing east, bringing the threat for severe weather to parts of the south. CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar is tracking all of that for us. So Allison, good morning to you. Happy New Year. And the question is, how does this play out across the country?

Right now, the focus is still over the western portion of the U.S. where we still anticipate some snow and even some rain. And the thing is, it's on top of pretty significant amounts of rain already.Oakland, California, picking up almost 5 inches. San Francisco, South Lake Tahoe exceeding the 5-inch mark. Santa Cruz picking up over seven and some locations of California even picked up over 8 inches of rain in just a 24-hour period. Right now, the rain is focused across San Diego, Las Vegas, the general southwestern region. But then it's going to begin to make its way across the east. As it does so, it's going to take that cold air and the moisture with it. So you've got winter weather alerts from California all the way over to Wisconsin where we anticipate the system is going to go in the 24 to 72 hours in the future. Here's a look at that system as it makes its way over to the east on Monday. Once we'll start to see a lot of the winter weather aspects begin to impact the Midwest, but also severe storms along the gulf coast. States like Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, all under the threat for severe storms not just Monday, but also Tuesday. This is going to be a multi-day event.

And certainly, one benefit here in America is that most homeowners have fixed rate mortgages.

But sources tell me and my colleague Lauren Fox that there were no major break throughs. This despite the fact that Kevin McCarthy has offered a number of concessions to his critics.That includes agreeing to an investigative panel to centralize all the probes into the Biden administration. That's something conservatives have really been clamoring for, and perhaps most notably here. McCarthy has agreed to a lower threshold for a vote on triggering -- a vote on deposing the sitting speaker. That is something known as the motion to vacate the Speaker's chair. It has been a chief demand of his conservative critics. Up until this point, McCarthy has been really reluctant to budge on the issue. That is because he's essentially giving power to his critics to fire him at any given notice. But as he has struggled to lock down the votes for speaker, he is now willing to come down to a threshold as low as five people, sources tell CNN. So that would be a major concession for Kevin McCarthy. However, moderates in the party said on the conference call on Friday that they are very uncomfortable with that idea. And meanwhile, the critics who are pushing for that threshold still wouldn't commit to voting for Kevin McCarthy. So they wrapped the call, agreeing to work through the weekend. They are hoping to resolve some of these outstanding issues and then finalize a rules package and then hope that everything else sort of just falls into place.
