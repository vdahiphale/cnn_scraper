So what's your response to what they had to say?DORSEY NUNN, AUTHOR, \"WHAT KIND OF BIRD CAN'T FLY, A MEMOIR OF RESILIENCE AND RESURRECTION\": My response is this -- five percent of the world population is holding 25 percent of the prison population. That wouldn't even because possible without necessarily forcing the labor. So the question still boils down there when you get really down to it, it ain't about whether or not we're going to advance the notion of rehabilitation or we're going to advance the notion of public safety. What it gets down to is, are we going to advance the notion of being able to do this real charitable practice of slavery as being cost effective. So at a certain point, we probably need to have a real question inside the United States, if a country is founded on the backs of slaves, and we say that we are not practicing slavery, should we actually not practice slavery? And prior to 1865, California had impacted it, probably a little bit earlier, in 1849. So it came years early, and probably Vermont had some pause in probably 1877, and they still is holding on to the vestiges of slavery.",

Everybody else thinks that it's just a simple form of punishment. So like, you need to ask the question, are you willing to actually give up the notion of brutally subjecting people to forced labor? Or are you actually defining punishment as being sentenced to prison and the time that we spend in prison? Then do something else with the population that's there, because none of the jobs that you gave me and forced me to work on, I didn't -- it didn't give me the opportunity to feed my family when I got out. It didn't give me the opportunity to feed my family or over the period of time. And it didn't necessarily provide you greater public safety because the first thing that we need to do is remove desperation and those choices off the board. Slavery gives labor a bad name.",

They say that they attacked a military bulldozer, which was then engulfed in flames. And when an armored personnel carrier came to rescue those on the bulldozer, they say they attack the APC as well. So we know that this is an area where there has been significant Israeli military activity in recent days. [14:05:03] We heard from one of the civil defense officials in Rafah that there had been airstrikes and artillery shooting since dawn in that area. In fact, they said that they had received phone calls of civilians calling for people to be evacuated as they were injured, also calling for bodies to be retrieved. But they said they simply couldn't get there because the operations and the fighting at that point was too intense. Now the IDF on Friday also said that they had discovered a number of tunnels in this area of Rafah, in the wider area of Rafah, also saying that they had found large quantities of weapons, as well, and pointing out that they had seen sort of passages between one house to the next. They believed that they had been put there by Hamas to give them easy access around this very densely populated area of Rafah. Fred?",

So we're waiting to see whether or not the Supreme Court can accept that Congress has the power to do with that case is all about. I'm also very concerned about the presidential immunity case. President Trump is arguing that he should not be held liable for anything that happened on January 6th because everything he did that day was official, and official presidential activity is activity for which the president is immune from any kind of criminal prosecution. The counterargument has to do with whether or not there's a limit to what official presidential activity is.

And when there's so many different people around the world, and there's so many different issues coming out of now central Asia, I think it's a new threat picture that the intelligence community and the national security establishment in Washington are going to have to look harder into.I think it is something that we need to be worried about, and I think we need to remain on our toes so that we have our homeland security coordinated with some of our intelligence elements overseas so that we can begin to try and screen and block out would be terrorists.",

I think it began principally by the FBI director in numerous congressional testimonies where he was able to just say very frankly and disarmingly, listen, this is a way for them to enter the country. It's been a flashing light for people around on the world to realize that the backdoor of the United States might be ajar.And so I think it's something that Congress needs to pay better attention to. They need to fund more Border Patrol. We need to put more intelligence elements, maybe it's drones and the rest, on the southern border. And at a time when were worried about China, Russia, and the Middle East, we've just got one more thing that we need to find the time to deal with.",

But if we look at how much is going on in the Middle East, how much is online that could potentially inflame would the jihadists, and you look at the increasing ungoverned space in Syria and even parts of Iraq, I think you put all that together, and that's why the article is saying the system is blinking red.I think it's something that the intelligence community, while it may have been spending its precious resources and assets swear in recent years as we've been into a period of great power competition, we have to remember that stateless international terrorists are still trying to get to the United States, and we have to figure out a way to stop them before they get here. WHITFIELD: \"The New York Times\" also reported in April that ISIS-K is increasingly recruiting from Tajikistan with Tajiks making up more than half of the recruits. We also heard that underscored by our own Katie Bo Lillis in her report before the break. So what stands out to you about the terror group's recruitment efforts?",

Also, there is new evidence, I think, especially when you consider some of the new sources, that Afghanistan may not be as safe as we had anticipated.We, the Biden administration, the United States is relying on something called over the border, over the horizon intelligence collection, and drones that can fly in from the Middle East. We may need to figure out a way to be more present in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and in the central Asian region so that we can try and hit these terrorists overseas or get to them before they can get to the United States.",
