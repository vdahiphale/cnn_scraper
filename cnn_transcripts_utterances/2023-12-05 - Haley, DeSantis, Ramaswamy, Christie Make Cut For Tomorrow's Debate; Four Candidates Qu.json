Get ready for some fireworks between Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley but will either take on Donald Trump.Plus, a desperate plea from Ukraine. Senators will hear directly from President Zelenskyy about the stakes on the battlefield if they do not approve more funding. With just days left to act and the world watching, will U.S. lawmakers give up on Ukraine and hate on campus. The leaders of three of the country's most elite universities are on Capitol Hill right now facing questions about the terrifying rise of antisemitism. Did they allow do hate to flourish? And what if anything can be done to stop it now? I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We start today with the 2024 race. Chris Christie, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy will be on the stage tomorrow night in Alabama. With less than six weeks until the first votes are cast, the frontrunner will be once again noticeably absent. Instead, Donald Trump will spend his night raising money for his Super PAC after appearing at a televised debate, or at least I should say a town hall tonight in Iowa. CNN's Alayna Treene is covering all of this. Alayna, what are you hearing from the Trump camp?",

And that's why he's continuing to skip these. But that's also led to a lot of frustration among his opponents.

One is that, you know, they don't have an opportunity to attack him directly on the stage. He is the frontrunner, and they want to be able to go head-to-head with him.And they're not giving -- the Trump campaign is not giving them an opportunity to do that.
