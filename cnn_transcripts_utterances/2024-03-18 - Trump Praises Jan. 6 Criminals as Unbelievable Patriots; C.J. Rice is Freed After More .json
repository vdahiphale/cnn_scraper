Trump spread more lies about the 2020 election, saluting those convicted of crimes on January 6th for their attempt to subvert democracy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Rice has been completely exonerated. People watching might recall we've been covering this story for several years. C.J. Rice was the patient of my pediatrician father and my dad testified that in 2011, there's no way C.J. could have committed the crime. This shooting three or four people were wounded, nobody seriously. But C.J. in 2013 was sentenced to 30 to 60 years in prison, as you noted, largely because he had a completely incompetent attorney. That was the cover story. I wrote a cover story for the Atlantic Magazine in 2022 called, this is not just justice, a Philadelphia teenager in the empty promise of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees people a right to fair, adequate counsel. And an attorney, Carl Schwartz, working with a number of other attorneys filed a habeas petition not long after that. And the district attorney has now granted that habeas petition. And the court has said C.J. Rice did not get a fair trial, did not have adequate representation. The district attorney has concluded that the case was weak to begin with. The only reason he went to prison was because he had a bad attorney. And for the first time in the whole sorry history of this case of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania versus C.J.

There was no evidence that this was retaliation, but she granted that. But they also did their own investigation. They listened to jailhouse recordings of conversations C.J. had with his mom in which he was pleading to have his mom ask his attorney, Sandjai Weaver, to please get the phone records because the cell phone records would prove that he was in West Philadelphia at the time of the shooting, not in South Philadelphia, something that Sandjai Weaver never did, something that the Philadelphia Police apparently never did when they were investigating this case. So, that was a big part of it. They also looked into other things that were very suspicious about the only person who said that C.J. did this as one eyewitness who knew him, didn't say, didn't identify him the night of the shooting, didn't identify him to hospital personnel. But then after police said they got an anonymous tip that C.J. did it, suddenly she identified him. They found her testimony not particularly reliable.

Now, President Biden neither endorsed nor condemned that call for new elections, but he did call it a good speech and said it reflected many concerns that Americans are feeling about this conflict in Gaza. But certainly it generated a lot of anger on the part of Netanyahu. Listen to a little bit of what he told Dana Bash yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

One is these hostage negotiations that will resume today in Doha. Certainly, President Biden very eager to get a deal that would secure the release of those hostages, but also result in a temporary ceasefire. Obviously, President Biden also very eager to get more humanitarian aid into Gaza, and, of course, they will discuss this pending Israeli operation in Rafah. The White House says it hasn't seen a credible plan to protect the civilians there. So, certainly, a lot on the plate for President Biden as this call is set to occur this morning, Jim.",

You know, he did mention Alexei Navalny for the first time in -- well, for the first time he's ever done it in public.And he also sort of confirmed the reports that we've been sort of talking about for some time now, which is that Putin -- the Kremlin had agreed to swap Alexei Navalny or agreed to talk about swapping Alexei Navalny in the days before his death as part of a prisoner exchange. Sort of interesting that that would come from Vladimir Putin. Now, he made some joke about it, sort of off-color joke about saying something like the only condition he had is that Alexei Navalny never came back. Of course, the opposition, the family of Alexei Navalny accused Putin of killing Alexei Navalny, something that the Kremlin denies, killing him because Putin couldn't bear the possibility of him being released. And so it was interesting to hear Vladimir Putin's version of what happened in that post-election speech, Jim.",

And yet, when the time actually comes for them to support Ukraine against Russia, which Ronald Reagan would have been vociferous and steadfast about, they shirk.
