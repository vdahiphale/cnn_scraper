He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.\"Shortly after, Reiner posted on social media saying, in part, quote, \"We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside.\" Now, at the same time, two of Biden's closest political allies on Capitol Hill, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Jim Clyburn, are publicly questioning whether the President's decision to stay in the race is final.

Right now, you have many Democrats who are basically arguing they hope that Biden makes the right decision, despite the fact that two days ago they received a letter from the President explicitly saying that his mind was made up and that he was staying atop the Democratic ticket.I think, Jessica, that reveals just the fact that they are trying to give him space. They respect Biden. They believe that they have worked closely with him to do things that they believe have helped the American people. They want to show a sign of deference, but at the same time, alarm bells are going off, both in public and in private. You now have eight Democrats who have publicly said that they hope that Biden gets out of this race, hopes that he steps aside. They also have a large contingent of Democrats who are privately telling their colleagues that they do not believe that Biden can win. Three of those Democrats made their case yesterday to their colleagues. That includes Michael Bennet, who then came on CNN's air last night and said that he did indeed say that privately at this lunch, and that he believes it publicly, that Biden cannot beat Donald Trump. So, that is something to keep in mind as we move forward here. But, Jessica, it's just a good reminder that there is sort of this middle ground that Democrats are trying to walk.
