      "sentences": "Right now, President Trump is on the plane that you see there that just took off from Mar-a-Lago moments ago. He is headed here to New York City and to a court appearance in Manhattan.The first former U.S. president to face criminal indictment, Trump is making history with this trip. All of this is connected to his alleged role in a hush money payments game and cover up involving the adult film star, Stormy Daniels, who alleges she had an affair with Trump. As of now, the grand jury indictment is still under seal. We are still waiting to see what these charges look like. CNN has formally requested the judge to release it. And 1:00 p.m. was the deadline for the judge to decide. But Trump's legal team says they plan to challenge every potential issue in that document. It remains to be seen what exactly they will be challenging. CNN's Jeff Zeleny and David Chalian are back here with me now. Jeff, obviously, we are still waiting for the legal ramifications of all this to see what this indictment looks like. But we're already seeing the political benefits and what this could potentially do for Trump's presidential candidacy. I mean, they are now saying that he has raised $5 million. We should note they are saying that that's not actually in any FEC report that we have seen. But clearly, initially, he is seeing a boost from voters.",

He may benefit from it.I'm also so interested, David, by how the other Republican nominees or potential nominees are playing around this. Because Jeff's right that there is no clear-cut way.

Not the case here. The case here is a rallying around effect, as Jeff is saying, because there's such concern about Trump's supporters and the need for them, come the end of the day, when you're running for the Republican presidential nomination. I will say one thing in our poll, Kaitlan, I thought was really interesting was an overwhelming majority, three quarters of Americans, do see politics at play in this prosecution. And so while there is a majority that's approves of the indictment, you also see voters saying, hey, yes, he may have done something wrong here, but it's not devoid of politics here. And that gives Trump a bit of an opening to continue to make that attack on Alvin Bragg.",

What is old is new again.But it is important to note - and we've been talking about this repeatedly over the course of last week's - there's so much going on in the investigative front. And it's not just New York as the former president prepares to face the historical criminal charges in Manhattan tomorrow. \"The Washington Post\" has new reporting on the special counsel probe. It says investigators could have more evidence of obstruction tied to the classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, including efforts by Trump himself to sift through contents of some boxes to keep certain items in his possession. CNN's Evan Perez is tracking all this. And, Evan, I feel like I need like the court board with the strings to figure out all the things that are going on.",

It is also clear, though, that, in recent weeks, based on the activity of the special counsel, with the number of witnesses that they've been bringing in, given tight deadlines, asking them to turn over things. That there is a sort of this this movement, certainly by the special counsel's office, Jack Smith, to get to a place where they can make a decision as to whether charges are coming. And again, what makes this different than just say, you know, him holding back documents, the former president having access to these classified documents - he was former president. What made this a much more serious thing is the fact that they believed he was obstructing. And so we're beginning to see, at least from this \"Washington Post\" story, a little bit of what the prosecutors have maybe showing their hands in some of their interactions with witnesses. They're telling them about certain things that is now abundantly clear that they have someone on the inside who told them about, for instance, this - this this this - this evidence that the former president may be reviewed some of this, some of these documents, and purposely was holding them back. That's what makes this so much more serious.",

I'm sure there have been legal setbacks in terms of the Trump people kind of asserting this privilege or another or saying this person shouldn't have to testify, this person can. These things are starting to be beaten back. There are judges who are saying, no, I don't think so.

Now, \"The Washington Post\" reporting seems to suggest that they had received a subpoena and after receiving the subpoena, the president then directed people to perhaps open boxes or move or mishandled documents, that sort of lock, stock and barrel obstruction of justice.

There's going to be a bipartisan group of lawmakers in attendance.And this has been a very carefully orchestrated trip with the official line being that the president of Taiwan is transiting back from Central America, passing through the U.S. on her way back to Taiwan. Now this is happening despite threats from China. There's threats of retaliation, which could include something like military exercises. And so this meeting could really rattle the already tense relationship between China and the U.S., especially after the recent spy balloon incident. But Kevin McCarthy isn't ruling out traveling to Taiwan himself. That is something that he has expressed interest in. He has made standing up to China a top priority of his speakership. He told reporters last month that he is not going to let China tell him when and where to go. Of course. His predecessor, Nancy Pelosi, did make a historic trip to the island last year. She was the first speaker to travel to Taiwan in 25 years. And China did respond with extensive military exercises - exercises. So it is always a balance for leaders of wanting to stand up and counter China's threats without triggering further conflict.",
