I'm Lynda Kinkade in the Isa Soares, denied a tense, calmingIsrael after the IDF hit targets in Southern Lebanon and Gaza in retaliation for dozens of rockets launched from Lebanon. Then an apparent leak of classified military information about Ukraine. What we know from the Pentagon and Christians are marking one of their holiest days of the year. We'll be live in Rome on this good Friday. Governments around the world are urging restraint after days of violence in the Middle East, warning that any further escalation could spiral out of control. A fragile calm is in effect for now, but Israel has ordered the mobilization of some reservers. After it launched airstrikes into Southern Lebanon and Gaza, it says it went after Palestinian militant targets, after rockets fired into Israel. After those cross-border attacks, Israelis traveling in a car in the West Bank came under fire today, two sisters were killed and their mother was wounded.

The latest in a wave of missiles fired from Gaza and Southern Lebanon in recent days. Violence also spread to the West Bank on Friday. There two Israeli sisters were killed and their mother seriously wounded in a shooting described by Israeli forces as a terrorist attack, Hamas praised the deadly attack as a heroic act of resistance. In recent days, major escalation across the region has raised fears of a wider conflict. This is the latest catalyst. Israeli police twice stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque Wednesday overnight footage showed the dramatic raid, Israeli forces hitting worshipers with rifle butts and battens. Israeli police say they entered the mosque after hundreds of rioters barricaded themselves inside, and that their officers were attacked with stones and fireworks. Palestinians and the wider Muslim world see the raid on the mosque as a provocation, particularly during the holy month of Ramadan. Condemnation quickly poured in as well as rockets from two directions, Southern Lebanon and Gaza. It all begins and ends at the holy sight you see behind me here, known as \"the Noble Sanctuary\" to Muslims or the Temple Mount to Jews. It is dictated by a decade old agreement that says only Muslims can pray at the site. Some non-Muslims are allowed at certain times at the complex, but any violation, real or perceived of that so-called status quo agreement could quickly ignite tensions and many Palestinians fear, that's exactly what's happening. There have been calls by Jewish extremist groups to slaughter goats at the Mosque compound during Passover and in January, an inflammatory visit by Israel's far-right National Security Minister Ben-Gvir drew international condemnation. He's convicted of supporting terrorism and inciting anti-Arab racism. Prime Minister Netanyahu has insisted his government is not seeking to change rules at the holy site. On Friday, tens of thousands gathered at the steps of Al-Aqsa Mosque after a peaceful prayer service. Banners read \"Al- Aqsa is a red line.\" Another said, \"Do not test our patience.\" The U.S., UN and other members of the international community have called for restraint and calm, but with nearly two weeks of Ramadan left and the Passover holiday underway, it remains a deeply sensitive time in a deeply sensitive place.

If you look at the Israelis, for instance, they just a couple of minutes ago, a source in the defense sector there telling CNN that as of right now the operations in South Lebanon, but also over Gaza are over. If there is no new rocket fire. Now of course we know from some of the events that we've seen over the past 24 hours that that is a very big if, and certainly you can see and feel as we are on the edge of Gaza right now, that the Israelis certainly aren't taking any chances. In fact, as I'm speaking to you right now and the lights that you see behind me, that is already the territory of Gaza. We are hearing drones overhead the entire time. So, clearly the Israelis very much keeping an eye on the situation looking to see that nothing is fired towards Israel from Gaza territory. And obviously also being on high alert as well with the fact that they've said that they've called up reserves and especially in air defense and also in the Air Force as well. So, clearly this region is very much on edge. Israel, obviously on edge, Lebanon, very much of course on edge as well. But at the same time, you do feel that regional actors (ph). And certainly the countries that have been affected so far, Israel, but then Lebanon as well. They don't want this to spiral into something wider and turn into a wider war here in this region, which obviously would be highly detrimental to a country like Lebanon, but certainly to Israel, as well, Lynda.",

And also be very careful to not allow this to spiral into something wider where all of a sudden you have a wider conflict with the Lebanese, but specifically also of course, Hezbollah as well. It was quite interesting, when we saw some of the statements that were coming from the Israelis were early on, they were actually blaming Hamas, the group that controls Gaza for firing those rockets from Lebanon. Then very quickly took that back and said that they believed that it was Palestinians firing from inside Lebanese territory, which obviously very much excludes Hezbollah having been behind all this At the same time, we're also seeing that Hezbollah has been fairly quiet over the past 24 hours as well. Also, seemingly not wanting to escalate that situation either, because of course we know that Hezbollah is an extremely important and extremely strong group there inside Lebanon. Certainly when also that's much more battle hardened than it would've been several years ago, especially all through all the experience that their fighters gained fighting in Syria, for instance. Nevertheless, for Hezbollah also, it would've been an extremely tough conflict if they would've gone into a direct war with the Israelis. So, it's really seems as though all sides are saying, take a step back here, make sure this doesn't escalate to any further. Certainly the Israelis right now saying very publicly. It seems that for now, right now, their retaliatory action in Gaza and in South Lebanon is over if they're not shot at again, Lynda.",

But what they're telling us so far is that these documents, they are legitimate, they are authentic. However, some of them have been edited in some places. And what we're told is that at least one document actually had a correct Pentagon assessments for how many Russians were killed in action, for example. But that document appears to have been edited before it was later disseminated by Russian Telegram channels to make those casualty figures much lower. So, it's little things like this in these documents. That are leading officials to express to reporters that they should be very cautious with how they're handling these documents. But look at the same time, these documents can, they are pretty revealing and they could be useful for the Russians just in terms of figuring out and finding out how much equipment the Ukrainians currently have. For example, one of the documents lists the exact systems, the quantities of them that the West has given to the Ukrainians, when the training on those systems will be complete, and roughly how many more systems, the U.S. and the West are going to give to Ukraine. So, that is a very potentially valuable window that the Russians could have into this kind of operational, you know, aspect of the Ukrainian military. So, the U.S. Now they're investigating. The Pentagon is investigating how this leak actually happened. But so far we are not getting really any closer to finding out when these documents appeared online exactly.

Whywould you then put them online to essentially advertise the fact you were in possession of this confidential assistance in the upcoming counter offensive? Everyone's expecting the Ukrainians to launch. Counter verse two. Why if the U.S. have discovered this intelligence leak and these documents online, why would they give indications that these are authentic? So, not to say that these are not genuine signals from people and that there is just great confusion as often occurs in these circumstances. But you also should remember the context of misinformation in this war and how we're ahead of the previous Ukrainian counter offensive in the summer, there were suggestions of certain tactics that might have been used by Ukrainians that turned out later to not be the case. The fog of war means a lot of people talk different things the whole time. That don't always turn out to be true. But it is very interesting how these documents have specifically emerged just at a time of heightened speculation as to when Ukraine's counter offensive may begin. And they do appear, it seems, if they are authentic to present important bits of information about Ukraine's capabilities. We'll have to see how real they turn out to be down the line and if they have any impact on the counter offensives timing. Adding into that, Lynda, we are hearing from Bakhmut. Certainly a UK intelligence assessment of the fighting for that. Now, symbolically key city in Ukraine's East suggesting that Russia, the UK says, might be getting some momentum perhaps because the mercenary vagner groups fighting for that city and also the traditional Russian military, they're the conventional Russian military, are beginning to cooperate a little more their rivalry. Certainly stymied will certainly be very public over the past months. Whether this marks a sea change in Russia's lengthy months long, almost the whole winter, frankly, fight for this town, which most analysts say has minimal strategic value, but it's really come outsize and importance of Russia because they've said they will take it. We simply don't know if this is a sea change in how that fight's going to play out, but certainly it has over the past month sucked in a lot of Russian resources. A lot of Ukrainian ones too, but some analysts are saying it's given a bit of breathing space on other parts of the frontline for perhaps Ukraine to prepare for this counter offensive. Whether these documents being leaked or the events in Bakhmut alter the timing or pressure points of that counter offensive, we don't know yet, but certainly I think many are anticipating in the days and weeks ahead.

So these are targets, which, on the surface. looked pretty benign, pretty insignificant frankly. We're talking about an electrical transformer, we're talking about some buildings, some cars affected in a rural area, about 10 miles, 15, 16 kilometers from the Israeli border. And in one case, we were talking about a massive crater left behind by one of these strikes in a farmer's field that jolted awake some nearby farm workers and actually collapsed a part of their roof just from the sheer force of it. But you had to wonder, after seeing those pictures and hearing from the people around that area, what on earth was the military or strategic target that the Israelis were after? Well, a Lebanese security source told my team here in Beirut earlier that these actually were Palestinian militant sites. There actually were weapons on these sites that the Israelis were after. And so, this was something more serious than what it seemed on purpose. And, of course, the real risk here, and the real concern that had been expressed by that security source and by plenty of people, including the United Nations, is that this retaliatory strike could lead to this, sort of, ongoing back and forth that could really spiral into a larger conflict.",

And whether or not this sortof fragile state of calm that's descended over Lebanon right now will actually hold, and that is because the Lebanese Foreign Minister told us and our colleague, Becky Anderson, earlier today that he has managed, his government has managed, to speak directly with Hezbollah. They have ties with the Lebanese militia group. They're actually part of the government. And also spoken to the Americans, but essentially, because of the state of how things are in the country, and the complexities here and in the region, he is essentially relying on Hezbollah to relay his message, his government's message, to those Palestinian militia groups. And he's relying on the Americans to relay the Lebanese message to the Israelis to turn down the temperature and not to retaliate further and not to escalate things. The other reality here is that the Lebanese don't effectively control large swaths of their territory, especially in the southern part of the country. Case in point the minister figures that some of the rockets that were actually used in this barrage were actually manufactured in Palestinian refugee camps in the southern part of the country, camps that had been there for years, but that Lebanese security forces don't actually have a part in policing. And so you have that. On the other hand, you have this really confusing game of telephone that has some potentially very dire, real-life consequences if it all goes wrong, Lynda.",

But the one thing that everyone would agree on here is it brought peace, it brought safety, it brought the knowledge that you could go out shopping in the central Belfast with your family and not be caught up in an explosion. More 3 1/2 thousand people were killed during those three decades known as The Troubles. So, yes, Northern Ireland has moved on, and, yes, you can look around, see the development, see the development here in the city center, see the new businesses, the new hotels, all those sorts of things that come with an improvement in the economy. But there are other areas where people will tell you, particularly the younger generation, have been telling us that they feel that the Good Friday Agreement hasn't delivered enough, not really on their expectations. That you really can't have a good conversation between, let's say, the pro-British and the pro-Irish communities, about the identity of Northern Ireland and the people who live here. And what happens next, there's a movement for United Ireland, there's a strong movement to remain part of the United Kingdom. So all of these areas don't get very much discussion. There's a political stasis here between the major political parties, and that's bringing some economic issues. But really it's that big issue, Good Friday Agreement brought peace, but it sort of held that. There isn't a pathway forward. There isn't a way forward to what comes next.

Well, that breathtaking singing fillings St. Peter's Basilica, PopeFrancis was there arriving in a wheelchair and remaining seated for most of the event. The 86-year-old is currently recovering from a bout of bronchitis and was released from hospital last weekend. The Vatican says he will miss the annual Way of the Cross procession, which is being held later at the Colosseum due to the intense cold weather. The preparations for that, as you can see, are already underway. Well, I want to bring in our Vatican Correspondent Delia Gallagher who joins us now live. Good to see you. Happy Easter to you, Delia. So just how is Pope Francis doing as he marks Good Friday given his recent bout of poor health? DELIA GALLAGHER, CNN VATICAN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, exactly, Lynda. I mean, I think he's doing about as well, as you can expect, for an 80-year-old man who has mobility issues and is recovering from a bout of bronchitis. The fact that he is missing the event tonight would normally be cause for concern. But this is an event which begins at 9:00 at night, it's two hours, it has been unseasonably cold here in Rome in the evenings, the Pope would be up on a hill and exposed to the elements. So, given all of that and given his condition, it seems like a simply prudent judgment on the part of the Pope and the Vatican to keep him home. They say he'll be watching from his residence. But I have to say, Lynda, he has been participating in all of the Holy Week events since Palm Sunday. He got out of the hospital on Saturday. He was right in the square on Palm Sunday. Yesterday, he was at a juvenile jail here in Rome for the washing of the feet. That's another traditional thing that they do on what's called Holy Thursday, he was watching and kissing feet of 12 young people there. He seemed to be in very good spirits. And, indeed, we saw him just about two hours ago now in St. Peter's Basilica, as you mentioned for Good Friday service. We will see him tomorrow, one assumes, at the Easter vigil in the evening and St. Peter's Basilica and, again, on Sunday for Easter Sunday Mass in St. Peter's Square. So, it is a challenging time for the Pope. No denying it. But all things considered, Lynda I think he seems like he's up to the challenge. Lynda.",

Like the piles of rubble they left behind, ISIS's rule in Mosul, a stronghold for the terror group for three years, would crumble. Iraqi forces, with the help of a U.S.-led coalition, reclaimed the city in 2017. The rest of its self-proclaimed caliphate would fall over the next two years. The fragmented artifacts in the Mosul Museum have been under repair by a team of Iraqi and French restoration experts for the past four years. They say it is a painstaking process to try to repair the shattered antiquities, a jigsaw puzzle of pieces that might never quite fit together again. One restorer says, \"This is the most gratifying part, assembling and gluing the pieces, although some are too crushed to use, others are missing altogether.\" The museum is just one of many ongoing rebuilding projects in Mosul. In March, church bells rang out again in another part of the city, part of a UNESCO effort to rebuild churches and mosques destroyed by decades of fighting in Iraq.

Well, the biggest story in golf over the past year or so has probably been the rivalry between the PGA Tour and the upstart Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament. And that battle has now spilled onto the green at The Masters. Brooks Koepka, who plays on the LIV Tour, has vaulted into the lead at the first major of the year. He shot five under par today after his seven underground on Thursday. LIV Commissioner Greg Norman has promised a special celebration on Sunday if one of his golfers wins The Masters. World Sports Don Riddell is at Augusta National and joins us now. Good to see you, Don. So Koepka has the best chance at winning the Masters right now. What will happen Sunday if that happens and who else are you watching right now? DON RIDDELL, WORLD SPORT (on camera): Yes. Hey, Lynda. I mean, Koepka's playing absolutely brilliantly. And it's been a while since we've seen him in this kind of form. Remember, he won four majors, almost in the blink of an eye between 2017 in 2019. And then he went right off the boil. He was really struggling with knee injuries and other injuries. He said that when he missed the cut here last year, he punched the back window of his Mercedes twice. He was trying to break it. That's how frustrated he has been. But he's doing really well on the LIV tour. He won twice recently, including in Orlando at the weekend. And now he has translated that form to Augusta National. He says his ambition is to win all four majors, the career slam, he's already got two in the bag. And he's the favorite at the moment. And what would you say the chances are, with all the LIV drama going on in the background, that the two guys who are leading right now, neither of them play on the PGA Tour? That's because the guy in second is an amateur. He doesn't play on any tour. Sam Bennett is an absolutely incredible story. He is eight under par, four behind Brooks Koepka. He's got himself into a position as an amateur that almost nobody has ever done in the history of this tournament. So, look out for him this weekend. He's going absolutely great guns. Not so much good news, I'm afraid Lynda, for one of your Australian compatriots, Jason Day. He was doing brilliantly, but then he dropped four shots in his last four holes of his second round. He's still tied for six, but he's now seven back. It could have been so much better for Jason Day, but up until halfway through the back nine, he was looking really good.",
