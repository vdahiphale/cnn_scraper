This time, it will be as the defense team's first witness.Still at stake, the fate of the Trump business empire. As you remember, the judge in this civil case has already found the family liable for fraud. So, what is Donald Trump Jr. going to say to try and tip the trial in the favor of he and his family? These are live pictures you're looking at right now of Donald Trump Jr. sitting, waiting for the proceedings to get underway. This will be our first and only look inside the courtroom, aside from courtroom sketches before this all gets underway. Let's get to CNN's Brynn Gingras outside the courthouse.

      "sentences": "Yes. I mean, the defense here, Kate, is going to try to prove the fact that the Trump sons, the Trump Organization, did not try to have this conspiracy to defraud banks and insurers to get special rates on their properties by inflating those financial statements.Now, if you remember Don Jr. was on the stand as a states witness just about two weeks ago, and he distanced himself from being, you know, one of the top heads of Trump Organization and preparing those financial statements. So, when he takes the stand for the defense today, we're expecting to hear some of the same argument. The difference, though, is he's being questioned by his own lawyer. So, there's going to be a little bit more leeway in his answers. The state really tried to keep him to a yes and no answers. This time, he'll be able to explain a little bit more about the inner workings of preparing those financial statements. And, again, the defense here trying to show that there were no victims, that banks didn't complain about being defrauded, that they didn't complain about losing any money, and so that this is going to be sort of the first person to explain that into this courtroom. Now, we are expecting this defense to last for about a month. As we said, Don, Jr. is the first one to take the stand. His testimony is expected to last pretty much all of today and can go into tomorrow because there will be some cross-examination from state's attorneys. But, certainly, we are expecting a number of witnesses. It's possible we may see the former president back on the stand. We'll likely see Eric Trump to come back to the stand, again, able to get those questions in from their own attorneys. And we are expecting a few witnesses in the real estate industry from banks as well. You know, we saw a little bit of that defense last week when Ivanka was testifying as to, you know, the state -- sorry, the defense really wanting to paint this picture again of no victims. And, in fact, banks were happy to do business with the Trumps. So, we'll see how this defense lays out for the next month, but Don, Jr. just about to take the stand inside the courtroom behind me.

The answer to that, I believe, will be all. And I would follow that if I can go too deep here, is, and on top of repaying the loans, how much did the Trump Organization pay these, big sophisticated banks in interest? And so the answer, we don't know, several millions.And so the argument that you're trying to advance here with Donald Trump, Jr., if you're the defense is, not only they get repaid the banks, the so-called victims here, they profited. Now, legally, does this matter, not for some of the counts here, but it does matter for others, and it matters, I think, atmospherically in terms of how serious this fraud was.",

The Trump Organization claimed that his paperwork was worth not a little bit more than that, $500 million, 25 times more than that. And I think you can argue as they did, well, there's subjectivity involved, there's some value to the brand name, but not that type of gap. So, I think that was the strongest part.",

Are they going to try to justify the estimates? Because what we saw largely so far is a game of just pointing down the lane.Well, I didn't really put those statements together. We heard it from Don Jr., my experts did, my accounts did. But that only goes so far if everyone is pointing at one another within the organization and your outside accountants count as what you do as the organization. So, at a certain point, if they're just all sort of circularly blaming each other, that's not going to be a defense. So, we'll see if they come up with a more coherent strategy today on the defense. BERMAN:  And one of the issues also seems to be lack of testimony of anyone saying, Donald Trump told me to value it at X. Donald Trump ordered me to inflate the values here.

He testified, Donald Trump never looked at me in the eye and said, Michael Cohen, I need you to inflate these assets. But Michael Cohen testified he made his intent quite clear to us. This was his way of doing things, he would say, I need to be worth more.Would you like to pin something directly on Donald Trump if you're at the A.G.'s office? Sure, but you don't have to here because there are various defendants. Donald Trump is a defendant in his own capacity, but so too is the Trump Organization and various of their LLCs. Also keep in mind the judge has already ruled on one of the causes of action in this case before the trial started. So, the A.G.'s office already has that count for what we call persistent fraud. That's already in their back pocket. They already have that. Now they're fighting over the other counts and also the damages amount.",

They said that on November 12th yesterday, around 11:58 P.M. in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C., Secret Service agents encountered possibly three individuals breaking a window on a parked and unoccupied government vehicle. It goes on to say that during this encounter, a federal agent discharged a service weapon and it is believed that no one was struck. It goes on to say that the vehicle, it seems to be a red vehicle, fled the scene and that there is a lookout for that vehicle, and also that this is an incident that will continue to be investigated by the Secret Service and the D.C.

Now, if the people who are breaking into the vehicle turned to the Secret Service agent when they declared, hey, Secret Service, we are here, and as soon as they declared there, if those suspects turned and pointed a weapon or those agents determined that it appeared that there was a weapon in use or possibly being pointed at them, they could constitute that, that could articulate as a deadly force use, a use of deadly force because they are protecting themselves or the other individuals that were in the area.

We don't know the description. It could have been a suburban. It could have been a nicer vehicle. It may have been a break-in. The fact that the protectee wasn't in the vehicle at the time, I think, leads to the conclusion that the individuals that were breaking the vehicle just broke into the wrong vehicle at the wrong time and they targeted the wrong vehicle.If it had been targeting President Biden's granddaughter, I think the individuals would have probably attacked the vehicle when she was in the vehicle or near the vehicle. The fact that they're just breaking it, that appears to be that they were just breaking into a vehicle, I think lends to the argument that this was just a vehicle break-in at that time.",

Will House Republicans agree to go along with something that takes them into 2024, even if they don't really like it to give him time to find his footing?

And what he's trying to do is make this not a referendum on him but to make it a comparison between Joe Biden versus Donald Trump or Joe Biden versus what would happen if Republicans controlled all levers of government.So, if he can use this to try to show chaos dysfunction, inability to govern, he's going to try to use that politically to his advantage. And also he's going to try to do that because, generally, the party that effectively causes the shutdown is the one that gets the blame. He doesn't want to get blamed for it.
