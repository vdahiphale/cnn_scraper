It was a stunning 11th hour settlement. Just as opening arguments were set to start, Fox choosing to cut a huge check rather than face a jury for knowingly lying about the Dominion Voting machine company and the 2020 U.S. presidential election Dominion CEO John Poulos says it is a big step forward for democracy.",

Well, my next guest, the journalist, Mike Giglio, thinks it's already getting off to a rough start. Donald Trump is the current front runner for the Republican nomination, and he's launched his campaign in Waco, Texas. It's a place perhaps best known for the notorious cult, the Branch Davidians, who lived there and the botched federal siege on their compound back in 1993, an event that lasted 51 days and left 82 of the cult members dead. In a new piece for \"The Intercept,\" Giglio argues that Trump could have been using this charged location to send a coded message to extremists. A theory he's explaining to Hari Sreenivasan.

And it's -- it was a Christian sect in moving outside Waco, Texas heard, I think, decades. And they eventually came under investigation by the ATF because they were suspected of manufacturing machine guns illegally and explosives, hand grenades. And the ATF conceived a pretty disastrously botched initial raid in late February of 1993. So, this is right at the start of the Clinton administration, there was on the right very widespread fear of the federal government and gun control. The NRA was sounding the alarm about this. And so, it kind of like paved right into the passions of the moment. And the ATF raid went horribly wrong. It resulted in the shootout. Four ATF agents were killed and two members of the Branch Davidians. And then, what happened was a very long siege that lasted through all of March and up until April 19th, during which there was a major American news story. You know, helicopters from CNN, like the whole home media circus that is kind of like common now in America. And the FBI, which had taken over the operation executed a second botched raid that was meant to be nonviolent, but ended up in another shootout and a fire that killed more than 70 people at once, all from the Brand Davidians. And so, this is the tragedy and it is really an example of botched operations and overreach of the federal government. But it also became a cultural touchstone on the right, especially for militant groups. And for them, it became like, you know, the seminal example of federal overreach and the -- a scare story, really, of the danger of the federal government and what it was willing to do, especially in the hands of a Democratic administration against gun owning conservatives.",

And for him, the moral of the story was really clear, it was never that the Branch Davidians were heroes. You know, he and other people that really kind of focus on Waco, they don't necessarily identify with the Branch Davidians. For them, the stories about the bad guys. It's about how the Branch Davidians were demonized for being outside the cultural mainstream. How, in their view, the media and the government, which did happen, demonized them during the siege made them appear like these threatening outsiders. And in their minds, like in Stewart Rhodes' mind, the basis of this demonization once in large part of the fact that they were Christian, very hardline Christian, and that they were very hardline gun owners.

And he later came to see it, or at least portray it, as a preview of the coming fight with the government.

But I think, if I were someone who was a member of the Oath Keepers, for example, and I saw that he had picked that place to launch the first official major rally of his presidential campaign, it would send a message to me that he was on my side, which is something that Trump has been signaling, I think, without holding a rally at Waco. It was a message that he obviously sent to his followers ahead of January 6th, militant groups took that message, they showed up at the capitol. Members of the Oath Keepers, including Stewart Rhodes, have been convicted of seditious conspiracy now for January 6th. And it came out in the trial that they thought that they were following Trump's directives. They were -- they thought they were in communication with Trump. Stewart Rhodes is writing open letters to Trump, urging him to take specific actions. And that's what's his portrayal of why the Oath Keepers were there on January 6th, was to help him. And so, fast forward to the current campaign, I have noticed and other commentators as well, Trump speaking even more openly in the terms and frames of the militant right and militant groups. He's portraying the battle as existential against the federal government, against Democrats. So, he's already been very aggressively in his messaging on this front. And to me, the choice of Waco, whatever he might have intended, is sending another very strong signal that this is the direction that his campaign is headed. And I would just note, you know, he opened that rally. He didn't mention Waco. The events of that Waco. But he opened the rally by playing a rendition of natural anthem that was started by a choir of people who have been imprisoned for January 6th and playing images on the ride of the capital. So, again, a pretty clear messaging where he stands on this.",

He is intentionally saying to his followers, this campaign, this political battle is an existential struggle against the government, the federal government as controlled by Democrats. They're coming after you and I'm just standing in their way. So, it's going to be a very and has been existentially themes campaign from Trump, and I just think that this is playing into that messaging, and that it's something that we, observing it, should just understand that context matters.",

And it sounds like pretty outlandish, but you can sort of see when, in the talk of oligarchy and erosion of rights in America, how it can blend into different versions of politics in the United States. And some version of this year's here (ph) are explicitly racist. Some are just really grounded more and like, talk about control the corporations have over government, influence of money in politics, but it is something that has been part and parcel of the militant movement since before the 1990s and certainly, in the 1990s. And Waco played into that is fear security. So, fast forward to 2020, without ever saying, now, we'll go to conspiracy theory, if you look at the press conference that Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani held after the vote in 2020, when they put forward what was the Trump campaign's official narrative of how the election was supposedly stolen, this is the Dominion conspiracy theory, it is about elite global interests, American's foreign -- America's foreign adversaries conspiring with elites in America and politicians and the Democratic Party to steal an election, and it echoed very loudly with the new world order conspiracy theory. And if you're conversing that, you know, theory and its influence in certain segments of American politics, it was very alarming to see that put forward on a national scale. This is something that have been confined to the fringes for decades.

You know, that Trump was on their side, they still had a lot of resistance within the government and the political system, but that they were generally empower. I think if you think of it from that mindset, then that's a mindset that encourages for long view. That's a mindset that encourages participation in the political process where it helps and then, using any other means to grab and leverage power that you can when the political process isn't working. And I think that it's a struggle that, in their minds, has been happening since the 1990s, when lot of these groups first came into being, in the immediate aftermath of Waco. And I think they are very content, at least at the moment, to see can they get political power again. And you know, what would be the result if, again, like a Trump or someone that shared his worldview were to come back into power.

To use the National Guard to help him do this. That would be a massive use of federal power, obviously, a massive of abuse of federal power. So, I think we should consider that their enemy is not really the government, but yes, like you mentioned, it's Democrats, it's Democrat's control of the government, and that's what motivates them, I think, right now more than anything else.

And also, I think there's an awareness that that sort of drastic overreach creates problems that last in this game for decades, like it's still influencing politics today. I don't know how that translates to present moment other than saying, you know, you just always hope that anyone in power in America realizes that it is usually much more risky in the long- term to use too much power rather than too little. And I think that is a lesson that they have learned from past incidents at Waco and elsewhere and that I think the government has really been having struck it (ph) downs with in what is the largest -- one largest investigations, obviously, in FBI history after January 6th.",
