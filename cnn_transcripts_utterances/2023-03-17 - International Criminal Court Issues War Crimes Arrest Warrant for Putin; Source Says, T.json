And according the chief prosecutor, Karim Khan, this is the first time that the head of state of a U.N. Security Council member has been issued with an arrest warrant.Now, the thing they have gone after President Putin and also the Russian high commissioner for children, Maria Lvova-Belova, for is the deportation of thousands of Ukrainian children from inside Ukraine in Russian-held areas across the border into the Russian Federation. That under international law constitutes a war crime. It can, by the way, even constitute crimes against humanity or genocide potentially. At the moment, the scope, though, is with regard to war crimes. We asked Mr. Khan about the significance of this moment. Take a look at what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And so, it's going to be much easier in that context for Putin to sort of brush it aside. And that's what the Kremlin has been doing, of course, over the course of the past several hours, calling it outrageous and unacceptable.Remember, they're casting this in a forced deportation of children, as the Ukrainian president has called it, as an act of mercy domestically. They're saying they're saving these unwanted Ukrainian orphans from the war zone and sort of embracing them into breast of Mother Russia, if you like, in these camps where they're being re- educated and then adopted out to various Russian families. But, look, that meeting with Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, is absolutely crucial, nonetheless. This is a vital relationship for the Russian Federation. It's supposed to be a relationship without limits but there's definitely been a limit over the course of the past year. China has not given Russia the military assistance that it's looking for.

We haven't seen them do that with Sweden yet, but, nonetheless, NATO appears to be growing larger and stronger. And the International Criminal Court by the way as well, Wolf, says it's not just this one line of inquiry that they are pursuing.

As part of the joint venture, Hunter received his portion of good-faith seed funds, which he shared with his uncle James Biden and Hallie Biden, with whom he was involved with at the time and sharing expenses. Now, Wolf, it is also worth noting that this energy company does have ties to the Chinese state, as most companies do in China. And Hunter Biden, yes, he's a private citizen but he's not your average citizen. His father, of course, was the former vice president and is now president. But Hunter Biden is pushing back nonetheless. He's stepping up his efforts to push back on these allegations. And, in fact, earlier today he sued the owner of a Delaware computer store who worked on his laptop, they said he wrongfully shared information and tried to invade his prophecy -- Wolf.",
