U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ordered a guided missile submarine to the region, with the public announcement seen as a message of deterrence to Iran and its proxies. Well, the U.S. is also accelerating the arrival of a carrier strike group. CNN Political and Foreign Policy Analyst Barak Ravid reports that according to a source, Israeli Defense Minister, Yoav Gallant, told the U.S. Defense Secretary that Iranian military preparation suggests Iran is preparing for a large-scale attack. Well, two sources also told Ravid that Israeli intelligence suggests Iran could be planning an attack within days, though the situation is still fluid.(VIDEO PLAYING) Well, tensions were only heightened Sunday night after Israel says about 30 rockets were launched from Lebanon. The Israel Defense Forces says some fell into open areas, and no injuries have been reported. Well, all this ahead of planned ceasefire talks that are due to take place later this week in an effort to end the war in Gaza. On Sunday, Palestinians were seen leaving Khan Younis, after evacuation orders from the Israeli army. They carried whatever belongings they could in search for safety. Well, CNN's Jeremy Diamond is following developments and has more now from Haifa, Israel. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

ASSOC. FELLOW IN INTEL. SECURITY STUDIES, ROYAL UNITED SERVICES INSTITUTE: I think that we're all on pretty much the same page here when it comes to those reports. Having said that, those reports have been coming out now for a couple of weeks. So, it's still an open question as to whether or not these reports are quote, unquote \"genuine\", or if they're part of Iran's strategy to rattle the Israeli establishment, because of course, if you're expecting an attack, then yes, you prepare for it, but it also means you put your community on high alert. It means that you get rattled, and that may indeed be part of it. But, frankly, we won't know, unfortunately, until it's too late.",

And as your report said -- your reporter just pointed out, there is considerable enthusiasm for such a ceasefire deal from amongst the international community. I think even Iran wants that deal. The biggest sticking point, of course, which your reporter alluded to, is Netanyahu and his cabinet. And keep in mind that over the course of the past 10 months, there have been numerous reports now coming out to show that Netanyahu has sabotaged ceasefire deals quite a number of times. So, I think that that's probably a part of it.I think there is probably the other consideration, well, one of the other considerations being, what sort of reprisal ought to take place? There is probably considerable discussion in that regard, and there is no rush, I suppose, from the Iranians' perspective to actually respond as much as there is to respond at a time of their choosing.",

I do think that the movement of these assets into the region is designed to send a message to Hezbollah, to Iran, that the United States is Israel's ally. It did so also in October, and has done so a number of times over the course of not just the past 10 months, but more historically than that. I don't think that it's a prelude to taking any action without some sort of initial reprisal from Hezbollah or from particularly Iran.",

Zelenskyy says Moscow is just using the nuclear plant to blackmail Ukraine and the rest of the world. He added that radiation levels in the area are normal. Well, meanwhile, Ukrainian troops are pushing deeper into Russia'sKursk region after launching an incursion last week. The latest report by the Russian Defense Ministry indicates they've advanced up to 30 kilometers inside Russia. On Sunday, Zelenskyy said his military is doing what is necessary to end the war. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (Interpreted): Only from the beginning of this summer and only from the Kursk region, our Sumy region suffered almost 2,000 strikes, artillery, mortars, drones.

The Ministry of Defense putting out this video, purportedly of a strike on a Ukrainian military convoy, some five armored vehicles on Sunday. Well, CNN has geo-located this to about 14 kilometers from the border near where the Ministry of Defense claimed to have thwarted Ukrainian advances last week. And it's unclear at this point whether Russian efforts have slowed the advance. But, the question for Ukraine, as Russia amasses forces and evacuates tens of thousands of civilians, is how long they can hold on, and if holding on, even occupying pockets of Russian territory is part of the plan.Videos like these have started to surface online of Ukrainian troops replacing Russian flags with Ukrainian ones. Now, after days of silence, only dropping hints about the operation, President Zelenskyy addressed it directly for the first time on Saturday. ZELENSKYY (Interpreted): Today, I received several reports from Commander-in-Chief Syrskyi regarding the frontlines and our actions to push the war onto the aggressor's territory. I'm grateful to every unit of Defense Forces ensuring that. Ukraine is proving that it can indeed restore justice and ensure the necessary pressure on the aggressor.",

It was only a two-pointer. So, heart break for France, elation for the U.S., claiming an eight straight Olympic gold, and with that, Team USA dominates total medal count, but it ties China at 40 gold medals each, on the very last event of these Olympics. A tie for gold has never happened in the history of the Summer Games.Now, at the closing ceremony, to show respect to all the athletes and their people from around the world, it was a celebration for the ages. Snoop Dogg, Billie Eilish, Red Hot Chili Peppers, H.E.R. and others performing, marking the official hand over to the 2028 Los Angeles games, and the end of these incredible and unforgettable Summer Games here in Paris, the Olympics, once again showing that perhaps sport better than anything else can bring people together from all over the world, no matter their differences, to embrace and celebrate one another.

Sebastian Coe, who is the President of World Athletics, gave a press conference at the end of the athletics program, and he was saying, the number of countries now that win medals is so much wider than we'd ever experienced before. You talk about the USA and China dominating on the medal tally, and it's been that way for some time. And then, just underneath, you've got countries consistently. You've got Great Britain. You've got Germany. You've got France. You've got Australia and Japan. But, these are the countries that can invest a lot of money. So, they're always going to perform well. But, when you see surprise nations, people coming through fromBotswana and winning a gold medal on the track, or people that you really hear from, from countries that are very small. They don't have the same investment, but they too are lifting their game to challenge some of the big ones. That is fantastic to see.

They used the strengths of France and Paris and incorporated that into a show for the world.Now, as you say, the USA knows better than anybody how to put on a good show. It's going to be very different in Los Angeles, of course. They've hosted the Olympics a couple of times before. They know how to do that.

Welcome. Colonel, great to see you. Let's start with the latest barrage of rockets from Hezbollah. Do you believe that this is a precursor of what's to come? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, &amp; U.S. AIR FORCE: Yeah, and I think there is a distinct possibility that it is a precursor. Of course, there has been firing of rockets for quite some time now between Hezbollah and Israel. And of course, the Israeli response to that has been fairly robust ever since October 7th and even before that. But, this is a bit different. This seems like there is a concentrated push to actually fire rockets in a very discreet fashion to very discreet targets in northern Israel, and that seems to be an indicator that they're going in that direction.",

Back in April, the U.S. was instrumental in actually shooting down a lot of the missiles and other aerial bodies, such as UAVs, that were fired against Israel.

Those batteries would have 10 missiles in each of them. These are receptor missiles that would then be able to shoot down any incoming short-range missile, basically missiles that are about 70 kilometers in range. So, that would cover the Hezbollah threat. But, the Israelis have systems other than the Iron Dome that would be used for most of the missiles that would come from as far away as Iran. Those systems would be able to take out everything from medium range to long-range missiles, as well as ballistic intercontinental missiles, should the Iranians decide to fire any of those at Israel.So, the systems are there. It's basically a layered air defense system. And between Iron Dome, David's Sling, and the Arrow 3 system, Israel would have a robust capability to defend itself. It will probably not be foolproof, but will certainly be very effective.",
