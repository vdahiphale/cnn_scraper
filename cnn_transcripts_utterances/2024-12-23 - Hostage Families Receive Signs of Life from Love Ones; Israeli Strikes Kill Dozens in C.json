      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, welcome to the show, I'm Bianna Golodryga in for Isa Soares. Tonight, a damning reportinto former Congressman Matt Gaetz. The House Ethics Committee says Donald Trump's first pick for Attorney General paid tens of thousands of dollars for sex and drugs. We'll give you the details. Plus, Luigi Mangione appears in court. The man accused of fatally shooting the UnitedHealthcare CEO pleads not guilty to murder and terrorism charges. And diplomacy in Damascus. Representatives from around the world head to Syria as the country looks towards a new future. Now, we begin with a damning report just released by the U.S. House Ethics Committee on Matt Gaetz, Donald Trump's first choice to run the Justice Department. It finds the former Republican congressman paid for sex and drugs numerous times, including paying a 17-year-old girl for sex in 2017, in violation of a law against statutory rape. The report also found substantial evidence that Gaetz improperly accepted gifts while in office. Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration for Attorney General last month. He denies wrongdoing, even suggesting that he may now run for Florida governor or the Senate. Let's get more now from CNN's Katelyn Polantz who has been covering this story from this morning in Washington. And, Katelyn, the Ethics report states that Gaetz violated state law and house rules. Obviously, Gaetz's last-minute attempt to block the release failed. What is he now saying about it aside from saying he may once again run for office? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER:  Well, he's saying that it's false. That the things here that the House finds are not true, and that he wasn't prosecuted for any crime. That part is true, that he was not prosecuted for any crime. But what the House has done here in this report is, they've not just summed up the findings that Matt Gaetz engaged in commercial sex or paying for sex with women, allegedly engaged in statutory rape, which the House believes may be against Florida law. That's sex with a girl, a woman who was 17-year-old at the time, a girl at the time in 2017 at a party where he was having sex with her twice, and that also he was using illegal drugs at the time he was a member of Congress. Summing this up, the committee says there are several significant violations here. They say the committee determined, there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges and obstruction of Congress. The way that the House committee got to this, and they're showing their work in releasing this report today along with appendices, exhibits, is that they have interviewed more than a half-dozen witnesses, including the then under-age girl Matt Gaetz had sex with in 2017 at a party. They're also having text messages and they're tracing the payments. Often times, these women are telling the committee, they say that the women knew that they were being paid with the expectation that they would have sex with Matt Gaetz or that they were being paid for drugs that they were bringing to his rendezvous. And one of the things that they pointed out is that aside from this situation with this underage girl, where he's having sex with her at a party, there's also a woman who was paid more than $5,000 in total, and also women who were of age, who were adults going on a trip with him --",

And so, that made it so that he wasn't in violation of any federal sex trafficking laws. The Justice Department did decline to prosecute him. Now, Gaetz's biggest issue in his -- when he went to court this morning is, he's saying that the House is defaming him. They're invading his privacy by releasing this report, and this report is essentially damaging his reputation, his professional standing.

Well, with just a few weeks of his presidency to go, Joe Biden has commuted the sentences of 37 death-row inmates to life in prison without the possibility of parole. It's a decision that leaves only three federal prisoners, whose crimes included mass shootings or acts of terrorism awaiting execution. And it comes as President-elect Donald Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment reclaims the White House next month. Our M.J. Lee has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MIN JUNG LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  In one of his last major acts as President, President Biden is using his presidential clemency power to commute the death sentences of 37 inmates that are currently on federal death row to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Now, remember, back in 2020, President Biden campaigned on getting rid of the federal death penalty. And in recent weeks, there had been a swirl of speculation about whether he might take this kind of action before he leaves office, particularly as he was under a good amount of pressure from human rights activists and a number of advocacy groups, some of whom have argued that the death penalty tends to disproportionately affect black people and other people of color. Now, President Biden, in his statement announcing these commutations said this. \"Make no mistake, I condemn these murderers, but guided by my conscience and my experience, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level. In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.\" That last reference there to a new administration resuming executions I halted. That, obviously is a reference to incoming President Donald Trump. Keep in mind that during his first term in office, there were 13 federal death row inmates who were put to death, and in his most recent presidential campaign, Trump has made very clear that he is set on moving forward with additional federal executions once he returns to office. This is a little bit of what Donald Trump has said over the last year on this issue. DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  And I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer. (CHEERS) (APPLAUSE) We are an institute and a powerful death penalty, we will put this on. We have to bring in the death penalty if we want to stop the infestation of drugs coming into our country.",

One of the brothers of the Boston Marathon bombing, and then also Robert Bowers, the man who killed 11 people at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018. I should finally note that President Biden, who is a devout Catholic, says he will be traveling back to Italy to meet with Pope Francis. Of course, the pontiff is one of -- one of those people who has publicly said that he would like to see the commutations of those on federal death row here in the United States. Back to you.

And whether or not the two were headed for an inevitable collision in terms of maybe Elon Musk wielding too much power or stealing Donald Trump's thunder. On the one hand, the fact that Donald Trump even raised the idea, suggests that its top of mind for him. The other is that Elon Musk, thus far at least, has proven to be a useful ally, specifically when it comes to dangling threats to others that may be challenging him within the party in terms of primaries.

But to some of the other headlines we heard over the weekend from Donald Trump, some of them sounded quite familiar, particularly the idea of wanting to purchase Greenland. We thought that was done and over with in the first term. And yet, here we're getting a preview of what's to come perhaps. The Panama Canal being another issue, Donald Trump saying that despite the fact that there's a decade's long treaty between Panama and the United States, that he thinks they're being unfairly overcharged. And when it comes down to it, he may very well take control back once again of the Panama Canal, getting into a Twitter war of sorts with the President of Panama. Is this just something that maybe somebody mentioned to him right before he spoke, or do you think this is perhaps a preview of some of the diplomacy we may see in the months to come?",

He alsotalked jokingly, obviously, about Canada becoming the 51st state, but often with Trump, a joke is not truly a joke. It's a way of exerting pressure and bargaining. I think a lot of it comes from Trump's vision of almost every dispute in the world as a business deal, almost like a real estate dispute. He's talked about Gaza, for example, he once said that Gaza could look as great as Monaco, and it wouldn't be very easy to -- it wouldn't be very hard to fix the situation there, which is kind of absurd. One thing where I think this is very interesting, though, is it's almost like a 19th century colonial mindset that Trump has, that big countries should be able to lean on small countries or influence them, or even buy a little bit off. From where that's really interesting is in the context of Ukraine, because that's exactly what Vladimir Putin has done in Ukraine. And Trump is saying and he said this weekend that he plans to try and fix that situation, to end the war and get together with Vladimir Putin. So, if that's the way he sees things, that tells us a lot about the kind of solution that he might be envisioning for Ukraine.

Putin, just a few days ago, at a nationwide press conference said the two hadn't spoken in four years. But he's also welcome to meet, and then I saw a headline where at least per the Kremlin, there have been numerous offers now in terms of where such a meeting could take place. I'm just thinking about the stark difference from what we've heard in the Biden administration as it relates to the war, that no decision would be made without Ukraine at the table.

That's because he said they have thousands of hours of videotape tracking Mangione's movements. As you know from the investigation and what we've seen and what we've reported, they have tracked Mangione arriving in New York City, going to surveil the Hilton Hotel, where he allegedly shot the UnitedHealthcare CEO up at the hostel where he had spent the night, and then at the bus stop at one point along the journey. So, a lot of that evidence, the prosecution says they have, and they said that they will begin to produce it on a rolling basis so that Mangione's team can look at it. And the judge has decided to set a date for late February of the next time they will be in court, and where they will then discuss where they are in terms of turning over information. But the prosecution said that to speed things up, he would suggest that Mangione's attorney give them a hard drive of two terabytes. That kind of gives you a sense of just the size and the volume of the materials that they've collected, and that will all be turned over to Mangione's team for their defense. But in addition to the New York state charges, there's also evidence that was collected in the Pennsylvania case where he's facing Commonwealth charges there, and then, of course, the federal charges as well.
