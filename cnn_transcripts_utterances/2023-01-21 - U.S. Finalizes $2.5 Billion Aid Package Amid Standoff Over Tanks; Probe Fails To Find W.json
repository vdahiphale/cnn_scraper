And when they do, they have been slaughtered because of a lack of training. As Russia is still very active in the air. They're continuing to use missiles and rockets to harass Ukrainian citizens.So, the point is that if Ukraine is going to retake ground, and I think they will, they have to conduct these combined arms operations both in the southeast and continue to counter any kind of Russia advances in the Donbass, in the North and the East. So, it is going to be important as you get out of the winter weather, winter slows operations down. It's tougher to conduct operations, and there had been unbelievably tough slugfest in the East and in the Southwest even during the winter. I think we're going to see things heat up quite a bit.

The announcement that they would be named a terrorist organization, or excuse me, an organization that is criminal would, would mean that they can not only go after the groups themselves, but those who fund them.

So, in their letter, the Department of Justice wrote that consistent with long standing policy and practice, any oversight requests, requests must be weighed against the department's interest in protecting the integrity of its work. Really, they're trying to lean on past precedent to say that we can't give some of these documents. Now, the Judiciary Committee did not respond in kind, they really tweeted really quickly after why is the DOJ so scared to cooperate with our investigations. Now, for the White House's side, they have not yet responded to official requests from the Judiciary Committee or the Oversight Committee. Officials, when you talk to them, they say that we will respond to good faith inquiries.

DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: First of all, Amara and Boris, I have to say that no one looks forward to getting a colonoscopy. I think I can say that with a fair amount of certainty. So, this might be some welcome news overall when looking at screenings. First of all, who should get a primary screening? That first screening. There is nothing that's changing here with these recommendations. People between the ages of 45 and 75. As you see there, they lowered the age recommendation a few years ago. It used to be 50, now, they say 45. What this study was really looking at was trying to figure out what about people who had a negative screening test, and now they're going for their 10-year follow up? How likely is that to return some positive results or to catch something? And they did 120,000 -- about 120,000 colonoscopies in Germany, and this what they found, that at 10 years, women, about 3.6 percent of the time with a previous negative screening would now catch something. With men, it's a little bit higher. If you went to 14 years, it was still a bit higher. But you get a sense of the numbers here in terms of just how many times you're going to catch something on that interval screening. This is a study that came out. Again, nothing is changing in terms of a recommendations. But I think the question might be, should the interval be spread out a little bit more, particularly, in women and younger people? So, we'll wait and see on that. Again, I want to emphasize that the value of the primary screening is still really high. No one is suggesting that people should not get that first screening. In fact, let me just show you the numbers that we polled, a 40 percent risk reduction for getting colon cancer. I mean, if you found a polyp or something preventing a cancer, 68 percent risk reduction from dying from colon cancer. And again, keep in mind, this is the third leading cause of death in the United States, cancer death. About 50,000 people die every year of colon cancer. So, though that's what's sort of being considered right now in terms of looking at the screenings, looking at the interval, looking at the studies, and we'll see if this translates into a change in the recommendations.

More than two dozen House Republicans have laid out their demands to avoid the nation's first ever debt defaults. Those range from new immigration policies to imposing deep domestic spending cuts. And those cuts could have profound implications for infrastructure spending. Joining me now is Brian Harrell.

But a lot of these substations are remote. They're not manned in terms of people being on site. There are some protections as some of your larger critical substations. The things that are pushing electricity from point A to point B. There's a lot of protections associated with those. But some of the smaller distribution level substations, the ones that are kind of feeding your house, if you will. There's not as many protections associated with those.

And so, this is heightened concern, obviously, for the industry. And I think they have done a very good job of addressing this. The best partner that industry has right now is our government and national security partners. You mentioned the DHS memo, it was spot on, it really highlighted the need for greater resilience, more vigilance when it comes to this. And so, having more law enforcement patrols, adding more protections to our critical infrastructure (INAUDIBLE). And making the right investments.
