Yes, they can do a lot of messaging those -- they will do about the border about IRS, other issues that will pass the House, have no chance to pass in the Senate, even if Republicans are in control because of the 60 vote threshold of the Senate and, of course, the president in the White House who's a Democrat. But what about raising the national debt limit and extending government funding? How early does McCarthy concede on some of those issues to Democrats? Or does he dig in and get what he wants? At the end of the day, does it lead to the possibility of a shutdown or a debt default? How does he come out on the other end of those fights?

And so we might know earlier, though, in 2020 it took a lot longer in that district. But also in 2018, Elaine Luria was one of the majority makers. She was one of the main reasons why Democrats took over and took over so big in the United States House of Representatives, and it's also a district that has gone back and forth back and forth so many times.

It also goes into more rural districts. It was more of a Democratic district, even though Tom Malinowski beat the same opponent, Thomas Kean Jr. by just 1.2 years ago, that was a district at the time that Democrats, Joe Biden carried by about 10 points.Now, after redistricting, Joe Biden carried that same new district by about three points. So it is now more favored for Republicans, but it's somehow for Republicans, even though it is still Democratic leaning, if somehow Malinowski were able to hold on to that district, perhaps not as big of a wave, perhaps a rip of sorts, but still Malinowski very much the underdog heading in --",
