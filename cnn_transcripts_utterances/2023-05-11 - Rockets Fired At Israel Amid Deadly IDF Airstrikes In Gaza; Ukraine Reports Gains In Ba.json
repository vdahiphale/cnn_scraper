And even amid all that, a kind of a sympathetic audience and a tendency to mislead and openly lie, he made a series of statements that I think any Democrat is going to look at as extremely damaging for a general election. And especially when you consider that the 2018, 2020, and 2022 elections, all three had the same pattern with the Republicans underperforming in white-collar suburbs that used to vote Republican in part because those voters feel disconnected and alienated by the values of the Trump era GOP. He said he would pardon most of the January 6th rioters. He said twice that he was honored that his appointments had overturned Roe v. Wade. And then he further said that the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the constitutional right to abortion gave him leverage to produce a national law that would satisfy pro-life voters. And he also said that he would resume the practice if strongly signaled that if he's reelected, he would resume the practice of separating families, kids from their parents at the border. And in all of those ways, not to mention demeaning E.

We have gone through areas of family separations, talk of build the wall, mass deportations under Obama. And through all these different policies, really nothing has stemmed the tide of migration. And that's because for so many of the Central Americans, people from around the world who are migrating, this is not a choice that they are living. Migration is a matter of survival.

And this is very much a pressing issue, not only for Republicans, but Democrats as well, because as Republicans have seized on this issue politically, because it resonates very much with their base, what we see on the Democratic side is really a failure to counter this type of misinformation. I think the average American voter knows where Republicans stand on immigration. They want to shut down the border, and they don't want to let more people in. But when it gets to the Biden administration's approach, I think people are not even sure what that is. So far, President Biden has tried to move on immigration in sort of what he sees as a balanced attempt between a balance between border security and a more humane approach. But so far, that really doesn't seem to be working. And we saw a polling out just this month, a Global Strategy Group about two-thirds, 68 percent of Americans want a humane immigration system and border security. It doesn't always have to be an either or type of situations. I think for the Biden administration, they're trying to figure out that balance, but it's going to be a rough few months ahead.",
