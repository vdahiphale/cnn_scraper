But also, as you noted, I was also told that investigators believe he did have help once he ran away from this medical transport. But, Kate, let's take a step back. Again, it's almost exactly 24 hours ago that Shane Pryor, 17 years old, escaped from custody.He was charged with a murder back in 2000 -- excuse me, from -- back in 2020. He was accused of murdering a woman in an alley. He's been awaiting trial though since then. And he's been in the Philadelphia Juvenile Justice Services Center. He was arrested when he was 14 years old. Then yesterday, like I said about 24 hours ago from this exact moment, he was transported from that juvenile detention center to the Children's Hospital Philadelphia when then police say he ran out of the vehicle that he was being transported in and basically evaded capture and has stayed on the run since then. Now, notably, there are a few things that came up in this police press conference yesterday afternoon. First, it appears from the surveillance video that Mr. Pryor was not in any restraints. He had no handcuffs on, no shackles on which was how he was able to run away from those who were transporting him. The other thing that police said is that he was actually seen in other surveillance videos and from other witnesses going from building to building potentially looking for a cell phone or the resources to get out of the area. Well, that law enforcement official that I spoke with this morning says that they believe that he was able to contact someone and that someone has been able to help him. So, it's a bit of a mess. Again, 24 hours later, still no reported confirmed sightings of him at this point. But police are saying this is a dangerous individual, and they're asking Philadelphians or anyone in the area, if you do come in contact with him, don't try to contact him just call police. At this point, we're also I should send -- mention, Kate, I was in contact with his defense attorney. We're expecting to get a comment from the attorney who's been representing him later on today, Kate.",
