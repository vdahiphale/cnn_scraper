Right now, that is part of the defense process wrapping up, their argument. But the day started with a swatting call at Judge Arthur Engoron's home. Judge Engoron did not address the news of that in court today. He is just the latest official involved in Trump's various legal cases to face threats or a swatting incident -- Boris.",

      "sentences": "Now to the case itself.Judge Engoron has already determined that Trump committed fraud and is liable. The trial is now going to determine what that will cost him and potentially his future as a businessman, the New York attorney general seeking $370 million in disgorgement of profits. She also wants the court to bar Trump from doing business in New York, as well as five-year bans for his two adult sons. To recap, prosecutors argue that the Trump Organization inflated real estate values on some signature Trump properties, including his estate at Mar-a-Lago. They allege that this issue wasn't the result of simple accounting errors or subjective differences in valuations, but that they were a deliberate effort to defraud, like vastly exaggerating the square footage of certain properties. Now, Trump and his team have denied those claims. And, meantime, as we mentioned, Trump is now talking in court right now, the judge allowing him to address the court. But, remember, just a day ago, the former president refused to agree to these preconditions set by Judge Engoron. Of course, Trump has done most of these things just outside the courtroom, literally every time he's appeared at this trial. That was again the case this morning. We're going to find out what the former president is saying in court right now. Cameras are not allowed in that room. We are expecting he will address the courtroom from outside once this wraps up later today. As for what the next step looks like, remember, there's no jury in this case, so no deliberations. After closing arguments, we're going to hear Judge Engoron resume the case. Then he will rule by a written ruling that he says could come as early as the end of the month. And then, of course, come the appeals that Trump and his team have promised. Let's get the latest from inside the courtroom now with CNN's Paula Reid. She's live outside the courthouse for us. Paula, a bit of a surprise that the judge would allow Donald Trump to address the court.",

      "sentences": "You know, nothing in this trial has been surprising. Everything that we think is going to happen according to certain courts changes and it doesn't happen. So it doesn't surprise me at all that the judge allowed Trump to speak, because part of the reason he gave initially of why he would allow Trump to speak is he said he had more on the line in this case than anyone else.And since there is no jury, he said it was only fair to let Trump speak. But, of course, as you just laid out, Trump went beyond the contours of what the judge wanted to be permissible here by talking about a witch-hunt, by making this a political case and not arguing just the facts in the case. But, for closing arguments, for the bulk of it, they were mostly delivered by Chris Kise, his attorney, and he did stick to the facts in the case. And he went through the evidence that was presented, saying to the judge that the attorney general's office did not present any witnesses who testified that there was fraud here. And that has been a core, consistent theme of the defense, that there was no banker who said they would have done anything differently if they had gotten different financial statements, so saying that the A.G. didn't meet their burden and didn't bring this case. Now, part of Kise's closing argument, he said: \"This entire case is a manufactured claim to serve a political agenda. It has always been press releases and posturing, but no proof at all. The attorney general is seeking to strip them, according to the papers, of everything. No one from the marketplace showed up and said there was a problem.\" So, then, again, that's the core of this argument here, that they didn't have the witnesses testify. Now, the judge has already ruled in this case that the financial statements were fraudulent, that the values of some of these properties were inflated that, the value of Trump's triplex apartment in Manhattan was inflated. So he's already made a number of these determinations, and even in a ruling last month, he said that some of the witnesses that Trump's team put on, he said, were just not credible. So he's already laid down the contours of what he thinks of this evidence in the case, but, of course, everyone gets their shot today to try to convince him a little bit more. We also heard from Alina Habba, another one of the attorneys representing Trump and some of the co-defendants in this case. She made a point of saying that there was no fraud. Both she and Kise focused a lot on Michael Cohen, who was the attorney general's -- one of their witnesses, the one witness who testified that he was told indirectly by Trump to boost the values of these properties, along with Allen Weisselberg, the former CFO. And this investigation started when Michael Cohen testified before Congress in 2019. The attorney general's office has been clear about that. So they were focusing on his credibility, because, during Cohen's testimony, initially, he said Trump directed him. Then he walked it back and said it wasn't a direct -- a directive, that it was known, an inference that Trump gives. Now, Trump's sons are also on trial here. Eric Trump was in the courtroom today, along with Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn. He was sitting beside him. Their attorneys also had a quick shot at the end, and they also said that there was no evidence against their clients.",

But it is quite stunning that his attorney was asked to control his client by the judge. And, clearly, he couldn't and didn't, and didn't want to.

This one, though, in particular, really gets to the heart of who Donald Trump purports to be, which is a shrewd businessman. And fraud -- this case, he's committed fraud, the judge has said. It's really just an issue here of how extreme it is. And that's the question. And there is also the attorney general trying to stop him from being able to do business in New York, the threat in a way to his identity, if that is the case.

It's one of the reasons we have seen him show up so many times during the course of this case, because, as you noted, it's not just how many hundreds of millions of dollars they could have to pay out in this civil case. It's also the possibility is on the line that they may not be able to do business here in the state of New York. Now, I want to caveat that, even if that is put forth as one of the penalties here, it would likely results in years and years of appeals, but this is incredibly personal. There's no jail time on the line here. This is not a criminal case, like the ones he is facing at a different courthouse here in Manhattan and in Florida and, of course, in Washington, D.C.

Prosecutors say that he made millions of dollars working with businesses in Ukraine and in China and used a lot of that money to fund an extravagant lifestyle. Everything from exotic cars to exotic dancers, they say, is what he was spending his money on and not paying his taxes on time. Now, Hunter Biden has since repaid those back taxes. And one of the arguments he and his lawyers are making is that he wouldn't be facing these charges if it wasn't for the fact that Republicans have been putting pressure on the Justice Department to go after him. And so, obviously, six months ago, Hunter Biden was within minutes, minutes of sealing a plea agreement that would have washed away all of these charges. He would have pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors and a diversion program for a gun that he purchased at a time that he was prohibited. Now he's facing two sets of charges, one in Delaware for the -- for that gun, and now these nine counts for tax evasion and filing false tax returns.
