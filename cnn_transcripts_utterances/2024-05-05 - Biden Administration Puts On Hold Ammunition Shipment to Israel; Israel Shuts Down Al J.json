      "sentences": "You are in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" Hi, everyone. I'm Jessica Dean in Washington. We begin with breaking news. CNN has learned the Biden administration has paused a shipment of U.S. made ammunition to Israel. It appears to be the first time the U.S. has stopped a weapons shipment to the Israeli military since the October 7 Hamas attacks.And it comes amid growing tensions between the U.S. and Israel over the war in Gaza and during high-stakes negotiations to reach a potential ceasefire and hostage deal. Let's get right over to CNN's Priscilla Alvarez, who's here with us. Priscilla, what more are you learning about all of this?",

      "sentences": "Well, a source could not disclose why the decision was made to pause this particular shipment, but two important points here. It is not linked to what is believed to Israel's potential ground invasion of Rafah that's in the southern Gaza Strip, where more than a million Palestinians have been sheltering and has been a concern for the U.S. if Israel were to move in and continue that operation or at least start it.The second point that the source made is that it is not affecting other shipments. That's to say that this is a shipment that was paused. It's unclear why, but the expectation here is that other ammunition shipments will continue to Israel. Now, when I asked the White House about this, the National Security Council spokesperson gave me a statement that says the following, quote, \"The United States has surged billions of dollars and security assistance to Israel since the October 7 attacks, passed the largest ever supplemental appropriation for emergency assistance to Israel letting unprecedented coalition to defend Israel against Iranian attacks, and will continue to do what is necessary to ensure Israel can defend itself from the threats it faces.\" So, from this statement, you can tell U.S. officials maintain no policy change with Israel. This pause in shipment does not signal that there will be a policy change. And we should note that those appropriations that the statement refers to is that $26 billion that the U.S. sent to Israel to help with the Israel-Hamas conflict. So, while we don't know all the details here, it is clear that the U.S. is not changing its position and that, you know, as far as we know, it is not linked to that potential Rafah operation they're concerned about.",

He's going to stay in Doha for a continuation of those talks.Oftentimes, he is deployed in intensive moments. And he is part of this multi-party discussion that's happening with Israel, Hamas, Qatar and Egypt. So, the fact that he is there is significant. But of course, these hostage talks are consistently fluid. So, we don't know when a deal is reached until the very last minute. So, of course, the White House has kept this as a top priority for them. They have continued to have these conversations. The president himself speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last weekend. So, all of this clearly in an intensive phase with the CIA director staying in the region.

There has been repeated comments and repeated State Department, CIA officials trying to message the fact that the Biden administration is not happy with the way the Netanyahu government is conducting this conflict, especially the efforts of humanitarian aid.So, it could be a signal saying we can do this, even though, as Priscilla mentioned, you know, they went to great lengths to say that this is not having to do with potential operations in Rafah. I personally think it is, because I think the Biden administration has given the warning on multiple occasions. This is something saying you can't conduct operations that kill innocent citizens.

      "sentences": "You know, Jessica, negotiations succeed when there's urgency, when there's sufficient amounts of pain on one hand, accompanied by sufficient amounts of gain on the other. And as I look at this and I look at the Netanyahu government's motives, at least the prime minister's and Hamas's motives, I don't see either of them in a hurry. They both have to be pushed because I think they both understand that they prefer not to see this this deal take place.There are fundamentally different objectives, I think, that the two sides have. And remember, the key Palestinian decision maker is making decisions ensconced in a tunnel somewhere meters below Rafah and Khan Yunis, or maybe even in Sinai, together with hostages. So, it's a curious way to negotiate. The fact that Bill Burns is on his way to see the prime minister, will be there on Monday, I think, is a good sign that, in fact, there's still the possibility of closing this. But under these circumstances, it's really hard to imagine that both parties really want this and are prepared to pay the political price and costs for it. DEAN: Yeah. And then we're unsure. Apparently, the CIA director's plans are fluid, but he is remaining in the region. I remember you saying last week that once he got there, that that was a signal that we should see that as things are serious, but we'll see what can kind of come out of this. And Mark, in terms of going into Rafah, Benjamin Netanyahu has said that they want to go in whether or not there is a deal in place, regardless of if there is a deal in place. And the defense minister says troops should expect intense action in Rafah there. It is one of the stickiest sticking points in these negotiations. Of course, Hamas wants the war to come to an end. Israel wants a pause and wants to go into Rafah. The U.S. has said again and again that it wants to see a plan that's going to protect these over one million civilians that are there in that area. But sources have told CNN that while they've seen some plans, nothing that the administration considers an executable plan. So, Mark, what does the U.S. do with the Rafah situation? What will Israel likely do?",

If you look at it from 10,000 feet, what you see are all the contradictions and all the challenges of this war, how to prosecute a war against a terrorist organization which embeds its assets in and around and under civilian populations. The Israelis will be bumping up against a treaty partner. The Egyptians are extremely nervous. And third, the humanitarian situation. The Israelis cannot possibly move 1.2 million humans into sanctuaries where they have access to potable water, shelter, medical care and sanitation quickly. If the Israelis wanted to do this, they wanted to cooperate with the Egyptians and with various NGOs, perhaps over a period of weeks and months, that could be done. But I don't think that's what's on the prime minister's mind.General Hertling is absolutely correct. There are four brigades or battalions down there of Hamas fighters. If Mr. Netanyahu is going to continue to propagate the myth of total victory, he's going to have to destroy the organized structure, military structure of Hamas down there. So, I think unless there's a deal, I suspect that the Israelis will go in and conduct some kind of operation in Rafah.",

Netanyahu has accused Al Jazeera of being, quote, \"a mouthpiece of Hamas.\" He has done that for quite some time. That's not just something that's happened over this weekend.So, this will only bring more scorn against the Israeli government, especially Prime Minister Netanyahu. The United Nations has already condemned this move by saying, you know, it's an affront to journalists and free press everywhere. You know, it is one of those kinds of things where Netanyahu has always had basically bad feelings about Al Jazeera, and it has continued to grow as this war has gone on. He feels that they are part of the Hamas organization or at least supporting it. The fact that the debate or the discussions in Qatar contributed to this might be a factor, but it's interesting that he's pulled the plug today. And it also tells me again, I'll go back to the point I made earlier, that there is a potential real quick action about to occur in Rafah.",

People did not listen. People got arrested. Things got extremely violent and authorities had to deal with the chaos and the violence then.
