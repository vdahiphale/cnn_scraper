They've been waiting there for a few minutes, this sort of gallery of Republican Senators awaiting former President Trump. His first visit to Capitol Hill since January 6th. The first time that he's seen many of these lawmakers in person in the nation's capital. And he is walking out now to applause. We'll be listening in to former President Trump as he delivers his message. He spoke earlier in the day with congressional Republicans, House members, and actually seemed to be happy that many of those who voted to impeach him during the second impeachment were no longer around. He also, during this afternoon's session with Senators, seemed to have a sort of reproachment with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, somebody who criticized him heavily after January 6t h. Now McConnell is supporting him in his bid for the presidency. Here is Donald Trump.",

      "sentences": "Right. So Donald Trump, I mean, this is what he wanted. He wanted to see a rallying around him from these lawmakers. And It's funny because a lot of the things that you fact- checked are the exact same things he says on the campaign trail. We're also told, even though these we're closed-door meetings, we've got some reporting from inside the room of him repeating a lot of these false claims behind closed doors to them as well.But look, I think this is a huge moment for Donald Trump, very significant. And It's his first time really meeting with a massive group of lawmakers since leaving office. And also, he's now the presumptive Republican nominee. He was recently convicted. This is his first time meeting with them after that verdict in Manhattan. And so this was important for him. And when I talked to Donald Trump's advisers, they stressed to me that they really wanted to see unity. Of course, there were some people missing today. We know Senator Susan Collins, Senator Lisa Murkowski, two people who often break with Donald Trump and Republicans at large, were not there. You mentioned the -- the icy relationship with Mitch McConnell, which continues to be icy despite McConnell having endorsed Donald Trump earlier this year. But they really want everyone to be supporting the former president, particularly as we head into this stretch into the summer and the fall. Of course, It's not just Donald Trump who is facing an election. It's many of these members as well, all of the House members and many of these Senate Republicans. And so that was a big part of this, too. They want everyone to be on the same message. They want them to be showing their support for Donald Trump. And that's what we're told really happened, that they we're giving him the warm welcome that he very much expected and was hoping he would have.",

      "sentences": "He told folks in the room that many of them would be re- elected.Let's talk to Scott Jennings to get some perspective. Scott, I really want to ask you about Mitch McConnell. You obviously worked for the Senator. But there was something that I realized. After he stopped talking, he said we have to get elected. He made no mention of a huge issue, reproductive rights and abortion, despite the fact that there was this Supreme Court decision earlier today. What do you make of the fact that the president didn't actually bring up an issue that's in the headlines right now? SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, he's not running on it. I mean, that's what Joe Biden is running on. I mean, when you're running a political campaign, you try to frame campaigns and the issues of the day around what you want to be talking about. And the things he started with today were borders, our military, and the fact that there are Russian warships off the coast of Florida. And so Trump's entire strategic imperative every day, I think, is to frame this election as strength versus weakness. And the first -- first three things he brought up fit right into that frame. So I'm not surprised he didn't bring it up. Although he's been quite clear about his position, should be left to the states. He's pro IVF. He believes in the exceptions, which is the old Reagan position. He's laid out a marker. And I think most Republicans are kind of falling in line behind that. But that's not what he's running his race on. It's the other stuff that I mentioned and that's why he started with it, I think, today.",

Democrats will disagree with it. I do find it noteworthy, in the polling, national and in the states, that that when you ask people who's better for democracy, Biden or Trump, It's very evenly split. And even in a survey I saw to Georgia last week, Trump was ahead on that measurement. So I think, starting out the election cycle, Democrats thought this was going to be something that they we're going to be able to run on and have a wide lead on that particular issue point. But it really hasn't borne itself out. I think Trump goes back to that well, because I think they think they've successfully muddied the waters on this issue. And I think he believes his criminal issues, his legal issues is what he would point to as the interference in democracy.",

And he knows that Donald Trump, at the head of the ticket, will have a huge impact on that.Look at where the races exist. Ohio, Trump's going to win Ohio. Montana, Trump's going to win Montana. Nevada, Trump's doing very well here. And so all these are top-tier Senate races. And it is imperative and vital, I think, for the Republican Party to have the Senate Committee under Senator Daines and the presidential campaign rowing the boat in the same direction. So that reunification is about winning the Senate, which is what McConnell wants to get accomplished this year.",
