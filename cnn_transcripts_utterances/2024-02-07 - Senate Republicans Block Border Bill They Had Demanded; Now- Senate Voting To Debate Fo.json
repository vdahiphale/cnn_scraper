Democratic Senator Joe Manchin's here and we'll talk to him about the drama playing out across the aisle. Plus, one day away from Donald Trump's first real case before the U.S. Supreme Court. He's trying to keep his name on election ballots and states across the country as his actions on January 6 come into question. Ahead, this critical moment for his legal team and for Chief Justice John Roberts, who's tried to keep the court out of politics. And four months to the day since the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel on October 7th, I'm going to ask the father of a hostage about the new ceasefire proposal that could result in the freeing of his daughter.

I'm Jake Tapper.There was a showdown on the U.S. Senate floor today as Republicans failed, yet again, to agree on a border bill that included much of what Republicans themselves have been demanding. This is really one of the most remarkable turns in recent political history. Just to bring you up to speed, last fall, Senate Republicans demanded that any aid to Ukraine and Israel not be passed unless Congress also addressed the U.S.'s border crisis. And then months and months later, after a lot of work, that compromise happened. And Sunday night, those senators got what \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board, which is rather conservative, is calling, quote, the most restrictive migrant legislation in decades, which \"The Journal\" means as a compliment. It is legislation that the conservative Biden-mocking Border Patrol Union supports. And on Tuesday, Republican leader McConnell seemed excited that something would finally be accomplished to address this catastrophe. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY): This is a humanitarian and security crisis of historic proportions. And Senate Republicans have assisted, not just for months, but for years at this urgent crisis demanded action. Three months ago, we asked our colleague, Senator Lankford, to lead that action.

And the one thing that's really difficult for them to defend against is the so-called meat assaults that we saw firsthand near the front lines there in Avdiivka. Essentially what the Russians do is they send small units of assault troops that continuously assault Ukrainian positions and they hope to at some point break through.Now, what we're hearing from Avdiivka is that apparently in the south of the city and to the north of the city as well, there are some places where the Russians have now gone gained a foothold, but they did lose a lot of people in the process of being able to do that. I was in one command center with the Ukrainians where you could literally see the ground in those areas littered with the bodies of dead Russians. And there were some who were still out there who apparently been separated from their units. So it's certainly has been costly for the Russians. I'd say at this point, they by no means have that town. The Ukrainian say the situation there is critical, but they don't believe that they've lost that town just yet. They believe Jake that the Russians badly want that town because they want to give Vladimir Putin a win ahead of the Russian presidential elections on March 17th, Jake.",
