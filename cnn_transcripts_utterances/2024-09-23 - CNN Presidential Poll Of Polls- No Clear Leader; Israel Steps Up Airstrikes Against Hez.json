Always wonderful to have you.So we've just got some new numbers in -- just in the last couple of minutes posted on The New York Times -- New York Times/Siena College poll. They did a Sunbelt look and the headline out of it seems to be that Donald Trump basically is doing well across the Sunbelt. And, in fact, they found that the tightest of these states is actually North Carolina which, of course, Joe Biden didn't win in 2020. It was Donald Trump's narrowest victory. But there you see this Siena College poll -- 49-47 in North Carolina. Georgia and Arizona show that he has a slightly wider lead there. Arizona, in particular -- my Republican sources think is pretty much gone for the Harris team. That's one where Donald Trump seems to have a strong edge. Georgia, still some questions about Black turnout -- whether that might change things. But I think you're seeing here why Harris has spent so much time in North Carolina. You add this together with, of course, what we've seen from Mark Robinson -- the scandal at the top of the statewide ticket there. What do make of these latest numbers? SHELBY TALCOTT, REPORTER, SEMAFOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah. You know, you and I talk about polls a lot and I think it's important to note that it -- the race is so close, and that's exactly what these polls represent. Even if Donald Trump is up a little bit or Kamala Harris is up a little bit, in a lot of these polls it's within the margin of error. And that's exactly what the campaigns are seeing and that's why we're seeing the campaigns go to North Carolina a lot, go to Pennsylvania a lot, go to a lot of these states. And another thing is a lot -- when I talk to, particularly, Donald Trump's campaign but Kamala Harris' campaign also, when we talk about the national polling, they are more focused on these battleground states. And so when these numbers come in for the battleground states specifically, that's what the campaigns are really interested in.",

In that NBC News poll that dropped over the weekend, they had her at 32 percent favorability back in July. It's 48 percent now. And now some of this is, of course, a reflection of people getting to know her throughout this. But I think one of the things I've been looking for is signs as to who is basically winning this war to define her, right? That was how the Trump campaign talked about it when she entered the race. That's how the Harris team has been talking about it. It seems like there may be some signs in this polling that it's the Harris team that is succeeding there. I mean, the head-to-head in this national -- in this NBC poll is now 49-44. That's a change from 45-47 back in July. Again, I think you're correct to point out the campaigns are not looking at these national head-to-heads the same way they're looking at the battlegrounds. But that number for Donald Trump is lower than it was -- perhaps a reflection of the way he's been running his own campaign as well. I mean, we know he has a floor, but he also has a ceiling, no?",

Kudos to President Biden and Vice President Harris in trying to tamp this down.Remember, Hezbollah unjustifiably started attacking Israel after October 7, and what that has done is that's opened up this second front. And now we're seeing the results, which is a really harsh reprisals now recently by Israel with the pager attacks, with targeted assassinations as well. Israel's north has been hammered by Hezbollah -- depopulating it over 100,000 civilians. So it's time to pull back. It's time to get, for example, Iran to pull back Hezbollah.

Joining me now to discuss the latest in this battleground state, former South Carolina state rep and CNN political commentator, Bakari Sellers. Bakari, good morning. Wonderful to have you. So look, you have been -- you and I have been talking about this race in North Carolina well before what our KFILE reported, and you have been insistent that there's no way there could be such a gap in the gubernatorial race that Robinson could be doing so badly and not have Kamala Harris pull out this race. Now, The New York Times polling still shows that Harris has a little bit of a gap here but it's within the margin of error. We had this reversed on the screens for our viewers who may have been watching a couple of minutes ago. But Harris is 47, Trump is 49. It's correct there. What impact do you think what happened with Robinson -- this new CNN report -- is going to have at the top of the ticket? Because the reality is that while North Carolina has sent Democrats to their governor's mansion in recent years, it has not voted for a Democrat since 2008 in the presidential race. BAKARI SELLERS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, (D) FORMER SOUTH CAROLINA STATE REPRESENTATIVE (via Webex by Cisco):  Yeah, certainly, but North Carolina is one of the states that's primed to be flipped this time. I think North Carolina has an interesting combination for the Harris campaign. It's one that has a ton of college-educated white voters. It's that corridor between Charlotte, North Carolina and the research triangle, which is Raleigh-Durham. And it has a lot of Black voters. One of the things the Harris campaign has to do is go outside of those areas to the eastern and western portion of the state. But you asked about Mark Robinson and the thing is Mark Robinson is running against an extremely good candidate in Josh Stein. But the steady drip, drip, drip -- Last week wasn't the first time that Mark Robinson has been marred by some type of scandal. I mean, he is anti-Black, anti-Semite who has said things such as Holocaust denial. And so for -- it's amazing to see that last week all of a sudden because of posts on nudeafrica.com or whatever it was it was a bridge too far when he has been taking bridges too far for so period -- so long a period of time that it's kind of baked into the cake in North Carolina now.",

But I would say that one of the things that makes Georgia so appetizing is the number of Black voters there inside Atlanta, inside of the Savannah area, inside of Richmond County-Augusta. And so when you -- when you look at that you say that she's always going to have punter's chance there. Before a very long period of time before Joe Biden, I just think that Georgia was a very -- you know, you saw what Stacey Abrams was able to do. Instead of going -- concentrating on sub precinct and able to flip that state and make it purple. You saw Warnock and Ossoff win. But it still is a very hard nut to crack for Democrats. And one of the things that you see in Arizona is the fact that immigration looms extremely large. And although we've made up a lot of ground on the issue of immigration we still have work to do. But I will tell you Arizona, with Ruben Gallego versus Kari Lake means that we have a chance. Because throughout this MAGA movement the candidates that the Republican Party have put up have just sucked. And so, Kari Lake is getting destroyed by Ruben Gallego. And then you don't have any other races on the ticket in Georgia. And so it just makes it a head-up race without anything else in the state of Georgia.

The 0-2 Ravens went to Dallas with their backs against the wall and ended up looking like their normal dominant selves. Lamar Jackson and company led 28-6 after three quarters. Now, the Cowboys did rally in the fourth quarter to cut the lead and make this one really interesting to just three points with less than three minutes left, but the comeback not to be. Ultimately, the final drive, Lamar Jackson gets the ball back through a clutch third down pass and then threw a nifty fake to start a 10-yard run for a first down. So Baltimore holds on to win 28-25 and avoid the second 0-3 start in team history. Things looking very bleak for the Eagles early against a Saints squad that had put up 91 points in the last two games -- not nearly that many scored on Sunday. This is a defensive affair.
