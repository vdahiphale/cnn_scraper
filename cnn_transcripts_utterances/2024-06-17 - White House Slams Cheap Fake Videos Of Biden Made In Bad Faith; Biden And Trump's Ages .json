      "sentences": "The news a lot of Americans see and the manipulation that's distorting the 2024 election. That's tonight on NewsNight.Good evening, I'm Abby Phillip in New York. The November choice is between two old men. We know that. But tonight I want to talk about the Joe Biden that Republicans want you to see and the pipeline of videos that aren't telling the full truth. Now, those videos are probably right now clogging the public consciousness as Americans start to think about their votes. The RNC wants to weaponize questions around Biden's age. And the follow-up to that question is, is he mentally fit enough to do the job again? It's a question that Donald Trump hopes is on voters' minds. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I think you should take a cognitive test like I did. I took a cognitive test and I aced it. (END VIDEO CLIP) PHILLIP: The latest video shoving this question in voters faces is this one from a star studded fundraiser a couple days ago. President Biden and former President Obama on stage, waving to this crowd, and then there's a six second pause, and then a walk off the stage. The New York Post screamed, freeze up. The White House fired back, accusing the conservative outlet of wildly misinterpreting what happened. It's far from the only example of this push-pull between what the president is seeing and heard doing and how Republicans and conservative news allies are labeling what he's seen and heard doing. Now, you don't have to scroll too far down on the RNC's research account to find posts winking and nodding that Biden isn't all there. Posts like this one, showing Biden at the G7 summit wandering around. Now, the RNC would have you believe that this was all aimlessly. The New York Post saw the video and put the stills on the front page, meanderer-in-chief. The problem is, that is also wildly misleading. Biden wasn't staring off into the distance like a puppy distracted by a bird. He was watching a diving demonstration. He had a conversation with those aerial stuntmen. And that's far from the only exaggerated or entirely invented story that's made its way into the American information ecosystem lately. Just go to Sinclair's website and they bill their national desk as, quote, a comprehensive, commentary-free look at the most impactful news of the day. But the reporting shows the opposite. The 185-owned or operated Sinclair stations across 86 markets published, quote/unquote, news filled with commentary. Just to give you an example, this bizarre assertion because Biden sat down weird, that he pooped himself. Literally, I'm not kidding, pooping is in the text of the Sinclair web link. This headline appeared across the country on local news websites owned by Sinclair. Biden appears to freeze, slur words during White House Juneteenth event. That misleading story, as documented by a left leaning substack called Biden dazed and in a stupor. Now, the Trump campaign called it a senior moment. Here is the actual video. The president, President Biden, isn't dancing or clapping. Everyone around him is. Now, that is a moment of, I don't know, what do you think it is? Here is the pointed White House response to what's happening there. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: The president stood there listening to the music and he didn't dance. Excuse me, I did not know not dancing was a mental -- was a health issue. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've been worried for years about A.I. deep fakes, that computer-generated images are going to trick people into believing something that's totally false. Cheap fakes are a little bit simpler. They're cheap. They're just distorted out of context videos, chopped up in certain ways, constructed in certain ways.That's what we're seeing. That's what the Biden administration, the Biden campaign is so worried about right now. But make no mistake, they are worried about this. This is a real problem. This is not some made up fiction. The videos are oftentimes made up, but the problem is real because some of us, Abby, watch a 40 minute speech by Biden. We see the full context. Other people only watch a five-second clip.

But the thing is that George W. Bush, for better or for worse, was seen as decisive in command. When you're looking at Biden's moments, the real challenge for Joe Biden isn't that he's old, isn't that he has these awkward moments from time to time. It is the perception, whether you agree with it or not, that he's not, in fact, in command of his White House.Donald Trump is also very old, but he is seen, again, whether you like it or not, as being very much in command of the Republican Party, you know, someone that literally folks are seeking to curry favor with him at all times. And the rap on Biden is that there are a lot of young folks who are very much Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren devotees, who have much more control over the administration then would be the case if he were truly in command.

I think that pushes them not to believe.And I don't believe Giuliani really, really believes that he's going to go to prison, especially with what you see what's going on in Georgia. Now, you have the delays because of, you know, they're going after Fani Willis, the prosecutor, and that's going to delay the case. So, things like that give Giuliani, people like Giuliani hope that, you know, it's just never going to happen. And, plus, you know, they're fighting for the presidency. They all truly believe in Giuliani also, that if Trump wins, that that will wipe away all their problems. So, that's why it's imperative that these elections, and I know we say it every year, every time there's an election, that this is the one, but this is really the one, you know, for, to save our democracy and to make sure that there's accountability for what has transpired in the past eight years.",

There are many things in our society that people scoffed at.I have a car seat like you do in my child's area where he's in the car. And I have friends who say, I remember when we would just be held back in the station wagon. Yeah, I remember a lot of things. But what we know is when knowledge and power are put together, good things can happen. The safety of kids. We've done a number of shows, Abby, on young people who've taken their own lives. The pressure of social media is real. And I love that the Surgeon General said it's a complicated issue. I was on today promoting my new cookbook while now talking with you about the dangers of social media. We're in this vortex, and it is complicated.

You've spoken to parents of tweens about this issue, and they all havedifferent answers about how they are working this out in their own homes. They have to decide with their kids who have opinions, who can talk back to them, who can try to sneak to the back room and grab a phone and get on social media.

The government is saying it is in your best interest, except for in certain states, where you need to put on a seat belt because it does protect you.I think what the Surgeon General is saying, Abby, is that we're putting a lot of weight on parents. I hear and see on my show where people will say, well, then take your kid off social media. Don't give them the phone. We know that it's not that easy. We did a show recently of a parent who spent thousands of dollars on her child's prom. Her choice, her money. The comments almost made me take the post down from my show's social. It went beyond judgment. It went to bullying and abuse. And I'm worried about the mental health of that kid who went on a prom that her mom could afford. It was a lot of money, and it wasn't the money of the people who were in the comments section. And so, I think what the Surgeon General has tapped into also is a loneliness factor. The Surgeon General was on my show, and he talked about this epidemic of loneliness. And I feel that, like all of us, we feel that connection in social media. We reconnect with high school friends. We did a show a lot of people reconnect with old loves. You know, the list and the gamut is wide. But the reality is, is it healthy connections? Is it healthy, I have my phone right here, to pick up this phone and doom scroll? And that's what teenagers are doing. And I heard you say that, you know, we all grapple with it. I've had some of the most famous people in the world on my show who said, I decided to delete my social media, or I need a break from social media. Or they even hire people to handle their social media because they don't want to see the onslaught of negativity. So, I think that as mature, reasonable people, we have to say we recognize the good. We see revolutions. Breonna Taylor, I learned about, in this home from social media, and the world woke up to the murder of this young woman. So, we know the power of social media. But we also know the wide number of people around the world who say they go on and they feel worse about themselves, especially those under the age of 18.",

But I can tell you, the Surgeon General does not let his kids on.But most of the most powerful people in the world of social media don't let their kids on either. Ask yourself, is that the case? I mean, some of them even cover the camera on their phones. And so, I don't want to condemn these people who've created technology and a connection that the world has never seen. And on all of those platforms, there is good, there is bad. In any civilized setting, we should be able to have this conversation to say, let's weigh the data.  Let's weigh the conversation and see if there is some improvement. And to say that there is not is ridiculous. I do a show every single day. And I'm telling you, whether they're the most famous people in the world or people who come on our show and are, quote, \"everyday people\".

But suddenly, Biden is showing some vulnerability there. An aggregate of recent polls show that Trump is making some gains. One real-life illustration of this is Black farmers in swing states.Many are expressing their frustration with the Biden administration for, in their eyes, not doing enough to help them financially. Biden has allocated money and programs to support farmers in distress. However, a major one of those programs, $4 billion, is the subject of a lawsuit by white farmers who say it's reverse discrimination. John Boyd Jr. is the founder and president of the National Black Farmers Association. And he joins me now. John, good to see you. And thanks for joining us.

Why does that make you and perhaps other farmers say that they're not going to support President Biden when President Biden wants this program to go through? And he's not the reason that it's not.BOYD, JR.: Well, the President hasn't moved enough on his initiative here, Abby. This isn't just a new ask here. So, I've been trying to get debt relief for Black farmers for over three decades here in the United States. And the whole time I was asking for it, white farmers was getting debt relief. Matter of fact, they were getting all of their debt relief. And then it turned around after we finally got it done by an act of Congress and started suing us in key states around the country, Texas and Florida and some others issued temporary injunctions. And just as I started winning some motions in federal court to motion to intervene in here, the actual discrimination that Black farmers faced, the administration repealed it by an act of Congress. So, yes, white farmers sued us, but also the administration repealed it. And I wanted the President to fight for Black farmers to get the $5 billion to 120 percent that we were promised from the beginning. Instead, you know, we didn't get it. So, we see it like 40 acres and a mule. It's the same initiative. Those farmers who are tied up, those 17,000 black and other farmers of color, have their deeds tied up with the United States Department of Agriculture. Those are the real farmers that I'm trying to save in this country. And instead, the administration went silent. But we wanted them to fight like they're fighting for affirmative action. We wanted them to fight like he fought for college debt relief for college tuition. But we haven't heard the administration even say the word black farmer since it was repealed.",

So, if you have friends in the Black farmer community who are thinking about casting a ballot for Donald Trump, do you think that that is wise, given the track record of people like Stephen Miller who are behind a lot of these lawsuits?

The only presidential candidate who's came forth and made that promise was Kennedy on his podcast. He said he would do it within the first week of office. The President is in office now. He can do it. And you know, what bothers me is $175 billion went out to Ukraine. A lot of that money, Abby, went directly to Ukraine farmers. Nobody sued them. Nobody has an issue with helping Ukraine farmers who are not even citizens of the United States. But you can't help Black farmers right here in this country. And when you look at immigration, people coming in this country getting credit cards and debit cards and be putting them up in public housing and all of these things. But you can't provide relief, $5 billion relief for Black farmers. What does that say to my daddy, John Boyd, who passed away a couple of years ago? What does that say to Thomas Boyd? I'm sitting on a farm right now in Boynton, Virginia, where my forefathers were slaves in this country. And there's always a reason why we can't get something.

In the 1972 race while at a New York City kosher deli, Democrat George McGovern, he ordered a corned beef sandwich and a glass of milk, a combination that is definitely not kosher. And four years later, Gerald Ford's great tamale incident made national news when he tried to eat a tamale while it was still wrapped in a corn husk while he was visiting San Antonio. Now, during his campaign, John Kerry angered Philadelphians when he ordered a cheesesteak with Swiss cheese instead of the traditional Cheez Whiz, which locals say is just a small step below criminal. Now, Cynthia Nixon's bagel order, that dominated headlines while she was running to be governor of New York, it turns out that cream cheese, lox, red onion, tomato and capers on a cinnamon raisin bagel did not sit well with the locals.
