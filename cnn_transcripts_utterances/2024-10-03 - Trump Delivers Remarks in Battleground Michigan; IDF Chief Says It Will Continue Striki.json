I just left Wisconsin. We -- four days ago, five days ago, we had a sort of a rally wasn't supposed to be -- 60,000 people showed up in Wisconsin. But the White House wouldn't give us proper security coverage. So we end up in a room of about 900 people. You have 60,000 people, 50 to 60,000 people outside waiting. But they don't want that because they don't want crowds. What they are doing is such a disgrace to our country. And so to those people in Wisconsin that didn't make it, I think they love us and I think they're going to vote. By the way, we're up in all of the polls. We're up in every swing state. (CHEERING) They had a honeymoon period. You know, they had like a honeymoon. I didn't know what a honeymoon period they kept talking about the honeymoon because I beat Biden. We're up 21 points by their numbers. And they went to him. Crazy Nancy Pelosi, she's crazy as a bedbug. Crazy Nancy. But others, too. They went to him and they said, Joe, you're out. He said, I'm not. I'm not getting out. And they said, No, you're out. We're going to use the 25th Amendment because you're freaking crazy, man. And he eventually agreed to get out, which took about, you know, 24 hours. Remember, he said he would only get out if he was forced to by God. And that didn't work out. That didn't work. So they said, you're getting out because you're going to lose. You're going to lose by a lot. Right after the debate, they went to him. Right. I don't know. Did I do a good job or a bad job?

You have the beautiful ocean. You have everything. But you still need somebody that knows what they're doing. And she destroyed. Think of it. She destroyed San Francisco when she was the D.A.

But we know that he is certainly sensitive to crowd numbers and any appearance that they may have shrunk, certainly because of security considerations, which let's be clear, he does have security considerations. We know that. But certainly it's not something he wants to deal with.He also talked, of course, about the 2020 election. He said that the vote needs to be too big to rig because he won in 2020, which he didn't. But he said 2020 was rigged, which it wasn't. And he said if he thought he'd lost, he wouldn't be doing it again. Well, we know that he has admitted that he has lost. One of the issues, though, is that when he recently said something about it, that he lost by a whisker, it was met with a lot of rejection by some of his followers on the right. This is something that really energizes them. And they did not want that to be something that he would at all move away from. So he's making it very clear to them that he's kind of going back to where he was on this.",

Her view has been similar with President Biden's to protect Social Security, much to the consternation from both sides of the reality of entitlement spending here.And there's really not been a conversation by any presidential candidate really in years about the wisdom of, you know, or the longevity of these programs. That said, what he was saying there a month before the election is not true. The crowd size is so interesting. There is no doubt Donald Trump can draw very large crowds. He seems to be sensitive to some of the sizes of these crowds when they're not in giant stadiums. But the reality is he's campaigning so often in so many states in the middle of the day. Supporters, A, have jobs and things to do. And B, there are some constraints in terms of what local law enforcement and federal law enforcement can do at these big rallies. So he's having somewhat smaller rallies, but they're still, you know, certainly respectable in size. I was at one in Erie in Pennsylvania on Sunday afternoon, one of the smaller Trump rallies I've been to, but certainly a couple thousand people there. So I think the crowd size is something that is still one of the nagging things to him. But look, we can stipulate to the fact that he can draw a crowd.",

This is coming after the Israeli military struck around 200 targets in Lebanon in a barrage of airstrikes overnight. The IDF says it killed several Hezbollah commanders in a strike on a military structure in southern Lebanon.The Lebanese health ministry says the strikes in central Beirut killed at least nine people. Israel's military is also reporting that around 100 projectiles have been launched from Lebanon into Israel in the past several hours. And all of this as Israel is now warning villagers in southern Lebanon to evacuate. Many more towns now. A major signal that its ground incursion is expanding. Joining us now to discuss all of this is Beth Sanner. She's the former deputy director of national intelligence. Beth, first, let's talk about what a timeline and options for Israel's response against Iran could look like. This idea of nuclear facilities, oil facilities, and when this might happen.",

And I think that that provides a little bit of a reasoning to delay.But basically, when you're trying to figure out all the different options you have and how those will be executed and coordinated, and then preparing for retaliation, that takes a little while. And so, you know, I think that we're looking at, you know, maybe later tomorrow, maybe this weekend for something to happen. You know, there are a lot of targets on the list. But I would say, you know, very clearly, the United States has said, don't strike the nuclear facilities because that could really lead to the most dramatic kind of escalation, retaliation that against -- by Iran. So I think we have definitely missile sites and launchers and air defense. And now this question about whether Iran's oil industry is on the table.",

You know, there's kind of a limited amount of negotiating room, advising room that any administration would have with Israel at this point. And that's where we are with the Biden administration.So, you know, they can't pick the targets for Israel. That's just not going to work for Israel. In the terms of price increases, just taking Iran off the market, most of that oil goes to China, but it's a global market, right? So even though the United States has a lot of oil and we as the United States has produced more oil in the last year than any country on Earth ever, it's still a global market. And Iran is only about 2 percent of that market. So I don't think the question really is about a huge price spike if Iran is taking off the market. It is what Iran does in response that might take other oil off the market. For example, if they cut off tankers through the Straits of Hormuz or they directly strike against Saudi Arabia's oil industry, for example.",

This is people freaking out that there's a port strike and they're going to run out of toilet paper or bottled water or formula. But just because there is a port strike doesn't mean we're going to run out of everything. For example, let's take toilet paper.Ninety percent is produced here in the United States. The other 10 percent is produced in Canada and in Mexico. And that is all coming in by truck and rail, not ships. Also not impacted, oil and gas, as well as hurricane relief. The hurricane relief for Hurricane Helene victims is already here in the United States. Again, that travels by rail and that travels by truck, not by ship. But what we could see some shortages and some impacts down the line, if this strike goes past a week, is imperishable goods. So these are fruits and vegetables. Let's take bananas, for example. We import 100 percent of all the bananas we consume here. And ultimately, there are other goods that are going to be impacted down the line. Chocolate, alcohol, furniture. So it's important to know that as this strike drags on, we could start to see some shortages in these particular goods. But the goal here, Boris, at the end of the day, is for the two sides to come to a deal, come to an agreement before we, the consumers, start feeling any of this -- Boris.
