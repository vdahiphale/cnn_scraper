      "sentences": "Top of the hour this Friday morning. I'm Jim Sciutto.We begin this hour on the southern border where crowds are already building on the Mexican side ahead of the lifting next week of Title 42. That is a policy dating to the Trump administration that allows U.S. border authorities to swiftly turn away migrants on the grounds of public health. We're going to take you to the border live as Texas officials prepare for a big surge of migrants this weekend. Plus, Twitter has now taken down the accounts of several high-profile journalists from the nation's top news organizations including CNN. Accounts that have covered Musk aggressively in recent weeks, they've now been suspended. Why? And in new video, just into CNN, these are residents of Kyiv sheltering in a metro station during another Russian air raid targeting civilian population centers. This morning dozens of Russian missiles hit targets in the capital Kyiv, Odessa, Kharkiv as well, hitting critical civilian infrastructure. First, we do begin at the southern border where CNN's Ed Lavandera is in El Paso, Texas. CNN's Gustavo Valdes just on the other side of the border in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. Ed, I do want to begin with you there because you've been seeing folks there so desperate, they're sleeping on the streets as these numbers increase.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that has continued throughout much of the week. Another frigid night here in El Paso. And you can see here playing out some of the logistical issues that the city of El Paso is having to deal with. This is an area outside one of the bus stations in downtown where dozens of people have once again been sleeping out on the streets because the shelters are filled.The city has come out and put out trash cans because people have been coming by, donating food, warm drinks, that sort of thing. You know, the city now having to come by and take away all of the trash. Many of the migrants here helping the city workers load the trash cans into the dumpster. But these are the sanitary logistical things that the city and the emergency teams here in El Paso are having to deal with right now. And that is the infrastructure headaches that they have to deal with because of the influx of migrants. There are about 2500 a day. The mayor is now saying that next week if Title 42 is lifted, that the number of migrants coming into El Paso here could be as high as 5,000. So these kinds of logistical issues is what they're concerned about and they say that the real test here is being able to move migrants who are generally not staying here in these border communities, moving it out on buses to other locations where they can get to their final destinations as quickly as possible, and that will help relieve the pressure here in the border communities. So that is the challenge that a lot of these border communities are going to be experiencing and dealing with dealing with next week when Title 42 is lifted.",

An analysis of government data shows that there is a record backlog now, more than two million pending cases, asylum cases, in the United States right now. Given the current resources, the wait time for asylum seekers to get a hearing is 4.3 years. New this morning, CNN has learned that an American student who went missing in France more than two weeks ago, there he is, is alive. CNN correspondent Melissa Bell is following the story this morning. And Melissa, of course Kenny DeLand Jr.'s father who confirmed that good news to CNN this morning, I mean, one, what do we know about his condition and do we know anything more about the circumstances of his disappearance?",

Again, we don't know what happened.In the meantime, we had learned yesterday from the father, Jim, that beyond the change of clothes, the packed lunch, the wallet and the phone he'd left his host family with on the morning of November 28th. He'd also taken his passport. Now did that signal intent to cross the border? We still don't know. But the prosecutor who's in charge of the missing persons investigation in that town of Grenoble where Ken DeLand Jr. has been studying has confirmed to CNN that he's been found in Spain. How he got there, why he went there, and again why he vanished so suddenly when he was used to giving his parents news. They've been saying throughout, look, we heard from him every other day. This is the most uncharacteristic. For now, Jim, we simply don't know why he vanished, where he went, and why he cut off communication. But the news that he is well clearly a huge relief to Kenny DeLand' Jr.'s father who have been telling us just this morning, Jim, that he couldn't sleep as every day passed closer to that flight he was due to take home which is tomorrow. Growing anxiety of course that he may never be found. So wonderful news for him this morning.",

Overnight back in here in Washington, the Senate passed two critical pieces of legislation including the National Defense Authorization Act, basically the Pentagon budget, and a short-term funding bill to avert a government shutdown for now. That bill is headed to President Biden's desk, is expected to be signed today. The question of course is what they do next. CNN congressional correspondent Lauren Fox up on Capitol Hill with more. So, you know, I don't know if you want to call it a kumbaya moment, but at least some bipartisan measures to get some necessary stuff passed.

Anyway, so hats off to them for that.Joining us now is CNN political analyst Laura Barron-Lopez. She is White House correspondent for \"PBS News Hour.\" So this is remarkable because if we were talking a couple of months ago before the midterms, you know, you had a growing chorus I think, you know, privately, particularly, but some public that hey, maybe Joe Biden should step aside. Now there you have the leaders of the Democrats in the House and the Senate, at least the outgoing leader of the House and Senate, saying they're all for it. Is it just the midterm results that have changed the calculation here? LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think certainly the midterm results, Jim, are impacting the way Democrats are feeling about President Biden. They, you know, they narrowly lost the House and they held on to the Senate and we know that's the first time since 1934 that the president's party has gained a seat in the Senate. If you had talked to Schumer, you know, months ago, a lot of Democrats were not feeling optimistic earlier this year about their chances of holding the Senate and certainly thought that they were going to have greater losses in the House. So President Biden feels pretty bullish and good about the fact that his message heading into the midterms appeared to work and he was, you know, taking a victory lap right after the midterms. So I think that it certainly had a big influence on it. Of course there are factions of the party that want to see a younger generation still rise. But no one so far has said that they would challenge him.",

New poll among Democrats, this is among Democrat-leaning voters asked if Biden should be the Democrats' 2024 nominee, only 40 percent said yes. That's Democratic leaning voters. 59 percent said no. Now we should note this is up from 25 percent in July and down from January and February. I mean, is the assumption or the hope of the Biden administration that that is the beginning of a trend in his favor? BARRON-LOPEZand feel good about where the president is headed right now. And especially coming off the midterms. And all signs right now point to the fact that he is going to run again. They also view the former President Trump as someone that would be a good person to run against. And that they believe, you know, as they did in 2020, that Biden is one of the only people that could actually beat the former President Trump. And you know, a number of Democrats like Senator Bernie Sanders have spoken very plainly about the fact that if Biden were not to run, they would throw their hat in the ring. But again all of these other Democrats that are potentially younger than Sanders who clearly are eyeing maybe running for president, are not saying that they are going to jump in. And so I think that if voters don't have that other option, they will likely support President Biden.",

But this appears to be the broader goal here and that is to destroy critical infrastructure including power generation. The Biden administration condemned Russia's latest barrage of missile strikes. This comes as the Senate did vote overnight as part of the massive National Defense Authorization Act to authorize more than $800 million in further military support for Ukraine. Discussion now of those Patriot missiles you're seeing there as well.CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr joins me. So among the things, Barbara, they have announced is expanded training for Ukrainian forces. But they haven't quite announced the final decision on these Patriot missile. What do we know?",

You know, President Biden still by all accounts hasn't signed that final paperwork that would allow the White House to announce the transfer of Patriot missile systems to Ukraine. Pentagon sources are telling us they do expect it to happen. It is going to be a critical advantage for the Ukrainians.It will take time to get it all there, it will take time to get Ukrainian troops trained up on it. But what the Patriot does of course is, it is able to track, engage and bring down Russian ballistic missiles at high altitudes and long distances further away from the Ukrainian target. So the idea is there's basically the beginning of an air defense shield for these higher altitude longer range shootdowns. So these Russian missiles can't get to the civilian areas and the hope of course is they can begin to get a handle on these Russian attacks. But it's going to take some time. This is a complex weapon system. Hundreds of Ukrainian troops need to be trained on it. There is the issue of repair, spare parts, logistics, maintenance, all of that. But they do hope to make a start on it.",
