Every time I went up there before he became president, I would see Allen weisselberg walking around. Everybody stand by.If you're just joining us, I'm Wolf Blitzer. We're here in THE SITUATION ROOM. We're following truly historic major breaking news. Sources now tell CNN that a New York grand jury has voted to indict the former president of the United States, Donald Trump. This is the first time in U.S. history, the first time in U.S. history that criminal charges have been filed against anyone who has served as president of the United States. The charges coming after the investigation of hush money paid to former adult film star Stormy Daniels to cover up her alleged affair with Trump. This has huge implications not only for Trump but also for the nation as the former president makes another run for the White House right now. Our correspondents, analysts and contributors are all standing by as we cover this breaking story and what comes next. Kara Scannell is on the scene for us. Let's go to your first. You're there in New York. You're watching all of this unfold. Tell our viewers what else you're learning.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, that's right, we learned that a Manhattan grand jury has returned an indictment against former President Donald Trump, as you said, the first time in U.S. history that a current or former president has ever faced criminal charges. This all stems from that investigation into the hush money payments. Now, sources tell us that the indictment is under seal, so we don't know what the exact charges are, but it does relate to Trump's role in paying off women so they didn't go forward with stories ahead of the 2016 presidential election.Now, sources also tell us that this vote occurred late in the day. The grand jury was meeting today from 2:00 to 5:00 P.M. We saw the prosecutors heading over toward the grand jury's room late in the day and then coming back. And our sources tell us that they then turned in this indictment, and it is under seal. Now, Trump's lawyers have been informed of this. We have yet to hear any reaction from the former president himself. They do not know the charges that the former president is facing. We do expect us to see -- to have the charges unveiled in the coming days, and Trump's attorneys had worked out an agreement with the D.A.'s office that the former president with self-surrender, to come here in Manhattan, where he would be processed, just like any other defendant, although he is not like any other defendant because he is the former president. So, we'll see an increased security presence when he does come in for his arraignment, but he will go through the regular process of being -- having his mug shot, taken having himself fingerprinted, and then going before a judge who will ask him to enter a plea before he will be released on bail. Certainly a historic moment today, the first time a former president has ever been indicted on any charges after leaving office, Wolf.",

And, of course, what we are learning today is that is not, in fact, what happened, that there was a grand jury that was convinced at least, that this indictment should move forward. I mean, that's been another knock, obviously, from Trump's team, as well as from some legal experts watching this saying, essentially, there was a weak case, they didn't think that you know it was possible, potentially for Bragg to even get an indictment if he brought it before the grand jury, again, wrong. The grand jury went ahead with us Wolf. So, I think it's a big day in sort of a moment of reckoning for the Trump team.",

I'm actually just watching my computer to figure out when that is going to come, and so forgive me for continuing to look down.We are starting to hear from some of Trump's other entities. As Kaitlan said, a lot of this is going to be through Trump's surrogates, through people who he wants out there, not just supporters, but his congressional surrogates. He's going to want to see people on the airwaves, on Fox News. He is going to want to see people on OAN and Newsmax talking about him, defending him, talking about how this is a witch hunt, and that is what we are likely to see from the people who have been out there having his back. We know that Donald Trump cares about the optics of the situation And, again, this is a unique situation. This is unprecedented. This is the first time not only a former U.S. president has been indicted, but he is also a candidate to run for his third presidential bid in 2024. One of the things I've talked to a number of aides about is how they embrace this new normal. This is not going to, as of now, affect the way that they do business. They are going to continue to run him for office in 2024. Now, what that looks like, nobody knows. And, Wolf, I do want to mention again here because I've just gotten another several text messages here from allies, advisors to the former president, who all say that they were shocked, blindsided that it came today. Again, they have been preparing for this. There was a system in motion. There was a plan in place and he has been waiting, as his team, on pins and needles for this indictment to come down. But following those reports in recent days, they had all kind of taken a step back and they felt like they were able to catch their breath. This was a surprise to them. And, again, as we reported on air, their lawyers did not even know when we broke this story that it had happened yet. So, they are still putting this together. They are still formulating their response. But you can imagine we're going to likely see Trump getting aggressive, lashing out. We just haven't seen that yet as his team is preparing that response.",

That's my view. Why? Trump paid hush money to benefit his campaign. That -- but he characterized it as legal fees. That's a violation of the New York statute on keeping false books and records. And because of that campaign benefit, it's a campaign finance issue. In a close election, that kind of thing really matters. So, anyone else would be prosecuted.

But the crux of the crime under New York state law is the way that those payments were recorded, the way they were logged on the internal books of the Trump Organization.We know Michael Cohen and Allen Weisselberg we're handling the books, but the trick for prosecutors is going to be tying Donald Trump directly to that, and to that end, it appears Michael Cohen will be the prosecution's star witness here. Michael Cohen, on the one hand, had access. He was right in the middle of all this. On the other hand, he is going to be eminently impeachable. His credibility will be very much in question. He's been convicted of perjury of other frauds. He has been rejected as a cooperating witness by the U.S. Department of Justice. He tried to cooperate, they said, we don't believe him. Now, it may well be, it seems clear, the D.A. has reached a contrary conclusion on Michael Cohen, but if and when this case gets to trial, and we're far away off, Michael Cohen is going to be a key witness.

I take no pride in issuing this statement and wish to also remind everyone of the presumption of innocence as provided by the due process clause.However, I do take solace invalidating the adage that no one is above the law, not even a former president. Today's indictment is not the end of this chapter but rather just the beginning. Now, that the charges have been filed, it is better for the case to let the indictment speak for itself. The two things I wish to say at this time is that accountability matters and I stand by my testimony and the evidence I have provided to the district attorney in New York. That statement from Michael Cohen that was just released, the former president's former lawyer and fixer for that matter as well.

Initially, we've seen that when Donald Trump has come up against circumstances like this.But what is so interesting and to see, Wolf, is that over the course of the last couple of weeks, once Trump went out there and said incorrectly that he was going to get arrested on that Tuesday, what he started doing through social media appearances, through his rally, through interviews was to provide the script to the Republican universe at-large about how he's looking for Republicans to respond to this moment. So, as we're watching now the reaction coming in from his allies on Capitol Hill, even from some of his competitors in the presidential race, like Nikki Haley or others, who have said this is a political prosecution, you're starting to see Republicans rallying around the very script that Donald Trump wrote for them. What I think is critical to watch going forward is, are we going to see any Republican use this as a moment to back away from Trump. I would be very surprised if we saw that based on. Again, we don't yet know the charges, Wolf, we don't know the specifics of this, and, largely, the Republican field has galvanized around this notion that it is a political prosecution.",

This is a political persecution and election interference in the highest level is one of the things that he is saying right now. That's no surprise. That's been the line for all along.And as you were just discussing with David Chalian, this is going to be putting a lot of Republicans in a tough spot. I mean, the moment that this country is in is that you have a former president who was running again for that same office and you have a lot of other Republicans in the Republican field trying to challenge him, but they are going to find it very difficult to do that, because I think all of them up until this point have felt compelled to defend him against this particular case, even if they don't think necessarily that he should be the Republican nominee or that he is fit for the office. Republicans have felt compelled to defend Trump. And so I think this is going to make it actually more difficult for Trump's opponents to challenge him. Long-term, I don't think we know what the political consequences are, but I think in the near term, the Republican base or at least, you know, the 30 or 40 percent of the Republican base that Trump has always commanded is perhaps more solidly behind him now as a result of this than they were before.

This is not the Donald Trump sitting president of 2020. This --  the context now is a twice impeached former president who is being investigated in multiple venues for his role in January 6th for the classified documents and now indicted in this criminal investigation in New York.

We don't know if Donald Trump could face charges related to January 6th or related to the Mar-a-Lago documents probe.

I mean, there had been pockets of activity, particularly last Tuesday when former President Trump predicted inaccurately that he would be arrested. We saw a ton of media presence here and like one or two groups of protesters, then it was really calm today. I mean, we were one of the few media groups that were here. It's now starting to fill up again, as you can imagine.I mean, one thing that I think is really worth remembering in this, is this hush money investigation began as a federal investigation, the one that Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to. And at that time, the Department of Justice had a policy that you couldn't indict a sitting president, and they never looked to bring charges against former President Trump. The Manhattan D.A.'s office then picked up that investigation and then they started looking into other things, including the financial records, whether they were -- valuations were inflated on the financial statements. When D.A. Alvin Bragg came into office last year, his senior prosecutors, the ones that were from the previous administration, they pressed him to move forward to bring an indictment against the former president related to the financial statements. He said he wasn't ready. He didn't think they had a case. And he said then, that he would continue this investigation and would speak either by coming out and saying that he was declining a prosecution because there wasn't the evidence where he would speak through an indictment. Now, we have yet to hear from Bragg's office today, but this certainly is a turn of events. I mean, Bragg's office went to trial on the Trump Organization in December. They want a conviction of tax fraud charges against the company. The company was sentenced with a fine of $1.6 million. That appeared to really embolden the prosecution team showing that they could win a conviction against a Trump-related entity in New York. The grand jury kicked into gear in January. We saw witnesses coming in. All these witnesses once close to the campaign, witnesses that were like Michael Cohen, who were involved in this deal and witnesses, including Donald Trump's longtime friend, David Pecker, who was involved in these catch and kill deals. Now, he went before the grand jury twice. We saw him here on Monday. He seemed to be the grand -- the final witness at the grand jury, heard from. He was at the beginning of these deals. He was the one that was contacted by Stormy Daniels' agent. He got in touch with Michael Cohen setting into this chain of events that led to the hush money payments being made, Wolf.

And as I was saying before, he's going to run against Alvin Bragg before he runs against his fellow Republican contenders, and then says, you know, this is somehow Joe Biden's fault. So, I think you're going to continue to see him to see him say that.He has made this a case or trying to make this a case against the Democrats. He says, the Democrats have lied, cheated and stolen in their obsession in trying to get Trump, and now they've done the unthinkable. And we know that this is a case that's been hanging around for quite some time. So, it isn't so unthinkable. It's actually been out there. It was out there prior to the 2016 election. So, this gives us a clear indication again, not surprising, that Donald Trump will try and use this to his advantage as the victim and will say that his grievance is also everyone else's grievance against the Democrats. PHILLIP:  And, Wolf, one thing I think is really important to keep in mind in all of this is that this is supposed to be a nation of laws, right? And I think that if you look at the argument that Trump is making and that his allies especially on Capitol Hill are making, the suggestion is that, just by virtue of the fact that he's a declared candidate for the presidency, that this is an invalid investigation. And I just think that, you know, we can't take that premise. We need to see what the facts are of this case. And if they substantiate an indictment, according to a grand jury, that's actually how this system is supposed to work. And these allegations against him were committed when he was not president of the United States. He was a private citizen. So, at some point, the legal system has to be able to function, no matter what the politicians say about it. And there are a lot of people on the Democratic side and on the Republican side debating about whether this is the best case or the worst case, or what have you, but at the end of the day, the courts will determine that. And I think that there's really no mechanism for anyone to say that this is a lesser crime that shouldn't be pursued and only the more important crimes should be pursued. If you're a D.A. like Alvin Bragg is, I mean, I think it does kind of -- if you have the evidence, it does kind of tie your hands. And Trump characterizing this as a witch hunt, Trump characterizing this as a political persecution doesn't make it so, but we should still wait to see what the actual evidence is that is against him, and we don't have that information yet.",

So, that does give security some time to get things in place.We do know my colleague, Brynn Gingras, is reporting that the NYPD, U.S. Marshals and Secret Service have already started conversations to how they would beef up security for this arraignment just because of the magnitude of having a former president come into court. You know, Trump has called for protests. He has called for people to show up. We have not seen that in any large numbers here outside the courthouse, as we've been on, you know, grand jury watch for the past week-and-a-half. We've seen a handful of people to come but not a big swell of supporters for Trump. But, nevertheless, it's a high security situation. And the NYPD, U.S. Marshals and Secret Service, according to sources, are in conversation right now had to prepare for that. There will be a big event next week. We can expect to see a real heightened sense of security. We've already seen in preparation for this that they have installed security cameras on top of the light post around here. They put up barricades. The actual police presence has been relatively low key, but I think as we start to see crowds, we will start to see more of a police presence increase here just to insure the safety of the former president's arrival for this and his calls for protests. They have been prepared for everything. Wolf.",

That's where any defendant appears in front of a judge and his advised of the charges, and that typically is where the indictment is unsealed, meaning is made public.Now, people are probably wondering, is there any way we see this indictment before that court appearance, which Kara just reported will be next week. It's possible there could be motions made by media groups, by journalists to unseal that indictment before then. That will be up to the judge. The prosecutor also sometimes will send a courtesy copy of the indictment to the defense, which then, at times, can disseminate it. So, that will be a strategic decision by the prosecutor. But Donald Trump will have to be transported up here to New York City, to Manhattan. He will make his first appearance in person in the court. Now I want to say this. I know that area very well. There are all sorts of underground tunnels, garages. That is a law enforcement-heavy area. I do not expect to see him being perp walked, as they say, or walked out on the street by law enforcement. I am virtually certain they will bring him in through one of those underground entrances. He will then have to be fingerprinted, and they don't use ink anymore, really. You just sort of put your hand on a computer screen. He will have a mug shot taken. And here in New York State, Wolf, it's really important to know, mug shots are not presumptively public. They're not automatically public. The law here says that if there is some specific law enforcement need, then the law -- then the mug shot can be made public, usually that means a fugitive-type situation, someone on the run. So, we'll see what the decision is there. Another question is will he be handcuffed ordinarily in the course of an arraignment before the person comes into court. They would be briefly handcuffed. But I think that could be negotiated around here. We'll see what the Secret Service has to say. At the arraignment itself, here's what will happen. The judge will advise Donald Trump of the charges against him. Donald Trump will enter his initial plea, which almost certainly will be not guilty. The judge will make sure that Donald Trump has a lawyer and has a lawyer of his choosing. I'm sure that will be the case. And then the judge will set some of the next date. Sometimes a trial date will be set, but sometimes judges won't set a trial date at that first hearing. They'll set the date for legal motions and discovery, which is the exchange of information. So, those are the next steps that we're going to look to see in the courthouse.",

And it's interesting to note, one of his potential rivals in the race, former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson put out a statement and he called this a dark day for America when a former president is indicted on criminal charges. He went on to say that the presumption of innocence follows Mr. Trump. But that Trump should not be the next president. But that should be decided by voters and not in a court.

It looks like one of the potentially, of course, we have not seen it, but potentially applicable crimes here would be called falsification of business records. That means basically the Trump Organization in its internal record keeping falsely logged this $130,000 hush money payment to Stormy Daniels as a legal fee.If prosecutors can prove that, and remember proved that Donald Trump himself was part of the way that payment was logged, that's a misdemeanor, which means the maximum penalty is one year but realistically, Wolf, nobody's to go to prison for first time misdemeanor of that nature. Now, the charges can get more serious under New York law if prosecutors can tie the falsification of business records to some other crime, to some second crime. And so, that's one of the big questions that I'm waiting to see is what will they allege as the second crime? It could be a campaign finance violation. That's been the gist of a lot of the reporting, and the theory would be that this payment to Stormy Daniels was actually the same as a campaign donation or campaign expenditure. It would have been far in excess of the legal limits. But there's a big legal problem there, which is we're talking about a federal campaign and federal campaign laws that govern the campaign for the president.

They understand that these legal complications might make him so polarizing that they could hurt him in a general election. But I do want to point out one thing, and this is when we talk about the contested primary when we talk about where Trump's base is. I was in Waco with Trump on Saturday, there were at least 10,000 people there. This was with an indictment, a potential indictment looming. We talked to dozens of people in the crowd asking them if former President Trump was to be indicted, do you think that this would impact his political career? His chances of being president? Would it affect the way you think about him? And every single one of them said, no, that it wouldn't impact the way they think about him and that they believed it would only make him stronger.
