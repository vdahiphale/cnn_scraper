I'm Pamela Brown in Washington.And, this morning, investigators are scrambling to figure out the motives and recent movements of the man accused of murdering a health care CEO on a Manhattan sidewalk; 26-year-old Luigi Mangione is in a Pennsylvania cell alone and under -- quote -- \"maximum custody level.\" He had been the most wanted suspect in America after the Wednesday morning ambush of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. And he was arrested in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after a McDonald's employee thought a masked customer looked like the suspect and called police. He had a handgun and a three-page manifesto railing against corporate America. Here's how this arrest unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

FRANK MONTOYA JR., FORMER FBI OFFICIAL:  Yes, he knew that jig was up. He knew that they had found him and were going to arrest him. I mean, this is a great instance where individual does something and maybe doesn't think there's going to be any consequences for it and then realizes in that moment that, yes, there are consequences and you're done.

It's a lot different than going on a Reddit post and listening into or into some other chat room and listening to people talk about how they might do this or that thing. And actually executing it, it's a whole different kind of activity. And you're going to -- especially if you're inexperienced like this, you're going to forget things. You're going to make mistakes. You're going to leave a trail, no matter how well you try to cover yourself. I mean, look at -- when you look at the trail that this individual left behind, whether it was the videos that were prevalent throughout his travels in New York or the witnesses that were able to finally identify him, everything from the beginning to the end, he left a lot of these trails. And they were probably in his mind inadvertent or something that he didn't think about. But at the same time, it is what led to his subsequent apprehension.",

      "sentences": "Well, this is a much bigger, much broader sweep of members of Congress and their staff than we knew about.I mean, we have previously heard from Adam Schiff and from Eric Swalwell, two representatives. Schiff is about to be a senator of California. And we had heard them publicly discuss that they had been notified by their providers, by their service providers, that their records had been seized by the Justice Department earlier. Now, this is a set of leak investigations that happened beginning in 2017, went for about two or three years. And so, again, we'd heard from those two members. What we did not know, Pam, is that there were 43 staff, both Democrats and Republicans. As a matter of fact, there were about 20 Republicans and 20 or so Democrats who were -- whose records were seized. And among those was Kash Patel, who was at the time a staffer for Devin Nunes, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. Now, one of the things that this report says that there was no indication that partisan politics played a role in the targeting of these people, but a key part of these investigations, of these tactics, right, to seize these records is that the Justice Department required a nondisclosure order, meaning that the service providers couldn't say that they -- that their records had been turned over. Google, Apple, a lot of these companies have a six-year limit before they notify members of Congress, in this case, media members whose records were seized. So you have no option to really fight these subpoenas to try to make DOJ show what it has to do here. And so the big finding here is that they did not really do the work. They really didn't have any reason to seize these records, except that these people had proximity to some of the classified information.",

That was part of the reason why the Israeli prime minister sought to delay this very moment of testifying in this case, unsuccessfully, though, as the judges ultimately ruled that he would have to show up to testify in his own defense, a process that could take several weeks. We expect that the prime minister will testify as many as three times a week for as long as six hours per day, initially beginning with questions from his own defense attorneys, who have been giving him a lot of running room here to make comments about foreign policy, accusations against the media, as he really tries to make his own case. But then the more serious cross-examination will come from the prosecution. And there are three cases that are involved in the trial that the prime minister has been facing for four years now. They are Case 1000, Case 2000, and Case 4000, all of them effectively boiling down to allegations of corruption, that the Israeli prime minister offered favors to wealthy businessmen in exchange for more favorable media coverage or in exchange for lavish gifts, some several hundred thousand dollars in champagne bottles, in jewelry, and other gifts that these businessmen allegedly provided. Now, the prime minister and his attorneys, of course, maintain that he is innocent. And we have heard the prime minister already on the stand making his case, defending himself against these allegations, insisting that he is innocent. Jeremy Diamond, CNN, Tel Aviv. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
