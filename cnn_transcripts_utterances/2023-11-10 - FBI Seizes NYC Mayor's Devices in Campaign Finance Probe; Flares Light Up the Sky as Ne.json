Just ahead, tonight the mayor of New York, a former New York Police Department captain, confronted by FBI agents who seized his phones and iPad as part of what appears to be a fast-growing campaign finance investigation.We begin though with late developments in Israel's war in Hamas, most notably, new reporting on efforts to secure the release of the more than 240 hostages now believed to be held by Hamas and other groups. Comes at the end of the day that saw Israeli forces heavily pound targets in northern Gaza from the air and troops on the ground continued to engage Hamas gunmen. A senior American official, familiar with the hostage talks, tells CNN that negotiators are working toward an agreement involving what this official call a sustained days-long pause in the fighting. In exchange, hostages would be freed on a rolling basis, starting with women and children over a period of days. That same official, however, added that many details remain unresolved, and negotiations could stall or break down at any point. Also today, comments by Secretary of State Antony Blinken getting attention. Secretary of State Antony Blinken more directly raised concerns about the death toll in Gaza and pushed for more in the way of humanitarian aid beyond the daily pauses in fighting to allow civilians to get out of harm's way or get aid that Israel announced yesterday.

And it appeared as if there was an intense firefight because flares were dropped and a smokescreen created on the ground, which is normally what we've seen when the IDF forces believe that they've got -- that they've come into contact with a number of Hamas fighters.We saw what appeared to be missiles coming in from above, perhaps heavy machine gun fired from an apache gunship, but a very, very intense battle. Significant because it's just a few miles into the north of Gaza. Troops have been on the ground there for two weeks already, and yet, they still find themselves in these very heavy confrontations with Hamas. And that's given that they still have many, many, many miles more to go in Gaza before it can be cleared, bigger cities as well, which gives the understanding that this will be a very, very long military operation indeed if it's going to succeed, as the IDF lays out, Anderson.",

I think that when you're fighting against an enemy that's hiding behind its own population, using them as human shields, the administration has said this, Secretary Blinken has said this repeatedly, there's going to be civilian casualties. We're going to do the utmost to hold them down. I think he's saying -- listen, we in the White House, we're under a lot of pressure. We're under the pressure from the pictures coming out of Gaza. We're under the pressure from our own party. Can you do your utmost? Could you open up these, you know, humanitarian corridors or humanitarian pauses to allow aid in and perhaps release some of the pressure on us? Help us help you, he's basically saying.

Last week she appeared to lean toward a delay in the need to make it, in her words, \"reasonable adjustments,\" to the timing of the case. That did not happen today. But she did say that she will revisit the decision in March just days before he's said to go on trial and the Special Counsel's other federal investigation into attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Judge Cannon today did agree with the former president's team that they need more time to prepare for the case. And she pushed back several filing deadlines, including those that involve reviewing the classified documents at the heart of this case. I'm joined now by CNN Political Analyst Maggie Haberman of the New York Times. She's also the author of Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America.

And granted, a lot of this is because Trump appointed Judge Aileen Cannon. And so fairly or not, he reads into whatever she does and believes that it's going to benefit him.

And you're seeing some just kind of run-of- the-mill things, like people putting swastikas on others' dorms and then outright violence against students.That is what happened to Dylan Mann at Tulane University. He went for what he thought and what started as a peaceful pro-Israel rally. There were pro-Palestinian supporters on the other side of the street, and then it turned. Take a listen.

We're seeing that happen there. And what's happening here in the U.S. as well.One of the things that I have learned in looking into this, not just now, but also before, is that if you look at the history, the notion of anti-Semitism, which as we all know has been going on for millennia, tends to be kind of a canary in the coal mine for when a democracy starts to rot and has real problems. The fact that we are seeing that not just in these European countries, but more importantly here in the U.S. is very, very disturbing.",
