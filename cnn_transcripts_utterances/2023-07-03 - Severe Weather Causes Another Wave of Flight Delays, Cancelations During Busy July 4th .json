Now, when we go through the rest of the day, that we'll get a second wave really starting to develop this afternoon and into the evening. So, Washington, D.C., New York, down to Atlanta and a secondary system out to the west, including Minneapolis. Main threats will be damaging winds, large hail and the potential for some tornadoes. That secondary wave again, you really start to see it fire up this afternoon and into the evening, thanks to the heating of the day. And then more showers and thunderstorms yet again for the holiday itself tomorrow. So, we do still have the potential for some strong to severe thunderstorms. Again, some of the same areas today, like New York, D,C., and Atlanta, but also more becoming more widespread across the central U.S., but the threats themselves remain the same.

So, these are huge numbers.The good news right now is that things are starting off relatively smooth, but never say never. The day is still relatively young. And I just checked FlightAware. So far, we've seen about 80 cancelations in the U.S., pales in comparison to what we saw yesterday. In fact, the numbers really ramped up as the day went on and bad weather hit the East Coast. We saw about 600 cancelations in the U.S. yesterday, although last week was a lot worse. So, we are on the track to getting a little bit better. One caveat here, though, the FAA does warn that there could be ground stops today because of thunderstorms later this afternoon in New York, which has been a troubled spot, in Philadelphia, in Baltimore, in D.C., all the way down to Miami.

Well, also this morning, we're watching something that I've been trying to figure out over the course of the entirety of the last weekend, questions swirling around a recent Supreme Court decision.Now, you'll remember the court ruled last week in favor of a Christian web designer who says she shouldn't be forced to create sites for same-sex weddings. But now, the man cited in the case, named Stewart, says he never even requested a website, and says he's not only straight and married to a woman, but he's a web designer himself. Now, in an interview with CNN, he said, quote, I've never asked anybody to design a website for me, so it's all very strange. I certainly didn't contact her, and whatever the information in that request is, is fake. CNN's Joan Biskupic joins us live from Washington, D.C. Joan is the author of Nine Black Robes, Inside the Supreme Court's Drive to the Right and Its Historic Consequences. She also can explain all the questions.

In terms of the larger picture that you're talking about, in terms of how this ruling could have reverberations for other public accommodations laws, yes. I mean, this is a big deal. This is, as Justice Sotomayor said the first time, the Supreme Court said that a public accommodations law is going to essentially give a pass to someone for discriminating in this case on the basis of sexual orientation. But just as Sotomayor and others in the dissent said, this could open the door to groups, businesses, saying they don't want to serve certain clients based on other protected characteristics such as race and sex. But in terms of just the specific facts that have brought forward by Mr. Stewart here, I don't think that will affect it. But, as I say, many repercussions down the road, Audie.",

And, usually, judges and justices try to rule on cases as narrowly as possible and only rule on actual cases. And the example we were just talking about with Joan where you have this fact scenario that's now come into question. Typically, the Supreme Court would not even take a case like that because of this doctrine called standing. We don't take hypotheticals. We don't issue advisory opinions. We wait until the facts have all played out, and then we ruled. And the Supreme Court showed us in that case that they are willing to essentially rule on hypotheticals, forward-looking hypotheticals. That enables the court to take more cases. The other thing that the Supreme Court is doing is twice now in the last year, in very important ways, the Dobbs decision and then the decision that we saw last week on affirmative action, they're overruling longstanding, 40, 50 year longstanding precedents. Now, the Court can overrule precedent. People say when. The real answer is when you have five or more justices. So, this court to me, is uniquely powerful.",

It's not just about one thing or four things or five things. It's community based. It's wide ranging. I was struck yesterday when you made the point when you asked people to treat this like it was a mass shooting in a rural community as well. Can you elaborate on that? I think I understood the point you were making, but it was an interesting one, and the framing of it was interesting. What you meant for your community specifically?",

We know that when you think about this country in the history of mass shootings, most of the time when we talk about this, we're talking about it being a school in a rural community or a suburban white community. And when it happens in Baltimore or Chicago or D.C., it doesn't get that same attention. These black American lives, children's lives matter just as anyone else. We're just asking for all of them to be treated the same.Any mass shooting, anytime anyone is murdered with an illegal gun in this country should be treated the same, because it should not happen in the country that is the leader of the free world. But it does, because we as a country still allow the sanctity of American guns to outweigh the sanctity of Americans lives, and particularly Americans children's lives. And that is something that we have to change. No one is saying that people shouldn't be able to have their right to have weapons, but those who shouldn't have them, and it shouldn't be easier for a young person to get a gun for than me to be able to go to CVS and buy my allergy medication.",

It's cycled through a couple of chiefs. Do you think you're in position to have the trust and relationship with the community that you would need to find this suspect or to deal with the teen violence in general?",

And Baltimore, coming out of the Freddie Gray unrest, is now seen across the country as a department that is dealing with reform and fighting crime the right way.We're consistently holding (ph)  folks at the behest of the Department of Justice and others from other departments about how to put in those reforms through the work of our now former commissioner, police Commissioner Harrison, and now to Commissioner Worley. And even as we're going through this tragic incident, as I said yesterday, we're a city that is seeing a 20 percent reduction in homicides. And even with this mass shooting, seeing a reduction in non fatal shootings, we're going to continue to do that work, because for me, one is too many. And, yes, we're going to continue to build those bridges, rebuild bridges, build bridges that will never happen in our community. But this department has changed leaps and bounds throughout consent decree and those reform efforts and focusing in on what they need to be focused, on illegal guns, bringing them, those trafficking, those selling them, and holding those people accountable, and we will continue to do that.",
