Jordan's team say they're confident they can flip any remaining holdouts and they have flipped about a handful. Let's discuss with one of Jim Jordan's backers, Congressman Keith Self of Texas. Congressman, thanks so much for being with us. So Jordan can only lose four Republicans. By his team's count, there are at least 10 against him. What's your message to those holdouts? REP. KEITH SELF (R-TX): Well, I think Jim is doing a great job of building the momentum, of pulling those people on his side, and I think he will do that.
