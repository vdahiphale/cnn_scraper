He wants them to both conduct really deep dives into the failures that day and report back to his panel. Now Congressional oversight is a tough job.

In a 6-3 ruling, the justices rejected North Carolina Republicans' arguments that the states courts, its own courts, should have a limited to no role in reviewing election rules, rules that would be established by partisan state lawmakers. CNN's Supreme Court reporter Ariane de Vogue has been watching this case closely. Ariane, the legal theory behind this -- and let's talk first about the effect it will have on how elections are run in the states, including federal elections are run in states going forward.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, you have to remember that the supporters of president Trump here and the supporters of this theory. They were making a big ask. They wanted the court to say that state courts have no role in reviewing election rules, passed by state legislatures, when it comes to federal elections. That is a very broad theory. It was a dormant legal theory that hadn't been brought up for several years.And critics were worried about it for this reason. They said, look, it is going to up end how elections go forward. Because it could lead to rogue state legislatures. It could lead to different rules for state and federal elections within states. And that would be real confusion. That was their worry. So, today, the Supreme Court really acted swiftly here, 6-3, rejecting that theory. They said in fact that state courts do have a role here, and that -- and this is what Chief Justice John Roberts said in the majority opinion. He said, state courts retain the authority to apply state constitutional restraints when legislatures act under the power conferred upon them by the elections clause. So, basically you even heard former President Obama, he weighed in right away, praising this ruling. Saying that the court had really turned back what he called a fringe legal theory.",

As things stand right now for states that Biden carried in the 2020 are led by Republican legislatures. And, in fact, when the litigation started, the majority of state legislatures were Republicans.So that might have pushed them to sort of think in these terms and use this -- bring forward this theory. I will say that in his opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts did say, look, state courts, they do not have free reign here. There's still a role for federal courts to play, to sort of overlook that at times. So, basically the end of the day today, what the Supreme Court did is move swiftly before the next election to try to push back at the notion we have any more sort of chaotic litigation coming up.",

So that is a good thing.To put this in perspective, Jim, you mentioned the cases years ago, that never got beyond eight cases. That was eight cases in Florida. And if someone does get sick, anti-malaria drugs are very effective, best if taken early. So let's look at symptoms. Fever is the number one. There's also headaches and body aches and fatigue, et cetera. If this sounds familiar, we've all felt this way at sometime. Right? I mean, this could be a whole bunch of things.
