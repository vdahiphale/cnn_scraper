This is the largest single death toll since the war began in Gaza, or rather, since the 10th of December. And that really underscores just how bloody this operation was.Normally, these operations take place under the cover of darkness. But it began at about 11 o'clock in the morning local time on a Saturday, when many people were out and about shopping and whatnot. And as usual, in Gaza, there were children everywhere. The video that we received from our cameraman inside the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital showed that there were dozens and dozens of people desperate for medical care, many of them women and children, that the morgue was completely full and they were simply putting bodies on the ground outside the hospital. Also keep in mind that because of the Israeli operation in Rafah in the southern part of the Gaza Strip, where according to the U.N., 1,100,000 people have left that area seeking safety elsewhere. Many of them were in Nuseirat, many of them were in central Gaza when this operation went down. So there were many civilians, and that explains, perhaps partially why the death toll is so high.

For better or worse, I think it was intentional the way they conducted this operation. Probably the pandemonium that they created as part of the bombing within the Nuseirat camp itself, they thought would actually make things to their advantage as they conducted this operation. So, no, I think that they were very clear eyed.

Israelis believe maybe 46 were either killed on October 7th, their bodies brought to Gaza to trade, or they died in captivity. I think this does two things. Number one, I think it is a certainly it was a day of hope for Israelis who have been living in a sort of collective PTSD since October 7th, but it puts a premium, it seems to me, and a focus on hostages, and it also reminds the Israelis, I think, that the largest return of hostages in November 105 can only come through a negotiation. And here's where I think there is a real problem, because there are -- there's an irreconcilable set of objectives between Israel and Hamas in this negotiation. If I were to make a prediction, I don't like doing it. I think there is an opening, perhaps, but only for a phase one. That is to say, a return of 20, 30 hostages, the women, the elderly, the infirm in exchange for a six-week fire, a ceasefire, in return for Palestinian prisoners, and the surging, because it'll be quiet, six weeks of quiet in Gaza, which would be a win for the Biden administration.

Now, the White House is also hoping for the president's actions to communicate in and of themselves back to American voters back home. That is why it is so symbolic that President Biden is visiting the Aisne-Marne Cemetery just a few hours outside of Paris later today before he departs because of what you mentioned at the that President Trump did not visit that cemetery at the time, citing weather concerns back in 2018 and coming under wide criticism for not doing that. So President Biden has been trying to distinguish himself on matters where the military is concerned. His campaign releasing two ads slamming Trump's record on the military and on defense concurrent with the visit this week.

And so, this latest jobs report, you know, we don't just look at one month, we look at an entire trend. And we've just seen, month after month, jobs getting created. You know, 15 million jobs since the president came into office. It's 15 million more individuals getting to use their talent, their skill, their drive, their hunger to contribute to their communities and to make a decent living.

We're creating jobs that really allow people to make a decent living to afford the basic things in life. And that's not happening by accident. None of this was inevitable, right? It was because of strong leadership and strong economic policies. And we're just seeing the benefits now in communities across the country. Well, can you to do that. One simple way to think about it is we're not looking at a shrinking pie that needs to be divided into smaller and smaller pieces.

This video being shown in preparation for this exercise, what the South can do. And the South said that they sent a broadcast of K-pop music blared over these speakers.Again, South Korean soft military power directed towards the North. And also, news reports from South Korean media detailing human rights abuses from North Korea perpetrated by North Korean leader Kim Jong- un. So what exactly led to this point? You know, South Korea is saying, we did this one broadcast, and it's up to you, North Korea, whether or not we do another one of these again. We rewind to 11 p.m. on Saturday night. That's when we were all out.

About 80 of them made their way to South Korean territory, some of them landing in the heart of the Megalopolis that is Seoul. And if we rewind a little further back to Thursday of last week, that's when a North Korean defector who runs an advocacy human rights group in South Korea decides to send 10 balloons to their neighbors in the North, having slices of life tied to those balloons, like K-pop, K-dramas, little flash drives, leaflets denouncing the North Korean regime.

You've got some down in portions of Florida, others in Texas, then the southwestern states.So you've got several different areas here that are going to be feeling the heat. The real focus, however, is going to be in the southwest. So areas of Arizona, Nevada, portions of California, although it does stretch into portions of northern California. But look at some of the records that we had on Saturday. Three of these were actually in Florida. Then we also had one in Utah and one in Texas. Here's a look, though, at the next couple of days. You'll really start to see these numbers begin to shoot up. Take, for example, Las Vegas, going from 103 today to 108 on Tuesday. Sacramento also getting back into triple digits by Tuesday. Phoenix starting to see their temperatures get back into the 110s by the time we get to Tuesday. Here's the thing about Las Vegas. We get it. It's a hot place, especially this time of year. But even for them, this is extreme. Their normal high still is not yet in the triple digits. They'd be about 98 degrees. But every single one of these next seven days is expected to be in those triple-digit temperatures. Now, one area where we're not really seeing the heat, that's going to be where we're seeing a lot of this heavy rain. Here's a look. You can see a lot of these showers across portions of southern Missouri. And a lot of rain has already fallen in these areas. You're talking at least three to five inches. That's why we have the potential for excessive rainfall and a flooding risk, not just for Missouri, but a lot of this area, even stretching back into Colorado, Texas, as well as New Mexico.",

Here is an important warning for parents as summer gets underway. The color of your child's swimsuit may help save them from drowning. That is according to water safety experts who say there are certain colors that are easier to spot in the pool or open water than others.CNN Health Reporter Jacqueline Howard is here with us to talk about this. I mean, this is so important, and I'm so glad that we're doing this. So, basic question, what are the safest colors for your children to wear?",

This is a multi-layered security event, the biggest security operation in the county's history. And they are prepared to make sure that this event happens safely.They are expecting about 30,000 people to show up to watch this game between India and Pakistan today. So they have been checking every single person that walks through the gates of this park, the cars, the packages, the bags. Everything that's coming in is being checked by canine units, metal detectors. There's elements that we can see, as well as those that we cannot see. The police commissioner also telling us earlier this morning that this is the safest place to be in Nassau County right now. They have deployed an additional 100 police officers to other areas of the county to make sure that they are also watching for those soft targets, other areas where people are expected to be gathering as a result of this big game that's taking place today. This is India, Pakistan. It's like Yankees, Red Sox. It's a big rivalry in sports. So it's a big day for the community, a big day for the sports, but also a big day for law enforcement, the eyes of the world watching, making sure that everything goes as planned. Victor, Amara.",
