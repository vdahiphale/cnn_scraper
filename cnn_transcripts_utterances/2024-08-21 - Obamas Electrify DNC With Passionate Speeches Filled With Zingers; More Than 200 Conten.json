We will never benefit from the affirmative action of generational wealth. If things don't go our way, we don't have the luxury of whining or cheating others to get further ahead.

I am Jim Acosta live at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.The goal for the party today, keep this convention cooking for Vice President Kamala Harris. Here is a look at who is taking the stage tonight, former President Bill Clinton, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, and Harris' running mate, Vice Presidential Nominee Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota. Coming up here on the program, Minnesota Congressman Dean Phillips, you'll remember, he tried to take on President Biden in the primaries. And political influencer and reproductive rights activist Deja Foxx will be here as well. She's one of the content creators here at the convention. And later on, Congressman Seth Moulton and Congressman Joaquin Castro, they will also join me here on set. But my first guest this hour is Minnesota Democratic Congressman Dean Phillips. He was the lone Democrat to challenge President Biden for the nomination. It was a lonely quest, but you were sort of a Democrat Nostradamus back then. You did see that there might have been a need to change things at the top of the ticket and that is what has indeed happened. But I do want to ask you about -- you're from Minnesota, you know Governor Walz well. This is his big night. This is sort of -- I've been maybe describing this as Bass Pro Shop night at the Democratic convention. He does wear flannel. You can confirm that. REP.
