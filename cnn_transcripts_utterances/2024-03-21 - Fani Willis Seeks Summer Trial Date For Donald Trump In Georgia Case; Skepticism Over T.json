That would obviously be before the 2020 election. And you'll remember this would be the second time Fanie Willis has asked Judge McAfee to set a trial date. She's previously asked that he set one for August 5th. That request has gone unanswered so far. McAfee has not set a date and he's not put one on the calendar for Trump to stay in trial in Georgia. And this second request would by all means be a bold move from Fanie Willis considering what we've been talking about for the last two months.",

And we could see that come in the coming weeks. Now, look, that doesn't discount the challenges that she's still going to face. McAfee obviously was really critical of Willis's credibility, really criticizing her for her actions that almost got her disqualified from the case.And also the threat of disqualification. Still looms over Willis. An appeals court is going to decide whether or not it wants to review McAfee's order that allowed her to stay on the case. They have about 45 days to say whether or not they're going to do that. So all of this swirling. But Willis trying to set this case back on track, trying to work towards a trial at a time when she's just emerging from probably the most chaotic two months of her entire time on this case.",

But to me, 14 defendants, A RICO case, you'll have really lengthy jury selection processes.

What that means, is that it sets the stage and makes it possible for her to potentially move forward to try to seize assets in Westchester. That's where he has a golf course. Also, the family compound known as Seven Springs in a state crossing over three different jurisdictions. But it doesn't necessarily mean that she's going to move to seize those specific assets if it comes to that. You know, the judgment is also in New York, where Trump has a lot of properties, Trump Tower, his penthouse apartment there, the hotel at the corner of Central Park, as well as the office building, 40 Wall Street.And its essentially making it possible to set the groundwork that if she does want to move forward to put liens on these properties or move to initiate foreclosure proceedings, that is in place. They are on notice. Now, I also checked some of the county clerk's offices in some of the other places where Trump has properties in Florida, in Chicago. I didn't see any judgments there as of now. So right now, it looks like the stage is getting set to move in New York. But of course, there is still time, although that clock is ticking, as Trump is waiting to see if the appeals court is going to allow him to post a smaller amount or allow him to not post any money until the appeal is over. The New York Attorney General's office has opposed that. And Trump still does not have the money to satisfy that half a billion dollar judgment. Boris, Erica. HILL: In terms of that, right, I mean, are there any other options at this point? We know we've been talking about, of course, the 30 companies that refuse to loan their underwrite that money.

A lot of the large financial institutions stopped doing business with Trump years ago. You know, also some properties, you know, there are questions about what their value is. That was the issue in this whole case that the judge found that Trump inflated the value. So companies generally would want to do their own homework before deciding whether to issue a mortgage on a property. And also mortgage interest rates are high right now.That makes the cost of doing that pretty expensive. And we've seen Trump publicly state that, you know, this is an expensive process for him. That is one option. There could be a donor that comes in last minute and offers to give Trump cash for this. It remains to be seen if anyone credible is going to do that. And then, you know, he could potentially have a fire sale of one of his properties on his own. I mean, the clock there again is ticking. It seems that is unlikely. Surely Trump's are working behind the scenes as they're facing this deadline. But, you know, if not, we'll see what happens on Monday. Erica, Boris.",

Because they're here, they can file more easily. So I think they would probably start there. And remember, it's not just real estate. Even though Trump doesn't have enough in cash or cash-like assets like securities to cover the entire bill, he has some. So you would want to probably start with those liquid assets anyway. And then for the real estate that does exist, some of them, some of that value is already encumbered in other places as he's taken loans out based on the collateral of those real estate properties. So it's not as if you have the whole value of a Mar-a-Lago, for example. Even if you knew what that value was, which, of course, is part of the whole reason that we're here in the first place is that those values were exaggerated. So, you know, it depends but we'll see what they do.",

There was this debate between the Trump team and the A.G., the Trump team saying we looked at 30 different companies. Nobody could provide us this massive figure, $464 million. Letitia James argued back, essentially saying, well, maybe they can't give you all of that, but you can go to these companies and separately they can give you small chunks that then add up to that number.

So then the question becomes, well, then why don't you just do two of those or three of those or four of those or however many you can get? There's there's one of the problems here, and I think the A.G. puts her finger on it in her responses.There was not much transparency around what the Trump team actually did and what negotiations are actually were with these 30 companies. So it very well maybe, that there is the opportunity to piece together smaller bonds to make up the whole amount. The issue is just making sure that the people can be whole at the end of this. If at the end of the long appeal, the large judgment is still upheld, then, you know, they need to be paid. So that's what the bond is for.

But that didn't happen this time, at least not yet, at least not in the data we see. And so investors are reacting to that. Now, I just talked to Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody's Analytics. And I said, Mark, look, I mean, two-thirds of Americans roughly are invested in the stock market, whether it's individual stocks, whether it's their 401K. What do they make of this news? What do they make of the markets? And he said, he sent me a statement. He said, as someone once said, the stock market isn't the economy, but it's not not the economy. The soaring stock market is a strong endorsement of the strength of the prospects for lower interest rates and another good lesson to never bet against the American economy.

This has to be one of the more crafty cases. U.S. attorneys have charged this Texas man for sneaking on board a Delta flight bound to Austin. This happened in Salt Lake City on Sunday, St. Patrick's Day. And court documents say 26-year-old Wycliffe Fleurizard was planning to fly standby on a Southwest flight. That flight was overbooked. So investigators say Fleurizard went to the gate of this Delta flight. Police reviewed the security footage, which showed Fleurizard in the boarding area taking photos of multiple passengers' phones and boarding passes while they were not looking.The criminal complaint says Fleurizard scanned his fake ticket, boarded the plane, locked himself in the bathroom, and did not come out until after the plane pushed back from the gate. This plane might have worked if he did not get questioned by a flight attendant. And court documents say this. Fleurizard indicated to the flight attendant that his seat was 21F. The flight attendant verified, that the passenger who was in seat 21F was the individual who had purchased and had been ticketed for that seat, and it was not Fleurizard. So clearly this created a lot of confusion on board. Flight attendants were able to figure out this man was not on their manifest pretty quickly. So they taxied back to the gate where the police were waiting. Police say Fleurizard told them he got bumped from his original flight onto a later flight and was simply trying to get home and made a mistake. Now he's facing one count of stowing away in a vessel or aircraft. When's the last time you heard that charge? That can carry a prison time of up to five years. Fleurizard was in court today.
