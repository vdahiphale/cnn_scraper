Israel does not want to learn from history, that al-Aqsa is for the Palestinians and for all Arabs and Muslims, and that storming it sparked a revolution against the occupation.\"I guess the point here is that there have been clashes before between Palestinians and Israeli police in this area known as the Temple Mount or al-Haram al-Sharif. But sending police into the mosque, firing stun grenades and using batons to beat worshipers inside the mosque, seem seen this to a whole new level -- a whole new dangerous level. KELLER-LYNN: This is absolutely a very disturbing scene, I would say, both in terms of what the police alleged could have happened. Had the raid not occurred, the police said that the worshipers were fortifying themselves within the sacred holy place along with stones, with fireworks, which were ultimately launched against the police in order to, perhaps, attack Jewish worshippers the following day. Reminding, of course, that Jewish worshippers were planning to come consecrate the upcoming Passover holiday on Wednesday before it started this evening. What we saw in terms of the police forces reacting as strongly as they did very, very harsh videos to watch. But really, I think, speaking to the fact of how scarred people are about this time, this critical time being Ramadan, Passover and the convergence of Easter coming that only two years ago, conflicts on the Temple Mount, ultimately, were the catalyst for an 11-day conflict between Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Israel. So, this is definitely top of mind people, and a very strong response kind of with that at the forefront of Israeli consciousness.",

But what we're seeing that is particularly concerning is the involvement of other international players. There were a lot of efforts before in the lead up to Ramadan season for Israel, as well as its local neighbors, Egypt, and Jordan and the Palestinian Authority, mediated by the U.S. to some extent to really think about quelling these tensions. Of course, the new government that's headed by Benjamin Netanyahu is -- has been headed by security figures, who not necessarily have been quieting, but rather raising the tensions.",

KELLER-LYNN: Right, we have a police minister, who was indicted 15 times for charges, including incitement to violence and racism and support of a Jewish terrorist group. And we have a finance minister, who's also a second minister in our defense ministry, who said that he supports wiping off Palestinian community off the map, as well as says that there's no such thing as Palestinian people. So, we have this very difficult security situation, as well as the security Cabinet within Israel, which hasn't met since February. And like I said, the defense minister, it's unclear whether he's not in the position. So, we do have a very, I think, very problematic security situation within the Israeli government itself moving into the situation, and difficult to say how to deal with external challenges when balancing so many within the coalition itself that's supposed to be governing against them,",

The first way is that, really, the government's critical mass, weight of attention has been placed on judicial reform. Its plan to dramatically neuter judiciary power, and instead increase political power with almost unchecked and unfettered. That has been the government's sole focus, and as such, has really de-escalated its emphasis on security, even leading to this critical time. Again, we talked about what you said, extremists in the Israeli government. This would be far-right parties that have come to power through Netanyahu, since the election in November. They are part of this government, because this is the coalition that was possible for Netanyahu. So, these politics obviously play a role with these figures in power in such secure -- sensitive security settings. And then, obviously, you have all the international pressure as well, that's been playing on the Israeli government and also interfering with its own ability to orchestrate scenarios such that it could defend against this, this kind of outcome.",

You'll see a few orange boxes. Those are severe thunderstorm warnings. They go for a few more minutes where we're seeing hail and half-dollar size cover the ground in Martindale.

Houston grabbing onto some of the heavy rain through Friday morning, and unfortunately, it lags through the day on Friday. Then finally, rolling into Saturday, it will start to taper back a bit.

And flood watches, still in place through about seven o'clock central time down across parts of Texas and Louisiana and right on up through the Tennessee Valley for today, mostly through the morning for the Tennessee Valley in early afternoon. but these areas are already saturated, and we're adding more rain on top of it. Another two to possibly six inches of rain. That swath there through Texas, right on up into Southern Arkansas and right on down into Louisiana.

Here come the official invitesA lot of people talking about this because notably, Camilla is no longer referred to as \"queen consort.\" But the word \"consort\" was there simply because it refers to the wife of the reigning monarch, as opposed to Queen Elizabeth, no consort, who ascended to the throne, basically, through blood. She was born into royalty. She took over. She was the power of the throne. So why take this word \"consort\" out of the official invitation?",

And there is no such thing as a princess consort.But it was done to sort of placate people who might feel in -- in a negative way about Camilla. And it wasn't really until the late Queen Elizabeth II marked her 70 years on the throne, when she issued a statement that said that it was her sincere wish that, when her son became king, that Camilla be known as queen consort, which is not really a title. But it was -- it was the queen's, really, fairly clever effort to smooth over, to kind of dispel the idea of a princess consort and have people start to think about Camilla as a queen consort.",

And they have specified now that that is going to be in effect following the coronation. So I don't interpret that in the least as going against the wishes of the late Queen Elizabeth II. And Camilla will be not only the -- she will not only be Queen Camilla, she will be known as the queen, even though Queen Elizabeth II, for 70 years, was known as the queen, and Queen Elizabeth II.
