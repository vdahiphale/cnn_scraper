We also heard them chant, (INAUDIBLE), that means bring all of them home. This is the demand.We're on now the Ayalon Freeway. This is one of the main north/south highways through Tel Aviv. They're shutting down a couple lanes of traffic here and they'll march from Tel Aviv all the way to Jerusalem, some 40 miles over the course of the next several days. Before now, they spent a couple of weeks outside the defense ministry where the war cabinet met. There, they tried to essentially get attention, make it known that their priority was bringing the hostages home and trying to force the government to make a deal. But they feel like that hadn't gotten anywhere. So, now, they've come to the streets. And if you take a look behind me, you can see the names of the hostages, names like Atan, Ohad, Dafna, Wogan (ph), these are their families here. They're marching again all the way to Jerusalem. And their goal there when they get there on Saturday is to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and reemphasize the call to bring the families home, a tremendous sense of frustration over the lack of answers that they're getting. Sure, they heard the statements. They've seen what Netanyahu has said until now. They're palpable feeling is that not enough is being done and isn't enough -- essentially not enough of a desire or demand to come to a deal that will free the hostages still held in Gaza.

By the time they arrived at his office, they had thousands with him. That, too, is the idea here.There have been some rumors and reports of progress on hostage negotiations. President Joe Biden spoke with the emir of Qatar over the weekend, and they spoke about the need to release hostages. We also learned of a three-year-old toddler, American citizen who's being held hostage, the youngest American there.

That's when Biden holds a much anticipated meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Joining us now, Washington Post Foreign Policy Columnist Josh Rogin. Josh, great to have you on. President Biden really deeply believes, still knows this very well from covering the Biden White House, when you sit with someone face- to-face, you accomplish things you can't otherwise accomplish. And he's known Xi Jinping for a very, very long time. What is the best hope that the White House can get out of this after Jake Sullivan said over the weekend, look, we have to just like reopen the lines of communication here?",

For his entire career, President Biden has believed that foreign policy is personal, that if he just gets into the room with these leaders, good or bad, that he can connect with them and make a relationship and convince them to do good things instead of bad things and make deals that he otherwise wouldn't be able to make.Funnily enough, that's exactly what President Trump thought. And President Trump pursued a very similar strategy with Xi Jinping. He thought they were friends. They signed a fentanyl deal in 2019, I don't know if you remember, where Xi Jinping promised to curb the transfer of dangerous drugs to America in exchange for trade concessions. And Trump thought their friendship would really seal the deal. Well, it didn't work out, okay, because Xi Jinping doesn't feel that way, because the Chinese system doesn't work that way, because their policies are not going to change based on this one meeting. I hear they're going to sign another fentanyl agreement in exchange for some economic cooling off. And I'm sure both sides will present that as progress, but it's not. And that's the bottom line here, is that they're going to meet for four hours. They set a bar that's so low that communication is the goal and they will achieve that bar. But in terms of solving any of the problems in the U.S.-China relationship, addressing China's economic aggression, its military expansion, its internal repression, its problem with all of its other neighbors who will also be there in San Francisco, 20-something Asian countries. No, no real progress at all. So, yes, talking is better than not talking. Winston Churchill said, jaw, jaw is better than war, war. But if you set the bar that low, then that's not really an improvement in U.S.-China relations. That's just stopping it from getting worse fast.",

All you have to do is watch Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo's interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, excellent interview, I encourage everybody to watch it. And what Gina Raimondo said is it's time to lower the temperature in the relationship. It speaks to what you just said, Phil. Well, it was hot. Now it's going to get cool.The problem is that the goal, in my view at least, the goal of U.S.- China relations is not to have a low temperature. It's not to get along. The point is to protect U.S. values and interests and to work with our partners to respond to the threats and challenges that China presents as it rises, where they affect us. So, for the first two years of the Biden administration, I think you had this really competitive policy led by people like Tony Blinken and Jake Sullivan, which was like, oh, we're going to solve some of these problems by being pretty tough with the Chinese, not as rude and obnoxious as the Trump people, but still pretty tough. Now, we're here in year three. It's a political cycle. And now the ball has been handed to the economic officials, which is what the Chinese want. And now you have Janet Yellen and Gina Raimondo saying, okay, well, listen, we got to turn down the temperature. So, yes, they'll be able to turn down the temperature but I worry that doesn't solve the problems.",

And, you know, China's the world power and the second biggest country economy in the world, second biggest military in the world. They deserve to be treated with respect. Don't get me wrong. We want good relations with China. Don't get me wrong. We want good trade relations with China. But it takes two to tango, Poppy.So, what you're going to have is the president United States tell Xi Jinping, well, we really want you to tell Iran to stop being so bad. We really appreciate if you tell Putin not to be so bad in Ukraine. And Xi Jinping will have his own list of grievances, some of which are absolutely valid. And for both sides, it makes political sense to have this meeting. They can go back to their countries and say, hey, we talked You know, I told them the tough messages and I got an agreement that things are going to get better, and it makes sense politically. I get why Biden is doing this. I don't think it's bad to talk. You know, I'm not -- that's not what I'm trying to say. All I'm trying to say is this is a political exercise more than a diplomatic exercise and they both get something politically out of it. But the structural problems in the U.S.-China relationship are only going to get worse and I think the relationship is just going to get worse before it gets better. But, you know, let's be optimistic. Maybe they'll surprise us and come up with something that I can't even predict. HARLOW:  Hey, we will take that glass half full at the end.

But to Senator Durbin's point and your point earlier, Poppy, there is no external enforcement mechanism, and also, more importantly, nothing internal. There's nothing internal that they've set up that would allow a channel for any complaints to come in for the justices themselves to even air some of those complaints. So, I think that you're right when you refer to the separation of powers and the chief justice's interest in trying to make sure that they preserve their own integrity, but they still need to sort of answer that question of, if something goes wrong, if a complaint is even made outside, will the justices answer it in some way?
