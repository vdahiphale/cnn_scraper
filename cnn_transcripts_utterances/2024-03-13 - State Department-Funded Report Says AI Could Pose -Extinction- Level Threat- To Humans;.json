      "sentences": "Yeah. John, if you're looking for some light reading stay away from this report because it is almost 300 pages long and it is as scary as any sci-fi novel out there.They're basically laying out two central dangers here, right? The first one is that AI systems could become weaponized, and the second is that they could become so advanced that we lose control of them. Let me read you a key line from this report. They write, \"Given the potential capabilities of such a system, in the worst case, such a loss of control could pose an extinction-level threat to the human species.\" Now, I know that may sound ridiculous but it does echo some of the concerns we've heard from CEOs, from academics, from even the godfather of AI himself, Geoffrey Hinton. The U.S. State Department did confirm, yes, they did pay for this report but, no, it does not represent the views of the U.S. government. But it was based on interviews with hundreds of people in AI, in cybersecurity, in WMD, and in U.S. national security. And the researchers -- they warned that eventually, AI could introduce WMD- like risk to the U.S. I'll give you just a few examples of what we're talking about. AI- powered cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns that could destabilize society, and weaponized robotics. And there's also this risk that AI systems could become so advanced that they basically refuse to be turned off. Because if they get turned off, they can't accomplish their goals.",

I mean, it is amazing what these tools can do.And I did talk to one of the researchers here who said that yes, AI could be a game-changer for U.S. society, right? It could help us cure diseases and make scientific discoveries. But they are warning that the U.S. government does need to act here. So they're laying out some sweeping recommendations here for safeguards, including launching a new AI regulatory agency. Emergency safeguards, such as limiting how much computer power AI models can train themselves on. Export controls. But one of the problems here, John -- and you know this -- is timing. There's a lot of debate -- a lot of unknowns here over how fast AI is going to evolve. And so, one of the issues here is if they impose really tough regulation too soon they could stifle innovation. They could let other countries get ahead of the U.S. in the AI arms race. Of course, if they want too long, that could be disastrous, too.",
