They called \"The Onion's\" bid a fragrantly noncompliant Frankenstein bid, where as the court appointed trustee, Christopher Murray, obviously felt very differently and said that the other bid from \"The Onion\" was a better bid.Now Ben Collins, he's the CEO of \"The Onion\", he said in a statement last week, \"The long-and-short of it, we won the auction. And you're not going to believe this. The previous Infowars folks are not taking this well.\" He says they expected all this, buying the site was always going to be fun later on but annoying right away, and he says the fun part is still to come. The trustee in this case also filed an interesting motion responding to some of these allegations, calling them baseless, selective quoting, and half-truths. Now, I do have to say Judge Christopher Lopez, the bankruptcy judge in this case, he held a status hearing last week on this. He seemed a little bit perturbed with how the process worked out, but he said they will be holding evidentiary hearing next week to try to get to the bottom of what happened. Sara?",

Question one, will the House Ethics Committee decide today to release the report on their lengthy investigation into Matt Gaetz? We could know in a matter of hours that decision, which could have real impact on if and when Trump's attorney general choice gets a confirmation hearing. A lawyer now claims that Gaetz allegedly paid two young women more than $10,000 for sex while he was a sitting member of Congress.Question two, what will Gaetz say to senators today? He and J.D. Vance are headed to Capitol hill to try and woo over Republican, key Republican senators, the very Republican senators who will decide his cabinet fate, some who have publicly expressed skepticism about the man, his past, and his qualifications to run the Justice Department. And question three, who will Donald Trump select today? Another round of job announcements overnight and another round of job announcements still to come. One of the big ones still lingering out there, Treasury Secretary. Let's start with Alayna Treene this hour. She's joining us. Alayna, what's the latest?",

Vance, takes him, as well as Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick to run the Department of Defense, to meetings around Capitol Hill. I'm told those meetings are going to be taking place today and tomorrow. And what's really interesting is that Vance is planning to sit in on those meetings. When Matt Gaetz goes to meet with some of these key senators who are going to be involved in his Senate confirmation process, the vice president elect is going to be there as well. And it's another sign of just how much Donald Trump is not backing away from some of his more controversial picks.I'd note, as well, that we know that Elise Stefanik and Doug Collins, Donald Trump's picks for the U.N. ambassador, as well as the to lead the Veterans Affairs Department respectively, they will be on Capitol Hill meeting with senators as well. But Vance is not sitting in on those meetings. He is only sitting in on the ones where we know that both of these men have pretty controversial pasts and allegations that are resurfacing. Now, one thing that's very clear again, though, is that Donald Trump is digging in on Matt Gaetz. We know and we have reported that he's been personally lobbying senators, calling them up to tell them that he wants their support. And he was asked about this yesterday as well. I want you to listen to what Donald Trump told reporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And this consultant said, you know, it's almost like we have entered the new era of the American oligarch. We think of how these wealthy individuals run Russia, of course, Vladimir Putin giving them wide latitude to do what they want.But it's not really fair to say that, I think, because overall, we have seen the wealthy been very much involved in government. But to your point, $326 billion. His company was built on American taxpayer money, low interest loans given by the government, policies that not only promoted the use of clean energy, but the $7,500 tax credit that people remember when they bought their electric vehicle, their Tesla, well, that helped boost his sales. So across the board, as much as Elon Musk is incredibly a dismissal of the federal government, it was the federal government that has helped him become the richest person in the world.",

And he's had some controversial things in the past as well with some of the supplements that he's been selling.

But let me start with the facts here, because what the State Board of Education is doing in Austin is they are voting on a menu of curriculum for public schools here in the state of Texas. One of those items on the menu is curriculum created by the state of Texas, by the Texas Education Agency. It's called Bluebonnet Learning and it has received a lot of criticism. Now, critics say that it leans too much towards the Bible, that it focuses too much on Christianity and not on other religions as well. Now, there's been a lot of criticism about this but there's people both for and against who have been outspoken, who have spoken out before the state board. Some of them say that this is an issue of the separation of Church and State. Other people have said that public schools should not turn into Sunday schools and other individuals say that there's nothing wrong with some of these Biblical references in these materials. Here are people talking on both sides of the issue. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He also issued a statement saying, in part, \"... that these materials allow our students to better understand the connection of history, art, community, literature and religion.\" The final vote on this is on Friday. But, John, here is the crux of this entire story. Public schools in the state of Texas have the power to decide what they students. They decide the curriculum. But here's the thing, the state of Texas is providing a very big incentive for these schools to use the state created curriculum, this very controversial curriculum because the state would give each school district $40.00 per student and an additional $20.00 per student if they decide to choose this curriculum. That's a total of $60.00. And you and I know that many public schools have had many budget woes, and this is a pretty big incentive for them to choose the state product -- John",

WAGMEISTER: Yes so, Sara, overnight, five new accusers, five new lawsuits. There are three John Does and two Jane Does, so all anonymous plaintiffs. Now, the allegations are incredibly graphic and incredibly disturbing; Combs denies all of them. But there are very similar patterns in these five lawsuits that we have seen in many of the other lawsuits. By the way, I want to point out that Combs is now facing over 30 civil suits from 30 different accusers. All five of these accusers claim that they were drugged before they were sexually assaulted, and the three male accusers all claim that they were sodomized by Combs. So again, very graphic allegations, but here is the twist, all five of these accusers, Sara, are represented by that attorney Tony Buzbee, who was just sued for extortion by that anonymous celebrity. So it is all related now, Buzbee of course, denies those extortion claims, and when I reached out to Combs' attorneys last night, they denied these allegations and the five new lawsuits. But they didn't respond actually to these specific claims in the complaints. They actually put more of their focus on Buzbee, and they told me that these are -- that as they've said before, that Combs has never sexually assaulted anyone and they said, this is just a money grab and a publicity stunt from  Buzbee.",
