Columbia University in chaos, hundreds right now defying a deadline to vacate the encampment. Plus, Trump's favorite network back-tracking, now pulling a salacious story about two major witnesses in Trump's hush money trial. Could the false story impact the case? And she's back. Marjorie Taylor-Greene returning to the Capitol, tonight, promising to kick out Mike Johnson as speaker. Is she bluffing? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news. Protesters and police facing off as tensions are running high, at universities across the United States tonight, colleges and universities are now cracking down on pro- Palestinian protesters who have taken over some of the campuses. Let me just show you some of the dramatic live pictures of what you're looking at here. This massive crowd is in Texas. Police in riot gear can be seen moving in earlier, tearing down barriers and forcefully arresting students. This was the University of Texas at Austin, those students have been camped out on campus and at least 40 students we understand at UT-Austin were reportedly taken into custody. Meantime, in New York, protesters are defying a mandatory deadline to tear down their encampment in Columbia University. It gave the students until 2:00 this afternoon to pack it in, and they did not. They defied that order. So now we are learning at this hour, unclear what the security situation is, and a lot of questions about that at this moment, but we are learning meaning that the university is actively suspending students, as I speak. This situation is a tinderbox. I mean, moments ago was student was flying a massive Israeli flag over pro-Palestinian protesters. The man holding the flag telling CNN he's been harassed and assaulted on campus. And as I mentioned, these protests have been spreading. It is now coast-to-coast, California to Boston at the White House, the administration is now watching very closely. So far, those still refusing to weigh in on whether the students should be disciplined for disrupting schedules, classes, and graduation plans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: So got to be super, super mindful. These are institutions, some of them are private, some of them are public. And it is up to their leadership. University leadership and colleges to make that decision. Not going to weigh in on that from here. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The ICC has been investigating possible war crimes by both Israeli forces and Palestinian militants. Now, if the ICC were to issue an arrest warrant, for example, for Prime Minister Netanyahu -- well, more than 120 countries have signed on to the ICC, which would place travel restrictions on Netanyahu so that would be incredibly significant. We have a team of reporters standing by to begin our breaking coverage this hour. Omar Jimenez is at Columbia in New York.

In fact, a large bus full of state troopers that were wearing the right gear, if you will, left about an hour ago on a city -- a city bus that was used to bring them onto the campus grounds here. So these are not those officers. In fact, I believe these are UT police department officers. So these are officers that this is their jurisdiction.",

They were trying to push the crowd back.Clearly, we saw that that spray that was fireball that was very close perimeter spray that was used. It was it like a volley of tear gas or anything like that?

We'll get back to Ed in a moment as that develops. I want to go now to Omar Jimenez because he's at Columbia in upper New York and Omar Columbia has laid down the law. Everyone had to get out, get out of that tent encampment, which is in one corner of the quad is I saw it the other day. But protesters, at least from what we understand, if not moved. What are you seeing right now? [19:10:10] OMAR JIMENEZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah. So were seeing a combination of things just for the viewers watching, overseeing behind this is a very small handful of protesters outside of Columbia's campus. So these protesters are separate from the encampment led protests that we've been seeing on campus. And yes, as you mentioned, there was a 2:00 p.m. deadline today for those -- for those students to voluntarily leave that encampment or face suspension, many did not leave. In fact, many of them chose to take part in a separate protest encircling that encampment, as one student told me to stop university officials from coming in, even university professors and faculty linked arms at the entrance to the encampment in support of some of those students. All of that said the campus is now levying suspensions as they told us. They're starting to hand those out. They also said there's a further disciplinary process for others that they're reviewing. But those suspensions are coming. We are in there just -- just about an hour or so ago, a little bit more than that ago as suspensions were first being handed out and there were still protesters inside of there. So it remains to be seen from a university perspective, what happens if, even if suspensions are coming through, if they choose to still not leave, because as a university said this morning, they do not believe calling in NYPD again is productive. But the question is, for how long would that last?",

Some types of protest actions, including occupying or blocking access to buildings and outdoor and establishing outcome encampments are inherently unsafe for both those involved and for bystanders. They increase the potential for escalation and confrontation. There also inconsistent with the university's mission and legal obligation to provide a safe environment for all.For those reasons, among others, our policies explicitly prohibit such conduct. They're trying to say you can protest, but you can't camp out, you can't block buildings, you can't -- you can't do the encampment the way you were doing.

So, there's a handful of them kind of standing guard outside of the school.But now, these protests are saying that they're going to go back to the south side of the campus and the campus square area. And this is where the protests started this afternoon. And that is an area where we saw and we were reported live this afternoon as state troopers and Austin police, and as well as University of Texas police department, were we witnessed taking several dozen people into custody and arrested. They were warned that if they did not disperse here this afternoon, that they would be arrested for disorderly conduct. And we saw those arrests as the officers went to the encampment area, which is relatively small there on the south mall and started plucking people out of their one-by-one. It took several hours to do all of that. But university officials said the reason they did that, Erin, is because they were not going to allow any kind of signs of tents or any kind of a scene where it would be taken as an occupation of any portion of the campus grounds here. And that's why -- that's why university officials say the officers in the state troopers were brought in. They were decked out in riot gear. Now, these protesters are going back to the same area where all of this started. I mean, it's not exactly clear what their intention will be, but what university officials really latched onto earlier is that when there was a sign that it was going to be some sort of occupation with tents and that sort of thing, that that was something that they're not going to allow. University officials have been seen what has happened in other campuses across the country. And you get the clear indication that they do not want to see that scene unfold here on this campus. So they are going to prevent it as quickly as possible. These protesters will obviously tell you that they are protesting peacefully. That they're not doing anything wrong, that should be allowed to express themselves. But now, as you can see here, trying to move a little bit faster as you can see exactly trying to get a sense, Erin, of what the intention will be here on the south mall of the UT campus. And in a second, you'll be able to see the state capital building there in the distance and the question will become just how long these students so her protesters will be staying here in this portion of the campus. Exactly how long they will be allowed to stay here. Earlier, they had -- officers had cleared a lot out of people, out of this grass area, this grassy area, but I do not see a heavy law enforcement presence at all at this point.
