So, there's this question, okay, is the protest vote bigger on the Democratic or Republican side? Nikki Haley's getting 27 percent of the vote there. But, of course, Donald Trump easily winning here.I should note there's a GOP convention. Not just a primary in the state of Michigan, where most of the delegates are, in fact, going to be allotted. Some of the delegates will be allotted based upon this primary, but we're not exactly sure how. We'll find out this weekend. Where is Donald Trump not doing necessarily as well? Well, let's go down to a familiar part of the state. Let's go down again. The home of Ann Arbor, Michigan University, University of Michigan, excuse me. Donald Trump getting 53 percent of the vote. We just jumped up to Monroe. Let's go back. Nikki Haley getting 42 percent of the vote there. But in most of the state, you know, you go up to that Upper Peninsula. Upper Peninsula, as my dear friend Billy, who's a producer here, reminded me of. Nikki Haley just getting 18 percent of the vote. Donald Trump getting 78 percent. Overall, Donald Trump just doing very well in Michigan. He's doing considerably better there than he did in New Hampshire, where he got just 54 percent. Or if you go to South Carolina this past weekend, you saw Donald Trump got 60 percent of the vote.

And voters came out with a lot of enthusiasm with that commitment. And now the question has to be to President Biden and his campaign. What will they do to heed the call of the people that have come out and said we are a pro-peace, anti-war movement that wants our leaders to be better.

We want peace. And we want peace for Israelis. And we want peace for Palestinians. The question is, will we have leaders that will heed that call and usher that peace forward? And you cannot do that by funding bombs to a regime that is hell-bent on, wiping the Palestinians out from Gaza, as we've seen demonstrated through the 80% of the civilian infrastructure that has been destroyed, 30,000 dead, 2 million displaced, and nearly 100,000 that are still missing or presumed dead.

So there's a kind of transactional nature that puts them both in each other's camp. But I do think this is a little different of a Trump operation this time. They are kind of pitching more frontally to their own voters that we are not going to be deferential to \"the swamp,\" quote, unquote, this time around. And if we come back, you can expect us to upend, and that should be a part of your choice. That should be your expectation of this campaign. And so I think that that was -- you know, Donald Trump, explicit always. But I think now it's an explicit promise of what they're offering to voters.

My question, look at all these things in connection, I'm often wondering who has got the harder hill to climb at this point. You've got Biden confronting the \"uncommitted\" with foreign policy. You've got Trump and his laundry list and a lot of things with legal issues. When you look at its expansively, who has the harder hill? Which is going to be more of a problem for the voters? What do you think? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Listen, I'm going to come straight in the middle on this and say they both have an equal hill to climb here. We know what the issues are. I think one of these sort of underlying problems is it's all unpredictable. You can't tell what's going to happen with these court cases with Donald Trump. Some of the polling does suggest, if there is conviction, some Republicans might waver a little bit. Those independence certainly, I'm sure would sort of question their support of Donald Trump if he is, in fact, convicted. Whether or not that happens, we don't really know. In terms of Joe Biden, again, who knows what's going to happen on the ground in Gaza; with foreign policy more generally; with both of their ages, right? These are men, he -- Joe Biden's 81. Donald Trump is 77, probably not the healthiest person. I heard he eats two fish fillet sandwiches at a time. Those are delicious sandwiches, by the way. (CROSSTALK)",

I mean, I just -- can I say that? I mean, I don't want this. I don't know anyone else who wants this. I don't even think, other than Donald Trump, I don't even think Joe Biden would have necessarily wanted this. And so when we look at these two people together, and you see the polling, one of the things that comes up again and again and again is that people know who these two guys are, and they have real feelings about them either way. And the question is how much movement is there really going to be? That's why I guess what's happening in Michigan is so interesting. That's why the IVF situation is so interesting. Can that move the needle? I mean, I don't know, because truly when you talk to people, people have an opinion about Donald Trump. People, they either love him or they hate him. People now have an opinion about Joe Biden. They've seen him for three years. And so I just don't know how much movement there's going to be.

And how do you say to a woman, how are Republican candidates going to say, I trust you to do complicated IVF, but I don't trust you to make the best decision for yourself about whether or not you should be pregnant. And I don't trust you to take that medicine. Man, it's going to be ridiculous. And so I actually think yes, both men have challenges, but I think Joe Biden actually has more positives to run on in terms of his actual record, what he's actually done for the country that, you know, look, they have not done a good job communicating it. I don't know where the disconnect is. But I'd rather have that hand and and be moving that ball down the field than the Trump trials, whereas we saw, in case after case, just so far, you don't know what's going to come out.

But people don't feel it, because they are living the same sort of, you know, barely above water kind of existence. So that, I think, is one of the reasons he's not connecting, because you can explain what the unemployment rate is. But if people don't feel it, they don't feel it.

And it means a lot of different things in different places. It means bridges, sure, but you have Republicans taking credit for some of that money and saying, look what I brought to my district. And so it's dispersed. And so a lot of -- a lot of the problem that this administration has had is really saying, Look, I've made your life tangibly better.

OK. The Biden versus Trump poll margin without Kennedy in Arizona, Trump plus five. With Kennedy, look at this. It shrinks down to a tie. Very significant change there. But in Georgia, interestingly enough, you actually see the opposite pattern. Trump was up by five without Kennedy. Now you add Kennedy into the equation, and you get Trump-plus seven.
