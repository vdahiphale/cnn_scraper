I mean, it was an active situation as they're even approaching.And you've covered these developing horrible, tragic stories like this, especially on tragic days like this one so many times before. It is striking when you hear from the Governor, his personal connection to this, and just how it is hitting so close to home for so many people.",

They are giving us these timelines.I mean, they normally always do. But now it just seems like they want to make a point to say we got there quickly. We took action quickly.

Those are very key questions that authority is certainly going to have to try and answer in the coming days.",

Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear spoke at the press conference. And he said that at the bank location, he lost two friends in the shooting. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. ANDY BESHEAR, (D-KY): This is awful. I have a very close friend that didn't make it today. And I have another close friend who did neither. And one who's at the hospital that I hope is going to make it through. So, when we talk about praying, I hope people will. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He was you know, breaking his voice cracking because he lost two friends and there is a third person in critical. John Miller brought this point up just a moment ago that you know these shootings are happening so often.Mass shootings and generally, shootings across the country were now at more than 145. That it's starting to become very personal because it's happening to people close to those with the power to change things. What do you see this doing, if anything, potentially to change the way things are I know you're from Kentucky yourself.",

      "sentences": "Yes, I'm here in Louisville. My office is just a couple of miles outside of downtown. In fact, if I look out the window over here, I can see that part of downtown where this tragedy occurred.That overhead shot you're seeing in eastern downtown Louisville, you see a baseball field, that's the Louisville Slugger Field. That's where our Triple-A baseball team plays. And I have season tickets. I take my kids there all the time. That's a very heavily trafficked part of downtown Louisville. [11:40:02] And I think one thing about Governor Beshear's comments that were striking to me is you know Louisville is the biggest city in Kentucky but it's a very small town. I mean, everybody here has connections to everybody. In the previous campaigns, I think I had some connection to the bank there. We have a bank in the bottom of our building where I am right now, and some employees downstairs. We're telling an employee of mine that they knew some of the folks that were at this bank. So, it's a big city for Kentucky, but it really is a small town. And you can see already, as information filters throughout the community, just the connectivity that people have to the shooting. So, it's pretty shocking and pretty tragic. And Louisville, by the way, is a city that has for the last several years, been one of the more violent cities in America. We have a very high homicide rate here anyway. And then you throw this shooting on top of it. And it's just a lot of heartbreak for the city will. JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR (on camera): Yes. Governor Beshear said that his campaign for Attorney General was in that building at the Old National Bank. And said he knows two people who didn't make it out today. Another one was being treated in the hospital right now. We talked about the mayor. You say the violence that has been in that city. The mayor -- shooting last year during his campaign. Scott, just give us a sense -- and I know you said you're about a mile or two away right now, if you have a sense of the people you're talking to just how this is hitting there for you and for others this morning.",

It's just a couple of blocks from the Yum Center where the University of Louisville has some sporting events including basketball. There's big concerts there. It's our biggest venue -- one of our biggest venues. So, in that part of downtown Louisville, people go there all the time.It's also very close to the waterfront on the Ohio River and sort of the waterfront park area. So, people are constantly down there with their families. And I think that's one thing about this particular bout of violence that we're having here is this is in an area where you can easily visualize yourself, going with your own family, with your own kids, you know. This isn't happening, you know, in somewhere where you can't imagine yourself being you know in a private residence, for instance. This is in a public place where you could very easily have been taking a walk this morning. This is one of the most beautiful days of the year here so far. You could have been right there. And I think as I've talked to people here in my own office, that's one of the things about this is people are just visualizing themselves being in this part of the town and wondering, well what if I had been walking by when this happened? So, it's very, very sad, people's hearts are broken and no one really has any -- anything other than just shock and heartbreak right now here in Louisville.",

I mean, you and I -- you and I have often talked about -- you know about Louisville, about your -- about your life in Kentucky, in your -- in your love of everything -- of everything in Louisville and in the state. You know, the governor said during this press conference, not only about his connection to people who were killed and injured. He also said that I want people to know that -- know today that this is a safe community. Do you feel that way this morning?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think there's a raging debate going on in Louisville right now about homicide rates, gun violence, the overall crime rate in this town. It was a big feature actually, in last year's race for mayor. We had a mayor for 12 years. He left office. The mayor's race was an open seat. And so, there was a huge debate about crime in Louisville, Kentucky. It was one of the top issues that are being debated.And so, this is -- this has been discussed, you know, really for the last several years is what are we going to do about the violence in Louisville. Now, we haven't had mass shootings like this one. But we have had a lot of homicides here, a very high homicide rate. And as was noted by someone earlier, the Louisville Police Department has been in the eye of the storm regarding policing procedures here because of the Breonna Taylor case. and then the Department of Justice report that came out. So, when you think about public affairs or political affairs in a city, Louisville, I would say as much as any other city in America has been having a community conversation and a community debate about violence. And so, do I feel like parts of the city are violent? Absolutely. I mean, there -- this is a common conversation you would have with people living here. I don't think anybody feels like you're going to walk into a mass shooting you know like this one at any given time. But certainly, this idea of Louisville being a violent place has been on the minds of most of its citizens for the last couple of years -- several years.",
