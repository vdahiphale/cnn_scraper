      "sentences": "It is a busy night for election officials in Arizona. They've been scrambling to process and count more ballots. We're crunching all the new numbers as they come in tonight. The nation, of course, is waiting for the final word on which party or parties will be in charge of the House and the Senate over the next two years?I'm Jake Tapper in Washington. Arizona will be one of the deciders in the fight for control of the U.S. Senate. Take a look at the state of play right now. At this moment, Democrats have 48 U.S. Senate seats. Republicans have 49. Republicans need two more seats to read the math -- to reach the magic number of 51 required to retake control of the U.S. Senate. And three Senate races remain undecided in Georgia, in Arizona and Nevada. Now we know the Georgia race is heading to a runoff in December, because neither candidate got above 50 percent of the vote. It's possible Senate control will not be determined until then, but it could be determined by what happens in Nevada and Arizona. Turning to the House. The numbers just changed again a little while ago. Remember, 218 seats are needed to control the House of Representatives. Democrats have 188 seats, including four pickups. Republicans now have 208 seats moving closer and closer to the threshold to retake the majority of the House. Thirty-nine races that could tilt control of the House remain as of now undecided. But let's go back to Arizona now because CNN senior national correspondent Kyung Lah is in Arizona for us. She's watching the tight races for Senate and for governor. And Kyung Lah, all eyes on Maricopa County, the most populous county in all of the Grand Canyon state.",

      "sentences": "You know, and these campaigns absolutely feel the weight of everything that you are talking about, Jake, the control of the U.S. Senate comes down to these little numbers that we're looking at, and that is very clear when you talk to the various campaigns. I've spoken to a flurry of sources at all of the campaigns. Let's start with Democrat Mark Kelly. A source with knowledge of what's happening inside the campaign calls a reaction from within as a, quote, \"good patch, a good batch\" that this was something that they were expecting and it is building pad. So they are feeling good about it. This is going their way.As far as the Masters campaign, someone with knowledge, a source with knowledge of, quote, \"what's happening in the Masters war room\" called a quote, \"the worst drop, but we knew it would be.\" So, it's not a surprise. They knew that this one would not be very good, but they are expecting and hoping that things are going to change. As far as the Kari Lake campaign, they are saying that this isn't super predictive of where this is going. The campaign at the Kari Lake headquarters is still believing that things are going to change, and why do they believe this? Because of what is still out. What Maricopa County has said is that it is those late early, those mail-in ballots that were filled in and then dropped off in person. The expectation from the Kari Lake campaign and the Masters' campaign is that those are going to lean to the Republicans and then you're going to start seeing tomorrow some change. Now, we can't predict how that's going to go because this is unpredictable. Voting patterns have changed so much. The way voters feel and believe it has changed constantly from 2018 to 2020 here in this state. So, we do not know how these are going to go. The hope by these campaigns is that tomorrow is going to be a different day. One other bit of context, Jake. The confidence of the Kari Lake campaign is that there was a press conference scheduled for this evening to react from this data dump, but that press conference was cancelled. This count is taking a long time. So even though they're projecting this sort of confidence, there is certainly some hesitation as these numbers trickle out. Jake.",

Clark County, almost three quarters of the population lives in this county. This building behind me is the Clark County election headquarters. We were inside a short time ago.We wanted to show you some pictures of tabulations of votes. These are not in person votes from yesterday. Those votes are all done. These are mail in ballots. [22:04:58] Every person who votes in the state of Nevada who registered to vote received a mail-in ballot. There has been an extraordinary number of mail-in ballot sent in since October 24th, and there are lots of votes still to count. So, when we were inside, we watched them tabulate the votes. You will not seek any faces as a sad sign of the times. For security reasons, the election workers didn't want their faces shown. There were also Republican and Democratic observers in there. They didn't want their faces shown, but here's what we know. When the day started, the incumbent U.S. Senator Catherine Cortez Masto was trailing Adam Laxalt, the Republican challenger by about 22,500 votes. These are the numbers we just got a short time ago. They counted 13,327 votes. Cortez Masto got 9,158 new votes, Laxalt 4,169. That's a net gain for Cortez Masto of 4,989. So, the lead has gone from about 22,500 to 17,500, and now this is just a tip of the iceberg. Tomorrow, another 12,700 votes roughly, and they were received in the mail. Today will be counted, and also here's the big number, about 57,000 votes that were put in boxes yesterday at the various voting centers, about 300 boxes. So, a total of 70,000 more votes are expected to be counted tomorrow. So, we have a lot of counting still due. And one more thing, Jake, after that's counted, we still have tomorrow, Friday and Saturday for more mail in ballots to arrive as long as they were postmarked by yesterday, they'll arrive over the next three days, and that's conceivably tens of thousands of more votes. So, anything can happen.",

We have very dramatic stakes still waiting in the House. The governor's race in both Nevada and Arizona still in play. Incredibly important states, again for the citizens of those states.

In New York, Democratic Congressman Pat Ryan has been reelected, CNN Projects. Ryan is an army veteran who's been in Congress for just a few months. He won a special election in August.Now let's turn to a controversial member of Congress. But before we do that, let us give you the balance of power right now. The balance of power, the Democrats have 189 seats, that includes four pickups, and Republicans have 208 seats. That includes 16 pickups, 38 seats remain needed to control, the magic number of course, 218. The state of play right now when it comes to those competitive House seats that we have not yet called. Democrats need to win 22 of them in order to win or keep control of the House of Representatives. Republicans need to just win seven of the competitive seats that are outstanding. Now let's turn to a controversial member of Congress whose political future seems in peril tonight. Brianna Keilar is at our voting desk with that. Brianna. BRIANNA KEILAR, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, that's right Jake. We're talking about Congresswoman Lauren Boebert who finds herself in an unexpectedly tight race and what was supposed to be a reliably GOP district. I mean, very reliably GOP. She, of course, is a vocal Trump loyalist. She has national name recognition as beloved by Trump Republicans as she is condemned by liberals for election denialism and antics like heckling President Biden during his State of the Union address, or posing with guns for her family Christmas card days after a deadly school shooting. So, what's happening with her? Well, right now she is very narrowly trailing Adam Frisch who is a former Aspen City councilman right now, by less than 100 votes, he is ahead of her by that. So, let's zone in here on Pueblo County, south of Colorado Springs to see why she and her campaign may be very worried. They should be worried because this is a county that trends Democratic. And I spoke tonight with Gilbert Ortiz. He is the clerk there in charge of elections, and he told me that all of their outstanding votes to count were all election day votes. They actually just reported out 2,000 of those votes that he told me they were going to report out. But the teams here, they are exhausted. They've been working 18-hour days. They need sleep, so they're not going to be done here. They're going home for the night. They're going to be back at tomorrow at 9 Mountain Time, which is of course 11 a.m. Eastern. And they're going to finish the last 2,000 approximately votes. But John and Jake, that's going to be essential to really seeing what happens in this race that now a lot of people are watching that they didn't expect they would be.",

So, he's running very well in this traditionally Democratic area, so that, that's one piece of the district that that's one, one piece of the district. So that's some of it.

This is where Grand Junction is located. They, this trends in favor of Lauren Boebert here, and they're waiting on approximately 5,000 military ballots, ballots that the machines initially had trouble reading. Those cured ballots as well. So, a picture here altogether of just how razor close this race is and will likely remain as we're going to be waiting for a few more votes. And also, as if we didn't need to add more drama to this. If this race is within half a percentage point, which it very well could be, as you're looking here, it will trigger a recount. That's how Colorado goes.

The Republican majority, assuming they take the majority, wants to go after Hunter Biden, investigate the president's son over his foreign business dealing. All those issues will come to a head in a Republican Congress, but those topics were not discussed in this very brief and polite phone call from tonight. But Anderson, it is not unusual for a new president to deal -- a president to deal with a new speaker. Remember what happened with Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi? How contentious that relationship began -- began -- became after Pelosi became after Donald Trump's first midterm, or when Barack Obama had to deal with John Boehner who became speaker after 2010 Republican wave there, they too had to learn how to work together, and they too were at longer heads from time to time over some major fiscal fights in the Obama year.

That's a little closer, a little more narrow advantage for the Democrat than Joe Biden had against Trump in Arizona two years ago. We also took a look at Nevada. And what you see in Nevada is a Cortez Masto has 62 percent of Latinos. They make up 12 percent of the vote in Nevada.Adam Laxalt gets 33 percent according to our exit polls. This is roughly in line with what the Biden/Trump Latino split was in Nevada two years ago. In Georgia, Latinos make up 6 percent of the overall vote in Georgia. You see Warnock winning them 58 percent to 39 percent. This two is a little more narrow than the advantage Biden had over Trump in Georgia in 2020. So, you do see slight inroads that Republicans are making with Latinos in these key states. And in Arizona, Fetterman gets 68 percent of the Latino population there to Mehmet Oz's 30 percent. In Pennsylvania, Jake, they only make up 8 percent of the electorate, but that's an increase significantly. So, from two years ago when Latinos were 5 percent of the electorate in Pennsylvania.

And in some key places too, I mean we we're talking about Nevada and Arizona and the west, but in South Texas they had three competitive districts where they ran Latino candidates.
