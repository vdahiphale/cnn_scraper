And whatever moves the U.S. can make towards warming the relationship or taking it off of the confrontational footing that it's currently on -- look, we're probably not going to see a return to the Iran nuclear talks, but if we see positive moves as perceived by both sides, perhaps Tehran would send those Americans home, and that would be one win for the Biden administration.",

Now, how that might be seized on by Republicans is that the U.S. eased up for far too little, and what's going to stop Tehran from just seizing another American citizen somewhere in the country to hold them hostage for another economic win?",

And a Chinese plane buzzed a U.S. spy plane. These are the kind of things that if they go wrong and result in an actual bump or a plane knocked out of the sky, that can escalate quickly.

But I think what's so important here is these are very intimate and very, very personal journeys. And in, kind of, talking about approaching this story, I think one of the things, having covered it late last year, Oregon legalizing psilocybin was, all right, how do you articulate this? This was the big struggle we've been talking to folks who had had their own trips and trying to figuring out how to then tell that story. I figured, maybe I could go forward with that, do it my own, you know, go through my own journey. What ended up being really convincing here was the folks who I was going on with this retreat was said, we'd feel more comfortable if you were going to do it as well. So, that was, kind of, I think the final push for me to say, OK. Let's go forward with this. And then I figured that that would be the extent of it. I didn't really guess that there would be such an inner journey and path of healing for me. But, yes, it was a moment of, kind of, discovery and something that really surprised me. I mean, I'm somebody who, I really, I didn't drink before it was legal. Like, some -- the university judicial council. I just followed rules.
