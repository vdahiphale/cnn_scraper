We'll show you the incredible rescue. And you're live in the CNN NEWSROOM. Hello, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me this Sunday. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. Former president Donald Trump's lawyer speaking out this morning, doubling down on his argument that Trump was within his First Amendment rights when he asked former vice president Mike Pence to overturn the election results and that it all boils down to the way he asked. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN LAURO, DONALD TRUMP'S DEFENSE ATTORNEY: And all of this played out in the open. It's all free speech. There was a Supreme Court decision Hammerschmidt (ph), which is right on point, that says when you're exercising free speech, you're not engaging in a fraud on the government. And that's what unfortunately most people don't understand in this context. It's very political. (CROSSTALK)",

And Jennifer Rodgers, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. Great to see both of you. All right. Harry, you first. John Lauro says asking is not action. What is your response to that argument? HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: It's deeply muddled. First of all, there's quite an irony in saying he was just saying pretty please to Pence. He did everything but hold a gun to his head. But really, this speech conduct distinction doesn't matter. What Trump is charged with is agreeing to do something unlawful. That's what a conspiracy is. You do it, as Dana was pointing out, with words. If you or I say, hey let's go rob a bank. Five little words there, and we take any action in support of it, we have broken the law. So it's not when he's badgering Pence exactly. -- that's an act in furtherance of the conspiracy. The conspiracy is agreeing with the co- conspirators to try to delay or impede the 1/6 certification hearing, which is plainly against the law under USC-1512, et cetera.

This was criminal. He wasn't just asking, he was conspiring. And all these things the special counsel very carefully set out in the indictment, very compellingly set out in the indictment.

They're going to argue he was acting on advice of counsel. They're going to ask for a change of venue and to disqualify the judge. They're going to say he didn't have guilty intents. He really believed that the election was rigged. Those are the main arguments it looks like they'll trot out. And they know many of them or maybe all of them are losers. They're also thinking about which ones eat up a lot of time, say as in Mar-a-Lago, where the classified documents litigation will at least stretch out time. I have tried to carefully look at them. We're doing a whole podcast on that for tomorrow.

They might go more for suggestions that she's a Democrat, that she's appointed by a Democrat, supported Democrats in the past with donations and such.

I mean I don't think the focus will be squarely on recordings of what happened on January 6th. The special counsel chose not to charge a seditious conspiracy or incitement of an insurrection, probably to avoid some of the First Amendment concerns that would have cropped up with those charges. So I don't think the focus will be that. It will be more on the scheming that happened between the election and January 6th in terms of how to stop the election from being certified.

You had a team in transition where Megan Rapinoe was maybe a step slower than she needed to be; Alex Morgan, the same.

A man missing since Thursday off the coast of Florida is pulled safety by the U.S. Coast Guard. Seen here drifting in a little 12 foot boat which was starting to take on water. He was spotted by helicopter is about 12 miles offshore. CNN's Camila Bernal is joining us with more on this. Boy, he's lucky but how did it unfold? CAMILA BERNAL, CNN CORRESPONDENT: He is lucky. It's a fascinating story here, Fred, because this is a 25-year-old who is on a 12-foot johnboat. I mean, it is just incredible. And I actually just spoke to the owner of the shop where he works. And the owner of the shop is saying, first of all, he's okay and extremely thankful to be alive, thankful to have been rescued. The shop's owner said he talked to him and even asked him, you know, what kept you going. He said that -- Charles Gregory said he was thinking about my parents that kept him going. So, the shop owner says, you know, he was supposed to show up to work and he didn't. He started calling him, texting him, he was telling me it's unusual for him not to text back or answer or show up to work. He says I know now that phone was at the bottom of the ocean. He went out and what happened here is he didn't come back. And so, the Coast Guard began searching after his parents essentially reported him missing to the Coast Guard. There were boats. There were airplanes. There were helicopters looking for him. And then, finally, on Saturday morning, that's when they were able to spot ham. You're seeing the video there. There was a crew on a boat that actually came and got him safely on board. They took him to EMS. They assessed him. They said there isn't any medical concerns. But he is sunburn, if you look at the photo of him after he was rescued, he's pretty red. He was giving the hang loose sign there. Those are all the pictures that we've seen of him. That's the sign that he's been putting out. It's incredible to know that he was there hanging on to this boat, hanging on to his life really for hours, and hours, as he was waiting to be rescued. So, it really is an incredible story. We've reached out to the family, waiting to hear from the dad. It's really the dad who's been taking care of them. The shop owner saying he's been standing next to him and just thanking people for their prayers and, of course, the coast guard for the work that they did to find him, Fred.",

This is something that native tribes have been lobbying for four years. And it would prevent a new mining in the area. So the president really trying to bolster his climate agenda ahead of the 2024 election. Of course, this is an issue that is critical for key members of the president's political coalition. Liberal Democrats, young voters, they haven't always been satisfied with the presidents record in this area when it comes to drilling, when it comes to mining. And so, the president really working to boost enthusiasm among those groups as he heads into the election. Now, this is part of a broader effort, administration-wide effort to sell the president's economic agenda in the month of August, and they do believe they have a good story to tell, inflation is slowing, consumer sentiment is ticking up, hiring remains strong. But as you mentioned, there is this disconnect in the poll last week. Seventy- five percent of Americans said that economic conditions were poor. So, it will be the president's objective to sort of close the gap, his singular challenged in this election year, Fredricka.",
