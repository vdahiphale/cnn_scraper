While Russian President Vladimir Putin said there can be no justification for what he described as a monstrous crime in a message to Slovakia's president. He also called Fico courageous and strong willed men. Now, the Slovakian Prime Minister has subscribed to the Kremlin's narrative about the war in Ukraine, blaming Kyiv for provoking the conflict.

And these are high risk environments. And that division and the polarization that has very much been a characteristic and most notably of European politics, certainly over the last 10 years have unfortunately, here played out in the way that we, that we witnessed during the unfolding of this today. Kim. BRUNHUBER: Yes, I want to ask you about that polarization a little later. But just right now, to the motive.

It has so the politics of Ukraine, one of the neighbors there, Poland, and in addition to Austria, of course, Hungary, and his friend and ally and Viktor Orban.So E.U. politics around immigration, around the question of Russian sanctions support, yes or no, for the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. And then beyond that, the kind of rebranded Fico as somebody who's very much played out in the public space on sort of culture wars, LGBTQ rights. But I think more importantly, since election, it has been the various ways in which feed so has gone about very much like his neighbor, Orban, undermining the media, weakening the judiciary, and so on. And these are proving increasingly polarizing issues and questions, particularly when one considers that the election itself did not turn his party to power. He simply emerged in the parliamentary system as the leader and have an opportunity to create this coalition government.

He's in party with a breakaway group from his party, and also with the Slovakia National Party, which is a far right leaning organization. So he has that. But the bigger question, or the most important answer here is, it's a parliamentary system. Fico himself was not elected. His party came out ahead in the election. And as the leader of that party, he had the opportunity to create a government. So, we're here to be replaced in the long term, it would essentially be up to his party to go about identifying a new leader but in the short term, his party and his cabinet are able to run the show. And there's also let's not forget it and elected president and the incoming president who will be in office June 15, is a former member of his party and a member of the breakaway party.

Lee has more from the White House. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) M.J. LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump agreeing on Wednesday to participate in two presidential debates. The first one hosted by CNN will take place on June 27. And the second one by ABC News will be on September 10th. Both campaigns, basically agreed to shun the presidential debate calendar that had been set forth by the Commission on Presidential Debates the idea they said of the first debate taking place not until mid-September they basically said was too late. That at that point some voters had already started participating in early voting and they were eager to reach voters a lot earlier in the election cycle. And in fact, we are told there was an informal back-channel contact between the two campaigns and that they agreed on their shared disdain for the CPD. Now, what is going to be unusual about the CNN debate in June is that there is not going to be a live audience in that studio in Atlanta. And one of the things that the Biden campaign had said was that the way that these debates were created in the past, with large audiences ended up making spectacles of the debate and that they were frankly a distraction. Now, one person we are learning that is going to be participating in some of these debate prep sessions for the Biden campaign is Ron Klain. He is, of course, the presidents former chief of staff and a trusted advisor. He tells me that he is going to be taking some vacation time to participate in these prep sessions. We don't know who is going to be playing the role of Donald Trump, that role in the past back in 2020 was played by Bob Bauer, the president's personal lawyer. Now, the Biden campaign clearly wanted to use the debate over the debates to go on the offensive, proposing this idea first and sort of asking the Trump campaign to accept and respond to their proposal. And we also have seen the Biden campaign trying to needle Donald Trump as well throughout the course of the day. President Biden saying earlier in the day, I hear you're free on Wednesdays, that of course, is a clear reference to the fact that former President Trump has been stuck for many weeks inside of a New York City courtroom.

He is the only prosecution witness who has tied to Trump the $130,000 payment to Daniels. And he allegedly falsified documents that describe the repayment to Cohen as a retainer.
