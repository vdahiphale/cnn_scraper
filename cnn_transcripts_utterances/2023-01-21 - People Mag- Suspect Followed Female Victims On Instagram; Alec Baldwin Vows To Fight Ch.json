Just a day after involuntary manslaughter charges were announced against actor Alec Baldwin and armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, we're now learning the film Rust is still in production. An attorney for the movie tells CNN the film will include on set safety supervisors and union crew members and will bar any use of working weapons or any ammunition.Baldwin did not speak to reporters about the charges against him when he was seen walking into his Manhattan home on Friday. His attorney said the actor was blindsided by the charges. CNN' Gloria Pazmino is with us now. Gloria, what happens now? GLORIA PAZMINO, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, for not only have we learned that production on the film continues, but sources telling us that Alec Baldwin is also going to continue as the lead in that film. You showed the photos of Alec Baldwin arriving at his Manhattan home yesterday, he declined to speak with the media who had been gathering there for several days trying to hear from Alec Baldwin directly days after these charges were announced. Now, the couple of weeks and months ahead will be long illegally speaking of both Alec Baldwin and the armorer that was on set will have to have a preliminary hearing which will determine if there was a probable cause to even go -- to go ahead with trial. But I want to just give you an idea of Alec Baldwin's mindset going into all of this. We did hear from him several months ago. My colleague Chloe Melas spoke with Baldwin back in August. And here's how he reacted to that incident. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, Baldwin and his attorneys seem to think that that was not the case and they do plan on fighting those charges. So, the next couple of weeks and months will be interesting in terms of seeing how this develops from the legal angle of all of this.But so far, Alec Baldwin and not speaking to reporters and we are waiting to hear how else this develops in the next couple of days.",

Three active-duty U.S. Marines who work in intelligence have been arrested for taking part in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. One of them was allegedly pushing for a second Civil War. CNN's Jeremy Herb joining us now. Jeremy, what are authorities saying about this?JEREMY HERB, CNN POLITICS REPORTER (on camera): Yes, Fred. These three Marines, Corporal Micah Coomer and Sergeants Joshua Abate and Dodge Dale Hanesan -- excuse me, Hellonen. They're facing a number of charges including in -- disorderly conduct in a Capitol building. Now, according to the court filings, this trio went into the Capitol on January 6 for about an hour that went to the Capitol Rotunda according to these filings. They placed a red MAGA hat on one of the statues that's in the rotunda, and then they took a photo with it. Now one of the interesting things that we've learned in this indictment is just how authorities discovered this trio. One of the Marines, Coomer, he sent messages on his Instagram page in addition to posting photos on his Instagram page. These messages he sent after January 6 to an associate saying, \"Everything in this country is corrupt. We honestly need a fresh restart. I'm waiting for the Boogaloo.\" What's a Boogaloo? The associate asked in response. Civil War 2, Coomer replied. And now that is a reference to a rallying cry that's used among some far-right groups. In the photos that he posted, he also included a caption, glad to be a part of history. One of the other Marines, Joshua Abate, according to court documents, he admitted while he was getting an interview for a security clearance that he had gone into the Capitol on January 6 with a number of his friends. He said during this interview, according to the documents that the riot was being portrayed negatively. And so, as a result, he didn't tell anyone about his involvement. We should note here that none of these Marines so far have entered a plea when it comes to their conduct. But the fact that this arrest happened this week, that is a sign that authorities are continuing to look for those who went into the Capitol on January 6, two years ago. Marine -- the Marine Corps they said in a statement that they are aware of this investigation, and they are cooperating with authorities, Fred.",

Russian -- Russia has already claimed victory in the area. But the fighting continues. Where are things stand?BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Yes. The Russians have claimed that they've taken Soledar, which is just north of Bakhmut. And we've been to that area and certainly it does appear they're in control of most, if not all of that town of 10,000 people before the war now. It seems that the last 24 hours have been very difficult in the region of Zaporizhzhia to the south of here where regional officials say there were 21 individual Russian strikes resulting in the death of one woman and in their words, the destruction of dozens of buildings. Now, just south of here in the town of Kostiantynivka overnight, there were at least a dozen missile strikes on that town. And just yesterday here in Kramatorsk, one person was killed when -- there are three missiles hit the city, one right in front of a kindergarten. Fortunately, the kindergarten was not operational at the time because of course the war classes have not been held in months. Now as far as the situation in Bakhmut goes, we were there yesterday we saw that the Ukrainians are continuing to pound Russian positions but the Russians are responding in kind. And what we noticed is that the Russian shelling is getting deeper and deeper inside the city. What we saw is there are fewer and fewer people are left in that one large city. Now the Ukrainian defense ministry is now saying that they do expect the Russians to launch a massive offensive. At some time, they say perhaps as late as the end of this month, perhaps February, perhaps into March. The expectation is that after that mobilization that began last September, that the Russians have been mustering their forces perhaps to launch a massive spring offensive. Fredricka? [13:15:03] WHITFIELD: All right. Ben Wedeman, thank you so much. So, Ukraine is not only fighting Russia on the battlefield but at the altar. Since the Russian invasion last February, there has been turmoil in the Orthodox Church. Prewar, Ukraine's Orthodox Church was split into two. One independent branch loyal to Kyiv and the other loyal to Moscow and its controversial Patriarch Kirill who has been an enthusiastic supporter of Russia's invasion. Shortly after the war began, the Moscow supporting part of the church, publicly cut ties with its northern neighbor. But Ukrainian authorities believe some of its priests and some of its worshipers remain loyal to Russia. Scott McLean reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SCOTT MCLEAN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Just outside Kyiv is the Church of the Nativity. It's been here since the Soviet days. But now it has a new priest, Father Pavlo Mityaev and has a new denomination. MCLEAN (on camera): Oh, wow. Beautiful. MCLEAN (voice over): The Orthodox Church of Ukraine.

Chats answered increased by 263 percent. And texts answered increased by 1,045 percent. And those increases appear to reflect how more people know about the 988 number. It's easy to remember, only three digits. And it seems like more people are seeking help for mental health crises. That's according to 988's Deputy Director Dr. John Palmieri. Have a listen. DR. JOHN PALMIERI, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, 988 CRISIS HOTLINE: We know that there are many individuals in this country who are struggling with suicidal concerns, with mental health or substance use concerns, who aren't able to access the care that they need. And so this is truly an opportunity with 988 as a catalytic moment to be able to transform the crisis care system to better meet those needs.",
