      "sentences": "This is just into CNN. The Kremlin spokesperson says President Vladimir Putin will be speaking soon, saying he will, quote, \"make a number of important statements\" this evening.Keep in mind, it's 9:30 p.m. in Moscow. This should be very soon. It's already getting late there as he has these important statements as they're describing them. Moments ago, here in the U.S., the White House reiterating that there was no U.S. or Western involvement whatsoever in the rebellion by the Wagner Group in Russia. In the meantime, the State Department saying the U.S. does not know the location of the group's leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin. I want to bring in senior fellow at The Atlantic Council, Michael Bociurkiw. I want to talk to you a little bit about where we are, where this moment is. The State Department spokesman, Matthew Miller, just said this is the most dangerous situation that has happened since the beginning of the war. You are waiting, as we all are, to see what Putin is going to be saying tonight. I wonder, considering this isn't a position of strength that he is in, what he is trying to do here to manage this narrative as you see it?",

      "sentences": "Good to be with you, again, Brianna.Well, look, I happen to not subscribe to the consensus view that this was a genuine coup. In fact, if you asked me to put a bumper sticker on this, I would say Russian coup, question mark. The reason I say that is because I think this might have actually been a very well-scripted attempt by Mr. Putin to do what he always does, play different factions against each other, to test people's loyalty, to do a bit of house cleaning at the top. Also, it might have been an opportunity as well for him to signal to the West that, look, there are worse autocrats or conmen than myself in the form of Mr. Prigozhin. He has quite the rap sheet against him. So it remains to be seen. But look, I was raised in the house of a renowned Soviet politician. From a very early age, I was taught to question everything you see spoken by the Kremlin or whatever they project.",

Also, Mr. Prigozhin runs, compared to some Western European armies, like Belgium or the Netherlands, a real significant force. It's a conglomerate that raises a lot of money for the Putin war machine. And let's not forget the American authorities have blamed Mr. Prigozhin for influencing U.S. elections, meddling, and also spreading false news. So I can't really believe that Mr. Putin would get rid of Mr. Prigozhin that quickly. He needs him very badly. We may even see him rehabilitated in some way.",

Nor will he be going into exile in the jungles of Africa where Wagner has operations.[14:35:01] So I think he'll re-emerge in one way or another. Given the way -- Brianna, the way how hopelessly the Russian military has performed, I think this rehabilitation might take place. We're also getting reports, don't forget, that Wagner is beginning recruiting again of fighters. It's just really, really difficult to fathom that he would disappear off the face of the earth. Having said that, stranger things have happened to opponents or people who are suspected of opposing Mr. Putin, falling out of hotel windows, drinking poisoned cocktails, like that sort of stuff.",

Putin and Kremlin can't have that source of income cut off right now. The other thing I'd say is that, you know, the difference between Mr. Prigozhin and some of the senior Russian military leaders is that Prigozhin has been seen at the frontline. He's got very strong loyalty among his men. So this is a fighting force that, if it were immediately disappeared from the frontline, it would really affect Russia's chances, I think, of getting further into Ukraine.",

Belarusian state media just announced that Lukashenko will, quote, \"answer all,\" apparently referring to questions around that brokered deal. We'll see if he delivers.

The information about Wagner's camps in Belarus has not been confirmed either. The result of the information right now, but the goal is to mislead and oppress the real authorities and people to resist. But nevertheless, I don't know what Prigozhin intends to do in Belarus, but he's definitely not welcome in our country. He's a war criminal and he can bring the war to Belarus. We don't want that. We heard from Prigozhin today that Lukashenko promised him to legalize the Wagner crew. What that means in practice, we don't know. There are rumors that Wagner wants to open up in our territory. If that happened, there could be threats. Just imagine thousands of foreign troops in our territory. Prigozhin might be involved in military training or whatever.",
