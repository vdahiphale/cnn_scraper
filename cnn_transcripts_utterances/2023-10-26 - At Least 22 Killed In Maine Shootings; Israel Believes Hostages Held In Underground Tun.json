They did release that still frame from CCTV footage inside one of those locations where he allegedly opened fire, that was inside that bowling alley, this photo, you could see him there with a assault style rifle. You see what's called a -- the magazine, which is a contraption in the weapon that holds the ammunition, that's a large capacity magazine, meaning that this individual potentially had a lot of ammunition with him.We've also seen time and again in these instances, Laura, where suspects will bring additional rounds of ammunition. We know with that number of victims, at least 22 people who were killed, numerous others were injured. This is someone who appeared to had been intent on causing mass loss of life. At this hour, we certainly don't know the motive. Why he allegedly targeted these two particular areas. But as you mentioned, this manhunt now underway. CNN is learning there are multiple agencies that are now involved. The local police as well as the Maine police, state police and the federal government now involved as well. The FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The ATF brings incredible resources to bear in order to try to identify a suspect based on the weapon itself. And so, as that investigation continued, we now have that identification. Finally, I'll point out that, again, at this hour, we don't yet know the motive, but sources are telling our colleague John Miller that this suspect who was a firearms instructor in the U.S. military, in the U. S. Army Reserve, had at some point reported mental health issues, allegedly indicating that he was hearing voices. He was apparently committed to some type of institution for assessment. And so, a lot of questions at this hour about what happened after that period of assessment. Were there people in his orbit who may have, you know, seeing additional lingering issues? He had allegedly made threats against a National Guard facility. And so, still a lot of questions about the motive. But that brings us to where we are at this point in time, this massive manhunt with authorities fanning out across the New England area looking for the suspect. Of course, we've seen, Laura, you and I have covered so many of these incidents. They typically will end in three possible ways, and that is the suspect decides to take his own life, the suspect is engaged by law enforcement and is taken into custody or killed or the suspect, you know, is eventually -- you know, this manhunt continues. And so, we're still waiting to obviously hear -- you know, see what happens here. Obviously, this is an area that has been in a state of lockdown and a state of fear. Authorities have asked residents around the area to shelter in place as this manhunt continues, Laura.",

Her own daughter, a Girl Scout in the car with her trying to make sense of what she's seeing.I'm really interested, in particular, on the comment you made about the ATF's involvement. We're looking at those still frames, different points in time. You identified the clothing, those cargo pants, as one way that people will store additional ammunition. People have been focusing on the gun itself that's being used.

It could be nationally or internationally considering how close to Canada this location is. It's going to be local, state, federal resources, all working together in coordinating, communicating, and collaborating to figure out, number one, we -- you know, we kind of know who this person is, but where has he been? What has he done? What has he learned? I am very concerned. I've heard the previous commentators over the last couple of hours, talk about his offensive ability to create harm and damage and death now, but that training would also lead him to anticipate the police approach, the tactics that police would use to try to track him and apprehend him, which would lend him to probably have some measure of ability in defensive maneuvers. And how to evade police and his evasive maneuvers. And now, that it is dark that further exacerbate this problem. And so, I think everything is on the table, especially a digital profile over on social media, looking at what he may have logged into who he may have communicated with. How far back does that communication go? And who would have inspired him to do this, if anybody else may be included in his planning of this? Because it took some planning.",

He had enough ammunition to commit the high number of fatalities and the high number of injuries that some may even lead to more fatalities. I would think he has enough ammunition to do that again, and we should anticipate that. So, the police approach is very important. This should be very systematic. It should be very, and it will be very carefully planned and coordinated by local, state and federal agencies going far beyond this one city, and maybe even the State of Maine, but this could last for days on end. We hope it doesn't, but we should be prepared for this to last on days on end because we know that this person likely has the skill set to survive and to sustain himself through a protracted event that could last beyond one new cycle or one police tour of duty.",

One at a restaurant and another at a bowling alley. There's a massive manhunt underway right now for a person of interest, who is named Robert Card.Andrew McCabe is back with me now. Andy, you know when you look at what's happening right now, and this is in Maine. So, one of the first questions people will ask is whether a person was known to authorities. We have learned from John Miller this person was a military reservist. But the gun laws and the type of weapon that is being used here. That's the second question. What are the gun laws in Maine? Was the weapon that you're seeing in any of these still photos able to be lawfully used in that state? Obviously, not for criminal purposes, though. ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: That's right. But it's entirely likely that the weapon that you see in these photos is -- can be lawfully owned in the state of Maine. The weapon is likely an AR-15 or a similar variant, a high-powered assault-style weapon. Maine does not have a -- any additional background check requirements beyond those federal requirements that are imposed upon federally licensed firearms dealers. Maine also does not have a -- what we refer to, as a Red Flag Law or where some states call it an extreme risk law. Those laws enable family members or sometimes law enforcement to take firearms away from people who seem to be at extreme risk of hurting themselves or others. For instance, if this person of interest was actually recently in a psychiatric facility undergoing evaluation, that's the sort of situation that could give rise to someone working under a Red Flag Law to remove that person's guns for some period of time. Maine does not have those laws, so that couldn't happen here. And we also know that Maine does not have a concealed carry permit requirement, which basically means if you have lawfully purchased a firearm, a handgun or a long gun -- it's harder to conceal a long gun, but if you have a handgun, you can carry that handgun without a special permit to do so. So, it's a -- it's a pretty easy state that seems to purchase and use firearms. Now, we know Maine also has a long history of shooting sports and hunting and outdoor -- there's a very strong outdoor culture in Maine. So, guns are fairly prevalent. I think some of the witnesses -- a few of the witnesses that we've identified on this air this evening, some of them mentioned that as soon as they heard the shelter-in-place rule, they grabbed their handguns --",
