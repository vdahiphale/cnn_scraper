For the first time, the public can see for themselves some of the text messages at the center of the House investigation into Matt Gaetz, what he allegedly said to the women that the committee says he regularly paid for sex and drugs. The new legal questions now being raised.And more millions pouring into President-Elect Donald Trump's inauguration. The latest top dollar owner being revealed today. And the big question, why are so many major companies eager to donate to this? But first, a major breaking news. American Airlines grounded all flights over a technical issue, and moments ago, it appears the FAA is lifting that order. John Berman is out today. I'm Kate Bolduan with Sara Sidner. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. We're now just learning it appears that the FAA is canceling the ground stop that brought American Airlines to a halt this morning. Just last hour, the airline announced they had grounded all flights in the U.S. during this very busy holiday travel day due to what they called a technical issue, with unspecified detail. The U.S. airline saying in a statement this, \"A technical issue was affecting American flights this morning. Our teams are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible, and we apologize to our customers for the inconvenience.\" Let's get over to CNN's Derek Van Dam. A lot happening as I was just even walking back into the studio. What is the very latest with this ground stop, or not?",

      "sentences": "Right, exactly. And there's so many avenues to this story coming on the crux of the busiest day of the travel season this week, right. Everybody heading to family, relatives, to see their loved ones during the Christmas holiday rush. And now we've got this ground stop which has now just been lifted, according to the FAA.But we are still monitoring whether that could compound the issues here across the eastern seaboard. Remember, we've got Reagan National Airport, we've got JFK, LaGuardia. These are all major hubs from American Airlines, which just last hour had our ground stop from the FAA because of this technical glitch. And now we have to play catch up with, of course, the thousands of travelers that are commuting in and out of those airports. So what you're looking at now behind me is the current look of the FlightAware website, where we're tracking all U.S. bound airline traffic, and you can see just how busy it is in and around the major hubs here across the east coast. But what you're also noticing here is also the weather that is moving through these hubs as we speak. So we've got about 120 million Americans traveling this week. Look at how many people are traveling by air, nearly 8 million people, roughly 6.5 percent of that total. So this is going to impact a lot of people. Add to that the combination of the rough weather, and this could cause some serious headaches along the airspaces here along the east coast. So here's the cold front moving through, already bringing snow to LaGuardia and into JFK as we speak, stretching further south. It's warm enough where near Washington's Reagan National Airport they actually have a mixture of rain and snow that could lead to some localized freezing on the roadways. So the potential for a glazing of ice is possible here. So that will, of course, compound the travel headaches that people are already dealing with at the airports, but also on the roadways, I-95 in particular. Kate?",

Sara? SIDNER: It is true. Even when there's just a little bit of a delay, it does have a ripple effect. We will see what happens this morning. Let's hope everyone gets to where they're going. All right, this morning, text messages reveal what the House Ethics Committee says is substantial evidence that Matt Gaetz paid women for sex and drugs while he was in office. The committee's report found Gaetz spent tens of thousands of dollars on sex and drugs for at least three years. In some of the texts CNN reviewed, Gaetz allegedly asked women to get him drugs, and one woman complains about not being paid. Gaetz has denied the allegations. He says he may have partied and womanized, but said it was nothing criminal. CNN's Marshall Cohen is joining us now. Marshall, just give us some details of what exactly you've been seeing in these text messages revealed by the Ethics Committee.",

      "sentences": "Hey, Sara. There's a lot in there. It is a and disturbing report on the former congressman, Matt Gaetz. So the Republican run House Ethics Committee said that there was substantial evidence that Gaetz paid tens of thousands of dollars to women for sex and drugs, all while he was serving in Congress. Most importantly, the panel also found that Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old high schooler in summer 2017. The report concluded that this violated Florida's statutory rape laws.Now, over the past few years, as Gaetz has faced all this legal scrutiny, he has vehemently denied that he ever paid anyone for sex. He also denies any illegal drug use. And in a social media post after the report came out, he said, quote, \"There's a reason they did this to me in a Christmas Eve eve report, and not in a courtroom of any kind where I could present evidence and challenge witnesses.\" But look, there was a lot of evidence. The committee examined 14,000 pages of documents. The committee interviewed many of the key witnesses. The report even includes texts, like you mentioned, of Gaetz allegedly asking women for drugs and haggling over payments. There are texts from one of those women telling a friend, quote, \"Matt never paid me. How much did he pay you?\" The friend said she got $400 and offered some advice. Ask him for the money, quote, \"before you have sex.\" There's even a detailed ledger of payments between Gaetz and multiple women using Cash App and Venmo. Some of those women later testified that those payments were indeed for sex or drugs. And of course, I should point out that the Justice Department looked into many of these allegations, but never filed any criminal charges against Matt Gaetz. Sara?",

Joining us right now with new reporting on this is national political reporter and author of \"The Bulwark\" MAGAville newsletter, Marc Caputo. It's good to see you, Marc. Thanks for coming in.And you have new reporting, kind of digging into with your sources into this question of, OK, you have this now. What does this mean for Matt Gaetz, the man who has always successfully sought the spotlight for so many years? In part, you write, \"In a normal time and state, Matt Gaetz's political future would be over after Monday's release. But these are not normal times. It's the Trump era, and this is not a normal state,\" meaning Florida. \"It's Florida, the heart of MAGAville.\" What does that now mean? What are you learning? MARC CAPUTO, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE BULWARK\": Well, for the time being, Gaetz is flirting, at least publicly, with running for office again statewide for either governor or Senate in 2026. A lot of people still think that's a very difficult bridge for him to cross. But what's telling here is that everyone is saying, look, we don't know. The public, the voting public, voters' tolerance for scandal is different now than it used to be. One of the people I spoke to for the story, a top pollster for Ron DeSantis, who also was a top adviser to Elon Musk's super PAC that helped Donald Trump win in the November elections, said the news media and a lot of critics do a lot of pearl clutching. But voters don't approach politics as sacredly as the press does. And they view politicians as all sort of flawed, and they might actually give Gaetz -- I know this is going to be tough for some people to believe -- a measure of credit if he owns up to it, says it's in his past, and he's moving on. Now, even that person I spoke to says, look, I don't know what's going to happen to Gaetz's future. But again, the fact is, we don't know. And in the past, we kind of did, and we're definitely in a new era, a new world of politics where these sorts of things don't stick to a lot of candidates. Obviously, they didn't stick to Donald Trump as much, but one thing about Donald Trump's Teflon is so far it hasn't been transferable. If Matt Gaetz decides to run again for office in 2026 and if he wins, it's going to show that we are indeed in a new time and place.",

So if Matt Gaetz runs, and if Donald Trump decides to endorse him, those are two big ifs, I would definitely not count out Matt Gaetz winning his office. Right now in our states dynamics, the Republican who wins the primary is an odds on favorite to win statewide, win a general election.One thing that should be noted is that when Matt Gaetz withdrew his nomination as attorney general, from what I'm told, the sources I've spoken to who spoke to Donald Trump and were briefed on this, he didn't get a commitment from Donald Trump to get an endorsement if he decides to run again. So it's still up in the air of, A, whether Matt Gaetz runs, and then B, whether Donald Trump endorses. We've got a few months, a few years to figure that out.",

I mean, keep in mind that some of these folks have been at odds with Donald Trump or Donald Trump has been very angry with them. If you consider Meta, the parent company of Facebook, he's been highly critical. He views social media companies as having a bias towards conservatives. So you see people talking to him in person as they're announcing these donations. So, that's one of the things that's very different. Also, keep in mind that Donald Trump's first inauguration, I mean, you mentioned how much Joe Biden raised. Donald Trump set a record with his first inauguration, it was nearly $107 million.

But I do think this is important because it is signaling a change in government approach. Judging from the social media reactions, some look at this and say it's commendable that Carr is trying to pressure media companies to be responsible to regain trust and most importantly, to invest in local media. But Carr is really signaling, among other things, is that he's going to be a friend to local and an antagonist to national media, and a friend of local. Well, local media needs some friends, needs some investment. So there's that reaction. But the other reaction I'm seeing to this letter is from people saying, look, Carr is using his bully pulpit on Trump's behalf. We know that Trump has threatened local TV stations and national owners. He's called for ABC to lose its license over that presidential debate in September. So, it's going to be notable to watch and see how appointees like in this case, Carr at the FCC, how they manage what Trump might want from them and what's actually in their legal abilities in order to take action at these agencies.",
