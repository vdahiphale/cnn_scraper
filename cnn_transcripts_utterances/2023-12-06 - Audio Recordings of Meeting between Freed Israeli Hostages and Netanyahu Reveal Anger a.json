These are new pictures of Vladimir Putin's arrival just hours ago complete with a fly-past and a camel cavalry. We understand he's discussing oil and the Israel Hamas conflict with his Emirati counterparts. First up, though tonight, the scene on the ground in Gaza, these are live pictures from the Israeli border. But the IDF is moving its fight further south, where civilians have already fled. Also this hour the G7 holds a virtual meeting as aid for Ukraine hangs in the balance. CNN has a rare look inside one war ravaged town at what could be an inflection point for this conflict. Well, the destruction and death toll is increasing in Gaza in some of the most intense fighting so far in this nearly two month old war. Israel's military says it hits some 250 Hamas targets over the past day as ground troops focus attention on Southern Gaza. They're now operating in the heart of Khan Yunis, Gaza's second largest city. The IDF says it's moving into civilian areas that Hamas is using to hide militants and weapons. It released this video that it says shows hundreds of missiles, grenades and drones stockpiled near a clinic and a school in Northern Gaza. Well, the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah taking information from hospitals in Gaza says that the death toll in Gaza now tops 16,000 with most of those killed women and children. Well, Israel's Prime Minister is rejecting the idea of an international security forcing Gaza once this war ends. Alex Marquardt connecting us this hour from an army base in Southern Israel. Alex from that perspective, what can you tell us about the intensity of the Israeli offensive?",

      "sentences": "Well Becky, in just the past few moments, we've heard the sounds of explosions up in the sky justover my shoulder here that look like Israeli air intercepts. We didn't see any rockets going up. But that doesn't mean that that didn't happen. We've heard the low rumble of explosions coming from the direction of Gaza. We've seen helicopters and jets circling all around either over Gazan airspace or around the perimeter in Israeli airspace. But it really does speak to what we have heard from the IDF, which just yesterday said that they have seen their most intense day of operations yet since the ground incursion started; both in terms of the number of firefights, and also the number of Hamas militants who they say they have killed. Israel's top commanding general saying that they have entered what he called the third phase of this conflict, essentially solidifying the gains that they made in the north as they push towards the south, specifically towards the city of Khan Yunis, which Israel's military says that they are operating in the heart of and that they are trying to encircle. And that really is becoming a focal point for the Israeli military because of the Hamas presence that they believe to be there, the Hamas infrastructure and the leadership they believe to be in and around that city, which is the biggest city in the south. So as Israel focuses their attention on that city, there are major humanitarian questions, Becky as well, because so many people fled to that city from the north after Israel told them to evacuate, now they're being told to go even farther south. A lot of Palestinians in Gaza as well as humanitarian officials say that for the 1.9 million people who have been displaced the vast majority of the population that there really is nowhere safe in Gaza and there isn't nearly enough aid coming into Gaza, Becky.",

It's been fairly rare for Mr. Putin to travel outside of Russia since his invasion of Ukraine almost two years ago. But he received a warm welcome here a short time ago with the UAE military jet flyover past his limousine route and a full military salute. For more on this let's bring in CNN's Frederik Pleitgen in Berlin. Look, it is not unusual this week or this past week to see foreign dignitaries and leaders of countries coming into the UAE. Of course it is hosting the COP28 meeting in Dubai at present. So what more though, do we know about Mr. Putin's visit to the UAE and the wider region? And what is he trying to achieve?",

And I think some of the images that we've seen, especially with that flyover with that salute, but also with the Escort that Vladimir Putin got, I think it is showing how important this visit is also to the UAE. And the message that the UAE and Saudi Arabia are trying to send to the United States and also to the rest of the world, saying that, look, they are America's allies. They're very important allies for the United States in the Middle East. But they also want to continue working and having pragmatic relations with the Russian Federation and with Vladimir Putin. I did see some of the opening remarks in that meeting with the UAE President where he, the UAE President himself said that the UAE is Russia's most important trading partner in the Middle East. Vladimir Putin, as you've noted, himself, then saying that the relations between the UAE and Russia are at an all-time high. Now, of course, all this comes as the United States and its European allies have been trying to isolate Russia on an international stage. And that's certainly something with a message that I think we're seeing from Vladimir Putin today, which is one that the Russians have been sending for quite some time now, is that Russia will not be isolated internationally, Russia is too big to be isolated internationally. And Russia is certainly too important in player -- especially in the hydrocarbon sector to be isolated in the Middle East, so definitely a very important meeting. And I think some of the things that they are going to be talking about, because of course, there is also a very important official agenda as well. They are also quite telling one of the things of course, the Israel Hamas war where Vladimir Putin has sort of been trying to style himself as on the one hand being on the side of the Palestinians, of course, repeatedly calling for a Palestinian state, but still also wanting to be a mediator. Of course, he is a very important player in Israel also with such a large chunk of the Israeli population having Russian roots. So certainly Vladimir Putin is trying to --himself that way, trying to inject himself into politics in the Middle East and at the same time, of course, and remaining an extremely important economic player as well, Becky.",

The Israeli Defense Forces say they have carried out about 250 airstrikes on Hamas targets in just the past day. The IDF say they are in the heart of the second largest city Khan Yunis. Seen now on your screen is in the south of the Enclave. But don't forget Palestinians in the North have repeatedly been told to move south since the start of this war. Multiple NGOs now say that no matter where civilians go nowhere in Gaza is safe. Meantime, the UN Agency for Palestinian refugees warns that Gaza is now one of the most dangerous places in the world. U.S. President Joe Biden is now walking back and notably candid remark about why he is seeking re- election in 2024. He told democratic donors at an off camera fundraiser on Tuesday \"If Trump wasn't running, I'm not sure that I'd be running\", a comment that caught even his own advisers off guard. Biden's campaign though was quick to shrug off the quip is nothing to see here moment. Well, CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is covering the story for us from the White House.

But he said, \"Folks, this is a big deal this election, we've got to get it done, not because of me. And I mean that. If Trump wasn't running, I'm not sure I'd be running. But we cannot let him win for the sake of the country\". So this is the starkest rationale for the President's re-election decision making. Of course, he's come under fierce criticism from some people on his own party for deciding to run given his age. But what he's making clear here, what we've heard repeatedly from his campaign is that this isn't just about the man on the ticket, but it's also about two very different visions for the United States. And the President is making clear, at least in these remarks, that this is about his decision making to come up against Trump to preserve democracy and the United States. Now, when he got back to the White House yesterday evening, he did try to walk back those comments just a bit, take a listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And new data underlines the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions.The EU's climate change service is officially announcing that 2023 will be the hottest on record across the globe. It says temperatures this year will be more than 1.4 degrees Celsius warmer than pre industrial levels. That is close to that 1.5 degree threshold that climate officials say the globe must not surpass without seeing the potentially irreversible effects of climate change. And something the world, of course, signed up to in 2015 at the Paris Climate Summit. Well, more than 100 climate scientists have just signed an open letter saying the phasing out of fossil fuels is \"Necessary for achieving climate change targets\". So let us say, \"The link between climate science and fossil fuel phase out is unequivocal. Moving towards the phase out of fossil fuel combustion is necessary to keep the goal of the Paris Agreement within reach\". Well, the scientists also say it will be necessary to utilize carbon dioxide removal technologies to meet those goals. Well, many here in the UAE at COP28 believe climate financing holds the key to ultimately unlocking many of the solutions to reaching Net Zero climate targets. I spoke to Badr Jafar, the CEO of Crescent Enterprises and the COP28 Special Representative for Business and Philanthropy.

But we need to embrace the dynamism, the capital and the action networks of business and philanthropy if we're going to stand the chance, and achieving our net zero and nature of positive goals. So the COP presidency hosted for the first time ever the inaugural COP28 business and philanthropy climate forum, here at COP28. And we managed to engage 1342 that's the number I just verified. 1342 CEOs from over 100 countries across the world, spanning the spectrum of industry, from energy to space, from fashion to agriculture, 43 percent of those in attendance were from the great nations across the global south.
