Just three months into the year, there have already been at least seven near collisions. The FAA is holding a safety summit to find the root causes of the problem.CNN's Gabe Cohen is joining us now. Gabe, what are they looking at? What are the things that near to change to prevent these close calls?",

We've already heard a range of ideas, increased funding, more staff, better technology.But to be clear, today's summit is just the start of a sweeping safety review of the aviation industry in the wake of those seven close calls you mentioned, since the start of the year, the most recent one about a week ago at Reagan National Airport near D.C. Even acting head of the FAA, Billy Nolen, has said this uptick really defies logic. So he called for this safety summit. In his opening remarks today, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg stressed the U.S. has the safest, most complex aviation system in world, and yet they're seeing more mistakes that usual happening across the system and happening on runways. Here's what he told our colleague, Pete Muntean, a little while ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "So a couple of key takeaways already from this summit. First, the head of the Air Traffick Controllers Union pointed to alarming staffing issues, that they're down 1,200 certified controllers from a decade ago, which means, of course, fewer eyes to prevent these safety risks.The FAA administrator responded to that, saying they're working to fix it, now on pace to hire 15 controllers this year and 1,800 more next year. We also heard from the chair of the National Transportation Safety Board, who spoke quite critically of inaction by other federal regulators, saying her agency has made seven recommendations in recent years just on runways collisions that, at this point, have not been enacted. She told the crowd, quote, \"How many times are we going to have to issue the same recommendations over and over and over again?\" Adding, quote, \"All federal agencies here today need to ask, are we doing everything possible to make our skies safer? And, Brianna, she also said they've already found at least one common cause in all of these incursions, that the so-called black box cockpit recordings were all overwritten, because they only record about two hours of sound, something she wants to see changed to help them with their investigations.",

You heard me talking to Todd Young. He's a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, some of those behind this nomination. So right now, this nomination appears to be confirmed after this critical vote. After lunch, there will be a vote essentially to confirm Garcetti and send him to the post. So this has been a major battle that has taken place largely behind the scenes. This nomination has been stalled because of that accusation, act on the concerns over sexual harassment. He denied those. He was able to convince enough Democratic Senators and some Republican Senate to now eventually get the job for this critical position - Brianna?",

That's projected to be 12.7 million in 2050. We are expecting this really surprising increase. Again, it comes down to aging. Another interesting point from this association, too often individuals with memory concerns and their doctors don't talk about those concerns. I'm talking about mild cognitive impairment symptoms, like losing things, or forgetting events or appointments. These are sometimes the early signs of dementia. But four in 10 Americans say they would not talk to their doctor if they experienced these symptoms. They wouldn't talk to them right away, possibly because thinking the symptoms aren't that serious, or possibly they might be embarrassed by the symptoms. But this emphasizes having those conversations with your doctor if you are experiencing the mild cognitive impairment symptoms, like simply losing things or forgetting your words while you speak - Brianna?",
