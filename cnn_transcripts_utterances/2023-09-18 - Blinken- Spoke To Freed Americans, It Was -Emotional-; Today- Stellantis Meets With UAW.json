First, let me be very clear that this process, the -- and the engagements necessary to bring it about the freedom of these unjustly detained Americans has always been a separate track in our engagement or for that matter, lack of engagement with Iran. So, irrespective of what was happening or not happening, for example, in pursuing the effort to return to the nuclear agreement, we've been focused on working independently to bring these Americans home. So, it doesn't speak to anything else in the relationship.We continue to be determined to take whatever step is necessary to deal with actions by Iran and a whole host of areas that are profoundly objectionable and that many other countries find objectionable. At the same time, when it comes to perhaps the number one issue of concern, which is Iran's nuclear program, we continue to believe that diplomacy is the best way to get a sustainable effective result. One that we had previously with the Iran nuclear agreement. And we'll continue to see if there are opportunities for that. In this moment, we're not engaged on that. But we'll see in the future if there are opportunities. But President Biden's also been very clear that one way or another, he's committed to ensuring that Iran never acquired nuclear weapons.",

Having said that, as I mentioned, two countries in particular played an absolutely vital role in helping to get us to this day, and that is Oman and Qatar. As for the other members of the GCC, I've had occasion over the past many months to talk to them about the relationship with Iran, which is a challenge for each and every one of them including for us. And to discuss in that context, some of the efforts that we were making to bring home our wrongfully detained Americans. And again, I don't want to speak for them. But I think everyone is supportive of that -- of that effort.With regard to the resources, I think it's very important to be very clear about exactly what this involves. As you know, this involves the access by Iran to its own money. Money that had accumulated in Korean banks as the result of oil sales that Iran made, which were lawful at the time those sales were made. And from day one, our sanctions have clearly and indeed always exempt the use of resources for humanitarian purposes because our aim is not to harm the Iranian people. Our problem -- our profound problem is with the Iranian regime. So, from day one, these Iranian monies that were in a -- in a Korean bank have always been available to Iran to use for humanitarian purposes. But for a lot of technical reasons, they weren't able to access those funds where they were. So, the funds were moved to another bank where we have absolute oversight of how they -- how they're used, and they can only be used for humanitarian purposes. And we have absolute confidence in the process and the system that's been set up. By the way, the previous administration, the administration prior to ours had set up a similar mechanism that was never used but exactly for these kinds of purposes. So, we're very confident that the funds -- the Iranian funds that had been made more easily available to Iran as a result of the actions that we've taken will be used exclusively for humanitarian purposes. And we have the means and mechanisms to make sure that that happens. Thanks very much. (CROSSTALK) (END VIDEOTAPE)",

What happens next to -- and I just say that Siamak said over the past 44 years, the Iranian regime has mastered the nasty game of caging innocent Americans and other foreign nationals and commercializing their freedom. And he calls Evin Prison virtually a dystopian United Nations of hostages.
