And we're learning gripping new details about exactly how Israeli forces rescued an IDF soldier held hostage by Hamas.Plus, dangerous threats. The FBI director issued a stark warning that the war in the middle east may inspire extremists here in the U.S. to carry out more attacks against Americans simply going about their daily lives. And we have a brand-new CNN poll out this hour, revealing the state of the race in a crucial primary state, South Carolina. Donald Trump may still be the frontrunner, but just how dedicated are his supporters, and which candidate has surged into second place. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We'll start with Israeli forces on the hunt for Hamas terrorists and closing in on Gaza city itself. The IDF says their troops are facing anti-tank missiles and machine gunfire as ground. The ground assault there intensifies, but airstrikes are not letting up,, continuing to attack hundreds of Hamas targets, hitting more than 300 overnight. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in southern Israel. Jeremy, what are you seeing as night is falling there?",

We've watched tank movements throughout the day and this evening as night falls, we are still hearing small arms fire in the distance.Israeli forces striking over 300 targets over the last day and we're getting a clearer picture of what those targets were. Not only Hamas command centers, their underground tunnels but also going after combatant commanders on the ground, which has been a key part of Israel's strategy as they conduct these expanded ground operations now in their fifth day. And among the commanders that Israel has now taken out according to the IDF is one of the commanders who directed the terrorist attacks on October 7, and particularly those in the north, in Erez and Netiv HaAsara Moshav which we visited just last week. IDF jets, according to the Israeli forces struck Nisam Abu Ajina, who is the commander of the Beit Lahiya battalion of Hamas is northern brigade.

Now, Israel Defense Forces say that they intercepted all of those threats outside of Israeli territory. And they did so at least in the case of that surface-to-surface ballistic missile using the red arrow system, which is the first time that that system has been employed and successfully intercepted a surface-to-surface missile.But what this does is it highlights not only the fact that Iran appears to be directing its proxies all over the region to conduct attacks against Israel.

And this is the first time that such an operation has successfully resulted in the release of one of those captives.And so, as you said, a little bit of a bright spot there and it's being used by the Israeli prime minister and these really defense minister to kind of make their claim that they believe these ground operations are actually helping to try and release these hostages, giving the possibility of releasing them and also strengthening their hand at the negotiating table as those complex negotiations being led by Qatar, mediated by Qatar are ongoing. And now, we have learned as of today, according to the Israel Defense Forces, that the number of hostages being held inside Gaza by Hamas and other militant groups, stands at 240. 240 people still waiting to try and get back to their loved ones.

So, in the context of those conversations, clearly, we're talking to them about vehicles, means ways in which those things can be achieved, not to mention the importance of getting all those hostages out. We know there's a small number of Americans in that group. We want to get them home to their families, too.

I do think it is important, though, to note that civilian casualties are not a war aim of Israel. They are going after Hamas leadership. They are not deliberately trying to kill innocent civilians, unlike Hamas, who definitely did that in their slaughter on the 7th of October, and have done it since the 7th of October by putting the people of Gaza in greater danger and in harm's way.

It was dramatic, and it was a slaughter, and we're helping them go after those Hamas terrorists.We're not funding any kind of a genocide. And as I said earlier, Dana, that's not what Israel is after here. They're going after Hamas terrorists. And yes, there have been civilian casualties. And as I said, none of them should happen. We don't want to see any. They can't be dismissed. And our thoughts and prayers go out to all the families that have suffered. And that's why we're working with Israel to be as discriminant and careful as they can be in their targeting going forward.

But what about the Nikki Haley, if at all?LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Well, I think Nikki Haley is showing that she's absolutely running a very good campaign. The fact that she is in second place relatively consistently over the last few polls, or at least she is very close with Ron DeSantis in Iowa yesterday, shows that she has a little bit of staying power and that she plans to stay in the race. The challenge is that the only candidate who has to spend it, there's been a couple of candidates, but one with any minor following that is suspended their campaign, Mike Pence, he's only pulling it about 2 percent. And so, that is obviously a non-Trump support. But that is not nearly enough to give to people like Nikki Haley or others who are trying to catch up to Donald Trump. That's what a lot of these candidates are hoping for is that they will consolidate the support as people do drop out, and then maybe something happens with Donald Trump. AYESHA RASCOE, NPR HOST, \"WEEKEND EDITION SUNDAY\" AND \"UP FIRST\": You know, I think that it's good for Nikki Haley, it would be better if she was just running against Ron DeSantis. But unfortunately, she has to run against Donald Trump. And that's where we just not have not seen any candidate really, you know, just getting to the place where they could beat him. I haven't seen the game plan. I haven't seen like the strategy really take shape that they could do it other than hoping that somehow, they will consolidate, you know, all the, you know, other voters together.
