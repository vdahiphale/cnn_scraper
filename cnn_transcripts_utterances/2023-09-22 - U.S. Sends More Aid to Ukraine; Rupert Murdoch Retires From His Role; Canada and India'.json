And it seemed to be a direct response to much of the news over the last day or so, which is the interview that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia had with Fox News, where he talked about the talks, negotiations towards normalization with Israel.And a big question in this normalization would be, what will the Palestinians get or what will happen to the Palestinians? And what we hear from the Palestinian authority president is essentially, you cannot have this piece that you seek in the Middle East without a full recognition of a Palestinian state. It was interesting to hear from the Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in that interview, not even mention the word necessarily a state for Palestinians, but instead talking about ways that they could ease the lives of Palestinians in this normalization deal. We do know that the Palestinians have set out certain things that they would like to receive as a result of this normalization deal. This is according to media reports as well as statements we've heard from Palestinian officials. This is things like U.S. backing for recognition of Palestinian statehood at the United Nations, which is something that Mahmoud Abbas mentioned in his speech. The U.S. reopening its consulate in Jerusalem that was closed by former President Donald Trump, and as well as Israeli transfer of certain parts of the West Bank territory into Palestinian control. Now it is going to be hard for much of these things to get through this current Israeli government. The most right-wing extremist in Israeli history, something that Mahmoud Abbas addressed, calling it a right- wing racist government. Otherwise for the rest of a speech, much of it is things that we have heard before from the Palestinian leader, things like demanding an end -- an end to the occupation, asking for full recognition of the state of Palestine, talking about what he called a double standard, saying why is Israel recognized but the state of Palestine is not recognized. He also is calling for Israel. He said to be held responsible for its actions, saying that there have been so many U.N. resolutions in that very body that he says have not been upheld. But, definitely, the biggest takeaway from his speech was that first line his sort of direct response to all the discussion about the normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia.

And this law, which they say, is according to the community of people and according to the customs of the society. Let's hold an election and see if they agree or not. Then, it will be clear. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I think there should be a law. If the freedom of the hijab is to exist, it must be in accordance with the society we live in. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I think the government will not step back, because it's part of the ideology of the Islamic Republic. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, as perhaps your audiences know by now, in the Islamic Republic of Iran, not adhering to, quote, unquote, \"Complete compulsory veil\" is, basically has punitive measures attached to it, already, for over four decades. This means that, you know, throughout the existence of the Islamic Republic many women, many of us have faced anything from fines, you know, lashes, imprisonment, humiliation on the street for not fully adhering to compulsory veil.And in response to the Woman, Life, Freedom movement that happened last year after Jina Mahsa Amini's death in custody in the Morality Police's hands, the Islamic Republic's regime, sort of, began to expand the scope and the scale of the punitive measures that are already, sort of, many of them are legalized within its system against women. You know, we saw peculiar sentences, such as, you know, having to wash dead bodies, all the way to fines. Over one million women, I believe, until July of this year, received a SMS messages about the fact that they hadn't adhered to compulsory veil, cars are being confiscated, humiliation on the street, and so on. And also, there are socioeconomic measures against women who are not adhering to these laws, such as, for example, not being able to open bank accounts, not being able to use services such as getting on a bus and so on.",
