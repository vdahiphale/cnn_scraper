And so we do know that they will have that conversation tomorrow evening. It will be moderated by David Sacks is a tech entrepreneur, a supporter of DeSantis'. We also know that Elon Musk confirmed that he would be doing this at a Wall Street Journal event just a little bit ago. He said that they would be sitting down that he would be talking. He has not endorsed anybody yet. But that is where we can expect to see him. Of course, just broadening out for a second, Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida has been talked about and talked about will he get in, won't he get in, if he gets in what happens. Well, now we have arrived at that point. And Jim, if it is any indication about where he stands against all of his rivals, soon-to-be rivals including former president, Donald Trump. Look at all the incoming that he's already had and that he will get over the next several days. They really see him as a true threat to their candidacies as well. And of course, the DeSantis operation wants to take full advantage of that. I'm here in Miami where a group of his donors will be gathering over the next couple of days.

But first things first, the primaries first so he wants to show Republican voters, of course, that he is someone who has the executive authority. Someone who can stand in a arena and a match with Donald Trump. Now, we are just about three months or so away from the first Republican debate. So whether or not Donald Trump decides to participate in that this is going to be a very crowded Republican field. We've seen many early potential frontrunners, some from Florida like Jeb Bush comes to mind, sort of a flash in the pan. So Gov. DeSantis certainly wants to show that he can take this to the next step and be a serious, credible candidate. And every time I've been out on the road with him and as he's been winding up here, voters are very, very excited to see him jump in. Now that he will be in tomorrow, we'll see if he can bring it.

You've heard a lot from Republicans, very clearly, frustrated about some of the behind the scenes negotiations last night, some of the discussions earlier this morning.

These prosecutors have said they're concerned that if he violates this protective order, he could try to argue that he didn't exactly understand the terms or didn't know what the restrictions were. So here, the judge went through the terms of this protective order. Now, the former president's attorneys have argued that, look, he has a First Amendment right to defend himself, not only does he have the constitutional rights that everyone has, they point to the fact that he's also the leading Republican candidate for the presidency and should not be restricted in any way in terms of what he can say publicly. But here in this court, they went over the terms what he can and cannot share publicly in terms of evidence in this case. And then we also, again, like you said, we got a trial date. Now this is probably tentative and likely won't hold. But as of right now, they scheduled this trial for March 25th. Of course, that's right in the middle of the 2024 campaign.
