Israel and Hamas once again on the verge of a temporary truce expected to begin just hours from now. If all goes according to plan, it would mark the first pause in the hostilities since the war began and could potentially could set the stage for even more captives to come out.Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv, Israel, and this is THE SITUATION ROOM Special Report. Let's begin our coverage right now here in the Middle East where we appear to be on the cusp of a critical moment in the war. Thirteen hostages' now just hours away from returning home, if the agreement between Israel and Hamas holds firm. CNN's Oren Liebermann has the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): After nearly seven weeks of war, it is the storm before the calm. Final hours of fighting in Gaza ticking down until a pause in the conflict separate early Friday morning. Thirteen hostages', women and children will then be freed by Hamas on Friday afternoon transferred to the Red Cross and then back to Israel.",

The spokesperson for country's foreign ministry expressed hope that the deal could be the basis for a longer pause. MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON: We are hoping that these four days would work as a proof of concept for effective de-escalation measures including expanding, extending this humanitarian pause but also getting to a more sustainable saleable truth. LIEBERMANN (voice-over): Hundreds of trucks are waiting at the Rafah border crossing outside of Gaza ready to enter the strip as a part of the agreement. Nearly 80 percent of Gaza's population is displaced, facing critical shortages of food, water and fuel. These trucks will provide only a fraction of what's required. For Gazans, the pause in fighting is a brief respite after weeks of relentless Israeli bombardment. As of Tuesday, more than 12,700 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, based on numbers from the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health, which have not been officially updated because of a breakdown in communications. On Thursday, Israel detained Dr. Muhammad Abu Salmiya, director of Al-Shifa Hospital, the IDF says he was questioned about alleged Hamas activity at the hospital. The IDF released footage of additional tunnels they say were uncovered below Gaza is largest medical facility. Health officials in Gaza have consistently denied Hamas use the hospital for military purposes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in a meeting with the new U.K. Foreign Minister David Cameron said the pause in fighting is not the end of the war.",

That means even the other 37 families in that initial batch of 50 in this agreement haven't heard anything, which means more agonizing hours of waiting, hoping that there is good news at the end of this. We have spoken with a few of them who have said, look, we're happy that that somebody is coming out and that this process has begun.We won't necessarily believe it until we see it. But it seems like this process is moving forward. And we hope it expands beyond the initial 50 to all the women and children and from there hopefully grows into the elderly men and from there beyond that. Is that reasonable to think at this point, still very difficult to come to that conclusion definitively.

And they've spent a long time building that up through the Afghan role. I was here eight weeks ago when the Qataris have mediated the release of the U.S. hostages from Iranian prison, Afghanistan, Sudan, they have a role in mediation.But this, the team tells me, has been really difficult, intense, complicated, really, really tough at times. And that is because these two sides, these two groups, so Israel on one on the one side and Hamas on the other simply do not trust each other. There is no trust between the two. And that is what's made these talks really difficult. I've been back and forth -- into Qatar. Over the past weeks, we thought we get there -- we got there at one point. Twice we thought we got there and then things fell apart. So this is absolutely crucial. They say their work is not done, but this is the biggest diplomatic breakthrough since this conflict began, if this works as the plan has suggested. But I did ask the spokesman for the foreign ministry today who held that press conference, Majed Al- Ansari, whether he expected any further delays, this is what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATAR FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN: We are hoping that we don't see any delays. And I think we've reached the point now where everything is in place and we are ready to go on the ground. So we are hopeful that, as I told you by 07:00 a.m., tomorrow, everything will stop and we'll have this beginning with the humanitarian troops or pause. When it comes to the -- what delays -- what were the reasons of delays, I can tell you that the discussions over the details and the schematics of how this will happen are very difficult and very detailed, because we wanted, as I said, to make sure that nothing would cause harm in the process of getting the hostages out but also that the parameters of the agreement are agreed upon in the operational sense between both sides. And that took a lot of, you know, discussions between both sides. But we are happy to report that the discussions happened in a very positive environment where both sides showed their commitment to the agreement itself. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the youngest is three year old Abigail Edan. She has been talked about a lot by President Biden. In fact, she turns four, tomorrow, Wolf.The U.S. has also said that they will not, unlike the Israeli government, they will not be telling American families that their relatives are coming out. Because of how fluid this situation is, they say they want to confirm that those American citizens are out of the Gaza Strip or at least in safe hands before they alert the family. So we can expect that once American citizens make their way out of Gaza or on their way out of Gaza, that those families will be alerted. Once that has been confirmed by American officials or Israeli officials, but the Biden ministration insistent that they have been in very close contact with these American families. There was a Zoom call with the families a couple of weeks ago with President Biden himself. A senior Administration official said that it was one of the most gut wrenching experience, one of the most gut wrenching things that he had heard happen in the Oval Office. Now, President Biden himself he's in Nantucket for his Thanksgiving holiday when asked by reporters whether that young Abigail Edan would be out tomorrow, he just put up his hand and said fingers crossed, Wolf.",

Thank you very, very much.I want to get some analysis now from former State Department Middle East Negotiator Aaron David Miller, and CNN Political and National Security Analyst David Sanger, who's also with the \"New York Times.\" Aaron, I'll start with you, do you see this hostage deal as being the first step to a much larger deal to secure the release of more of the hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza? AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER STATE DEPT. MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR: If -- first of all, thanks for having me, Wolf. If this one goes well, the next four days are relatively problem free. And there's no broken trust, let alone a renewal of hostilities in this -- in the truce. Yes, I think it could lead to a larger release, same pattern. The problem, of course, is going to be Hamas will still have -- even if it leads to 100, which is extraordinary and extremely welcomed to the hostages and their families, Hamas will maintain control of at least another 100. And the game -- the cruel game here I think is very clear, to dribble our hostages over time by time, rearm, regroup and hope that international pressure, including from the United States, leads to pressing the Israelis to constrain diminish or even end their ground campaign. That I think is the real challenge ahead. But for the moment, we'll know in a matter of hours whether or not the Qatari brokered negotiations and actually succeeded. I truly hope so.",

Balanced against -- that commitment to the dead, Wolf, balanced against the commitment to the living, which as you know, Israel puts a premium on redeeming their people, dead or alive from the battlefield. And that I think, is the cruelest choice of all that the Israelis are going to have to make.I think that if David's correct, and in fact that the deal breaks down, the Israelis are going to continue their ground campaign as intensely as they possibly can and look for operational opportunities, perhaps, to rescue hostages, but that seems to be extremely difficult.

While this part of the country had been dormant for around 800 years, scientists say, in the past two years, volcanic activity has come back to life with several major eruptions. We fly over the most recent one, past the mouth of the volcano and over seemingly endless lava fields still steaming hot even months after the actual eruption ended.
