The infamous gathering took place on December 18, 2020. We know that outside advisers were there. They were pushing a series of extreme measures to allow Trump to stay in office, including martial law. And we know that there was a shouting match. And now sources tell us prosecutors have taken a keen interest in that whole chaotic conversation as they're investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

There are some people you would expect to see in a meeting like that, like the chief of staff, Mark Meadows, at the White House, and other people you might not expect to see, like the former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne. And this is a meeting where ideas were being thrown around, like the military seizing voting machines, like martial law, like making Sidney Powell, an election denier, a special counsel, so they could kind of further this plot. And the January 6 House Select Committee focused a lot on this meeting and what went down during it.

So he may be very well investigating the possibility that this -- the fake electors scheme was all intertwined, that it covered multi jurisdictions, that this idea about efforts to put pressure on people, as in other states. And that gives us a little bit of an insight, might be sort of looking through a pinhole right now, into his case. But it tells us that he's thinking this on a grander scale, I think, than just a local state. So, for those people in Georgia, I think the answer is that Georgia is not alone. If you're looking at it from the Trump team, you're thinking, look, he's now bypassing the possibility of these state charges, and he's thinking about maybe wrapping a lot of this up in his federal indictment as well.",

He could be looking at efforts to overturn a federal election, those things.And I guess, of course, he always has the option of looking at conspiracy and wire and mail fraud charges as well from things that may have been used to perpetrate the crime or to advance the criminal conduct. So, I really -- I think this is well within his purview. And I think this is the kind of thing people have been waiting to see, whether or not he looks at this as something that needed to be brought before a grand jury because the criminal conduct was so widespread, as opposed to sort of just isolated instances of efforts by individual actors. This tells me that he's really looking at casting a broader net. Again, he does not have to indict just because he's investigating. But it does give us some insight into the idea that he's thinking about this on a much larger scale than just one phone call, just dealing with a couple of election workers. He's looking at in a broader sense about what was going on around the country and what efforts may have been going on in concert by individuals in the Trump orbit after the election.

He's been here several times. Actually, this is not necessarily a Trump rally. It's being billed as an agricultural policy discussion. So there actually are chairs here in the room. It's a smaller crowd. And that is by design. The former president is trying to take his message to a smaller group of people. He has held bigger rallies earlier this year here in Iowa, but it really is a tale of two very different campaigns, as you're talking about, the potential for more indictments are. Of course, two indictments are already on the books. That is not top of mind or even being discussed by many Trump supporters here. If anything, it simply has rallied some to his side. But as we travel across Iowa and spend time with other candidates as well, there is a clear split in this Republican Party.

They are canisters that carry anywhere from dozens to hundreds of mini-bomblets. Ukraine and Russia are actually already using them. We have a video that was taken near the beginning of the war. This is video of a cluster bomb being dropped on Kharkiv last year. You can actually see one of the bomblets dropped right here, initially not detonating. Later, it does detonate. That is a big part of why most countries have outlawed this type of weapon. We have retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton joining us now. He's a CNN military analyst. Colonel, tell us about this controversial decision and why the U.S. is deciding that it is worth it to send these cluster munitions to Ukraine. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, one of the big things, Brianna, is the fact that the Russians are using this weapon all the time. And you can -- as you can see from the video, this is one of the key weapons that the Russians have used, but the Ukrainians have also used it. They have had stockpiles of this weapon quite some time. And the key thing to remember about this is, because of the shortages that the Ukrainians are experiencing in the munitions that they currently have, they feel that they need the cluster bombs in order to prosecute their counteroffensive.",

The dirty battlefield -- all battlefields are dirty. This is exceptionally dirty when you live -- when you leave these kinds of munitions on the field.

So these nations, the strange bedfellows that we're a part of, one of them, Ukraine, is, of course, fighting a war for its very survival.
