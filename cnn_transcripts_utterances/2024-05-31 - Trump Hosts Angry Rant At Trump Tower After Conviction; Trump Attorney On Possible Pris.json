Donald Trump is lashing out, calling the judge, who will sentence him quote, \"The devil,\" in a rambling rampage. And a question that is on many Americans' minds, tonight, is will Trump actually go to prison? It's certainly on his, as he is vying for sympathy and falsely claiming that he is facing a 187 years behind bars. And a former \"Apprentice\" producer, who had an NDA for 20 years, has just now expired. He's now breaking his silence, claiming that he personally heard Donald Trump use the N-word. That producer is here tonight, and will join me. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Little bit of a pro tip, to start you off with tonight. It may not be the best idea, to refer to the judge, who is going to sentence you soon, on felony charges you were just convicted on, as \"The devil.\" But Donald Trump did just that in the wake of his conviction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have a judge who is highly conflicted. Looks like an angel, but he's really a devil. I wanted to testify. But the judge allowed them to go into everything that I was ever involved in. Was he a bad boy here? Was he a bad boy there? This is a scam. This is a rigged trial. It shouldn't have been in that venue. We shouldn't have had that judge. We're living in a -- in a fascist state. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And it was very unlikely that this was going to be an acquittal, just based on the volume of the evidence, and based on all sorts of testimony. Look, this is something that Donald Trump has spent decades, trying to avoid. He has lived in this legal gray area, for a very long time. And he has played gamesmanship with prosecutors and regulators, and people who have overseen his businesses, and aspects of his public-facing life. And he befriended prosecutors. He was very proud of his relationship with Bob Morgenthau, who was one of Alvin Bragg's predecessors. So, this is a momentous event. Now, what it means long-term, we don't know. He could win an election. He's going to appeal this. This appeal is like, if it succeeds? I have no idea if it will, or it won't, you know? They are going to throw a lot at it. They're going to try to get it before the Supreme Court. It will drag on for a while. It is highly unlikely that anything gets resolved before the election.

And so, he attacks the judge, and he attacks Michael Cohen, and he attacks this one and that one, and he says all kinds of other things. Then, he starts talking about the January 6th House investigation, which is never a topic his advisers want him talking about. So, it turned into a mini rally, and it was filled with grievances.

He ultimately didn't.I think there are things that Todd Blanche decidedly didn't do well, during this trial. But there were a couple of things he did do well, and one was that he got Trump, by some miracle, not to essentially self-cut during the proceedings. He, you know, there were a couple of instances of cursing, or shaking his head, or doing something, the judge didn't like, in front of the jurors. But generally speaking, they got him not to do things like that. And those moments defined the two civil trials that he had in the past year.

Now, the reasons why, you hear various different explanations for that Costello wasn't prepped well, and that was other people's fault and so forth. But that was a call that ended up confirming a lot of what Michael Cohen was saying, about some of the pressure. Even as Costello was denying it, he was doing it in a way that the jurors were paying very close attention during that testimony. And it seemed like a very strange choice. I will say one other thing that Todd Blanche made very clear to you, last night, in that interview, was how much the defendant was running the strategy, on a lot of fronts, in this case. And not every single one, but a lot of them. And when that happens, you run into things like Todd Blanche, telling the jurors that Donald Trump didn't reimburse Michael Cohen because, this was legitimate legal work. It wasn't a reimbursement. Trump himself called it a reimbursement over and over in 2018, which the prosecutor, Josh Steinglass, in his own closing argument, was able to point to tweets about.

But it was tilting things in a direction that we didn't necessarily need it to go, because we wanted to share an equitable story. And Trump seemed to have an issue with this idea all along.
