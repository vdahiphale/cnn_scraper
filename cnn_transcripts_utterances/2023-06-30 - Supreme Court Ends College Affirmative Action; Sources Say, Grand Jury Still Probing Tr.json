I think they're visceral, they're unvarnished to some degree, given where the nine justices are on this issue.But on that point, I don't think -- and you may disagree. Obviously, you're involved in higher education. The affirmative action, the process that was in place, the university wasn't necessarily perfect. There were certainly holes in it, there were certainly problems with it. You saw Asian-Americans, in particular, who kind of led on bringing this case, raising very specific and pointed concerns.

Now, this Supreme Court has taken away the ability to achieve diversity for the sake of achieving diversity and looking at an overall pool of what an incoming class looks like.I'm confident that a lot of thinking is going to go into this in the days ahead, and I hope that it will be the case that universities find a way to achieve a diverse class, whether it's race, culture, geography, economic circumstances, by allowing us to all consider an applicant's personal challenges in life, whether it's because of where you grew up, how you grew up, where you went to school for high school, and how you grappled with being the victim of discrimination in this country. From where I sit in the legal profession, we want to be able to look to law schools with diverse student bodies, because we've all seen the advantage of diversity in the legal profession. We've seen the advantage of diversity in the judiciary. Ironically, this Supreme Court is the most diverse Supreme Court ever. A minority of the nine are white men for the first time in history.

When you have 9 people or 12 people or 20 people all from the same background, all from the same social situation, all from the same geography, that is the environment for unhealthy decision-making. And that virtue must flow through the entirety of life, whether it's colleges, whether it's law schools, whether it's law firms, whether it's the executive branch of the U.S. government, whether it's the White House, the west wing, those of us of my generation certainly know the virtue of diversity, and we have to continue on that path.

And they are, therefore, in the majority accused by Sotomayor just acting basically as an admissions group, just sort of like setting admissions policy for the country according to their own personal whims. I mean, in the case of Justice Thomas, sort of personal damage he experienced when he was a law student. Not a sound way to make constitutional policy. I think we're going to find a lot of people using the loophole that you just alluded, sort of saying, okay, we're not going to take race into account but we're going to ask to you write an essay about any adversity you might have experienced in your life because of race or ethnicity. And the admissions officers will figure it out and the students will figure it out.

It's really just a matter of proving, number one, that someone knew they had documents in their house, that the documents themselves were of a sensitive nature, and then, separately, that he tried to obstruct the investigation into it, sort of very straightforward. When you start getting into overturning elections and candidates for office giving speeches that step up to the line and raising -- it's just more legally complex.

I mean, there is a political remedy, which is impeachment, and, indeed, the former president was already impeached for conduct closely related to what they're looking at with regard to the post-election activities. I think in terms of whether there can be an indictment there, there's a few different angles that prosecutors may be looking at. One has to do with the riots and the events that actually occurred on January 6th. Another has to do with events prior to that, closer to the election, where you had pressure brought on officials and even on the vice president trying to interfere with the election results.",

They're different possible legal theories about exactly what crime people committed in this process.And then the third one has to do with fundraising, and the idea that some of the fundraising solicitations that were sent out in the aftermath of the election were frauds on the donors, that people were misled about what their money was going to be used for, or even that they were misled about the fact that there was an election theft that Donald Trump needed your money to his campaign in order to wage a legal fight against, and so all of those are more complicated legal matters to bring a case about. One weird thing about them looking at that fundraising matter is that that, again, sort of like the documents case, moves off the really core wrongdoing. That is not about the riot. I don't think we would normally say that the big victims in the whole thing were people who gave money to the Donald Trump campaign, but that is another possibility for a legal avenue that they could attach to in order to have a legal revenue.",

And it's critically important because it suggests that there may be further wrongdoing that the prosecutor is going to either uncover or allege. And so in the case where we already heard the great reporting by CNN, where we hear papers rustling and so forth and the former president been coming up with some excuse, when I said plans, I didn't mean military plans. They were plans for some architecture project or something like that, some completely implausible scheme.What we're going to find out is whether or not there were other instances where a military map or something else that a potential future trial jury could easily understand. There are some things about this whole question of documents that are hard to understand.
