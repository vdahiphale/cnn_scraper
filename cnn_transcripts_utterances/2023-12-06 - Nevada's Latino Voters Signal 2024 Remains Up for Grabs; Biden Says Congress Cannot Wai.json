The Office of Management and Budget saying that without congressional action, \"We will run out of resources to procure more weapons and equipment for Ukraine and provide equipment for U.S. military stock.\" We're likely to see an extension of that in the president's remarks, which are expected momentarily.And just to remind viewers, the president has repeated come out to push for the supplemental request which is $105 billion in total, breaking it down, it's $61 billion for Ukraine and $14 billion for Israel. But he made a the call for the nation in October when this was first introduced. He has also gone to the pages of \"The Washington Post.\" So this is a priority for the president and this White House as they try to show on the national stage, but also on the global stage that they are continuing to back Ukraine and Israel. This is important for democracy. It's important for these conflicts and above all else, it's important for the national security of the U.S. So, we expect to hear all of that from the president in what is expected to be brief remarks and potentially also getting questions from reporters. Some of that may include what happens with border security. This is something that Republicans have pressed Democrats on. They will not pass they say anything unless there's robust policy changes, where the White House stands on that has been unclear. They have said from the podium that they will not negotiate in public, but clearly, this is a delicate issue and one that Republicans are calling for changes on, as they also try to get -- as the White House tries to get this supplemental through.",

He has a very weak hand to deal with. When he wants to push Ukraine funding, he looks to his right. And Republicans are saying, why? We don't see the reason to do this. Why are we protecting their borders when we can't protect our own? It's a legitimate question, right? The president has to make the case for democracy and he has tried to reach an agreement with the Republicans on border security here.And he looks to his left, in his own party, not just here in Washington, out on the trail, especially young voters, don't want him to get give any more money to Israel right now. They are mad at Israel. They think Israel is somehow the bad actor against Hamas, even though Hamas attacked a terrorist strike on Israel. So, the president can look left and right, whether it's in Washington at the Congress or out in the country, and there's a problem right now. And he's trying to solve it, and he's trying to be the commander-in-chief. This is a presidential moment, not necessarily a political moment, but he has a weak hand.",

And so, at that point, people were so -- a lot of people were really disgusted with the way the United States left Afghanistan. They didn't want to be there, but they didn't like the way that the U.S. left.

They say we didn't get what we bought and that also happened right when inflation was spiking or not too -- right after. So, if you go out in the country, number one, they think because the president -- part of this is because he keeps a light schedule. His team bristles at the suggestion, but the American people do not hear him every day whether it is on inflation, whether it is on Ukraine, whether it is on these issues. So, he's coming -- he keeps coming into these fights, making these statements at moments of crisis as opposed to building up support over time in traveling the country, make you -- go make your case about democracy.It's striking in the sense that you look at that low approval rating. I was just in Vegas. 30 percent unemployment at the peak of COVID. That's a body blow that's hard to recover from. Most of the jobs are back but people don't believe it. They can see it if you look around, but they don't feel it in their bones. David was going through, he's in Jimmy Carter and Donald Trump territory.

And the people of the United States can and should take pride -- they should take pride that we have enabled Ukraine's success thanks to the steady supply of weapons and ammunition we provided them together with our partners and our the allies. I just did a meeting with the G7, which was one of the issues we discussed. All the European leaders, we are prepared to stay with Ukraine and our European friends are as well. Who in the united states is prepared to walk away from that? I tell you, I'm not prepared to walk away and I don't think the American people are either.If Putin takes Ukraine, he won't stop there. It's important to see the long run here. He's going to keep going. He has made that pretty clear. Putin attacks a NATO ally and if he keeps again and then he attacks a NATO ally, when we have committed as a NATO member that we defend every inch of NATO territory, then we'll have something that we don't seek and that we don't have today, American troops fighting Russian troops. American troops fighting Russian troops if he moves into other parts of NATO. Make no mistake. Today's vote is going to be long remembered and history is going to judge harshly, those who turn their back on freedom's cause. We can't let Putin win. Say it again, we can't let Putin win. It's in our overwhelming national interest and international interests of all our friends. Any disruption in our ability to supply Ukraine clearly strengthens Putin's position. We have run out of money to be able to do that in terms of authorization. Extreme Republicans are playing chicken with our national security, holding Ukraine's funding hostage to their extreme partisan border policies. Let me be clear. We need real solutions. I support real solutions at the border. I put forward a comprehensive plan the first day I came into office. I made it clear that we need Congress to make changes to fix what is a broken immigration system because we know -- we all know it's broken. And I'm willing to do significantly more. But in terms of changes of policy and to provide resources that we need at the border, I'm willing to change policy as well. I have asked for billions of dollars for more border agents, more immigration judges, more asylum officers. Republicans have to decide if they want a political issue or if they want a solution at the border. Do they really want to a solution? It cannot be sustained as it is now. We need a real solution. And my team has been engaged in negotiations with Senate Democrats and Republicans on border security. Democrats have put forward a bipartisan compromise on the table. Major (ph) Schumer and Senate Democrats also have offered to let Republicans propose a (inaudible) to that border proper but the Republicans have rejected it and said, \"No, we will not change anything and introduce your proposal because we're not going to -- even though the Democrats say you can amend it any way you want -- No, no, we don't want to do that. This has to be a negotiation. Republicans think they can get everything they want without any bipartisan compromise. That's not the answer. That's not the answer. And now, they are willing to literally kneecap Ukraine on the battlefield and damage our national security in the process. Look, I know we have our divisions at home. Let's get past them. This is critical. Petty partisan angry politics can't get in the way of our responsibilities as the leading nation in the world. And literally, the entire world is watching. The entire world is watching. What will the United States do? And think if we don't support Ukraine, what's the rest of the world going to do? What's Japan going to do which is supporting Ukraine now? What's going to happen in terms of the G7? What's going to happen in terms of our NATO allies? What are they going to do? If we walk away now, it will only embolden other would-be aggressors. So, I'm calling on Congress to do something and to the right thing, to stand with the people of Ukraine, stand against the tyranny of Putin, stand for freedom -- literally stand for freedom. Let's get this done. We're the reason Putin has not totally overrun Ukraine and moved beyond that. You all have heard me talk about it before. If in fact we walk away, how many of our European friends are going to continue to fund? And at what rates are they going to continue to fund? This is too serious. Like I said, I'm willing to make significant compromises on the border. We need to fix the broken border system. [12:50:00] BIDEN: It is broken. And thus far, I have gotten no response. So I just -- we're going to vote a little bit later today. We'll know where we go from there but I wanted to make this comment before the vote. And I'm sure I will be talking with you after the vote.

Anyway, I'll talk to you more after the vote.",

Let's just start on the message that the president was giving extremely forcefully, using dire urgent language saying that if the United States does not give more money to the Ukraine war effort, Putin is going to get a gift. If Putin takes Ukraine, he won't stop there. He will go after NATO. He has urged the members of Congress to take the long run here. He said history will judge and much, much more.John King, what do you make of that and will it have any impact. And I should also note, important note, that the reason why this is being held up is Republicans want to include pretty significant immigration policy, not just funding for the border but policy changes, along with it.",

      "sentences": "And they haven't been able to reach an agreement on that. Look, if you just read the transcript, right, everybody out there -- most people out there watch this through their partisan lens. That was an incredibly strong moral argument for defending and standing with Ukraine at this moment. The president is also right on the facts that if the United States walks away, either  cuts funding completely or significantly reduces funding, the European governments will be under all sorts of pressure and other governments around the world that have joined helping the NATO allies in other ways will be under all kinds of pressure to reduce it as well.So the question is, Mitch McConnell is the big player here. He agrees with the president 100 percent about supporting Ukraine but he wants something. He wants more on the border. He has to deal with his own conservatives in the Senate and he also knows in the wild west that is the House of Representatives right now, if you want Republican votes, you got to give more on the border. So the question is, can the president take that moral argument and then get in a room and negotiate on the border in ways that -- again, he didn't even mention Israel. Israel is part of the -- money for Israel is part of this package as well. Will he give the Republicans so much on the border that he creates a political problem for himself on the left? That's the president's dilemma. How does he negotiate this?",
