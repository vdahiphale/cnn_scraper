And so they, they having to sort of adjust the rules to fit this set of facts right, this script. And so they are very fully aware of the fact that they want to try to at least make sure they bring the charges. And then put it in the hands of judges to see whether they can bring the cases before the voters make their decision. Of course, they are already. You know, I think David Chalian and I have been talking about this a lot. It's kind of a little bit too late, right? They are already crashed into the political calendar. And so the criticism is going to come I will say, one thing, I think is that I think it's we're going to hear a lot more in the coming months, is that, you know, I think these cases were, you know, everybody at the Justice Department knew the political atmosphere around these cases. And Jack Smith appointment, I think really turbocharged this and made them come a lot faster. Perhaps it might have been some of the political leaders of the Justice Department that might have been a little more hesitant about this, because of the very criticism they're getting right now, Jack Smith, is not that right? He came in from outside he is appointed specifically to try to remove the politics from this. And so it really turbocharged the two cases to come more quickly.",

We should note that Former President Trump has not clearly stated that he would support Ukraine. And so that is a key factor that U.S. officials believe that President Putin is looking at closely. Now, this is not an intelligence assessment of where President Putin is in his thinking of all this. This is just what U.S. officials and European officials are talking about right now. And as you said earlier, you know, there's a CNN poll out \"This Morning\" showing that the majority of Americans are opposed to additional funding for the war in Ukraine.

So that cuts into what we can spend on future warfare and current warfare, and of course, inflation and everything else, and we have to invest in new things.
