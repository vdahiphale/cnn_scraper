It was an Egyptian base, a raw city of the Philistines and the place where the Hebrew hero Samson betrayed by Delilah met his death, since then much blood has been spilled. The most recent contest for Gaza began at the end of World War II when persecuted Jews traveled to Israel from Europe, looking for a new start after the horrors of the Holocaust. In 1947, the U.N. created a plan to split Israel into two countries, one for Jews and one for the Arab people. Backed by the U.S. president Harry S. Truman, David Ben-Gurion, Israel`s Founder, proclaimed the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. Egypt then attacked Israel through the Garza Strip. Israel was victorious, but Gaza remained under the control of Egypt and an influx of Palestinian refugees began. In 1967, war broke out between Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and Syria in what became known as the six-day war. Israel seized the Gaza Strip and held it for about 40 years. In 2006, Hamas, the groups sworn to destroy Israel and listed by the United States, European and Union and others as a terrorist group won a landslide victory in Palestinian, legislative elections and Israel unilaterally pulled its forces out of Gaza that year. Hamas was now in control of the territory. However, Israel still controls much of the area`s access to and from the Gaza Strip. Since then, Israel and Hamas have been exchanging blows. Israel maintains Hamas as a violent terror organization. While Hamas says they represent an oppressed people being victimized by the Jewish state. The international community continues to press for a cease in violence, but for now the Strip`s population of 1.8 million people are trapped in the crossfire. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "This surprise attack on Israel over the weekend came 50 years and one day since another attack known as the Yom Kippur War. Israel has sincespent billions to create one of the world`s most formidable security systems. But in this case, the Israeli government appeared to be caught off guard. And the moment is seen as a massive intelligence failure. So why this most recent attack? Hamas says the assault on Israel was in part to defend the holy site, the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, in response to what they claim are attacks on it. And the desecration of it, as well as they say, an ongoing siege of Gaza. The holy site compound is one of the most revered places in Islam and Judaism. The sacred grounds known to Muslims as noble sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount have been a flash point of tensions between Israel and the Palestinians for decades. Clashes have frequently broken out at the site between Palestinian worshipers and Israeli forces. Police rated the compound several times over the last year. Violence has been particularly heightened this year. The number of Palestinians, both militants and civilians killed in the West Bank by Israeli forces is at its highest in nearly two decades. Let`s go now to CNN`s Tom Foreman, to better understand how Hamas forces attacked Israel this past weekend. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "This extraordinary series of attacks began at 6rockets flowing out of Gaza. Note that this would be the level at which their most rudimentary rockets would hit about 6 miles or so. Then you reach out to maybe 25 miles and their most advanced rockets, the ones that would most seem to rely probably on some technology beyond them. Iran has many intelligence people would say, would reach up here to Tel Aviv, that`s about 45 miles from here. Whatever the placement of them was, though, there were an awful lot of them. We don`t have an exact count, but it appears to be in the thousands. That would matter because that would make it easier to overwhelm Israel`s missile defense system, the Iron Dome system, and make sure that some got through, even if many were stopped. More importantly, by doing this, all indications are that laid the groundwork for what came next. At 7:40, an hour and 10 minutes later, that`s when armed soldiers, fighters started coming out of Gaza into Israel, some by knocking down walls and barriers here, some coming in by air with powered parachutes, some by boats going around here. This was something again, that indicated it was a very planned attack. (END VIDEOTAPE) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ROBERTSON (voice-over):  In the early hours of Saturday, Israelis woke to a sudden assault from Gaza militants. The surprise attack, claimed by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, a complex and massive operation, marking a steep escalation of hostilities. The attack began with a huge barrage of missiles fired from Gaza. Thousands of rockets, some making direct hits on targets across southern Israel. Under the cover of the missiles, a large-scale infiltration began as Hamas militants crossed by land, sea, and air, even using paragliders to cross into Israel. Videos from border crossing stations show Hamas fighters storming into Israeli territory. A few miles away in the border town of Sderot, Hamas was seen driving and opening fire at civilians. The gunmen tore through the streets, leaving a trail of casualties behind. The full extent of the casualties is unclear, but hundreds have been killed and more than a thousand injured on both sides. During the raid, some fighters also took Israelis as hostages. Israel quickly retaliated, hitting multiple targets along the Gaza Strip. In Gaza City, two high rise buildings collapsed after an airstrike. The unrest continuing late into the night, with both sides trading rocket fire. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been unwavering in his message that Israel is at war with Hamas. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
