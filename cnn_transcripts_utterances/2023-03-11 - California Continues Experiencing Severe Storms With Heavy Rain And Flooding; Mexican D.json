Powerful drenching storms hitting the northern and central parts of the state brought on by an atmospheric river. Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency. A levee breach has forced evacuations in Monterey County and floodwaters are causing severe road damage as well. The California National Guard is now on the scene in Santa Cruz to support emergency services. For some residents, the rising water is simply too much. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And as you mentioned at the top of the show, it is flooded because we have this levee that is upstream in the Pajaro River that failed around midnight local time. So all of that water as the cold front quickly comes through, that water is dumped essentially here all around us.So what we've been seeing, Fredricka, since dawn, since we moved positions from the berry farm we talked to you last time until now, National Guard troops have been coming up and down the central drag of Pajaro for several hours now rescuing people. You can just see the extent of the water. And there's still people who are trapped in these homes. As we were crossing the bridge before our live hit with you a couple minutes ago, there were family members who were trying to get through, saying I have a daughter or my dog who are in these homes right now. So if you actually notice, over on my right-hand shoulder, there are people, they are not trapped, per se, but it's still difficult for them on this balcony on this apartment building over here to get around. So we have these people over here, difficult for them to get where they need to go to safety. But we also, Fredricka, witnessed the rescue of a couple, Sierra (ph), Freddie (ph), and their dog Zeus (ph), about an hour ago. The National Guard came to their home because it was too dangerous for them to just travel a block away from our live shot position right now. They said they woke up around 8:00 a.m., saw floodwaters all around them, saw that the levee had broken on social media, and they called 911. And the National Guard was here in minutes. So it's a little bit of a lull right now, a quiescent period. But Fred, as we get into tomorrow and the next atmospheric river coming down the pike on Tuesday, we, again, still have a 100-foot section of this levee that has been compromised. What is going to happen when more precipitation comes here to the central coast of California, that is still an open question, Fred.",

The SVB was a top source of funding for tech startups and held more than $200 billion in assets. The collapse makes it the second largest failure of a financial institution in American history. The fallout sent stocks plummeting, sending investors into a tizzy. The Dow had its worst week since June. SVB is now under the control of the FDIC which insures deposits of up to $250,000. The agency says all insured depositors will have access to their insured deposits by no later than Monday morning.With us now is the host of CNN Business Nightcap, Jon Sarlin.

In 2022 the Fed started to dramatically raise interest rates, and for a bank like SVB, that has had a really significant effect on its balance sheet. The bank holds bonds, which because of increased interest rates, are now worth less money.On the flipside of that, the broader tech economy sector has been hit by those raising interest rates where this is a frothy economy that really relished in the cheap money that was being tossed around for the last decade plus. Those two factors led to the bank on Wednesday having to sell some of its bonds for a loss. That created a massive ripple effect in Silicon Valley where group chats and WhatsApp chats started talking about, hey, should we be getting our money out of this bank, will it be available in a week, in a month? Peter Thiel, it was reported by Bloomberg, one of the most significant PCs in the Valley, had his companies pull their money by Thursday. All of that led to panic.

When that will happen, we don't know. What we know is that by Monday, around $250,000, which is the insured amount, will be available to customers.But these are big customers, $250,000 is not a lot of money for them. So the question is when they will have access to those greater funds. You can look at a company like Roku, the streaming media company. They filed what's called an 8-K with the SEC, and it said 26 percent of its cash reserves are tied up in SVB. They said they don't know when they will have access to that money.",

But we're starting to see effects in the tech world. One thing to keep an eye out, crypto. USDC, which is one of the largest so-called stablecoins, lost its peg because its parent company had money tied in SVB.

And I think that goes to show you the sense of some of the people who are against these reforms. Keep in mind that having half a million people out in the streets across Israel as the organizers claim, Israel only has a population of about 9 million people, so that's a pretty significant proportion of people coming out on a Saturday night to protest this. We are just outside of the Israeli president's residence actually in Jerusalem, and it was Israeli President Isaac Herzog who just a few days ago gave an impassioned speech, speaking out for the first time specifically against these reforms, saying that these reforms as they are written threaten Israel's democratic foundations and warning, he said, that the country is at a point of no return. He's been pleading for both the opposition and the current coalition government to come to the negotiating table, to come forward with a series of reforms that everybody could agree to. But it seems that so far these pleas are falling on deaf ears from the Israeli government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They feel as though these reforms are sorely needed to rebalance the branches of government. They also have the votes that they need. They have more than enough of a majority in order to get these reforms through, and it doesn't seem as though they plan to slow down anytime soon. In fact, this week they're planning a major legislative blitz that will help push these reforms even closer to becoming final. But organizers here say that they are not slowing down anytime soon. They've been out in the streets now for more than two months. They plan further what they call days of disruption. These will be things like you shutting down the highways, slowing down operations at the airport as they did last week. And today they announced they will actually be taking some of these protests abroad. They say they plan to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he goes to an official trip to Berlin later this week. They will be protesting his trip there specifically against these judicial reforms. Fred?",

Fetterman checked him in on February 16th, seeking treatment for depression, a little less than a year after suffering a stroke.And now his decision is reigniting some conversations around politics and mental health. It wasn't until 2019 when Congressman Seth Moulton ran for president that a candidate from a major party talked openly about mental health treatment. And others like Senator Tina Smith and former Congressman Patrick Kennedy have come forward to talk openly about their past mental health issues. But they may be the exception and not necessarily the rule. Or perhaps that's the question. Former Congressman Brian Baird practiced clinical psychology for 20 years before his election and he's joining me now. So good to see you. So I would love to get your reaction to Senator Fetterman and what he is going through right now.",

I think it's admirable that he's doing his best working with his staff to try to stay abreast of the issues and stay informed and cast votes as needed.

He's got some new challenges, but I'm confident that if he stays with it, the recovery can happen. People make progress when they're treated for depression, and we really have to underscore that. If you deny it or you try to hide it, you're not going to get better. But if you address it and get support, you can make substantial improvement and get back to positive function.

Over the past 10 years he's met on a regular basis and has just announced a major reform of the Curia. I think that's what they had in mind.Now, indeed, he emerged, I think, as this figure maybe they didn't anticipate in its entirety, but I think that was the task they set for him. If you want to see him in left-right categories, again it's hard. A poor church on behalf of the poor, that's a very strong theme in him, might be more of a left-leaning theme. Certainly, the Pope of the environment. At the same time, he's fiercely oppose to abortion, he's fiercely opposed to what he calls gender ideology. And just in the last day he referred to it as a type of ideological colonization. So to put him in left-right categories isn't going to work.",
