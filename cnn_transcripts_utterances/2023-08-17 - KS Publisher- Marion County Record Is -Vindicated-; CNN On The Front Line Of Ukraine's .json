There was swift condemnation from First Amendment advocates across the country after the police searched and did a search and seizure at the Marion County Records Office. Computers, phones, and other items were seized. But now, police have to return it all.CNN Law Enforcement Correspondent Whitney Wild is here with us with details. Whitney, what more are you hearing about this? I know that they were able to publish even after all this -- all this searching and seizing all the things, but they start by saying cease but not silence. What's going to happen now with their equipment?",

They searched a reporter's computer who had been sick all that week and hadn't even been involved in it. They also took her cell phone. She wasn't even in the office at that time.

Basically, says that Governor Hochul takes issues with many aspects of New York City's handling of the migrant crisis and saying that the city can do more to handle the situation in a proactive, timely, and collaborative manner in terms of working with the city. For starters, the governor lays out a list of about 14 locations in and around New York City that the city could potentially use to house asylum seekers.However, the city has passed on those locations. So, the mayor in the last hour, Eric Adams is saying that they did not ignore any site recommendations. Simply they are not sustainable. And they do not work in terms of the goal to house asylum seekers. Adams is saying this morning that he hopes to sit down with Hochul's team to explain why they didn't take him up on that offer. Also, the governor zeroed in on -- zeroing in on this recent practice of offering relocation for asylum seekers from New York City to other communities Upstate. Saying not only does this practice overall delay the legal process for asylum seekers, but also it makes essential services very difficult to reach. I want you to hear what Governor Hochul told our affiliate in New York One. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) GOV. KATHY HOCHUL (D-NY): Putting someone in a hotel, on a dark, lonely road in upstate New York and telling them they're supposed to survive is not compassion. We are focused on helping find as many sites at considerable state expense in the city and we believe there's still more capacity based on the list we've already provided. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

Our CNN team was there as Ukraine retook the town of Urozhaine, a key strategic location on the banks of a crucial River in an area that Russia has occupied for more than a year. Let me show you on the map where this is. It's up here in this region -- down here, I should say, in this region right there. We can push it a little more and you can see Urozhaine right here. And now, the Ukrainians control both banks of this river.With me now is CNN Military Analyst, Retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. General, thanks so much for being with us. One thing I do want to point out is the Mokri Yaly River which goes right through here, it flows down into the Sea of Azov. And right here and here are two crucial Ukrainian cities that the Russians have held for more than a year, Mariupol and Berdyansk.

That's -- those tank training is taking place at -- a place called the Klietz troop and bunk plots, which is a German training area, just to the west of Berlin. It is one of several locations where Ukrainian forces have been training. There have been about eight or 9000 tankers trained. It's going to continue to increase.But what you're seeing in this film is a -- is a pair of tanks. This is called the tank section. And what they're doing is learning the tricks of how to maneuver on territory and engage targets. Inside those tanks are a four-man crew, a driver, a loader, a gunner, and a -- and a tank commander. And what they have to do is not only coordinate what goes on inside the tank and firing that 105-millimeter main gun, but they're also having to coordinate with that partner. And you see both tanks in this film right now. They have to engage targets. You don't want to shoot at the same target with two different tanks. So, they're continuously scanning. They're looking for targets downrange. And these tanks, these Leopard 1A5s have been used by the Dutch Army, the German army, and they are very good tanks. They're very fast. They've got good fire control systems, and they can hit targets. This will be a good match. But the most important thing is what the lethal part of this tank is -- are the four soldiers on the inside. They've received the training that they need something that the Russian forces have not been real good at in terms of their tankers.",
