The power has run out after the only electricity generating station ran out of fuel. The situation in Gaza is growing dire by the day and still, Israel continues its assaults. Hello. I'm Richard Quest. Our breaking news coverage of Israel's war on Hamas continues. Tonight, the United Nations says food and water are quickly running out in Gaza. The region has been cut off and is getting pummeled by airstrikes. Israel says it's hitting terror targets belonging to Hamas. But as you can see from these pictures during the day, dark smoke can be seen from the skyline. Humanitarian groups are warning of a severe crisis as basic supplies are running low. In terms of the number of people who have lost their lives on both sides. In Gaza, it is now above 1,400 it is believed and Israel says attacks by Hamas killed at least 1,200 people. While this is going on, the US Secretary of State who is in Israel says Israel must avoid harming civilians to the best of its ability. He told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, American support for Israel will never falter and the prime minister said, Hamas must be cut off from the international community.

It's a thin strip of territory, bordered on one side by the sea, and on two other sides by Israel, and also the Egyptians have sealed their crossing. So it is in a state of total siege. Now usually, limited -- well, food and other essential supplies do get in regularly from Israeli territory, those have all been cut off as indeed is the power supply. Without a power supply, clean water, which is in any case, in short supply is limited in Gaza. So the conditions for civilians in Gaza are extremely uncomfortable now and there will be NGOs and other aid organizations who are saying that they could reach catastrophic levels pretty quickly. Now Hamas has said that they are planned for this, certainly from a military perspective, they are comfortable that they can sustain themselves at any rate through a prolonged siege, but that is clearly not going to be the case for the civilian population, who as ever are the most to suffer in these exchanges of fire.",

They are themselves very anxious about political Islam. You have a dictatorship in Egypt that came to power by toppling the democratically elected apparently, Muslim Brotherhood government there. Now Hamas was actually created as a branch originally of the Muslim Brotherhood. So they are very, very suspicious indeed of the Hamas regime inside Gaza and want to keep it bottled up in that location, not having it leak into their own territory.

But Hamas says it will not negotiate as long as it remains under attack from Israel, and Israel says it has cut off water, electricity, and fuel as long as those hostages are held in Gaza. With a worsening humanitarian crisis in the besieged enclave, the US has warned Israel it must follow the laws of war amid talk of a massive ground assault.

Basically, what they're doing is they're collecting the perpetrators of the Hamas attack on Saturday, together with the vast majority of the population, the population that according to the CIA, 40 percent of the population is under the age of 15. These are -- most of the people in Gaza aren't members of Hamas, most of them are simply trying to get by in a very difficult situation. And I've been in Gaza when these flareups have happened. Oftentimes, you see that the reaction, apart from some hot heads is one of desperation and life is already difficult in Gaza. They know that once the bomb start to fall and the place is put under complete closure, more than it usually is, that their lives are going to deteriorate dramatically. We've already seen more than 340,000 people have been displaced, many of them are taking refuge in UN schools that have been converted into shelters. I've been to those shelters when they're crammed full of people, it is miserable there.

You know, they want public support to be on their side, they want international support to be on their side. And that's why it was also very important to see the U.S. Secretary of State Tony Blinken here, not only standing side by side with the Israeli prime minister, saying that is that the United States stands with Israel, and that Israel has not only a right but an obligation to defend itself in these cases, but also to hear the secretary of state laying out the same case, as the Israeli prime minister, also talking about the barbarity and the brutality of those Hamas attacks. It is all part of the same notion of trying to maintain international public support and in this case, to maintain the support of the United States. Now, I also spoke with U.S. officials who made very clear, that part of the reason for the secretary of state to come here before any potential ground invasion takes place, so that the U.S. can provide some input, so that the U.S. can make statements like the secretary of state did today, about urging Israel to stick to international law, to avoid civilian casualties, to the best extent possible.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NADA BASHIR, CNN REPORTER (voice-over):  Gripped by grief, and loss of unfathomable scale. Gaza's death toll and the number of civilians wounded is rising with each and every airstrike. In Al-Shati refugee camp, men dig with their bare hands, desperate to rescue loved ones from beneath the rubble of what once where their homes. Saad begins to list the names of the children killed in this latest strike. Among them, his niece. She was just a few months old. Now, she is one of more than 440 children Gaza's health ministry has said have been killed by Israeli airstrikes so far. Israel says it is striking Hamas targets. But authorities here say medical facilities, schools, and residential areas have been impacted. Our neighbors said that the Israelis had called, and told them to evacuate the area around our home. So we came to stay with relatives here in Al- Shati, Nabeel says. But the next morning, when we woke up to pray at dawn, the air strike was happening. There was no warning. The densely populated Gaza Strip, which has been under Israeli land, sea and air blockade since 2007, is home to more than 2 million people. Around 47 percent of them are children. So far, at least 340,000 people have been displaced within Gaza. Many are now forced to take shelter in U.N.-run schools like this one. But civilians here are also now facing with the Israeli government has described as a complete siege on Gaza. There is no water for us to drink, no water for us to wash yourselves with, so that we can pray, Maram says. They have bombed our schools, many people are killed. It's not fair for children like us. Why is this happening to us? Life under blockade is all that the children Gaza have ever known. For some, like 13 year old Nadine, it is hard to imagine a future beyond this relentless conflict.",

And the human rights watch, former leader, made some very good guidance on how you do that. And if you can't do, it you don't fight. Or you don't shoot. But how realistic is this? LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  It's not realistic at all, Richard. You know, the Israeli forces, their spokespeople, will tell you that they will use the concept of both international law and proportionality, and necessity. And they will define that over and over again, and being a student of many of the conflicts in Israel, they have said that on multiple occasions, they have attempted to do that.

Most of them have probably never been in Gaza. All of them don't understand the increasing complications of an urban battlefield, which they are going to face. During that same period of time, where Israel has not been in Gaza, the Hamas fighters have prepared their positions over a ten-year period of time. They've increased their funnel complexes. They had better sniper positions, they have ambushed positions. The Israeli air force it's already troubled most of the town, which is going to hinder any kind of maneuver and resupply operations.
