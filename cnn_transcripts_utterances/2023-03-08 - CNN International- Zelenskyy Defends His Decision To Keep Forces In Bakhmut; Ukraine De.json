      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead, Ukraine's President doubles down on the need to hold Bakhmut as mercenary say they've seized the entire eastern part of the city.Also ahead, Ukraine vehemently denying any involvement in an attack on the North Stream pipeline last year after report citing new intelligence indicates a pro-Ukrainian group could be to blame. Plus, thousands take to the streets in Georgia's capital Tbilisi clashing over contentious Foreign Agents Bill. More details in just a moment. A bold statement from Russia's Wagner group. The head of the private military company says his fighters are in control of Eastern Bakhmut. The Ukrainian city has been under intense Russian bombardment for months now. The comments came from Yevgeny Prigozhin, who also taunted Ukraine's leaders in a video message and dismiss claims that his forces are taking heavy losses. For its part, Ukraine says its military has killed more than 100 Russian soldiers in just the past day. A spokesman called the Wagner fighters cannon fodder. Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General is not optimistic about the situation predicting Bakhmut could fall in the coming days. Melissa Bell joins us live from Kyiv with the very latest. What do you make of all of these conflicting narratives, Melissa?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly a fairly chilling message from Yevgeny Prigozhin, Max, that you allude to speaking in that video message released today from that World War II tank monument that we saw his men make it to a couple of days ago suggesting they had managed to inch their way from the river and towards the center of the town. And this time, Yevgeny Prigozhin's message couldn't really be more chilling. Of course, he was answering, Max, Ukrainian official claims that essentially Wagner, his group, was finished as a fighting force, given the toll that Bakhmut has taken on them, given also what we've been hearing from Western officials that they're struggling now to find more convicts to recruit.And so he was replying to that defiantly in front of that monument, but also sending a very chilling message to the Ukrainians saying, get the elderly and the children out and send your fittest most able bodied fighting men in so that we can settle this here and now. So a very direct call from Yevgeny Prigozhin to the Ukrainian authorities, saying, come on, then let's see this off here and now. And, of course, in the context Max, as you say, where the whole world waits to see just how much longer Ukrainian forces can hold on to it, how much longer they will decide to spend lives and time and energy doing so. We have been hearing from them these last few days, not just from President Zelenskyy himself speaking to CNN, but from Ukrainian officials saying that they believe that their strategic ambitions here have been entirely fulfilled. And those were twofold, Max. First of all, degrading Russians war -- Russia's war capability. And specifically, of course, given the toll on Wagner that is an important factor, but mostly gaining time for this spring counter offensive that we know that they're preparing. But certainly, the world looks on to the fate of Bakhmut. And this is also part of Yevgeny Prigozhin's message. If it falls, if and when it falls, be careful because it will be the full might of the Russian army coming through. And the world hasn't yet seen that. So a very chilling message from Yevgeny Prigozhin even as his men look poised to inch their way closer to the town center, Max.",

But President Zelenskyy in the interview with me, he made it clear that for Ukraine, this is very tactical.If the Ukrainians lose Bakhmut, he said, that opens the door for the Russians to move into other very sensitive areas in eastern Ukraine, and gives them the momentum to take over huge areas. That's why it's so important. President Zelenskyy said, it's so important to maintain Ukrainian control over Bakhmut and that's why they're fighting as hard as they are. And he has no inclination at all to give up and withdraw, as some are suggesting why risk Ukrainian soldiers' lives in an area that you're going to lose anyhow. He doesn't believe they're going to lose it. And that's why he's determined to fight on in Bakhmut.",

He said that was not only important is showing the world that the United States stands with Ukraine. But it was important to show the people of Ukraine, that the United States of America is with Ukraine right now. And that was so important.And he got personal in the -- towards the end of the interview, saying it was even so important for his own children, to see the President of the United States there, walk the streets of Kyiv. Even as those sirens were going off, and we all saw that video. It was so important. He was also very, very sensitive to what's going on here in Washington, with some Republicans suggesting they should -- the U.S. should not give a, quote, blank check to Ukraine. He says he's met with Republican delegations that have come to Ukraine. He formally invited the new Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives Kevin McCarthy. In the interview with me, he invited him to come to Ukraine to see for himself what's going on. Kevin McCarthy, answering questions from our own Manu Raju declined that invitation say there's really no need for him to go. And he criticized President Biden for being slow in providing weapons to Ukraine. On that issue, by the way, President Zelenskyy made it clear that for Ukraine to win, the U.S. says to start providing fighter jets to Ukraine. That will open the door for other NATO allies, other countries providing fighter jets to Ukraine. That would be so significant in -- President Zelenskyy said -- in Ukraine is winning this war. He also wants a longer-range missiles. He said he doesn't need those missiles to attack Russia. He needs those missiles to protect the people of Ukraine who are being slaughtered right now. So he was very sensitive on that issue as well.",

      "sentences": "Yes. There have been more demonstrations called today. And I know we just showed those images. And I want to play some of them again, because it just shows you the passion and the anger against this bill on the streets of Georgia today.And why is that? Why is there so much anger about this bill? Well, rights groups believe that it's going to weaken civil society in media, essentially, make it more difficult to be an independent NGO, to be an independent journalist. These very critical checks and balance systems that exist outside the government. Rights groups say it will be harder to do that work, because that bill requires that if you receive 20 percent, or more funding, foreign funding that you have to register with the government. Now how does that play out? Well, the United States, the U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi actually calls it a Kremlin-like bill. They say it gives the government oversight to these independent agencies, that is not necessary and could again, are road the power of civil societies. And there's another important thing to note here. When Russia invaded Ukraine last year, Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia all applied for E.U. membership. Quite quickly after that membership, that pathway to joining the E.U. couldn't be threatened by this bill, because E.U. officials say again, that it could be a violation of E.U. rules, that this could again suppress civil society, suppress that independent media within Georgia. So much so the anger is. But George's own president sided with the protesters. I want you to take a listen to what she said.

And the impact of this many fear, is that Georgia rights groups say is being used sort of as a way to circumvent Russian sanctions, to continue to allow the Kremlin to impose its influence in that part in the eastern part of Europe against E.U. movements.
