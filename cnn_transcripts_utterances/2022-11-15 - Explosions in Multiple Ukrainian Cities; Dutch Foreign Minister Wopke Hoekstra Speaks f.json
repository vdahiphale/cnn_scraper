This is what Russia is doing. They are going back to striking the infrastructure and killing innocent civilians. A Dutch member of parliament, a foreign minister who is in Kyiv, taking shelter during the missiles said, look, you have to look at what Russia is doing, not what Russia is saying. Russia had been going through a sort of pause in targeting Ukraine's electricity infrastructure. But we hear from regions in the north and other areas in the very east of the country, strikes on infrastructure facilities -- two strikes in Kyiv as well as -- and Kryvyi Rih was targeted, air defense systems firing off. Lviv, in the very west of the country, so the sirens were quite literally going off all across the country. A large barrage, at least two waves of missile firing, potentially more strikes, in the air as we speak. The message for citizens is to stay in shelter. It is, of course, deeply concerning for the Ukrainian government. There are strikes that Russia has targeted on the critical infrastructure, taking the power infrastructure has brought the network to a very crippled condition whereby there have been a lot of power blackouts. Now the situation from that will appear set to get worse. That is the concern. And a real possibility that if Russia was pausing while its politicians, foreign minister was at the G20 in Bali, where its intelligence officials were meeting with U.S. intelligence officials in Turkiye just recently, to perhaps see what might be available on the negotiating table after that pullback from Kherson, it appears that Russia has now gone back to doubling down on targeting critical infrastructure, ahead of very cold temperatures this winter.",

Meanwhile, the -- Vladimir Putin's stand-in in Bali, the foreign minister of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, he basically accused the West of starting what he describes as a hybrid war in Ukraine and denounced Zelenskyy's speech at the G20, saying it was militaristic, aggressive and Russophobic. So I think walking out of here, the U.S. President, Joe Biden, wants to assemble a bigger chorus of voices to condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The idea behind that was they did not want to announce that withdrawal prior to the midterms, before Americans had voted, because they did not want to give the Democrats and Joe Biden any potential boosts. Of course, that kind of misunderstands what is on American voters' minds, right? And what they are actually voting for. There is not a lot of evidence that they would have cared all that much or even noticed the Russian retreat from this very important strategic southern city of Kherson.

They dothis often and Shireen Abu Akleh, the iconic Palestinian American journalist, was an American citizen. But it would be unusual, many experts say, for the FBI to investigate the activities of essentially what is an ally's military, which is essentially what they would be doing if they looked into Shireen Abu Akleh's death. And this comes after a major push by members of the U.S. Congress for the FBI to investigate her death. This is also something her family has long been calling for. Now what happened was, initially, the Israeli media reported that U.S. officials had informed Israeli officials, that they might be asking for materials related to the Shireen Abu Akleh incident. And then the defense minister, Benny Gantz essentially tweeted, confirming the reports, saying it will be a mistake for this American investigation and, saying, I am quoting here, \"We will not cooperate with an external investigation. I will not enable intervention into internal investigations.\" Now keep in mind, with this tweet from the Israeli defense minister, he is most likely the outgoing defense minister, because there have been elections. Benjamin Netanyahu is likely the incumbent prime minister. And most likely, Benny Gantz will not be staying on as defense minister. So the tone might change here. Now the Department of Justice in the United States has declined to comment on this. But if this is happening, it would essentially be the second American investigation into the death of Shireen Abu Akleh. The U.S. State Department investigation a few months ago, that included a ballistic examination of the bullet that killed Shireen Abu Akleh, it found they could not conclude definitively, based off of the bullet, how she was killed. They did come to the conclusion, the same one that media investigations, including CNN, has come to, that she most likely killed by the Israeli military fire. Now the IDF, after initially suggesting she might have been killed by Palestinian militant gunfire, had also come to the same conclusion after several months on the investigation. While they could not be certain, they also admitted it most likely was an Israeli soldier who killed Shireen Abu Akleh. The question is, if the second FBI investigation continues, what will come out of it if they come to the same conclusion? Will they then suggest they want to bring charges against an Israeli military personnel of a U.S. ally? Now as for the family of Shireen Abu Akleh, they say they have long been calling for this and they are encouraged by this news. Lynda.",

      "sentences": "Well, here the local authorities say they have, so far, at least an hour ago, said they believethey have seen off the missile attacks aimed at this area. And we have heard what sounded like impacts since then. There have been, according to Ukrainian authorities, attacks throughout the country, as far north as Kyiv, up even further north in Sumy and all the way southbound to Mykolaiv, west to Lviv. And Kharkiv has also been seeing a number of attacks. There have been at least two residential buildings hit in the capital of Kyiv and a large number of electrical supply areas and electrical infrastructure has been targeted by what the Ukrainian government says are about 100 cruise missile or similar attacks across the country. We have seen this before, back in October. It is almost on the same scale, a very large scale, widespread attempt to try to knock out the abilities of the Ukrainians to give electricity to their population, to keep the population warm during winter and also because it depends on electricity to pump water around the country. So it is a very significant counter attack, after the loss of Kherson, the regional capital, that the Russians evacuated in the last couple of weeks, the last week or so. And that is, of course, because it's been a major strategic blow to the Russians, both in terms of the military structure, also in terms of the political strategy. They have been weakened; there's been a great deal of criticism inside Russia for that Russian withdrawal, Lynda.",

The White House worked really hard to say that is absolutely not the administration's position and reinforced the Ukrainians' sense they are going to continue to get a supply of this sophisticated weaponry, that have been so important in their prosecution of this war, to not back the Russian invasion. But the message coming from the Ukrainian president at the G20, what he calls the G19, and his government here in country, is there's no prospect whatsoever of any negotiation until every Russian soldier has left the soil of the country and every exiled and abducted, in their words, Ukrainian, is returned. Many thousands of Ukrainians have disappeared into the landscape, into Russia, Lynda.",

MADOWO (voice-over):  In 2017, when Kazumi was 15 years old, he developed a carbon capture device called Hiyassy. KAZUMI (voice-over):  There are so many CO2 collecting machines in the world. But most of them are so huge. MADOWO (voice-over):  The small, carryon size device was created for at home or in office use so that everyone can help stop global warming. KAZUMI (voice-over):  By only pushing a button, you can remove carbon dioxide from the air easily. MADOWO (voice-over):  According to Kazumi, his device absorbs about the same amount of CO2 as 15 cedar trees and can capture about 5 kilograms per year when used continuously. While most of his work happens in the lab, he is always eager to get out on the water, where he says he will soon be testing the fuel he has created from captured carbon. KAZUMI (voice-over):  We are about to generate fuels for cars and ships and also trains and airplanes and rockets and so on. Our ship will use our new fuel in six months or so. MADOWO (voice-over):  The island nation is targeting net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the maritime industry by 2050. And Kazumi is on board to help make this happen. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
