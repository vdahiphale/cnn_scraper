Peru's government declared a state of emergency Wednesday, hoping to end violent protests over Castillo's impeachment and arrest. CNN's Rafael Romo reports now on the international tourists caught up in this political turmoil and violence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): International flights are operating normally in and out of the International Airport in Lima, Peru's capital. Even though multiple regions across the country are still in turmoil and some regional airports remain closed, this means many international tourists are stuck without a connecting flight to the capital and must stay in Peru for now. The government declared Wednesday a state of emergency that will be in effect for 30 days. Defense Minister Alberto Otarola said the National Police and armed forces are responding to acts of vandalism, violence and seizure of roads. Peru's national police had confirmed earlier that at least 14 highways across the country had been blocked by protesters demanding the immediate return to power of former President Pedro Castillo. As you may remember, Castillo was impeached and arrested on December 7th, after he announced plans to dissolve Congress and install an emergency government. He was apparently trying to get ahead of a congressional vote on his impeachment. Castillo is accused of conspiracy and rebellion. He denies those allegations. He was supposed to appear in court Wednesday for a hearing to determine whether he remains in jail but the hearing was postponed. Some of his supporters say he's a political prisoner. Dina Boluarte who was Castillo's vice president and succeeded him after his impeachment said Wednesday that it is technically possible to call for new elections by the end of next year. Even though Peruvians are not scheduled to go to the polls until 2026. Boluarte is Peru's 6th president in less than five years. Peru's health minister informed Wednesday that at least seven people have died in the ongoing protests and an additional 47 have been injured in the turmoil. Rafael Romo, CNN, Atlanta.

It's believed hundreds or maybe thousands of migrant workers died during construction products -- projects rather, in the run up to the World Cup. We now know what causes sudden death of American soccer reporter Grant Wahl in Qatar. His widow Dr. Celine Gounder says the autopsy revealed he died of a ruptured aortic aneurysm. She said it had likely been growing slowly for years undetected, and that no amount of CPR or shocks would have saved him. Wahl collapsed while covering the Argentine Netherlands quarterfinal on Friday. He was 49 years old. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. CELINE GOUNDER, WIDOW OF GRANT WAHL: Aorta, that's the big blood vessel that comes out of your heart, sort of the trunk of all the blood vessels. And an aneurysm is a ballooning of the blood vessel wall. And so, it's weak. And it's just one of these things that had been likely brewing for years.

SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's so sad. I mean, what Dr. Gounder was describing, thankfully, is rare, but can be catastrophic if it occurs. Let me show you this image first of all, if you look at the left side of the screen, that is a normal heart. And you see a large blood vessel right in the middle there called the aorta that is leaving the heart. That's what it should look like. On the right side of the screen, you see what happens when you develop an aneurysm where the walls weaken, and it starts to balloon out that unfortunately can -- the walls can become so weak that there can be a rupture, or significant bleeding. Let me show you quickly on this model here as well. Again, the heart, this is the pumping ventricle, the left ventricle and it pumps blood into the aorta, which is over here. And it's this aorta here which can sort of balloon out and potentially cause problems, bleeding that can occur into the chest and a lot of bleeding because this is the largest blood vessel really in the body. Types of symptoms that people might have. They can be pretty vague. Back Pain, cough, weak voice even just as the aneurysm expands, it can push on your lungs and your trachea, shortness of breath and pain in the chest. You may remember Grant Wahl said he thought he had bronchitis, he thought he had these chest like symptoms. Again, it's rare, especially the aneurysm that occurs in this part of the aorta. If you look at the overall numbers back in 2019, there were about 9900, close to 10,000 deaths. But that's aneurysms that occur at any point along the aorta, most of them in men, 59 percent in men. The things like smoking do increase the risk. People have a family history might get screened for something like this. But in the United States, there's not widespread screening, so there's a good chance that Grant Wahl didn't even know, 49 years old. I will just add one more thing. John Ritter, people may remember that name. But he had the same problem. This is what led to his death back in 2003. People thought it was a heart attack initially, but in fact, John Ritter died of the same problem that Grant Wahl did. John Ritter was 54 at the time. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

U.S. made the proposal last month in response to the ongoing crackdown and execution of anti-protesters by Tehran.The protests in Iran was sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini who was in the custody of the so called morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. Iran called it illegal and the ambassador charged it was built on baseless claims and fabricated arguments. The Bank of England expected to raise interest rates for the 9th straight time in the day ahead. Policymakers are trying to fight off a recession and deal with inflation as well. They got some good news Wednesday on that, inflation easing a little to 10.7 percent in November. Most economists expect half a percent interest rate increase, central bank voted in early November to hike rates by three quarters of a percent, the biggest hike in more than 30 years. The U.S. Fed increased interest rates Wednesday by half a point, notably lower than recent rate hikes of three quarters of one percent. But the central bank warns, even though inflation has started to cool, now, it's seven percent, it remains too high and well above the bank's official target of two percent. And so, rates will likely continue to rise well into next year. CNN's Matt Egan has our report. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATT EGAN, CNN REPORTER (on camera): The Fed is still pumping this economy with tough medicine aimed at trying to get inflation under control. It's just lowering the dosage a bit. And that is an acknowledgement of the fact that inflation has cooled off in recent months that the feds medicine is working. But the Fed's statement, though, reiterated that inflation remains \"elevated\". That is an acknowledgment that more work needs to get done here. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, he said during the press conference that they're going to see more concrete evidence that inflation really is cooling off before they gain confidence that things are going back on a downward path. So, no victory laps here at the Fed. And I think that makes sense. I mean, seven percent inflation, of course, is better than the nine percent inflation in the U.S. economy earlier this year. But it's still seven percent inflation, that is still triple the Fed's goal. And so, that does mean that we're going to see an all-likelihood higher interest rates next year and the Fed officials they're penciling in about 75 basis points of rate hikes for 2023. That means higher borrowing costs. Remember, mortgage rates recently hit a 20-year high, credit card rates are at record highs, they could go even higher as the Fed continues to raise interest rates. And this also means more downward pressure on the economy. Now, on that front, Fed officials, they downgraded their view on the economy for 2023. They now see near zero GDP growth in 2023. They also bumped up their forecast for inflation. And they see the unemployment rate going from a historically low level today of 3.7 percent up to 4.6 percent next year. Now, that is not high overall but it does still translate to the loss of roughly 1.6 million jobs. And it's another reminder of the real pain here caused by not just high inflation, but the Fed's war on high inflation. Now, the hope is that inflation will cool off enough in the coming months to allow the Fed to stop raising interest rates before it starts a recession.

And the expectation is it will then start to fall down to 4.1 percent in 2024, but those numbers are not carved in stone. Back in September, the forecast peak for interest rates was 4.6 percent. And what is truly head spinning in all of this is 12 months ago, short term rates were what? Zero and then at 4.5 percent more, getting to five percent next year. You know, in medical terms, this is like being hit with a defibrillator over and over again, it's not pleasant. PATEL: Well, they had to get ahead of it.

But what's really driving this John, which is we know, they're saying its 75 basis points and that's why I think it's the minimum is because job unemployment number is not where they want it to be.

Are they going to -- they're taking a step to looking the economy going, are we really back? They're questioning is inflation actually still going down? Even though we've seen the last two months to do that, they're not going to really give in real easily. And I think that's the news that I'm reading that hey, there's something more here that they're seeing as well and they're not willing to take the gas off the pedal right now or anytime soon truthfully, John, until February's meeting, even then we'll see what happens.",

And more than anything else, this wasn't about, necessarily, countering other countries, particularly China, to some degree Russia, that have made inroads in front of the U.S. over the course of the last several years.

Thankfully, they're finally catching a break through the overnight hours.But 49 reports of tornadoes across the South, and that number likely to go up as the sun begins to rise over the United States. Twenty-six damaging wind reports and six hail reports across the Southeast. There's that line. Still holding onto strong thunderstorms around the Gulf of Mexico, pushing into the Panhandle of Florida this morning. If we get any more isolated tornadoes, which that threat still exists, it would be along the Panhandle of Florida and into parts of Alabama and South Georgia. That line itself takes its track farther East, right on up into Florida and into the Carolinas Wednesday into Thursday, which is why we're seeing these areas highlighted in yellow. Still holding onto that isolated tornado risk, although it is significantly less than what we've dealt with over the past 24 hours, damaging winds and large hail will become our main concern, on top of the flooding threat that will still exist. Areas highlighted in yellow most vulnerable, from Mobile, Alabama, on up into Knoxville, Tennessee, where we could pick up an additional one to two inches of rain, with isolated higher amounts possible. Lake Charles, Louisiana, picked up 2.48 inches of rain. That's a new record as of yesterday. And on the other end of the storm, we were talking about the colder air and the blizzard conditions. That whole system is now tracking East into New England and parts of the mid-Atlantic. Areas highlighted in a darker pink or fuchsia color, if you will, under an ice storm warning, where we could pick up a half an inch of ice. If that's the case, that is crippling. Bare facts. Parts of West Virginia back into the Alleghenies and the Northern parts of the Appalachians, or central Appalachians, rather, dealing with this heavy icing coming into the next 48 hours -- John.",
