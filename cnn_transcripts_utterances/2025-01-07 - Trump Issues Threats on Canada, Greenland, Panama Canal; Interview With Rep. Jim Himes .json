That's been there for a while. Donald Trump thinks, if I want it to be, it shall be. It's just a fascinating glimpse at his mind-set. And in 13 days, he becomes president of the United States again, and we will watch how much -- again, she knows better than anybody at this table, a lot of what he says is for negotiating purposes and plus purposes to get some percentage of what he really says is what he wants.

The inauguration is only 13 days away. And remembering the legacy of Jimmy Carter. The state funeral for our 39th president is this afternoon, honoring a man who knew how to -- quote -- \"translate faith into action.\" And a stunning announcement from the parent company of Facebook and Instagram -- Meta, I should say. Meta says fact-checkers are out, a move that CEO Mark Zuckerberg admits will lead to more harmful content on the platforms. We are following these major developing stories and many more all coming in right here to CNN NEWS CENTRAL. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington with breaking news.

I want to bring in Jeff Zeleny, who is live for us now on West Palm Beach, Florida, right near Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. I think, as a reporter listening to this, Jeff, it certainly stood out to me that Donald Trump would not rule out military force to take control of the Panama Canal and Greenland. But also when it comes to Canada, he had sort of what we thought was seemingly joking before, trying to belittle Justin Trudeau, saying Canada is the 51st state, but he seemed pretty serious in wanting to annex it and make it part of the U.S.",

It's a Danish territory and it's not for the U.S.' to have. That does not necessarily mean that he could not build an argument for that, as well as send a message to other world leaders that Donald Trump is on the verge of being back. Of course, his first term in office, Pamela, as you well remember, we covered his first presidency. He made a hallmark out of trying to keep other foreign leaders off- balance, if you will. And on that vein, he talked about a NATO, talking about once again demanding and urging fellow NATO members to contribute more of their GDP. He also said if the hostages are not out in Gaza by the time he takes office, he said all hell will break out, so certainly a variety of headlines there in the first news conference of the year from the president-elect. But, Pamela, the question is, as he comes back, his legislative agenda, at the very end, he said he does not necessarily have a preference over one bill or a variety of bills for his agenda. That is a central question. How does he enact all of these policies into action? But there is no doubt he has a lot in his mind just 13 days before taking office -- Pamela.",

The president-elect's attorneys, along with the attorneys for his two co-defendants in the classified documents case, wanted it blocked, calling it a one-sided argument. And this decision could be appealed to the Supreme Court. But for the next several days, Judge Cannon says it cannot even be transmitted outside of the Department of Justice.

It's been dismissed. Now, the Justice Department said they could release it publicly as early as Friday at the attorney general's decision if he wants to do that. And so Trump's team, the co-defendants in the classified documents case, he has two of them who work for him also accused of obstruction of justice. They also are facing the dismissal of this case, but ongoing appeals. They are going to court and saying, we don't want any of this to become public because it could hurt us. And so Judge Cannon said, yes, let's look at the appeals court here. You have asked them as well to block the release of this. I'm going to say now, today, no one who gets this report in the Department of Justice, who has it with special counsel Smith's office, their officers, agents, employees, no one can share it outside of the Justice Department. And once the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals makes the decision here on what to do, if they too want to block the release of it, there's going to be a three-day window where nothing can be done. And so we're in this moment where things are running out of time.

All that she has said, as Katelyn Polantz just pointed out, is, everything's on hold until the Court of Appeals can rule on this. Now, it is a surprise that there's even a challenge to the issuance of the special counsel report, because previously it's been undisputed. These special counsel regulations -- we saw it with Robert Mueller, we saw it with Robert Hur -- say unambiguously that at the end of the special counsel's investigation he has to issue a report. Now, these lawyers are making really an unprecedented argument that that special counsel report should be blocked, should be held back because, as Katelyn just laid out, two of the defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, they still have theoretically live cases. And they're arguing this would be prejudicial to us to have DOJ release a probably several-hundred-page report laying out our conduct.",

They're going to argue in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals that we, DOJ, should be allowed, we have to actually, under the regulations, issue a special counsel report.Let me give you one other idea, Pam, to watch. Jack Smith, if he runs into trouble here, if the classified documents report down in Florida continues to be stuck and held up in the courts, he has an option strategically where he can actually separate his report into two separate volumes. He can say, OK, fine. Now I have got two different documents. The one in Florida is being held up then it's going through litigation, Court of Appeals. But, separately, I'm going to create a separate document that's going to be the January 6 special report at a D.C. And that is going to be harder for Donald Trump or anyone else to challenge, because those two co-defendants, Nauta and De Oliveira, they're not co-defendants in the January 6 case. So look for Jack Smith if he runs into too much of a roadblock in Florida to maybe break these into two and at least try to release the January 6 report in D.C.",

I mean, we say that quite a bit, but, in fact, during the argument that was just happening in New York, one of the judges asked Todd Blanche, Donald Trump's lawyer, do you have anything like this that you can point to before? And Todd Blanche said candidly, no, this is brand-new territory. Now, here's the argument Trump is making in the hush money case. And, again, as you said, Judge Merchan had said, I'm going to sentence you on Friday, three days from today. Donald Trump made an argument yesterday to Judge Merchan. He said, well, hang on, I'm appealing this case based on immunity. Now, Judge Merchan has rejected the immunity argument, but Trump is appealing it. What Trump is arguing Trump's lawyers is that, while that immunity appeal is going on, everything has to stop at the trial court. Everything has to be put on pause, including the sentencing. Now, Judge Merchan disagreed yesterday. He said, no, if there was a trial, I would have to stop that, but we're already done with trial. All that's left is, as you said, Pam, this probably brief Zoom sentencing, where I'm not going to give you prison in all likelihood. And I'm not blocked from doing that. So Trump lost there. So now he's at the next level up. Now he is arguing as we speak in the New York appeals court saying, I need you to step in and block Friday's sentencing.",

And there is a criticism, which I accept and take on board, which is that the Democratic Party got too far away from the kitchen table issues of the American people. People felt that chicken was too expensive. The rent was too damn high.

Like, where does this come from? And how does this in any way, shape, or form address the economic concerns and economic issues of an awful lot of people who voted for this man? That's thing one.
