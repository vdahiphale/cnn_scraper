There has been more interest in this legislation than there was in previous efforts.

      "sentences": "And thank you for joining us for this briefing. The Arlington County Police Department and our partner agenciescontinue to investigate a home explosion at 8:44 north Burlington Street. Yesterday, at approximately 4:45 in the afternoon, the Orange County Police Department was dispatched to the 800th block of north Burlington Street for the report of a possible shots fired incident. On scene investigation revealed that a male suspect this charged a flare-type gun from the residence more than 30 times. Officers attempted to engage with the suspect without success. A search warrant was ultimately obtained to allow our officers to secure any weapons, to ensure there would be no ongoing threat to the community. Members of the Emergency Response Team initially attempted to execute the warrant through various forms of communications with the suspect. However, this was not successful. In an effort to establish communications, ERT breached the front door to allow for communications and possibly surrender. At this point, officers experienced what is believed to be multiple gunshots from a firearm coming from within the dwelling. Despite the ongoing threat to themselves, ACPD staff continued to try to engage with the suspect to safely bring him into custody. As the suspect began discharging several rounds from a suspected firearm inside the house, officers could not locate the source of the suspected gunfire or its intended target. Officers began to deploy non-flammable, less-lethal chemical munitions to multiple areas within the residents where the suspect was believed to be hiding. The purpose of this type of deployment is to cause irritation in hopes of compelling the suspect to surrender. Based on the preliminary investigation of this incident, we believe that the resident of the home, James Yoo, 56, of Arlington, is the involved suspect. The Orange County Police Department does not have prior documented interactions with the suspect at this address other than two calls for service for loud noise over the past couple of years. We are aware of concerning social media posts allegedly made by the suspect. These will be reviewed as part of the ongoing criminal investigation. The suspect was inside the residence at the time of the explosion and he is presumed at this point to be deceased. Human remains have been located at the scene and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner will work to positively identify the individual and determine the cause and manner of death. Our investigation has now transferred into a recovery operation, as we work to collect all available evidence. There is no ongoing threat to the community related to this incident and no outstanding suspects. The suspect's residence was a duplex, and the other residents were evacuated prior to the explosion occurring. Thankfully, there were no serious injuries to any officers, other public safety officials or community members. I can assure you that this incident will be thoroughly investigated. At this point, the primary investigating agencies are the Northern Virginia Critical Incident Response Team and the Arlington County Fire Department's Fire Marshals Office. The investigative team also includes members of the Federal Bureau of Investigations and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. We will continue to work this incident in collaboration and coordination with our federal partners. I would like to thank the Arlington community for their support during this time and patience as we complete what will be an extensive and time-consuming investigation. I also want to express how proud I am of the members of the police department and all of our public safety partners for their courageous and professional actions to ensure the safety of our community. Thank you for being here.",

Aaron Miller, deputy county manager for public safety for Arlington County.I want to echo what Chief Penn and Chief Povlitz mentioned, appreciation for the entire public safety family, from our 9-1-1 team all the way through to the police officers, our paramedics, our firefighters, our emergency management staff and all those within the community that have lent a hand to respond to this critical incident. I particularly want to say thank you to our federal partners, as they continue to walk hand-in-hand with us and provide resources where necessary. There are about 10 households that were impacted by this incident. Those 10 households, we have been providing direct support to them. We have been in contact with all of them. And that ranges from helping to provide them some housing and sheltering and also providing some basic needs, toiletries, other necessities. We're going to continue to do that. We've set up a reception center. We've reached out individually to all of those households that have been affected. We'll have that reception center open for them today as well as tomorrow to continue to provide those services. Included with that is mental health counseling services that we are making available, some mental health counseling. We're also providing referrals to some of our nonprofit community based partners, including the Red Cross, Salvation Army and others as necessary. I do want to say that, as the chiefs both mentioned, this is going to be a prolonged and I think a little contracted incident. We've received resources requests from the Emergency Management Department to assist with debris cleanup, to assist in the investigation, things like that. As we continue to gather those resources, we will ask for the communities' patience as the surrounding area will remain closed for the foreseeable future. And we appreciate everybody's consideration of that.",

I'm the assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.I would like to thank Chief Penn and the Arlington County Police Department and Arlington County Fire Department for the opportunity to be here and for the opportunity to collaborate alongside our other federal partners in this very important investigation. The FBI is assisting in coordinating with our Arlington County and our federal partners on this investigation into how this house explosion occurred and the individual who caused it. We continue to provide resources to help confirm that this was an isolated incident and that there is no ongoing threat to this community or to other communities. When the incident occurred last night, the FBI sent special agent bomb technicians along with other federal partners as well as investigative agents to help support our law enforcement partners here in the local community and to assess the scene and provide technical support. The individual Chief Penn referenced had previously communicated with the FBI via phone calls, online tips and letters over a number of years. I would characterize these communications as primarily complaints about alleged frauds he believed were perpetrated against him. The information contained therein and the nature of those communications did not lead to opening any FBI investigations. Again, I'd like to thank all of our law enforcement and public safety partners and appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this investigation. Thank you.",

He was going to be one of their final witnesses. Now Trump's attorneys saying they're not calling him because they're moving to shorten the case. What that means, there will be no court tomorrow. On Thursday, there will be an accounting expert, an NYU professor who will be testifying. We also understand that former President Donald Trump will be in attendance on Thursday -- that was the plan as of yesterday -- to listen to the testimony. He then will testify as the final witness and the defense. That will be on Monday. And that testimony is expected to go all day. Trump's attorney did ask the judge to postpone Trump's testimony until the appeals court could hear arguments and rule on their efforts to lift this gag order. The judge shut that down, saying, absolutely not, no way, no how, that's a nonstarter, he will testify Monday, and that's that. Right now, court has resumed with one of the expert witnesses that the Trump team has called to the stand to talk about valuations of these properties. That is expected to wrap up this afternoon and then we are going into the shortened schedule. As this case nears the finish line -- we are in the tenth week of this civil fraud trial -- next week, after Trump's testimony, the attorney general's team says they will have one rebuttal witness who will be very short and then the case will be over. The judge said he will rule on this, though, not until early next, year -- Brianna?",
