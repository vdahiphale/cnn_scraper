You saw the president pretty peeved as he was pushing back on the suggestions that he has memory problems, recall lapses. And the issue, though, is not just that they think some of these details are gratuitous and unflattering. It is that they speak to a broader concern that voters have raised about his mental acuity and about the fact that they simply see him as too old to be president. The lawyers in this report yesterday that came out said that these references to his memory problems were inappropriate, and we had a White House official saying that they thought these references were simply out of line. And they said that when Robert Hur came to the White House back in October -- remember, this was the same weekend that the Israel war broke out, that he said to the president, look, I'm going to be asking a lot of questions from a long time ago. Just try to do your best to recall some of these things from a long time ago, and he even thanked him for doing this multi-hour interview in the middle of an international crisis. And they said, look, of course the president was understandably distracted given everything that was going on that weekend, but that that doesn't speak to a broader sort of memory problem that this report alleges the president has.",

I'm told that he told his advisers he was pleased and that he believed, as many of our legal experts did, that he was poised for a victory in the Supreme Court, something he talked about at that Nevada rally last night. Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Our Supreme Court hopefully will be doing something in terms of helping our country and preserving democracy.

He seized on the opportunity, doing what Donald Trump does, which is blurring the lines. He said that Jack Smith should drop the case against him, that he, Donald Trump, was more cooperative than President Biden, which we obviously know not to be true. In fact, Trump was so uncooperative that the FBI had to issue a search warrant of his Mar-a-Lago home to return some of those documents. But nonetheless, he still went out there saying it was a two-tiered justice system.And the end of the day was him winning his big win in Nevada, a place, a state in which the GOP party has largely become the party of Donald Trump. So yes, it was a good day for the former president who is running again for the White House. Now, the one thing I will point out because I think this is very notable. Donald Trump has spent much of his campaign seizing on the opportunity to call Joe Biden incompetent, to say that he is bumbling. One thing you have not heard from him is mentioning any of the lines about Biden's mental fitness when he's talking about the Robert Hur report. He is leaving that to his allies right now. Unclear if that's going to change, but it is notable given he has campaigned largely on the fact that he is stronger than Joe Biden.",

No, no, first of all, the evidence that they gathered that he knowingly and willfully retained classified information while he was a private citizen, which is necessary, and the special counsel discusses that, is based on such thin evidence. And when you're talking about notebooks versus actually marked classified documents, that's a significant difference, because President Biden as part of his job took copious notes, some of it must have been on classified information, some unclassified. And he understandably believed his notes were his, and they didn't have classified markings on them. That's a big difference.And so what you really need to look at is what marked classified documents did he possess that he knew he possessed and maintained. And the notion that his own credibility or recollection would have anything to do with the evidence, which was plainly insufficient, is a fallacy. And not only that, but you're assuming that the defendant in this case would testify at trial. I was a prosecutor for 10 years. I did not consider the defendant's credibility as a witness. I may have considered the defendant's credibility in explaining the evidence and whether or not it would rise to the level of knowing intent. And so this was extremely gratuitous, unnecessary, and it was just a political potshot in the middle of an election year when the special counsel knows it's two elderly men who are running for president, and this one, who was appointed by Donald Trump, wanted to make sure that he got his licks in.",

That was the day before this interview began. And he demonstrated an unbelievable mastery of this entire region. He had already reached out to a number of different leaders.

That was early mid- December when they got going.And back then, President Biden called the bombing indiscriminate -- Israel's bombing in Gaza, indiscriminate and at that moment, you kind of felt the same thing. Okay, maybe this will make a difference. We know Secretary of State Antony Blinken, when he was here was really doubling down to hear from the Israeli generals in charge who are actually prosecuting the war on the ground to know how they're going to protect civilians in Rafah, the UN is worried. UN officials are saying that there are areas and parts of Gaza that are now close to famine. There are about 300,000 people who already lived in Rafah, there are about a million displaced people living there now as well. It's right on the border with Egypt. The Egyptian foreign minister is saying any push of ground forces into that area could precipitate a situation where the Gazans are trying to get over the fence into Egypt, that would be a different kind of calamity. But right now, we don't know if the IDF is going to go in. The prime minister certainly positioning himself and said that just two days ago that the ground forces are ready to go in.
