And leaving a lot of people wondering, what does the future hold for Manchin? And does it include a run for president?Plus, the maid, the woodworker, the chauffeur and the plumber. Exclusive CNN reporting on who saw what a Mar-a-Logo -- who saw what rather at Mar-a-Lago and how worried should Donald Trump be about what his employees would stand on the stand. And the House is a mess. That's how one senior GOP congressman summed up to the new speaker strategy to avoid a government shutdown. So, what's Mike Johnson going to do with just one week to go until the country can't pay its bills? I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. We begin today with a one-man political earthquake. Joe Manchin, he's shaken up the political world by announcing that he won't seek reelection. Republicans are rejoicing now that they're all but assured to pick up his seat in the Senate, which takes them one step closer to claiming the Senate majority. And there's also this. Manchin fanned Democrats worst fears that he might run for president as an independent next year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. JOE MANCHIN, (D-WV): What I will be doing is traveling the country. And speaking out to see if there's an interest in creating a movement to mobilize the middle and bring Americans together. We need to take back America and not let this divisive hatred further pull us apart. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTERSources tell CNN that Mitch McConnell personally recruited Jim Justice, the popular Republican governor to run for the seat. And meanwhile, Steve James, the head of the Senate GOP campaign arm got former President Donald Trump to endorse Jim Justice. So essentially, they were trying to make it as unattractive as possible for Joe Manchin to run again, at least for Senate. Now, there are still questions about whether Joe Manchin has some higher political ambitions. He has flirted in the past with the idea of running as a third-party candidate for president. It's something he has not rolled out. And the group new labels event that he spoke out in earlier this summer, they're offering potentially a so-called unity ticket in 2024. So, we'll see what Joe Manchin decides to do. But in the short-term, no doubt this is a massive blow for Democrats and their hopes of keeping the majority. Dana?",

I mean, their baby dog, his dog who is at every press conference with him, and they've become part of the culture there.So, this was going to be difficult. But for all the democratic complaining about Joe Manchin over the last several years about his dithering and his deliverance. Now they're going to see what it's like to not have him in the Senate. And that is just the blunt reality of this. Now, all of those races up there on the maps are very interesting. Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown in Montana and Ohio respectively, also have very good brands. So that is going to be a defining story of the next year.

He's been talking about that anybody who's listened to Joe Manchin understands that he is very frustrated with the extremes in both parties, particularly his own.
