Still watching the track, but saying that if, in fact, your county gets an evacuation order, you don't necessarily have to leave the state but seek higher ground and prepare accordingly. This is something, of course, we will continue to follow closely throughout the show, and we'll have much more in just a few moments.But turning to our other top story today and this morning. And starting next hour, two key hearings, two different cities, two major tests for two of Donald Trump's four criminal indictments. At 10:00 a.m. Eastern judges in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., are set to hold dual hearings. And that means that very soon we will all have a much clearer picture of the timing, the evidence and the legal peril that the former president faces ahead. In D.C. January 2nd or April 2026, those are the proposed dates as arguments over when the federal election interference trial should begin. Special counsel Jack Smith and Trump's lawyers preparing to duke it out. And this could get fiery. Last time we had a hearing with this D.C. judge, she told the 2024 candidate that his status as a criminal defendant will take precedent over politics. And in Atlanta it's a crucial litmus test for Georgia's election indictment. Key evidence set to soon be presented as Trump's former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, seeks to move his charges out of state court to federal court. And today's fight will provide the best preview yet that the case district attorney Fani Willis has built against Trump and his 18 accused co-conspirators. Now, Trump not expected to attend either hearing today as his campaign continues to profit off prosecutions. On Saturday his team claimed to have raised $7.1 million since he was booked in Georgia last week. There is obviously a lot to get to this morning. Let's begin this hour in Atlanta with CNN's Katelyn Polantz outside federal court. Katelyn, good morning. What can we expect?",

His team is asking for a trial date in April of 2026. Jack Smith, the special counsel, he has asked for a trial to happen in January of next year. Of course, Judge Tanya Chutkan is the one who's going to make the decision and she's already signaled that she believes that this case and the importance of this case takes precedence over the former president's political campaign, which, of course, is ongoing and it is influencing some of what is happening here.The former president is facing a four-count indictment in this case. It's a narrow case. Much narrower than the one you see down in Georgia where Katelyn is. And that was designed for a reason. He's charged with defrauding the United States, obstructing Congress and, of course, disenfranchising voters in those states where the former president was trying to overturn the election results. Again, the case was designed in a narrow fashion, perhaps to try to get it to trial as soon as possible. We'll hear from Judge Chutkan at this hearing in the next hour and we'll see what patience she has for trying to delay this beyond the election year. Of course, the former president is going to be making the -- his legal team is going to be making the case that they've -- they have so much material to get through that they cannot possibly go to trial in the next year, guys.",

So, he -- the nature of the trial would change a bit. The audience for the trial could change. But the -- should it wind up in federal court, the law, however, it still is Georgia law, it still is the Georgia accusations. So, that would -- there are some advantages. There are some advantages.

Now, if that had been the standard, the judge wouldn't have needed an evidentiary hearing because it was clear, in terms of some of the accusations anyway, timewise he was chief of staff while they were happening. But the fact of this evidentiary hearing means that the judge wants to dig deeper than just you were doing x while you were chief of staff. He wants to know whether the accusations in the Atlanta case are related to - are actually causally related to Meadows' jobs. Under what circumstances does the chief of staff of the United States have a right to involve himself in an electoral situation, Electoral College situation, in a - in a state, or under what circumstances can he - can someone who's obviously being involved in the campaign and not in his traditional U.S. duties, that he's involved in the campaign, that he's not shielded by this law, that he doesn't have a right to access.

The defense is going to throw everything they can in the way to make this thing move as slowly as possible. That is their goal. Being speedy, despite the term we've heard about the speedy trial, is not in their advantage, especially for Donald Trump in D.C. because he wants to get this beyond the election. Whether it's removal, whether it's a severance, whether it's a motion to dismiss, whether it's review and discovery, any tool that they have they are going to pursue, meaning Donald Trump, to move this case out as long as he can.
