      "sentences": "Yes, the number of challenges here for rescue workers Max, just continues to multiply really these aftershocks under any other circumstance had there not had been a 7.8 overnight. You would call them massive earthquakes on their own. So you had the 7.8 which happened after 4 o'clock in the morning.And then just about two and half hours ago or so you had another major aftershock that was a 7.5. And just to put that into context, that is the strongest earthquake stronger even than the last really substantial earthquake in Turkey, which was 1999. That was a 7.4 and that one killed 17,000 people left half a million people homeless. So it just gives you a sense of what we're up against as these rescue workers are battling not only the constant tremors and smaller earthquakes, but also the risk of major aftershocks like this one plus the cold weather plus the snow. I just want to show you a piece of video that we've gotten in not long ago from Malatya this was from the most recent aftershock there. This is a reporter with a Turkish channel called news live on air when it seems like the obvious clearly they realize that there's more shaking, they hear the sounds and then start running. So I'll play the piece of video and then I'll translate what the reporter says watch. The sounds there, Max are absolutely terrifying. They're so the reporter here is saying as we were heading to the rubble to film search and rescue efforts that were two consecutive aftershocks. With a loud noise in the building you're seeing on my left was brought down to earth. There's lots of dust this local resident here he is covered in dust some really terrifying scenes and we also have updates on the number of killed and injured more than 1000 now in Turkey alone who have been killed. According to the authorities, more than 2800 buildings have been demolished have collapsed. So you imagine what happened there. You imagine that each one of these sites that we're seeing the pictures up, multiply that by 2800. And you can imagine what potentially the death toll is going to be here especially since this earthquake, the initial one took place overnight, there are more than 7000 injured but President Erdogan made clear earlier today that they simply don't know how many people may still be trapped underneath of the rubble. Obviously there is aid coming in from around the world, the rescue workers from around the world around the country to try to get there but these things take time. And with these really bitterly cold temperatures, nothing can happen quickly enough given that, of course it would be extremely difficult for someone to survive underneath the rubble, very likely badly injured in these kind of a temperatures, which are right around freezing for significant periods of time, Max.",

These things are readily available in big cities like Gaziantep which by the way has the highest death toll right now.[08:05:00] MCLEAN: More than 200 people killed, there are at least 200 people killed I should say. But one of the concerns is that a lot of this equipment perhaps isn't found as readily available in some of these smaller towns and villages closer to the epicenters where perhaps the search and rescue efforts are much more rudimentary than they are in the big cities. Now, hopefully, a lot of these towns and villages don't have the kind of high rises that we have in some of the bigger cities. But remember, 1999 was a real wake up call for Turkey. And that's when they started to really get smart on building codes and make sure that any new builds were according to sort of earthquake proofing standards. But in the smaller towns and villages where you have older buildings, perhaps not up to the same kind of codes. That's where there's plenty of concern that the death toll could be even higher and we just simply don't know about it yet, because the mobile connectivity out there is not great at the moment, Max.",

There has been a civil war that's literally rattled the country destroyed its infrastructure targeted hospitals and clinics. And you have to remember that the civil conflict is very much playing out here on the ground as this earthquake happens in its aftermath, you have two different authorities. On the ground, you have the regime controlled areas, the government controlled areas. They're receiving help, of course from Damascus, and then you have the rebel held areas in the north like places like Italy, where they're entirely reliant on rebel forces providing help on volunteers like the White Helmets to pull people out from under the rebel. But these volunteers Max, they themselves need help. But one of them made an appeal as White Helmets rescue workers were trying to pull people out of the rubble. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We saw pictures on social media of the dead literally lying on the floor of hospitals bleeding out untreated, because there is no care to give them body bags piling up again, in these clinics. And you heard there again from my colleague, Scott how the international community is already offering help to Turkey, already trying to bring the equipment they need. It will not be the same case for Syria. There is simply not the access there. You have to remember Damascus, that government is sanctioned by the West because of its involvement in this conflict. So there will be no direct line of communication. There will be nobody from the White House picking up the phone and asking President Bashar al-Assad what he needs.

This is a major disaster when you have a country like Turkey that has the capabilities; it has the resources to deal with natural disasters.This is a country that deploys teams, usually, to disaster zones to assist with search and rescue operations. It is now requesting international support to deal with the aftermath of this devastating earthquake, Max. They have declared this a level 4 emergency, which means triggering a request for international assistance. And President Erdogan saying that they have gotten offers from NATO, EU more than 45 countries that are offering support and assistance to deal with this very delicate and very complex search and rescue operation, because if you look at the area that has been impacted. Yes, Gaziantep was the epicenter, but the actual earthquake zone, Max, stretches across a vast amount of territory across Southern Turkey and across the border into Syria, for Turkey itself. I mean, in the early hours, as we started getting the reports of the damage and the destruction that has been caused. We were starting to get information coming from every single one of these provinces in different governor's announcing numbers. And now we've got, of course, the centralized crisis management team is dealing with this. And we're starting to get a better picture about the extent of the damage. But we still don't know how many people are trapped under the rubble. And this is something that President Erdogan also warned saying, look, thousands of buildings have been destroyed. We don't really know how many people are under the rubble right now. And I mean, they're in this race against time, you've got a few hours of daylight left for the search and rescue operations right now. You've got the very challenging weather conditions right now whether it is for the search and rescue with this winter storm, the rain, the snow, freezing temperatures also, people who are trapped outside with no shelter and those under the rubble. And then you also have these terrifying aftershocks one after the other. A very powerful one is 7.5 in the last couple of hours, hitting that area as well.

It's called a slip strike fault. Almost the exact opposite of when I use these blocks last, which was in Sumatra, when the ground went like this, pushed all of that water up into the ocean, and then made that huge tsunami there. This is the area here that slipped, there was 190 kilometers that slipped along this fault line so we talk about the epicenter and we talk about the focus and all that where the middle where it started. But this was a long duration and a long slip. As we talked about how many people were affected by the Anatolian plate, the African plate and right here, the Arabian plate. This is where it slipped right through there and then here up in the mountains, is when it went up a little bit more and causes that up and down motion. Buildings don't like to do this, Max, they don't like their base to go like this and then they have to catch up.

They were awakened with essentially what they said was everything shaking.And actually, that aftershock that happened just a few hours ago in Haifa, which is a Northern city in Israel as people were fleeing buildings because that's how strongly it was felt. So quite a shock for people here who are not necessarily used to earthquakes to feel that aftershock and to feel the initial tremor overnight enough to wake some people up out of their sleep. Although Israeli Authorities are saying that there were no injuries or reports of damage. It seems to have just been some shaking. But we are hearing from the Israelis that they've already been in touch with their Turkish counterparts and that they are planning to send aid. We are hearing that there are going to be two planes, military planes that will be taking off today this afternoon and this evening from a military base. These will be military planes that are capable of landing in adverse environments. Planes that don't necessarily need runways that is in good shape. And they will be providing search and rescue teams, medical aid, and humanitarian aid. And what's also really interesting in this is that is the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also said that they had received a request for assistance from Syria, which of course, does not exactly have the best relationship with Israel, and that they are looking to send that aid to Syria as well. It goes to show you just the levels of devastation here that it sorts of transcends, any sort of politics, people just want to be sending the aid. You know, we're hearing from all sorts of countries from Taiwan to the Netherlands all in between, from the Gulf countries that are all, not only speaking with their Turkish counterparts. But already announcing teams of hundreds of rescuers who are they are planning to send and they're going to need a lot of help, you know, the Israelis aren't just talking about search and rescue teams. But also the sort of humanitarian aid that will be needed to help house and feed and take care of their survivors, as well as psychological help, psychological cycle trauma teams that will be going there to try and help people just kind of comprehend what happened and try and help them sort of like move on to what's next? But also what's the fear for a lot of people in this region are more aftershocks or potentially further earthquakes. You know, here in Jerusalem there's always talk about how it's about time for the next major earthquakes was to happen every 100 years and so. Now of course the focus on is what to do in case that another one comes they're advising people of course, you know, go out to an open area or go into a shielded room of some kind.
