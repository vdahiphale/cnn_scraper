In Pakistan, they are still counting votes after a tense and closely watched election. We're live in Islamabad for you. And reading between the lines, questions from the U.S. Supreme Court Justices suggest that Donald Trump will be on the ballot in Colorado come November. Well, stock markets in New York will open in about 30 minutes from now, and if these futures markets are any indication, we should expect the markets to trade slightly higher, but slightly being the operative word. We start with the Israel-Hamas war this hour and the growing fears over what will happen to more than a million Palestinians in Gaza who have fled South to Rafah. This is what it looks like there today. You can see in these satellite photos, streets literally packed with people with nowhere to go. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says ground troops will enter Rafah soon, and that is prompting blowback from humanitarian groups and notably from the United States, which warned Israel that a ground operation in Rafah without proper planning could trigger a disaster. President Joe Biden also bluntly criticized the Israeli military operation in Gaza, calling it, quote, \"over the top.\" Meantime, ceasefire talks involving Hamas continue in Egypt, despite Prime Minister Netanyahu rejecting Hamas's counter offer to a truce proposal as delusional. Those are the latest headlines for you. Let's break this down. Got a couple of correspondents on this for you. You couldn't be better served. Nic Robertson is in Tel Aviv keeping a keen eye on what is going on in Rafah. Nada Bashir, tonight is in Cairo for you. Nic, the threat of this offensive in Rafah is really worrying people. The United States has said, without proper planning, this could be a disaster. Humanitarian organizations calling what is already a catastrophe on the ground, likely to get so much worse. What do we know now, as you and I speak about Israel's intentions there?",

One end ofthe spectrum, this could be a bluff for those negotiations with Hamas, putting pressure on them. But the indications are, and I think secretary Blinken when he was here, took away that sense as well, because he prioritized speaking with the defense minister, with the chief of military staff, the head of the IDF, with the head of Mossad as well, to impress upon them and communicate United States' concerns and hear their plans for how to deal with the civilians. There are 1.3 million people living close that border. 300,000 there before, a million displaced. Many of them have been displaced several times. Their backs are literally to the border. One humanitarian agency has said, there's a potential for a bloodbath there because they have nowhere else to run, and they have, in many cases, witnessed what the IDF has done down the whole tract of Gaza. The death toll every day, despite the best admonitions, if you will, of the United States, the strongest that we've heard from President Biden. If you go back 2 months talking about, the air strikes there, as not being, properly targeted, it didn't make a difference. The death toll for Gazans remain the same, and this is the concern now about Rafah. All those people, nowhere else to go. A ground operation starts. And what can happen, well, the foreign minister in Egypt has said there could be a potential for people to try to escape across the border, a real catastrophe potential in the waiting.",

There have been rumors, and conversations going on for some time that possibly victory also looks like some of those Hamas leaders being allowed to leave Gaza. And, again, we come back here to the potential pressure for negotiations at the moment. But that's how Prime Minister Netanyahu is outlining it. His military has swept down the country. He says 18 of 24 battalions of Hamas have been destroyed. We don't see the evidence for that. He says 20,000 of their fighters either killed, captured, or injured. We haven't seen the physical evidence for that either. He has said that any loss of soldiers would just be in vain if you stop now before that complete victory. The language that he is using, the emotive language and the position that he's putting forward speaks to his apparent intent that he believes that the military option is the option.",

Counting still in progress, many hours after the polls closed. You'll know from watching this program that the run up to the Thursday vote was marred by outbreaks of deadly violence. And now many analysts say this is among Pakistan's least credible elections. So that's the bigger picture. There's an awful lot of heavy lifting involved in covering the angles on this. Let's get you to CNN Producer, Sophia Saifi, who is live from the Pakistani Capital, Islamabad. Firstly, we are some hours after polling closed.

There were results coming out on television by the incredible local channels who were sharing their research and their results, which was showing, surprisingly, despite what many analysts had said in the lead up to this election, Imran Khan's candidates -- the party Imran Khan's party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, his independent candidates who'd lost their electoral symbol of that very popular cricket bat went speeding ahead of Nawaz Sharif's party who is hoping to become the prime minister for the fourth time. So there were no results coming out from the Election Commission of Pakistan, complete silence. People were getting completely frustrated because there was celebration in the PTI camp because there wasn't really much excitement in the leader because of the crackdown that had taken place against these candidates. Now what's happened since then is at around 5:00 in the morning, we haven't really slept very much. 5:00 in the morning is when the Election Commission of Pakistan finally released a statement 12 hours after polls closed, stating that they're going to have results out shortly. That's when they slowly started trickling in, and it's still trickling in. I mean, we're almost there. A couple of hours still to go. But, again, the PTI independent candidates are slightly ahead of Nawaz Sharif's very fated to win party. So where there is a lot of anger, there's a lot of rage, because what's going on is people are saying that people are not being able to get their results in time. They're accusing the military establishment of rigging. There's already been, accusations of pre poll rigging, that's obviously been denied by the military. But there -- this is very young population, it's a 128 million voters who came out. The Pakistani Ministry of Information kept stressing that this is the fight largest democracy in the country, and it is a very vibrant young country. And these young people are outraged that their vote has not been respected, according to them. So Nawaz Sharif is just pulling in to his constituency in the city of Lahore. He's due to speak at any moment. People are expecting this to be a victory speech, but, again, no final result has come out. This has already been tainted because of the huge delay in results coming out. So this is a nuclear armed country. It's got many issues with regards to the economy, rising inflation, issues with its neighbors, as we know from what we reported earlier a couple of weeks ago with Iran air strikes. This is an important time Pakistan, and we're going to have to wait and see how this is resolved because, there has been a ban on public gatherings in the capital. We're slowly hearing reports of protests. This could snowball into something quite serious. So we're monitoring this very closely and hoping that this is resolved sooner than later. Becky?",

CNN's Oren Liebermann is following this for us from the Pentagon. All right. I spoke to the Iraqi foreign minister at Davos, about 3 or 4 weeks ago. And at the time, we discussed whether or not American troops would be leaving the country. He said that they had opened negotiations to negotiate their departure, as it were. They are negotiating the entire U.S. Iraq relationship going forward at this point. What's the Pentagon saying, firstly, about these strikes?

You saw that in the anger from the Iraqi government, calling this a new aggression that undermines the understandings between the U.S. and Iraq. But the U.S.' position is that they've made clear to Baghdad that retaliatory strikes against, or after the drone strike that killed three U.S. service members would be continuing. So the U.S. is trying to make clear that Iraq had advanced notice that there would be some sort of continued U.S. action potentially in Iraq. But that has done little to alleviate the anger of the Iraqi government. In terms of how these play out, the U.S. is being very cautious with how they view these. As you point out, these are essentially right now discussions to begin further discussions about what the U.S. military presence in Iraq looks like. Now part of the debate is how do these play out and what is the end goal? There is no deadline here for when these could continue, and we've spoken with both experts and former U.S. senior military officials who say these could play out for years, essentially giving enough time, for Iraq to be less angry at the U.S. government. And then they also say that Iraq relies on the U.S. military presence there for some sort of stability. Now part of the debate here, Becky, is what's the end goal here, and are you talking about discussions based on a timeline that say the U.S. has to leave by this date? Or as the U.S. wants, are these discussions based on a certain set of condition: the defeat of ISIS, stability in the Iraqi government, some sort of condition related to Iran's -- the presence of Iran's proxies in the region. These are part of the discussions that will frame the higher military commission. The Pentagon did acknowledge, I will point out, that part of the discussion is how big is the U.S. military footprint in Iraq. Right now, there are some 2,500 U.S. service members in the country.",
