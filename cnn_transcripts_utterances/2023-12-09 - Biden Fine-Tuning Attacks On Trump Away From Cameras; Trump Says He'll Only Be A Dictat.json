The president told a fundraiser in California late last night that Donald Trump would destroy American democracy if he somehow wins back the Oval Office. Biden said to the crowd, quote, \"The greatest threat Trump poses is to our democracy.\" The president went on to slam Trump's role in the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol, saying, quote, \"It's despicable, simply despicable.\" Biden also referred to Trump's comments on FOX earlier this week when the former president was asked whether he wants to become an American dictator. Here is what Trump told FOX. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The greatest threat Trump poses is to our democracy, because if we lost that, we lose everything. And you really are starting to see President Biden really honing his attacks on Trump, fine-tuning his arguments at these fundraisers, these off-camera fundraisers, giving him a chance to sort of test some material, what will be a central argument of his re-election campaign next year. And certainly, there are some Democrats who want President Biden to be more forceful about President Trump, to make this argument publicly. And when you talk to campaign aides, they do say that that moment is coming, that President Biden will begin to sharpen his rhetoric, but they want to wait until they're sure that Americans are paying attention. They don't want this falling on deaf ears. And you can imagine that these arguments will make their way into television ads, digital ads, of course, that will cost a lot of money, and that is why President Biden is out here in Los Angeles this weekend, raising money at two important fundraisers, one last night with some Hollywood heavyweights. You know, I was talking to Jeffrey Katzenberg, he's the co-chair of the Biden campaign, a movie mogul.

So, in that context, it was really heartening to hear President Biden be so direct about what's facing this country. I agree that it is too early to assume that people are paying attention, and we don't want that argument to get normalized, which has been part of the problem the last seven years, almost everything Donald does seems to be normalized, but we've seen what he's done in the past, and I think what he's starting to do now is push the envelope and get people familiar with the concept of his dictatorial tendencies so that they just write it off the way they've written off all of his other egregious anti-democratic behaviors.",

Because you're the dictator at that point. I mean, what do you think? Does he stop on day one?M. TRUMP: Every day from then on will be day one. Let's put it that way. He has no intention of stopping. He knows why he needs to get back into the White House. Those reasons won't disappear on a day two or day 100. So, we have to take this threat incredibly seriously and part of that threat isn't just Donald's rhetoric, it's the reception that rhetoric receives.

What do you think a second Trump term would look like?M. TRUMP: Quite simply, and not at all hyperbolically, it would be the end of American democracy. America would become a leading autocratic nation in the world, and we would be, therefore, emboldening countries like some of those you mentioned earlier, North Korea, China, but also the pro-autocratic tendencies of countries that haven't entirely lost their way, but are well on their way to, like Hungary and Turkey. So it would be absolutely disastrous not just for the future of American democracy, but the future of the Western alliance and global liberal democracies, so I don't think we can overstate just how incredibly dangerous a second Trump administration would be, and we need to start preparing the ground for making those arguments now.",

And the amount of power he has is increasing. [16:10:05] I mean, Jim, if you had told me in December of 2020 that things would be worse now than they were then, or that Donald would have more power now than he had then, I wouldn't have believed you because it was just utterly unthinkable. So look where we are. He uses that kind of rhetoric because he knows it plays with his base, but he also uses it because he doesn't care about other human beings.

The difference now of course it would come with power to enact those kinds of threats. But also, they've learned a lot. And we can't forget that. These people made a dry run for an insurrection. It didn't quite succeed on January 6th, but it's still unfolding. We don't yet know if the attempted insurrection that started on January 6th or, I should say, a few months leading up to January 6th.

He's expected to testify on Monday. He's been sort of repeating the same excuses over and over again, saying that the banks weren't cheated, the banks were very happy with what he's done, and how his businesses are great and so on.

A loss here, despite the serious financial implications, which are, of course, extraordinarily important to him, but a loss would also mean that it has finally been proven, if not to him, at least to many other people, that he is not now and never has been anything he's claimed to be. He's not a business savant, he's not a brilliant entrepreneur, or a phenomenally successful real estate developer.

What -- I mean, what are your thoughts on all of that? I mean, is this -- this is just who he is, this is what he does. M. TRUMP: It's who he is and it's what he does, but we also need to be very clear. The reason he gets away with it and continues to do it is because he's allowed to. Nobody else, nobody else in his position would be allowed to continue attacking people, endangering lives of people, and he has actual power. You know, if an average person on the street was in this kind of legal jeopardy and started attacking court officers, they don't have millions of people hanging on their every word. We have court officers and prosecutors and families getting very serious death threats because of Donald's rhetoric. I mean, at this point, we need to be very concerned about stochastic terrorism, and yet nobody is willing to rein him in. And I believe part of that must be because they want to preserve the case -- sorry, protect the case from his inevitable appeal.

Basically, just saying that she has voluntarily tendered her resignation as president of the University of Pennsylvania. Interesting here, they say that she will remain a tenured faculty member at Penn. And then that statement goes on to say -- in fact, I'll read a portion of it here, directly coming from Magill herself. As she writes, \"It has been my privilege to serve as president of this remarkable institution. It has been an honor to work with our faculty, students, staff, alumni, and community members to advance Penn's vital mission.\" In terms of what Scott Bach, the Penn chair of the Board of Trustees, is saying to CNN in a statement, he says he's also extending gratitude towards Magill for her service to the community. And that in the coming days, that the board will be in touch in terms of what the interim leadership plan will be for this university. And of course, the back story here, for the last, nearly a week, there's been a mounting criticism against the president not just at UPenn but also president of MIT and also at Harvard. It was just yesterday that in the \"Harvard Crimson,\" the president issued an apology in a statement saying, \"Words matter.\" Interesting to see what happens at the other two institutions that have been discussed. But for now, again, we can confirm, per a statement released by UPenn, that the head of the university, President Liz Magill, has voluntarily chosen to step down from her seat.",

This is a release just issued by UPenn a short while ago confirming that the head of that institution, that she will be stepping down from her position.This certainly comes amid that growing criticism that they did not -- that she, along with the heads of two other universities, did not explicitly say calling for genocide of Jews would violate codes of conduct. Since then, in the last few days, we've seen this mounting criticism and asking for her to step down. And now Liz Magill now tendering her resignation to the school board. The board then going on to say that in the coming days, perhaps, an announcement will be made in terms of the interim leadership. But it really is just a remarkable moment here, Jim, as you were saying just before the break, at just how fast this developed and really unraveled, in some cases, and the amount of criticism that we have heard even from state officials. The governor himself in Pennsylvania also really asking for officials to take a closer look, and for her, for Magill to reconsider her position at the university.",
