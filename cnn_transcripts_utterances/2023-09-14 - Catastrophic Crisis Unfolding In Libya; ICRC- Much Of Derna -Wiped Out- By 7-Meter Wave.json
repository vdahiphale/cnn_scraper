We will be speaking with those on the frontlines of aid delivery. But first, these are your headlines this hour. Kim Jong Un has invited Russia's President Vladimir Putin to North Korea. That after the pair held a rare summit in Russia's Far East on Wednesday, very little information as to what was discussed. The death toll in Morocco nears 3,000, as survivors struggle in hard-hit mountain villages. They're getting help but still need more, nearly a week after Friday's devastating earthquake. And in business news, the chipmaker Arm has gone public on the NASDAQ at a valuation of $51 a share. That's a potential market cap of $54 billion. It's the largest IPO since November 2021. Welcome to the second hour of \"Connect the World\". Aid slowly arriving, and pledges of humanitarian aid continue to be made to help Libya. That's after those devastating floods which killed over 6,000 people. Thousands of others are still missing. The United Nations has said that most human casualties could have been avoided had proper emergency management systems been in place. So, tonight, we ask, was Libya sufficiently prepared for this disaster? Well, Ben Wedeman is following the developments from Rome, and is back with us this hour. I think we know the answer to that, Ben. But, give us some context as to what Libya was dealing with before this flood disaster occurred.",

But, there were no orders to evacuate the population. There were no extraordinary measures put in place before the storm hit. Of course, keep in mind that Libya, since 2011, has been in a state of chaos, so to speak, first, during the uprising against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and his downfall, and then as the country split into two competing governments, the East and the West. And therefore, even though this is a country of only about six million people floating on a sea of oil, which in theory could be prosperous and well off, but instead it sort of became the cockpit for regional rivalries with various countries becoming involved. And basically, simple public services were completely ignored. And we heard from today there was a press conference in Geneva involving the head of the World Meteorological Organization who put it this way. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PETTERI TAALAS, SECRETARY-GENERAL, WORLD METEOROLOGICAL ORGANIZATION: Yes. So, that's the conclusion that if there would have been a normally operating meteorological service, they could have issued the warnings, and also the emergency management authorities would have been able to carry out the evacuation of the people, and we could have avoided most of the human casualties. Of course, we cannot fully avoid economic losses. But, we could have also minimized those losses by having proper services in place. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We are going to stay on this story.I want to welcome my next guest who is helping lead the International Rescue Committee's response to the Libya flood disaster. The IRC is issuing an urgent call for international assistance, and notes that in addition to the thousands killed, more than 34,000 people are displaced. Well, Mark Kaye joins us now via Skype from Amman, Jordan. Good to have you with us on this story. Obviously, like, I was just talking with Ben about the numbers, and it really is hard to get a true picture of what has happened. But, what we do know is there is utter devastation. We know that at least 6,000 people have been killed. More than 10,000 people missing. And of course, thousands of people injured, both physically and mentally. Talk to us about those who have survived. They must be very much traumatized. MARK KAYE, INTL. RESCUE COMMITTEE, POLICY ADVOCACY &amp; COMMUNICATIONS DIR.: No, certainly, I mean, I think the satellite pictures you've shown truly speak for themselves. It's the thing of a living nightmare, a wall of water storey's high, cars being thrown around like toys, entire lives, families washed away in in moments. And now, we're seeing I think it's the uncertainty of the unknown, the conflicting numbers of just how many have died? How many are missing? We probably won't know the full extent of this crisis for at least a few days, maybe even a few weeks. It seems that many of the bodies have been effectively washed out to sea. So, there'll be questions as to whether, you know, we will be able to recover everyone who has been lost. The staff at IRC are on the ground. I've experienced this firsthand. We had an office in Shahhat (ph), which is just to the east side -- to the west of Derna, but it was also affected. Fortunately, they're all safe, but many of them had to leave their homes after heavy flooding. Quite rightly, attention is on Derna right now when you see those images, but it's not just Derna that's been affected, as your reporter just mentioned, the topography of this area, lots of Wadis and valleys, hard to reach communities. And there are lots of people in rural hard to reach villages who we don't know to the full extent of what's happened right now.",

You know, I think this is a really clear example of where you have a convergence of climate-related disasters linked to protracted crisis, economic stability, which is the case in Libya, and that's effectively created this lethal cocktail that's left people without the required minimal preparedness, the warnings, limited access to essential services.

And so, you're going to see overcrowding. We're probably going to see, you know, displacement sites. There was already a large displaced population in that East who had been displaced from the conflict beforehand. And we know that when you have crowded people without access to clean water, without access to clean sanitation, that's when these kinds of health outbreaks come out, and they've to be very hard to tackle once they start.

She is the Kurdish woman who was arrested for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. Amini died on September 16 last year while in Police custody, days before her birthday. Her death inspired massive protests, and riots groups say hundreds died in the government crackdown that followed. At least 22,000 people were arrested and seven people were executed. Recently, Iran has increased measures to restrict internet access and to stop a resurgent -- resurgence of that protest movement.

Recent reports from the United Nations show that in order to meet the Paris Agreement climate goals, global carbon removal, weneed to ramp up to 75 million metric tons annually by 2030. At present, less than one million tonnes is being removed. But, in Scotland, one startup has developed a simple carbon capture solution that uses one of the planet's most abundant resources, basalt rock. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BILL WEIR, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over) Over millennia, volcanic rocks have formed some of Scotland's most spectacular sites, stunning coastlines and historic landmarks, remote islands and iconic mountains. But now, they could also provide a solution to the urgent global need to pull carbon out of the sky and lock it underground. JIM MANN, FOUNDER &amp; CEO, UNDO: Rock weathering is a natural process. So, Co2 in our atmosphere combines with water and vapor in our atmosphere, and they will react to form a weak carbonic acid. That reacts with certain types of rocks to remove Co2. WEIR (voice-over): Scottish company UNDO takes that natural process and dramatically accelerates it. By grinding down volcanic rocks like basalt into a fine powder, the surface area increases. So, when the rock dust is spread across agricultural land, there is more contact with rainfall and Co2, and vastly more carbon is captured. XINRAN LIU, HEAD OF SCIENCE &amp; RESEARCH, UNDO: In its powdered form, kind of like in a coffee/tea or in the morning if you're trying to make a brew, you put the coffee beans in and you can leave in hot water for a long time, you're not going to get very potent drink. But, if you crushed down your beans, finally you unlock those reactive surface areas. And then, you can mass -- you can create a very potent brew very quickly.",

WEIR (voice-over): If UNDO is able to achieve those numbers, they would indeed undo a lot of the damage done by global carbon emissions. But, there is a notable benefit for farmers too.

But, what makes it so difficult is the fact that he is going after a foreign wealth fund, and that is not a fund that typically would have to operate under U.S. law. So, he already asked for the head of the Saudi independent wealth fund to come before Congress and testify and was rebuffed. Then, he issued this subpoena for more information, saying \"The Saudi's Public Investment Fund cannot have it both ways. If it wants to engage with the United States commercially, it must be subject to United States laws and oversight.\" Now, of course, there is no telling how this would unfold in court, and you can expect that it would be a very lengthy battle in the courts for there to be any resolution on this matter. It also comes as Blumenthal continues to hold hearings on Capitol Hill. Now, a little bit of background about the Subcommittee that Blumenthal is leading. It traditionally is a bipartisan Subcommittee with broad investigative powers. It also is a Committee that typically works really well with Republicans and Democrats leading it, but this is an issue that has divided some Republicans who view Blumenthal as overstepping the bounds of what is really appropriate in terms of congressional roles in looking through these deals.",

The central bank has now raised borrowing costs at 10 consecutive meetings, and there are signs that the success of rate increases since July last year are constraining economic activity. The Euro down right now against the dollar, almost over half a percentage point, but the European markets have reacted positively to the rate hikes, fears dissipating that it could have been worse. Well, it designs chips for 99 percent of the world's smartphones. And now, British tech company Arm is set to trade on the NASDAQ after pricing its IPO at $51 per share. But, it comes amid high tensions between Beijing and Washington over issues including tech, and the company gets a quarter of its sales from China. Well, Anna Stewart can put this in some wider perspective for us. She joins us now from London, and this is expected to be the biggest IPO offering this year, potentially in a couple of years.

So, we'll be keeping an eye across that these first days on the IPO. It can always be a little bit slow to get going. Now, it's interesting. Now, it's valued itself at the top of the range of the IPO, $51 a share, which essentially means that if all the banks that are involved in this IPO also exercise their right to buy shares, you're looking at a valuation for the company at $54.5 billion. Now, that is considerably less than we were thinking it would be valued at only a month ago, that was about $60 billion to $70 billion, but considerably more than Softbank bought Arm for back in 2016. It bought it for $32 billion. Last year, it tried to sell it to rival Nvidia for $40 billion. So, clearly, it is going to get considerably more than that. Only 10 percent is actually being floated today. So, Softbank are retaining a 90 percent stake, which is pretty large. And about a sixth of the shares we believe are being reserved for some of their biggest clients, including the likes of Apple, Nvidia, Samsung, the Taiwan chip maker TSMC, Intel and so on. So, actually, in some ways, quite a small float considering, and so much attention largely because this is the first big IPO we've had for some time. So, I think a lot of people will just be seeing what the appetite is from investors to see what that means for IPOs going forward.",
