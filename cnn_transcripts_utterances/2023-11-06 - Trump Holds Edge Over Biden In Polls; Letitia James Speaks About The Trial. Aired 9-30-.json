Can Democrats do a better job trying to sell his accomplishments to the American people? Yes. They clearly have not done a good job doing that to date. But there are fundamental problems for him in this poll that don't seem to be true of a generic Democratic candidate. It's late. It's always later than you think. I don't think Democrats should be dismissing this. I don't think most are. But, you know, one of the things you hear the White House say is if Trump wasn't running maybe Biden wouldn't be getting in. [09:35:05] You know, this decision does need to be made soon definitively. And there are signs that Biden is somewhat a drag on the ticket right now. Doesn't mean it can't be turned around. Democrats have a very good special election record. But on issue after issue they're trailing Trump where they really shouldn't be, including on the issue of democracy, by the way, where Biden's only leading him by 3 points.

They're just really looking at the primary right now, which I think is very short sighted. We need to be looking at electability in the general election.And what we have seen so far is, as his legal woes grow, so does his political power with the base, because as Letitia James just said, Donald Trump, as we all know, will come out there today and say this is a witch-hunt, this is judicial prosecution, this overreach by political adversaries. And his base and viewers on conservative television, and in conservative media, that is all they're going to say, time after time after time, and his folks believe that and they believe he is being unjustly charged. They believe he is taking one for the team because he -- if they would go after him, they will go after them. They believe that. And that really solidifies his support with the base. The problem is, that's not true. And independent voters and rational Republicans realize that's not true. They are going to unfold a very serious case of fraud in this case and people are going to take notice and say, we can turn the page. We have other options. We have a strong Republican primary field that is out there campaigning, which should be our nominee moving forward and certainly to take on Joe Biden. And look, I think what David Axelrod is saying about Biden is accurate. There should be some red flags and concerns about his electability in the general election. We heard the same thing from James Carville, the Clinton -- the mind behind the Clinton campaign. He said a month ago that Democrats need to wake the \"f\" up on the risks of Joe Biden in the general election. I think we're going to potentially see some names potentially come in because, you know, Axelrod was clear, Obama's poll numbers were about the same at this point in his re-election, but Obama was 50 and Biden is in his 80s.",

But if he does that today the judge can draw a negative inference.And, Kaitlan, you and I have both covered Trump at the White House. We know this is a test for him to remain composed, concise, and stick to the script that his lawyers would like him to, which is arguing that these valuations were subjective and there were disclaimers in all of them suggesting that banks should do their own due diligence. That's what he should be sticking to on the stand. Then when he walks out of the courtroom, he'll have a sea of cameras and reporters where he can turn campaign mode back on.

Seven Spring, the resort in upstate New York, was again valued neutrally by -- at around $26 million. Trump's people tried to claim it's worth $300 million. So, again, we're not talking about 10 percent, 20 percent. We're talking about ten times, 20 time. And to Kara's point, it's going to be really interesting.

So, while Israel is being attacked, while Ukraine is being attacked, while inflation is eating our country alive, I'm down here, and these are all political opponent attack ads by the Biden administration. Their poll numbers are terrible. You saw what happened today with \"The New York Times\" and CBS came out with a poll that I'm leading all over the place. But it's a very unfair situation. This is really election interference. And so this trial is ridiculous. The numbers are much greater than on the financial statement. And we've already proven that. They said Mar-a-Lago's worth $18 million. Mar-a-Lago's worth anywhere from probably 50 to 100 times more than that. And it's a terrible, terrible thing. These are political operatives that I'm going to be dealing with right now. And you have a racist attorney general who made some terrible statements. And you've just seen some more that came over the wires today. And it's a very sad situation for our country. We shouldn't have this. This is for third-world countries. And, you know, very unfair. It's very unfair. But, in the meantime, the people of the country understand it. They see it. And they don't like it. They don't like it. It's political warfare, as you would call it, or political lawfare, another name that got a lot of news worth. But usually it takes place in third-world countries, in banana republics. And nobody's ever seen that to this extent and we've never seen it here. But we will go along and we will hopefully do very well in every regard and we'll win the election and we'll make America great again. That's what we're going to do, we're going to make America great again. But we have to take it away from the thugs that we deal with and the horrible people that actually must hate our country to do this. But we will - we'll fight very hard for our country.

But let's see what he does when he takes the stand, he sits down, he raises his right hand, like everybody else, and swear to tell the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God. He has to be careful about perjury too, right? That's the other thing that could potentially happen, that he open himself up to, in addition to the fact that Alvin Bragg still has a case, an investigation, a criminal investigation open to these exact same fact. So, the Manhattan D.A.'s office, Alvin Bragg, his team will be watching this as well to see what does he say, what doesn't he say.
