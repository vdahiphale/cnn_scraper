At one point, he said: \"When our allies are stronger, we are stronger, and we rose to the moment.\" And at the end of his remarks, he thanked the Republican speaker of the House and the bipartisan leadership for getting this legislation passed. I want to bring in CNN's Arlette Saenz. She's joining us from the White House. Fred Pleitgen is in Kyiv, Ukraine, for us. Arlette, let me quickly start with you. A huge win for the Biden administration. The president signed off also as part of this bill potentially a TikTok ban. Does his campaign recognize how popular the site is, especially among younger Americans, potential voters out there? Is the Biden campaign right now concerned about this new legislation, potentially could ban TikTok?",

I just want to correct that. It was interesting, I thought, Fred, and I'm sure Ukrainians will be very pleased, when they heard the president of the United States say, this additional military assistance, this military aid for Ukraine, the president said, will start right away. In fact, in the next few hours, the shipments will begin to help the Ukrainian military. What's been the reaction so far to this bipartisan legislation passing the House, now the Senate, and the president of the United States signing it into law?",

He says: \"Putin is failing once again. The United States will not bow to anyone, certainly not to Putin.\" That's direct quotes from the president of the United States, certainly very, very strong warnings to Putin to stop what the Russians have been doing in Ukraine over the past, what, two years now.",

      "sentences": "Yes, absolutely.And I think, for the Ukrainians, it'll be very, very important to have heard that as well. I think one of the things that we have heard -- and I think President Biden also spoke about it as well when he spoke about people actually celebrating in the trenches when they heard about the vote that was going on. We actually spoke to soldiers who were fighting in the trenches on the front lines, and they did confirm that, of course, they were following the news about the vote that was happening in the House, and, of course, they were absolutely thrilled that the vote came through. But I think for them, also, it'll be very important to have heard President Biden condemn Vladimir Putin and say that the U.S. will not bow down. One of the things that we heard from soldiers who are fighting on the front lines is that many of them have felt almost a sense of abandonment over the past couple of months, as they have been running out of shells, as they have been witnessing, of course, what's been going on in Washington, especially in the House of Representatives, the aid not coming through. So, for them, they say what they have heard in the past couple of days, and now, of course, as well is a huge morale boost, Wolf.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, Hersh Goldberg-Polin is a 23-year-old Israeli-American citizen who was taken hostage by Hamas on October 7 while he was attending that Supernova music festival.And on the day of that attack, we actually saw a video of him appearing to be quite seriously injured to part of his hand. In this video that has now been released today, this is the first time that we are seeing him alive in a video since October 7. And in this video, a part of his left arm, including his hand, is missing. It's not clear if it was amputated or simply part of the injuries that he sustained on that date of October 7. But he is alive in this video, and it is the first proof of life that the family has actually seen since he was taken hostage. We don't know exactly when this video was filmed, Wolf, but there are several indicators in what he says in this video that suggests that it was filmed quite recently. He talks about the fact that he has been held for nearly 200 days. This week is when we are marking 200 days since October 7. He also talks about the holidays. We know that we are currently in the Jewish holiday of Passover, although he doesn't say Passover specifically. But the bottom line, Wolf, for his family, at least, who have relentlessly advocated for his release since the beginning of this war, since their son was taken hostage, both in Israel, as well as in the United States, this is the first time that they are able to actually see and hear from their son, which must be incredibly moving, of course, for families who have suffered so much uncertainty. This doesn't, of course, quell all of that uncertainty, but it is the first time that they are able to actually see him since October 7. Now, we need to note the fact that Hamas is releasing this, of course, at a very sensitive time, at a time where we have watched over the last couple of weeks as these negotiations have stalled, at best, and really backslid, according to several accounts, with Hamas offering less than half the number of hostages that they had previously been talking about as the basis for negotiations for months now for a potential six-week cease-fire. And so there's no question that Hamas is releasing this video to have an effect on the Israeli population, to try and influence the state of these negotiations, particularly at a time when the United States is bringing a lot of pressure to bear on Qatar for them to bring more pressure to bear on Hamas. To release this video at this time of an Israeli-American hostage, very notable, of course. We will see what kind of effect it could actually have on those ongoing negotiations -- Wolf.",
