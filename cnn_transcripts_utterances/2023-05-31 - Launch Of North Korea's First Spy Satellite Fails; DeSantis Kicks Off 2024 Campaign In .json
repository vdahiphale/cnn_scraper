Now in the coming hours, U.S. House members will vote on a bill to raise the debt ceiling as well as other measures tacked on to the spending limit.Well, some lawmakers seem confident they'll get the votes to send the bill to the Senate. The House Speaker will be busy trying to wrangle the last-minute support from Republicans who don't like this deal. Some Democrats are also angry about White House concessions. CNN's Melanie Zanona explains it all from Washington. MELANIE ZANONA, CNN CAPITOL HILL REPORTER: Well, the house cleared a key procedural hurdle that will get them one step closer to passing the bipartisan debt deal. The House Rules Committee on Tuesday approved a rule for the bill despite opposition from two hardline conservatives on the panel. So, essentially, this will clear the way for a floor vote. But they still need to pass the actual underlying bill and there has been opposition from both the far left and the far right. So, party leaders have been working furiously behind the scenes to try to sell this deal, to try to whip this deal. House Democrats will huddle on Wednesday morning with their party leadership and White House officials and Republicans huddled behind closed doors on Tuesday evening where we're told that Speaker Kevin McCarthy made a forceful sales pitch for this deal. He touted a number of victories in the bill. And some conservatives did get up and express their concerns with what they view as a watered-down bill that gave away too many concessions to the Democrats. But despite the conservative opposition, Kevin McCarthy is expressing confidence they'll be able to get this over the finish line. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): -- confident we will pass the bill. I've talked to many about whether they are for or against the bill. I'm not sure what in the bill people are concerned about.

It's quite interesting that the Republicans pushed strongly for work requirements as part of welfare. Understandable or reasonable issue that Republicans have fought for for a long time. But what's fascinating is when you actually tally up some of the estimates, it may end up giving out more entitlement benefits, because of some of the compromises that were made.

All of which basically, are the same sorts of missiles or same sorts of rockets that basically would put a satellite into space.The only difference is the launch trajectory for a satellite is different from a warhead. So, it does raise questions about either those tests for those ballistic missiles somehow not leading us to the correct perception of just how effective North Korea's ballistic missiles are. Or somehow, they're trying to do something different with their space launch capabilities from ballistic missiles. So, it does raise some interesting questions about where North Korea's military capabilities are in terms of its long range, missile capabilities. Are they as effective as everyone is thinking they are? If they're not, then that does kind of change the dynamics in terms of how we perceive North Korea as a threat.",

The first of a three-state tour of early voting states going on to New Hampshire in South Carolina. But meeting with Republican voters he made the case that he is the Republican for this moment. He did not make a reference by name at least to former President Donald Trump. But there were thinly veiled messages in his speech.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): Though, the point of all that is when we say that we will do something, it is not fluff. We follow through and we produce results. And so, as President, I pledge to be an energetic executive that will take these important issues head on and deliver results. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But at this point, Governor DeSantis is doing something he has rarely done. He's holding press conferences, which he did Tuesday night here in Iowa. He's also meeting voters individually one on one trying to make the case that he is from a new generation, and he says he has the energy for this job. So, clearly some subtle distinctions there, there are more to come. Jeff Zeleny, CNN Clive Iowa.",

Eight of those fires started on Monday as the region experiences record breaking heat. Now, more than a dozen schools will continue to be close Wednesday. The fires have destroyed or damaged hundreds of buildings and caused huge plumes of smoke to smother the area. Officials hope the weather will be on their side to help with the containment effort. And smoke from those wildfires in Nova Scotia is now impacting parts of the Northeast U.S. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has the latest.",

The white down the south this is all just cloud cover, that's not smoke. But all of this up here that's a little bit grey and tint, that is the smoke that is coming from those Nova Scotia wildfires, from Halifax all the way down to the southern tip. And then, the smoke being blown back into the Northeast, especially Long Island, New York City even in the Philadelphia. And for tomorrow, we push this even farther inland across parts of New Jersey into Pennsylvania.The areas that you see here in orange will be the thickest smoke, you may even be able to smell that smoke. So far this year, in Canada, 6.4 million acres of wildland have burned. On a normal year, if there is such a thing, an average year, about 12 times less than that should have burned by now. Now granted, most of the smoke that we're seeing in the Northeast is from Nova Scotia. And Nova Scotia is only a small percentage, maybe one or 2 percent of those total acres burned. But the high pressure that's centered right there will push that smoke right into the Northeast and that will be our forecast for the next few days. It will eventually get pushed out, but there will be hazy skies, there will be sunsets that are red, sunrises, same story. And there will be dots on our map that are orange, which means unhealthy for sensitive groups, and you may need to stay inside. Keep your local forecast handy where this smoke is going to go, where it's going to blow maybe down into a valley could even get more concentrated. There will be some rain though, not a lot yet until Sunday. But there is rain in the forecast here in Nova Scotia. Probably, a half inch calling for somewhere in the ballpark of about 10 millimeters which doesn't seem like very much. But if you just get those forests that aren't burning, a little damp, all of a sudden, the fire spread is much slower.",
