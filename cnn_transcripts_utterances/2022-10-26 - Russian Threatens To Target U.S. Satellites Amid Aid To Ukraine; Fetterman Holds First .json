Wait until you see what he is going to show you tonight. Plus, he is one of the Republican's biggest targets, a top Democrat in charge of getting Democrats elected. And now he could be taken down by someone who is not a household name, yet. And, American teacher Marc Fogel was sentenced to 14 years in Russia for marijuana possession. He's now believed to be on his way to a secret Russian penal colony where he will be subjected to hard labor. His sister Anne is my guest. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, a new and bigger threat to the United States from Putin. Top official with Russia's foreign ministry tonight warning that American commercial satellites could be a target because of America's aid for Ukraine. It is a direct threat from Russia to the United States. And this threat from one superpower to another comes as Putin's forces are reeling on the front lines. In a video shared by Ukrainian journalists, we want to show you this. You can see what appear to be Russian soldiers complaining that they don't have the basic tools to survive. Watch it for yourself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  That's the front line just over there. They sent us here without any training, without anything at all. They've been taking us around constantly our division, the Kantemir Division. We don't have any training or supplies, and our guys showed up in their own uniforms paid for with their own money. RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  We have no weapons, no ammo mags, no grenades, no belt pouches, no food, no water. It's absolutely (EXPLETIVE DELETED) hell. Who the hell knows, (EXPLETIVE DELETED), long live the god damn Russian army. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So far, we've gotten no answer from Yevgeny Prigozhin's people. However, the Ukrainians are also saying that they believe the Russians are sending newly mobilized troops here to the front line in the south as well. They say these people have absolutely no fighting experience and have described them as essentially cannon fodder. BURNETT:  Incredible. Fred, thank you very much. Straight to the front lines, and as Fred is reporting, HIV, TB, and hepatitis, prisoners who have those and being identified by wristbands that look like those old Lance Armstrong ones. You wear red for one, white for another disease. OUTFRONT now, Christo Grozev. He's executive director and lead Russia investigator for Bellingcat. He was able to identify the Russians involved in poisoning Putin opposition leader Alexei Navalny. And he has now used those same forensic data methods to identify the secretive Russian military unit responsible for the deadly missile strikes that have been killing civilians across Ukraine. And, Christo, thank you so much for being with me. I want to talk about your new investigation. First, though, Fred talking about the Wagner Group sending prisoners with diseases to the front lines. I know you have been following the Wagner Group closely as well. What are you learning? CHRISTO GROZEV, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR &amp; LEAD RUSSIA INVESTIGATOR, BELLINGCAT:  Well, this sounds credible. This sounds compatible with some early reporting in the days after the initial visit by him to Russian prisons where they were recruiting people straight from prisons. And some prisoners actually reported on -- even not on opposition channels but on pro-Russia, pro-war channels, they reported that they ask, well, I'm sick, can I still be recruited into this sort of convict unit of the Wagner army. And they were told yes you will be in a separate group, you will be isolated from the others. And therefore, what we're hearing today, what the Ukrainians have seen on the front lines in terms of this, it seems compatible. But what is more interesting here is that of course there is a shortage of people and of talent across the board, and equipment as well. But what is interesting, from my point of view, is the new ambition that Prigozhin has obtained, in that he believes he is much better than the regular army, his people are better equipped than the regular army. He knows how to manage them and motivate them and incentivize them better. And this has been kind of a growing competition between him and the regular army and Shoigu, the minister of defense. And I think today, just an hour ago it has kind of escalated to a point that we haven't seen before where Prigozhin in a fake response to a fake question from one of his own media said that in fact some people should get the boot. And he clearly was referring to Shoigu in this statement.",

[19:10:04] And I know you used methods to track this group, that you use to track those involved in poisoning the Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.

      "sentences": "Well, it was a couple of months into the war that we started wondering in Bellingcat who are the people that are programming the flight paths of these so-called high-precision missiles. They were relatively new and first used in the Syrian war by Russia. There are three types of them.The Kalibr that are launch from ships and submarines, the X ODH-101 type that come -- that are launched from planes, and the third one, these Iskander-M 500s that are launched from the ground. But all of them have one thing in common. They can't just rely on satellite data for their roots because Russians have light GPS positioning data is faulty and easily jammable by NATO equipment and by the Ukrainians. So they require manual programming of the flight path. So, we started looking at who is doing that. No military experts seem to have any input on that or to know. So first it became a priority. And we started looking at the most likely candidates for this, people that have graduated from the missile engineering IT institutions of the army. And there are only two of these in Russia. So we started browsing and passing through yearbook photos of these people and checking out what they are doing now. And we found that some of them actually are described by their friends in phone sharing books -- apps that are very popular in Russia as people working at the unit called GVC. The GVC in Russian transcribes as the central computation institute in Russian, which is a sort of IT support system within the ministry of defense. But it didn't make a lot of sense that we have so many rocket scientists and missile specialists that work on IT support structure. So we have this early hypothesis that maybe they're involved in exactly this. So we obtained like we did with the Navalny investigation, we obtained a lot of phone records --",

And we were able to not only identify all of them, we believe, but also group them in specializations. Some of them are only working with the Kalibr missies, others only with the Iskander and so on and so forth. BURNETT:  And, Christo, just interesting one final point here. I know they masquerade, they will say they're a pig farmer or a florist. And one of them I know is a coin collector.

They claim they have never been in a military establishment despite us showing them photographs of themselves in military uniform. But what really was shocking is that as we could see from a lot of the phone communication while at work, while targeting missiles, they are also doing extraneous things like hobbies, like collecting coins.
