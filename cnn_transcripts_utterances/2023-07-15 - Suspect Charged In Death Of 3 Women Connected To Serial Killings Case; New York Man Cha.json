JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYSTAnd what's interesting here is you had essentially cold cases where technology then caught up to the investigation, or the investigation, I should say, caught up to technology, and they were able to use not just genetic and DNA testing, but the review of the searches then becomes the key point. Who else is going to be Googling what's happening with the investigation a hundred times, right? Who else is going to be, how can they, how can a prosecutor monitor burner phones, except for someone who is nervous that that's what's being done with him. So, in some ways he had been the hunted.

So, they're playing a double game here. India and others. And they -- I think, if you think about Modi, he must have really appreciate sitting at the Bastille Day ceremonies coming to the White House. He's being courted by the West. He likes that. He doesn't want to lose that. To be courted by the West, he's going to have to move towards the middle of it, and not so close to Russia. And that adds that idea of isolation. So, you know, it's a chessboard here, the pieces are moving around. And increasingly, I think you're absolutely right. There's some isolation going on, both with Russia and especially with Putin.
