They say they're assessing other sites as well. And in the coming days, folks may see increased security protocols at many locations. They're also not allowing external visitors to their campuses through the end of the week. Also here in this e-mail to employees, talking about increased media attention, including themes they say are untrue. They also note the social media environment has become increasingly vitriolic. And they said that they're pausing all social media at this time. They're also pausing all external events and speaking engagements, they say, until further notice, out of respect for Brian and his family\" and they say out of an abundance of caution for their employees and their teams, guys.

      "sentences": "Yes, sorry about that, Brianna. We somehow hit the mute button on the microphone. So, in terms of the DNA evidence, what we know is, is that that isevidence that is coming possibly from a water bottle that was found at the scene in the hours after the shooting on the day of the shooting, and then also a water bottle, and that they may have been able to get some DNA off of that. That was a water bottle that came from a Starbucks where the alleged shooter was last seen before the shooting, where he made some purchases. So all of that is what authorities are working through now. That is with the New York City Medical Examiner's Office -- they are the folks there, the forensic folks, that do that kind of work. So it's going to take some time perhaps. But the other thing that is going to be important, we don't even know if this individual is in a DNA bank for them to even compare it to anything. But that's also very important for when they start to build out the criminal prosecution. You also talked about the backpack, that backpack that he was seen wearing during the shooting. We don't know where that is. Authorities have not been able to locate that. In fact, the last time it was seen was when he was entering on the bike into Central Park. He gets in the park. And somewhere, they believe, between the park and this street here on 85th Street, where I'm standing, it disappears, because we have video showing the alleged suspect on a bike coming down 85th Street to Columbus Avenue. And then what we see is, he is not wearing that backpack. Where he goes from here, Brianna, right now, we don't know, because he either makes a left on Columbus Avenue or a right. He does not go west of Columbus Avenue, because our team has reviewed surveillance video around the time that he was seen on this street and it does not show him going up west on 85th Street. Obviously, for authorities, that is the biggest question. Where is he? Who is he? Those two questions are the biggest priority right now. We're now on day three of this. We have yet to hear a whole lot from the NYPD since the hours after this happened. So, perhaps what's happening is they're working through this. Obviously, they may have some indications of who this individual is. They may not have any idea who this individual is and they're still continuing to gather as much as they can in information. The other thing is, the cameras are becoming so important in this case. It's just fascinating how the NYPD has been able to track so much of his movement in the day leading up to the shooting. But questions about where he went afterwards, they have yet to reveal. So we wait and -- we watch and we wait to see what happens and when we learn more information.",

I lived in Manhattan for three years, so I'm familiar with all these locations. Moving around, I think he definitely was -- has left New York City. I think the NYPD, in coordination with other law enforcement agencies such as the FBI, really should expand the scope. And talking to especially the Atlanta Division of the FBI, knowing where he boarded the bus, and expanding the look where he is, we're just waiting for him to make another mistake.

There is an immense amount of surveillance within New York City. Moving out of when he leaves New York City, that's where it becomes a much bigger puzzle piece in trying to put together his movements. But that one day where he checked out, I'm curious to see what it is. It was part of his movement. The fact that he was there 10 days in advance before the shooting shows, again, a little bit of advance work, but yet that he -- staying at a hostel, you have a lot of eyes upon you.

And it was difficult getting cooperation from Apple because of the restrictions. So it depends on the make, model, version of the phone and the programming of the phone. The FBI and the NYPD have amazing technology to be able to break into phones. But if it's a newer model, if it's the latest versions, it makes it more and more difficult to get into it. I don't know if he dropped it on purpose or if it was a burner phone. It may not reveal much information. But if they utilize that phone and they have it, they will be able to track his movements through the past 10 days because they will be able to see what towers it was hitting off and where his movements were around the city. So that cell phone not only is going to have information it, but it is going to be able to provide a tremendous amount of data that will show the movement of that phone around New York City and possibly before his even arrival at New York City.",

I want to read to you a quote from one of the judges from this ruling. He said: \"The First Amendment exists to protect free speech in the United States. Here, the government acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" So, as you can see, a pretty strong rebuttal of TikTok's argument there and upholding this argument that we have heard from lawmakers for years that TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could pose national security concerns.",

The ban would go into effect on January 19, one day before his inauguration. So experts have told me that it may be a situation where he tries to get Congress to overturn the law, but that that's unlikely because they have just voted on this. There's so much anti-China sentiment in Congress at this moment.

Now, I do want to be clear about one thing. Donald Trump, as we know, can change his mind on a dime. But I am told by senior advisers that there are just a few scenarios in which Donald Trump would change his mind. One is if he heard from senators that there were too many hard no- votes. That's what we saw happen with attorney general nominee Matt Gaetz. Right now, Donald Trump and his team still believe that there is a pathway for Hegseth. The other one of this is if there's more allegations that come out or more accusations or even more information. One thing to keep in mind here is that we know from Hegseth's lawyer that now his name has been submitted to the FBI for a background check. So that could yield more information here. So, the one thing I do want to do is read this TRUTH Social post, because it is not just a brief endorsement. It is a full-throated support. Here's what he says. He says: \"Pete Hegseth is doing very well. His support is strong and deep, much more so than the fake news would have you believe. He was a great student, Princeton-, Harvard-educated with a military state of mind. He will be a fantastic high-energy secretary of defense, one who leads with charisma and skill. Pete is a winner and there is nothing that can be done to change that.\" So he's clearly trying to put to bed any kind of nervousness or anxiety or thought that he would not be backing Hegseth at this time.",
