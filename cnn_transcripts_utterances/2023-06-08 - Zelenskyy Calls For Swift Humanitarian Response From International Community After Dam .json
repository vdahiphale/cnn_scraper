It's pleading for a clear and swift humanitarian response from the international community.The full extent of the devastation remains unknown, but one aid agency says close to 2,000 homes in Ukrainian controlled areas have been flooded.

Now the film has found success in many countries around the world. I will walk through some data points for you. In fact, according to ComScore, the film has made $327 million globally. But China, again the world's second largest box office, has contributed a very small amount. According to (INAUDIBLE), this is the Chinese box office tracker in mainland China, the film made only $2.7 million in its first five days. When you compare that to the Spider-Man movie \"Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse\" that had brought in nearly $20 million in its first five days. Some in mainland China have been sharing their objections online.

And Chinese state media has been ignoring such responses. In fact, let's bring it up for your, an op-ed that was published before the film's debut in China, \"The Global Times\" said this. Quote, \"The controversy surrounding Disney's forced inclusion of minorities in classic films is not about racism, but it is, lazy and irresponsible storytelling strategy,\" unquote. Disney declined to comment to CNN on the story, but we have also seen similar reaction online in South Korea, with one user saying that the movie had, quote, \"been ruined\". Adding the #NotMyAriel.
