I am Becky Anderson here in Abu Dhabi. The time is 7 o'clock. It is 10:00 am on the East Coast of America. And right now, President Biden is preparing one of the most crucial speeches of his 50-year career, his age, his popularity and his policies on Israel and Ukraine all under intense scrutiny. In Gaza, famine has started to take lives, including children's lives and still no ceasefire in sight, meaning no relief for desperate Palestinians as Ramadan approaches. And violence spirals out of control in Haiti, pressure growing on the country's political leaders to clear the way for new elections. (MUSIC PLAYING)",

      "sentences": "Yes, certainly this is a very high-stakes moment and I don't think that's lost on any of PresidentBiden's aides. They really do view this as a moment, as this general election rematch between President Biden and former president Trump gets underway, to leave an imprint on voters who haven't necessarily been paying attention for the last three years. And there are a couple of big buckets of themes that the president will address in his speech tonight. Probably the biggest one is this idea of economic populism, calling for higher taxes on the wealthy and on corporations for lowering health care costs. Going after issues like corporate greed, price gouging. This isn't really rewriting the playbook for a Democratic president running for reelection. But certainly the imperative for President Biden is to take credit for an improving economy while still acknowledging many Americans really feel sour about the state of their own lives. He will also address this sort of broad issue of democracy, both in the United States and abroad. And certainly in that he will address the issue of abortion rights, reproductive rights, vowing to restore the protections that were stripped away from Roe versus Wade but also addressing this issue of IVF, which has been a big political issue here in the United States. He will also have in as a guest tonight the prime minister of Sweden. Of course, that's the newest NATO member and he'll use that as a moment to reinforce his support for the defense alliance but also to call for more funding for Ukraine as it continues its war against Russia. And then of course, he will also address the crisis in the Middle East. He really cannot avoid it. There had been a moment when he had hoped for a hostage deal and a temporary ceasefire this week, that he could be able to tout during the speech. Of course, that hasn't happened. Hopes are dwindling for that to happen before the start of Ramadan. But what you'll hear the president say is this need for a temporary ceasefire and also for more humanitarian aid to enter into Gaza. So those are the things I think that the president will address. But just as important is how he will address them, how he looks while he's speaking, his performance, his delivery. Of course, as these questions mount over his age and fitness for office, that is the reason while he has been rehearsing and rehearsing over the last several days and certainly will be an important thing to watch as he delivers this speech tonight, Becky.",

I think what you're going to see from Trump is a steady litany of comparisons between conditions when he was president and when Biden is president. I think that comparison is the core of his argument. Things were better and he messed it up. Tuesday night in his victory speech after Super Tuesday, the former president said, we left everything in perfect condition. And if Biden would have just gone to the beach and done nothing, it would've been fine. I think you're going to hear versions of that argument from him tonight. Maybe hard to discern them beneath all the rhetorical excess and the capital letters. And, you know, the epithets. But I do think that is the core of the argument that Trump wants to persuade. It really is a different frame. One of them wants voters to look back. I think one of them more wants voters look forward.",

We'll, have you back always a pleasure. Thank you very much, indeed. And you can watch President Biden's State of the Union address right here. On CNN, our special coverage begins 08:00 pm Eastern time. Well, now, to the Middle East, where hopes are fading fast for a Gaza ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas before Ramadan, which begins just days from now. A Hamas delegation left Cairo earlier today without a major breakthrough. The stalled talks are raising fears for what could happen next in Gaza. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Tel Aviv and will join us later this hour with more on what is this developing story. Well, on both sides, so many lives hang on the outcome of these cease- fire/hostage talks. Right now the situation on the ground in Gaza is widespread starvation. New data illustrated here by the red bars shows that all of Gaza's population is now unable to meet their food needs, at levels ranging from crisis to catastrophe. The World Health Organization chief put it in stark terms on Wednesday, saying children in Gaza who survived bombardment may not survive famine. All this almost incomprehensible when you remember that food is lined up, waiting for permission to cross into Gaza. We know, of course, that Israel is controlling all aid coming into the enclave by road. It regularly insists there is no limit on the amount of aid that it will allow in. On Tuesday though, the World Food Programme said a 14-truck convoy was turned away by Israeli authorities at a checkpoint as it tried to deliver to the northern part of the Strip. Today, Israel said that claim was false but acknowledged that some aid intended for the North had gone undelivered. My next guest has been sounding the alarm, warning that hunger and disease will skyrocket in Gaza if essential systems are not protected. And her team on the ground has seen firsthand the catastrophic impact this war will have had on children. UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell joining us now live. Catherine, I almost wish I wasn't having to do this. In fact, I absolutely wish I wasn't having to do this interview with you tonight but it is so important. Starvation in Gaza, children dying of malnutrition. What is going on?",

And we -- we're seeing the consequences and I have to say that I've seen starvation in children in many places in the world. It is so horrific, Becky, I can't -- it's almost hard to describe how painful it is to watch it, because it is a very slow and very painful death.

So what you're seeing in these images are people who are so desperate. You know, sometimes I hear it described as looting. It's not looting. These are people who have no food for themselves, for their families. And they're trying so hard to get it. So what we need is better access to the north, where its even worse than in the south, right? We are horrified by the limited amounts of food that we can get up there. But in the south as well. And people are desperately looking for food and for clean water. And they're not getting it. And I think there are recriminations every which way. In my mind, I almost don't care about that.

So I ask you again, Israel is saying that the aid that it is getting in -- and it says it is allowing aid into the enclave, that it is getting into the north. Can you be a bit more specific about the problems that you know your teams on the ground are facing in getting aid into the north, where many people, I'm told, from those on the ground and those stakeholders involved in what is going on here.

So there are discussions about maritime access, airdrops -- our view is there's no question that road access is the best. It is the most efficient way to do it. It's the best way to get aid in. But frankly, we will take anything at this point. I mean, these people are desperate. And if we can get anything in through airdrops, as long as it doesn't take away from the focus of getting things in on the land, that -- I don't have any objection to that.

And if they have a car, if they have some ability, they're able to try to move a little bit north. But what does that mean? That means that the most vulnerable people are left behind because they have no way to get out, right? And we can't have a situation where they're just sitting ducks and they have nowhere to go. They have no food, they don't have clean water. And then we have an incursion on top of it. That seems -- that seems inhumane.

But this particular one that they hit wasn't. What we are seeing is the first fatality. We've heard from U.S. officials that serve in the State Department that it was sadly inevitable. The fact that they've done more than 45 attempts at hitting commercial ships with drones, with missiles as well. And this particular time, they did manage to cause the loss of life. And unfortunately, this is something that was -- had been feared for some time. What we're hearing from the U.S. side -- and this was interesting, I thought -- was despite the fact they're continuing these strikes against the weapons caches that they have, against drones, against missiles they know are just about to be launched, they still don't know how much they've degraded the abilities of the Houthis. We heard from U.S. officials saying they don't know how much they have left because they know they're constantly being resupplied by Iran. So each time they try and take out their capabilities, it is just restocked. So they're finding it very difficult to figure out how else they can try and degrade their abilities.",

Hamas for its part has indicated that it will need a ceasefire to be in place first before it can actually assess where and all of those hostages are and which one of those are alive. An Israeli official today telling us that they simply don't believe that Hamas doesn't have a sense of where all of these hostages are. Hamas, for its part, has been pushing for a permanent ceasefire or at least a pathway to a permanent ceasefire as part of these talks, something that Israel has repeatedly rejected. And they are also still negotiating over issues like the withdrawal of Israeli forces as well as displaced Palestinians from northern Gaza being able to return to their homes. But there's no question that hope is fading. As one American can official put it to us earlier today, for a deal to start by -- to be in place by the start of Ramadan, which comes in just a few days. And so the question then is, what will happen on the ground? Benny Gantz, a member of Israel's war cabinet, had previously indicated that if there wasn't a deal in place by Ramadan then an Israeli military offensive into Rafah would then follow. But right now its unclear if that would actually happen at the very start of Ramadan.

And it's unclear though whether that is enough to quell the gang violence. This all kicked off when, over the weekend, the gangs are, Ariel Henry in Haiti, striking a deal in -- excuse me -- in Kenya, striking a deal with the Kenyan government to bring in 1,000 Kenyan troops, who, at least it's expected, would be able to help control the out-of-control gang violence. And that really served to briefly unite some of these gangs who fight each other and the government for control of territory. And they went to war with the failing Haitian state. And that's why you saw police stations being burned and the airport shut down. It's still shut down in Port-au-Prince. And really chaos, reigning up until this moment, Ariel Henry not able to return. So far he has resisted calls for him to either move out of the way or in fact resign. But its not clear how much longer he can because, of course, he needs U.S. support. He needs international support. And while there was a U.N.

In 1999 an unusual step from the Philippines. It grounded the Sierra Madre, a rusting World War II era ship on Second Thomas Shoal. Filipino marines have been guarding it ever since. Our convoy is supposed to resupply those marines. But a much larger ship swerved dangerously close to the BRP Cabra and eventually pulls in front stopping it in its tracks. Meanwhile, this resupply boat doesn't stand a chance. That little vote in front is the Philippines resupply boat and it is currently being pursued by 1, 2, 3 -- at least 4 Chinese ships. They blast the boat with water cannons shattering windows and likely injuring four service members on board forcing the crew to abort their mission. The Chinese fleet includes what looked like civilian vessels. We're currently blocked and surrounded by what looked like ordinary fishing boats that are flying Chinese flags. And they're working in tandem with the Chinese coast guard. They appear to be members of China's maritime militia a way for Beijing to project power here in the South China Sea.
