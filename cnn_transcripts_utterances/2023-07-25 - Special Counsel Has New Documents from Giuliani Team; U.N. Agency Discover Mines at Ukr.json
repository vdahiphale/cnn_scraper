      "sentences": "Special counsel Jack Smith is now in possession of thousands of documents that were created by Rudy Giuliani's team in the days and weeks following the 2020 election. This team was tasked with trying to find some evidence of fraud.Now, one of the people on this team is the former New York police commissioner Bernie Kerik. He is a close associate of Rudy Giuliani and he has been in possession of a lot of these documents, the January 6 committee was trying to get all these materials, but he would not hand them over. Even though he is not a lawyer, he claimed that he was working for the legal team and therefore they were privileged. But in recent weeks, the special counsel investigators have reached out to Kerik to schedule an interview and also to collect evidence. And after they reached out, Kerik went to the Trump campaign, had them review the materials and Trump campaign we're told said, look, they were not going to argue privilege over this, which suggests that they believe there is not anything too incriminating in these documents. But now that the special counsel investigators have these, this is something that no other investigator has been able to obtain. So this is the first time we'll be able to see the materials and it could be some key evidence in their ongoing investigation. Now, Kerik has also scheduled an interview for early August where he will sit down with investigators and face questions, some of which they have likely already written and there will be new ones based on the documents he has just handed over.

The IAEA confirming what Ukraine had claimed for sometime now, which is that there are anti-personnel mines in the vicinity of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. The IAEA saying that they are clearly marked, that they are in restricted zones and they are facing away from the staff, from the employees who run that nuclear power plant.But, of course, the IAEA describing it as contrary to its standards. It might seem like rather muted language, but you have to remember throughout the conflict, the IAEA chief, Rafael Grossi, has had a very difficult task. He's had to negotiate between Russia and Ukraine in an attempt to try to create a secure zone, a safe zone around the power plant. That has not happened. Yet, there are, of course, IAEA officials on site who continue to maintain the situation there. But this is a place again where power has been cut off at times due to shelling, shutting down those nuclear reactors where very much a flash point has occurred time and time again. So we're not speaking about an immediate threat right now with this nuclear power plant, but we are talking about the stakes just getting that much higher, when we're talking again about the safety of a nuclear site.",
