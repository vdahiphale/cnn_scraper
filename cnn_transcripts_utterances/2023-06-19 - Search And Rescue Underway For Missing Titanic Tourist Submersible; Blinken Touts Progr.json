We have up-to-the-minute details on the mission to find the sub and the five people on board.Also this hour, the high-stakes meeting of the super power, Secretary of State Antony Blinken says the U.S. and China have made progress towards getting relations back on track, but there still is a ways to go. We'll have a report from Beijing. And more than 50 million people across the southeast face the threat of severe weather, including tornados this holiday weekend. We'll have the latest forecast. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and all around the world. Wolf Blitzer's off today. I'm Alex Marquardt and this is a SITUATION ROOM special report. Our top story tonight, an urgent search and rescue is underway for missing tourist submersible carrying five people who were on a journey to see the wreckage of the Titanic.

So, that's what we know. That's what we've been told this afternoon and this evening by the U.S. Coast Guard and other officials. What we can tell you is that this is an area roughly almost 400 miles southeast of Newfoundland. The Coast Guard has assets in the water, in the air, along with Canadian Air Force and navy ships that are heading to the area and actually are there right now, including C-130 planes, P8 Poseidon submarine hunters, other assets like that. They have not yet apparently searched the water column in getting into the depths of the ocean yet to try to find this vehicle, if it is indeed deep under the surface. What we also can tell you is that if indeed this is well below the surface, as what is certainly a possibility now, that it could be about 12,500 feet, that's more than two miles beneath the surface of the ocean, and that is about where the Titanic is located. So, there is an urgent search going on right now for this vehicle. Five people on board, according to the Coast Guard, and we're going to get updates as soon as we can. Alex?",

Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon, thank you very much.I want to now bring retired Naval Captain Bobbie Scholley for more inside on how the search and rescue effort is unfolding. Captain, thank you so much for joining me. We've been talking about the depth of this water, the distance that this search site is from the coast, 900 miles off the coast of Cape Cod, a little bit less off the coast of Canada. To what extent is looking for this submersible -- is it looking like a needle in a hay stack, if you will? CAPT. BOBBIE SCHOLLEY (RET.), FORMER U.S. NAVY DIVER:  Well, thanks for having me, Alex. And, first of all, I want to say my heart really goes out to the crew of the submersible, and also I want to say good luck to all the men and women that are out there searching. But as with any search and rescue operation out at sea, it is a bit like searching for a needle in a haystack. But in this case, unlike some of the rescue search missions that I've been on for aircraft, in this case, they knew exactly the location that they were starting with, with this submersible. So, they have good data for where to start the rescue, or where to start the search. And that's very important in this case. So, they know a starting point. The depth of water causes us this to be a much bigger area to search in. So, that's going to increase the haystack. But they have a lot of assets on station already with the aircraft in the air and they're bringing in all the right other resources that they need. The sonar buoys are fabulous to get into the water column. And that's what they need to do with having the depth of water that they are addressing. So, they have a lot of smart people in the Coast Guard and in the Navy and some of the commercial assets to get a multi-pronged approach to start chipping away at this haystack. And the 96 hours is a short amount of time but these resources are very effective.",

And that could be part of the problem with communications and with mobility on the submersible. So, we have remote operated vehicles that can be -- gotten out to the scene relatively, I don't want to say quickly, but within that time period.

I mean, these are not political enemies of his, and they're not never-Trumpers. They worked for him. And so I think their voices should carry some amount of weight. But there's no evidence quite yet that Republicans are ready to listen to Bill Barr and Mark Esper over Trump.I will say, though, listening to Trump tonight on the Fox News interview that we played a clip of, it's quite troubling. And he clearly doesn't have an answer for this. He's scrambling. I would be very concerned if I were part of his legal team that he was out commenting on this publicly now that he's under indictment. But it does underscore the fact that, for Trump, the political argument is really what matters most today because I think they're betting they can push off a trial until after the election. And if they can get him elected president, then they can make it go away. So, the campaign is the defense, basically.",
