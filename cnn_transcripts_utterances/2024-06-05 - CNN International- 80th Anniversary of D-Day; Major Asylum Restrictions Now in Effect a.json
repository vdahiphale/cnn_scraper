President Biden is here for a series of scheduled diplomatic engagements that have been long anticipated but carry much more significance now that war is intensifying inside Ukraine, which of course is the biggest military theater in Europe since World War II. Biden and Zelenskyy will meet later this week in Normandy where other world leaders will also be convening to commemorate D-Day, to commemorate the Allied invasion that eventually led to the liberation of Europe.And Biden and Zelenskyy will have an opportunity to discuss in detail exactly what is going on, on the ground and in the air in Ukraine where the U.S. has newly authorized Zelenskyy to use American-made weapons to strike Russian positions located over the border inside Russia. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan overnight called that common sense and he pointed out that this week's engagements are all happening against a backdrop where, in his words, dictators are once again attempting to challenge the order, attempting to march in Europe. That is a message that President Biden is expected to deliver forcefully when he gives a speech on a topic that is fairly familiar with him, on the power of democracy. He's expected to deliver that speech on Friday from Pointe du Hoc, which is the cliffs where Army Rangers scaled to destroy German lookout positions that eventually led to the end of the Battle of Normandy. Following that, the president is going to see his visit elevated to a state visit, a formal visit with French President Emmanuel Macron, where the two leaders will discuss again in detail what is happening in Ukraine and a very novel plan that G7 leaders are discussing to utilize Russian assets that have been frozen to send some of those proceeds to Ukraine to continue funding the country's defenses. They'll also discuss the situation in the Middle East where Macron has been critical of the U.S.'s position and where the war between Israel and Hamas continues to simmer. They will also discuss relations with China and much more. Now, this is all happening as President Biden faces a reelection vote in November. Voters have given him fairly low marks on his handling of foreign policy, but one of the hallmarks of his foreign policy has been this deepening of transatlantic ties. So expect him to continue to deepen those ties and to point to that in the coming months -- Max.",

And in fact, if you look at the decline on the Indian side in the balance of trade, or if you look at, you know, widespread reports about loss of territory to China, these would not necessarily, you know, show a great deal of success. China also remains massively engaged within the Indian economy, though for hyper-nationalistic reasons, every once in a while, the government has come up with strong anti-China propaganda and rhetoric. As far as the U.S. is concerned, India historically, you talked about Mr. Nehru. I think the relations at that point between Nehru and the American leadership was of a completely different order. But then, of course, the world order was a very different world order at that point in time. I think for the Americans, India's counterweight to China has allowed a lot of leeway to the Indian government in terms of things on which the Americans otherwise would have made a bit of noise, human rights, environment, and so forth. And that has basically been muted from the Biden administration. And in fact, American presidents from Obama, sorry, to Trump, to Biden, they've all made exaggerated shows of personal friendships with Mr. Modi, which is, I think, part of the style of Mr. Modi's functioning, which is to reduce international relations to personal relations with leaderships of different countries, which also goes down very well with his base. So for all of these reasons, I think that if, you know, Mr. Modi has obviously done a good job, I won't say he has not. But to say that this is somehow an exceptional period of Indian leadership sitting on the top table of the world, one only needs to go back to the previous prime minister, Manmohan Singh, who also was respected massively within international institutions and also among the global leadership.",
