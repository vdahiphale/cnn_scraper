Right now, 115 people are confirmed dead at this point. Crews still removing hazardous materials and debris to make it safe for families to return to their homes. But the recovery process is fueling mistrust between the community and government officials. CNN's Natasha Chen is here with an update for us. Natasha, why does the governor believe that this number is going to be much lower, which certainly is very good news?",

All of this coming as temperatures in Florida are expected to hit the high 80s with a heat index over 100 degrees in some areas. The region could also see up to four inches of rain today and into Saturday, which could complicate recovery efforts in areas that are already waterlogged from Idalia. The hurricane damaged thousands of homes, ripping off roofs, toppling trees and dumping waist-deep floodwaters onto roads.

In 2009, the U.S. banned the tobacco industry from adding flavors to their products. But 14 years later, menthol is still legal in the United States.

So we can expect to hear more from the agency soon. What exactly this rule says is that it will prohibit flavored cigars and menthol flavor in cigarettes. And the FDA says that it's proposed this rule to really help prevent kids from smoking. We know that flavored products are really attractive to children. And it's estimated that nearly half of kids who smoke use menthol cigarettes. We also know that historically, tobacco companies have aggressively targeted black and brown communities with marketing menthol products. And just in general, nationally, we know that smoking cigarettes is still the leading cause of preventable death and disease in the United States. So, Alex, it will be interesting to see once this rule is finalized what will happen next, when it will go into effect, how tobacco companies may respond.

A summer that's really been marked by a lot of frustration for travelers. The numbers for cancellations have actually gotten a little bit better when you compare this summer to last summer.
