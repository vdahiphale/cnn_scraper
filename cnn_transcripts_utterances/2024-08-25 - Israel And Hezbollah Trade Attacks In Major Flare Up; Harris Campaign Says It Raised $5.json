The Middle East backing away from abroader war for now after Israel and Hezbollah exchanged an intense barrage of fire across Lebanon's border early this this morning. Both sides are quiet at this hour. Hezbollah says its attack was in retaliation for Israel's killing of a top military commander in Lebanon last month. After learning, Israel says that a Hezbollah attack was imminent, Israeli forces launched what described as preempted strikes. A US Defense official says the US did help Israel track incoming fire from Lebanon, but was not involved in any Israeli strike inside Lebanese territory. Both sides appear to be standing down again for now, but the region remains on high alert. Several airlines have suspended flights into the region as a precaution. We do have full coverage for you. Our Jeremy Diamond is in Haifa, Israel, in the north; Ben Wedeman in the Lebanese capital of Beirut. State Department reporter, Jenny Hansler, she is back in Washington.

We saw the Israeli military around 4This attack was carried out by over a hundred Israeli fighter jets in one of the most substantial attacks that we have seen since the beginning of this war, and then within the next hour and a half, air raid sirens sounding in Northern Israel as Hezbollah carried out an attack on Northern Israel with about -- with hundreds of rockets, as well as several dozen drones it appears. The Israeli military claiming that it took down all of the drones that Hezbollah fired, and that no Israeli military bases in either Central or Northern Israel were actually struck despite claims from Hezbollah that that is what they were targeting. We do know that one home in the city of Akko in Northern Israel does appear to have been partially he damaged as a result of this barrage of strikes, but otherwise, the Israeli military is touting its defense effort and this preemptive strike as a resounding success. We heard from the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who said that this was a very successful result, that this preemptive strike prevented the launch, he said of hundreds of additional rockets that Hezbollah has been planning to fire and he said that he believes Israel has now destabilized Hezbollah, and that their operation failed. For the time being, it seems like both sides are intents on not escalating the situation further, but of course we know in this very volatile region that is an assessment that could change in just a matter of a few days' time -- Jim.",

They did not participate in actually launching any sort of missiles or rockets or anything of that sort, but they did provide intelligence in this way.And Jim, the US is not backing down from its defensive posture that we've seen here. The Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke a little bit ago with his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, and he told him that the US would be keeping its carrier strikes, these two carrier groups in the region for some of this deterrence. Now, earlier this month, they put a number of US assets into the region for this show of force to try to deter any response from Hezbollah, as well as Iran to the killing of a Hezbollah and Hamas commander earlier this month. They have put these forces in place to try to stop any sort of massive escalation. Now, overnight we saw a little bit of that escalation and it is clear the US is not prepared to back down and say that this is the extent of what we are going to be seeing. Now at the same time that this is taking place, there are also those high stakes talks happening in Cairo to try to bring a ceasefire and hostage deal to the finish line in Gaza. Now, the US had its delegation there. Hamas also sent a delegation, so that is a bit of a promising sign, but we have not heard any sort of outcome and any sort of sense at this talk has actually made it to the finish line there. Of course the concept of escalation, the idea that these things could be derailed is something the US has warned about. They have been saying it is urgent for this to get done and something that happened overnight, that's exactly what they were worried about -- Jim.",

I do think to some extent she has neutralized at least some of that anger and frustration that was largely targeted toward President Biden over the administration's support for Israel during its military offensive in Gaza and the decision to continue sending weapons to Israel.Having said that, there is still a faction of voters, and I think especially when you look at the state of Michigan, where there is a large population of Arab and Muslim American voters that Vice President Harris is going to have to persuade who want to see more of a shift on policy, not just a rhetorical shift that you've seen with her in terms of the empathy that she has demonstrated for the Palestinian side of this conflict. But as you mentioned, convention was very diverse. It was this big unifying moment for the Democratic Party. You talked about that massive fundraising haul for the campaign. It is really hard to overstate just how much things have turned around from just over a month ago when another Trump presidency almost seemed inevitable, and now, it is still going to be a very close race. But Vice President Harris has either cut President Trump's lead in number or former President Trump's lead number of key battlegrounds, or she is even meeting him in some of these critical swing states.",

That was something that the DNC and the Harris campaign ultimately denied or and I think that created some tension because there was a feeling of an imbalance because they did have the parents of an Israeli American hostage, of course, speak in a very emotional and moving speech. There was a desire by some of these uncommitted delegates and voters to also hear from the Palestinian side.I do think that there is a lot -- there are a lot of Palestinian American and Arab American leaders I've spoken with in my reporting who say that they do see Vice President Harris as distinct from President Biden and they don't necessarily blame her for his policy in the region, which she doesn't ultimately have control over. But at the same time, I think that a ceasefire is certainly something that would go a long way. That's why these negotiations I think are so important with just a couple of months wants to go until the election. And then of course, there is still this pressure to stop -- the administration to stop sending weapons to Israel as part of its war effort. That is something that the Harris campaign says that she opposes. She does not support an arms embargo against Israel. Now, whether that is going to ultimately matter in November, I think that might impact a smaller number of voters. You are seeing her perform better with some of these groups who are turned off by Biden's handling of the war, like young voters, Black voters, and even like I said, some Arab and Muslim American voters. So it looks like a rhetorical shift could be enough to satisfy some voters, but of course, when it comes down to tens of thousands of votes in key battleground states, I think the campaign knows it can't take anyone's vote for granted.",

I first met Sham back in March. She has made so much progress mentally, emotionally in that time, and her mother now worries that if they are sent back to Gaza, all of that progress will be erased. There is another option though, if a third country comes in and says that they will resettle Sanaa and Sham, then they will not, we expect to be deported back to Gaza -- Fred.",
