The IDF is saying that this strike was designed to take out a Hamas commander who they say they successfully killed. They say that they killed Ibrahim Biari; the Commander of Hamas' Central Jabalya Battalion. Biari, they say was one of the Hamas operatives who orchestrated the terrorist attacks on October 7th. They also say that he was responsible for other terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians, and they also say that numerous other terrorists were hiding in civilian buildings in the Jabalya Refugee Camp when this strike took place. According to the statement, they say a large number of terrorists who were with Biari were killed. And they say that his elimination was carried out as part of a wide scale strike on terrorists and terror infrastructure, belonging to the Central Jabalya Battalion. They also say that Biari has been the commander for Hamas forces in the northern Gaza Strip who have been fighting Israeli forces since that expanded ground operation was launched five days ago today. But again, when you are -- we are now seeing images of people rushing into the hospital, according to a member of the staff at the nearby Turkish hospital, saying that hundreds of dead and injured are being brought into the hospital. Of course, it's not clear how many of those are civilians, how many of those are combatants. We do know that Hamas has a history of embedding itself in civilian areas, in residential areas, and of course, as Salma noted, the IDF has been urging civilians to leave northern Gaza for southern Gaza. Of course, there is a massive challenge for civilians to actually be able to do that. We will see if we get more from the IDF on the exact number of terrorists that they say that they were able to eliminate in the strike. But clearly, there are civilian casualties as a result of this.

Now, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces say they did hit the Jabalya Camp -- Jabalya Camp in an attack. The IDF speaking to our Wolf Blitzer in the last 20 minutes. They say they were targeting a very senior Hamas commander. In the last few minutes as you heard there, from our Jeremy on the ground, he was saying the Israeli military claims it killed Hamas commander in the strike. The U.N. says the Jabalya Camp is the largest refugee camp in Gaza. At last count earlier this year, there were 116,000 Palestinian refugees registered in this camp, and as we heard from our correspondent, many of those would be children. Once we have more clarity on what is happening or what has happened, and the toll this has taken, of course, we will have -- we'll bring that up -- we'll bring to you the director of the Indonesian Hospital telling CNN that hundreds of dead and injured people have arrived at the hospital. Many, he said, are still under the rubble. As we look at these images, we've seen people there trying to find their loved ones, trying to see if they can here, to rescue anyone.

You could talk about commando raids, but dropping a missile into a densely- populated area like that. Whatever Israel achieves with its military strategy, it's likely to lose in the battle for international public -- if we keep seeing images like this, and as your previous guest alluded to, dead children day after day after day.

There is no infrastructure in the south, they argue, to support that. On the -- as we saw these images coming in from the Jabalya refugee camp, Nic, you know, we were talking to our Salma Abdelaziz and we were talking about the condemnation will start. We'll start to hear from leaders around the world and NGOs to the images we are looking at around here, doctors saying hundreds of dead, injured people arriving the hospital. Many as we look at these images, Nic, supposedly one would assume still under the rubble. We've heard in the last few minutes from the Pentagon -- I will read you out what they said. The Pentagon spokesman, Brigadier General Pat Ryder telling CNN the Israeli military is not deliberately targeting civilians, unlike Hamas. They are responding, of course, to this airstrike on the refugee camps. The Pentagon saying Israel not deliberately targeting civilians. But this, I would imagine, would put more pressure on prime minister Netanyahu here.",

And he was trying to deal with precisely that pressure when he spoke at a press conference yesterday, number one,saying the October 7th attacks were akin to a Pearl Harbor moment, a 9/11 moment. No one would expect the United States to have called a cease-fire at that moment. To the point of civilians being killed, the Israeli point of view and the prime minister's point last night was there is a moral distinction to be made. He said Hamas comes out and kills civilians, targets civilians. I was speaking with a witness who was going back to that music festival, today for the first time she had gone back, barely left her house since. She described seeing her friends lying on the ground quite literally begging for their lives and being shot in cold blood. So what the prime minister says is that Hamas comes out to intentionally kill civilians. The Israeli government doesn't; that there can be collateral damage but that is a message that, while it strikes at the core of understanding in Israel, it appears to lose traction with even some of Israel's strongest allies. And that's why we are hearing the increased calls for this pause to avoid all the civilian casualties.",

Of course, those civilians in northern Gaza were warned by the IDF to evacuate southwards. But the message I'm hearing from rights groups and medical teams on the ground is that there are many who simply cannot evacuate, who have to remain in the north for various reasons and, therefore, continue to come under this relentless air bombardment by the IDF.",

Nada Bashir with the very latest from Jerusalem, thank you very much. Benjamin Netanyahu has been striking in the last three, four hours a defiant tone as he rejects calls for a cease-fire The Israeli prime minister had long warned the label of Mr. Security until that identity was shattered by a Hamas attack on October, 7 which killed, of course, 1,400 people. He wasn't widely popular before overseeing the country's worst ever security breach, facing scrutiny over ongoing corruption allegations and a controversial push to overhaul Israel's judiciary, a story we have focused on on the show. Some of the headlines in the last few days have been brutal, including one from Haaretz, referring to the prime minister as \"a puppet.\" As you can see, in his most difficult hour referring to foreign policy, \"we will never forgive Netanyahu for what he did to us.\" Israeli citizens vowing to never forget and forgive him there. Let's get more on the mood inside Israel. I will bring in Avi Mayer, the editor in chief of \"Jerusalem Post.\" Avi, I think it is fair to say that we heard a pretty defiant speech from prime minister Netanyahu yesterday, when he rejected calls for a cease- fire, saying it wasn't the time for war; it was a battle against tyranny, i think he said in terror. A speech clearly directed at Israelis but also directed to the rest of the world. How are his words, first of all, received at home? AVI MAYER, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, \"JERUSALEM POST\": Look, I think, as you said, there was a dual message here. I think he actually did have a domestic audience preparing the Israeli public for the possibility this was going to be a long term presence in Gaza. There will likely be fighting that will go on for quite some time. They are also sending a message to the world, that this is not only Israel's battle but in fact it's a battle between the forces of, as you said, tyranny and extremism and those of democracy and freedom, which are represented by the state of Israel. So I think his words were, in that respect, well received within Israel. But as you said, there is a great deal of frustration within Israel about the role his leadership played in the failures of October 7th and his failure up until this point to take responsibility for those failures.",

But that criticism, correct me if I'm, wrong has only intensified following, of course, the devastating intelligence failure. Add to that the concern over the 240 hostages. From what I, understand some of the relatives wanted to give a chance to these negotiations. Talk to the sentiment right now in the country.",

So there is that consensus within the country. At the same, time there is this confusion, this lack of understanding as to why the prime minister is the only leader of the country who has yet to take personal responsibility for the failures of October the 7th. The heads of the, military of military intelligence, other security agencies have, said we played a role in those failures. The prime minister has yet to do so. (CROSSTALK)",
