      "sentences": "Good evening. I'm Kaitlan Collins.And sources across the political spectrum, tonight, say the Republican Party has a major problem on its hands, with potential implications for the presidential race and Donald Trump. CNN's KFILE has uncovered a slew of posts made by the Republican nominee for governor of North Carolina, Mark Robinson. You see him here. In just 48 hours, before Trump is scheduled to return to that critical battleground, he and the rest of us are finding out that the candidate that he endorsed posted dozens of disturbing comments, on a porn forum, between the year 2008 and 2012. Mark Robinson, calling himself, in his own words, a perv, writing that many things that are too sexual in nature, and frankly, too explicit for me to even read on TV. But I will say this, about what Robinson wrote. He said that he enjoyed transgender pornography, despite the anti-trans rhetoric that he's been using lately. And there were also racist and anti-Semitic statements included in that. Like, when Robinson called himself, and these are his words, again, a Black Nazi, in 2010. He also said that year that he supported reinstating slavery, writing, quote, \"Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves. I wish they would bring it (slavery) back. I would certainly buy a few.\" Now, before this report came out, but after Robinson's other offensive comments, to be clear, Trump previously praised him as the Martin Luther King on steroids. Tonight, in response to this reporting, by KFILE, Robinson is denying it all, saying that it's not him, and also saying he won't withdraw from the race. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK ROBINSON, (R) NOMINEE FOR NORTH CAROLINA GOVERNOR: This is not us. These are not our words. And this is not anything that is characteristic of me, nor has it ever had -- has it ever been. This is not things that we would ever say or even think.",

I'm quoting them now. They say, \"The Left can try to smear Mark Robinson all they want, but when voters go to the polls on Election Day, they are going to be asking one simple question: Are you better off now than you were four years ago?\" I mean, this is not a smear by the Left.

I mean, it would be pretty shocking, actually, if a party decided to throw their candidate off the ballot, although it did happen one time, in one other race this summer that we've covered.I think in the case of North Carolina, what are the questions I have? Number one. Was Mark Robinson likely to win in the first place? The answer is no. He was competitive, but I think not likely to win. This story does not make it any easier, of course, because of what Adam just said. I mean, it's pretty -- pretty rough stuff. Number two. Regarding the issues, will it affect Donald Trump? I would just note, in the last two elections, Democrat won governor, Trump still won the state. I don't think it works that way. And whether this hurts Mark Robinson or doesn't, or hurts him a little, or hurts him a lot, I don't really think it's going to have any impact on Donald Trump whatsoever. He endorses a lot of Republicans. In fact, he endorses most Republicans. And I don't think he owns the oppo file on every single person that he endorses, any more than any other national figure does, when they support the people in their party. So, I think the Trump campaign feels good about what it's doing in North Carolina. They feel good about their apparatus. Robinson may have his own problems. But I really don't think it's going to impact Trump. And I'll just add one other thing. Andy is a good reporter. And all year long, he has been doing lots of reporting, on both parties, including a lot of reporting on Kamala Harris. And people, like me, have come on here and touted that reporting as important.

And does that work? Sometimes, sure. Sometimes, it doesn't. And so, a lot of this stuff about Mark Robinson, as you just pointed out, which was important was, no, not the details of, like, what we're learning today, which is like, Oh my gosh. But there was a lot of stuff, where everybody -- I mean, he was already significantly down in the polls, in this. And where I don't think it's going to affect Donald Trump, in terms of, people are going to say, well, if Donald Trump supported him, I can't support Trump, I think they can leave Robinson. But what it could do is it could bring down some of the enthusiasm. I mean, this is like a gut punch to anybody that's a Republican, in North Carolina, to learn this. And in a race that's going to be so close, any kind of an attack on motivation can make a huge difference. So, you know, and I do think Scott's right. A lot of it's going to determine, what does Donald Trump do after this point? If he sticks with Mark Robinson, and defends him, and calls him Martin Luther King times two? For God's sakes, by the way. But if he calls him that, then he does own some of what Mark Robinson did. If he is quiet, or actually denounces him, then I think he has a position to say, I didn't know. I didn't know what's going to happen. But there was a lot that was known prior to this.",

So, it would probably lead to a protracted fight.I, again, I go back to my initial reaction to this. He was down, I think, unlikely to win in the first place.

Together, that's probably 58 percent of the vote. I suspect she will drive messages, on women's reproductive rights. I think it'll be more resonant there, maybe than in other parts of the state. In the western part of the state, she needs to talk about the economy and jobs, more effectively. But at the end of the day, it's tight. And there are two counties to watch, Northampton County, where I'm from, in that area, the Lehigh Valley, and Erie County. I'm going to make one prediction. Whichever candidate wins Northampton County, Pennsylvania, is going to win Pennsylvania, and is going to win the presidency. Same is probably true of Erie County. So, if you want to know anything, just watch those two counties. There has been polling done, in those two counties that show it's very tight there as well, with Harris with a very slight lead.

So, it's not just about, you know, are these empty campaign promises. Voters will actually be able to compare the record of President Trump, through his first term in the White House, and the last four years under Vice President Harris and Joe Biden. And there are very clear contrast, between them, on almost every single major issue that Americans are concerned about. Whether we're talking about the economy and the cost of living, something that was drastically lower for most Americans under President Trump than what they've experienced over the last four years. We look at border security. We look at crime. We look at domestic policy and foreign policy. In each of these areas, President Trump will continue to share with voters, his record of success, and remind them about how, overall, the quality of life for the American people was much better, under him, and why he looks forward to coming back into office, to improve their quality of life, once again.",

But we did a town hall, in La Crosse, Wisconsin, where I shared with him the struggles that my husband and I went through, in trying to start our own family, and how we went through multiple rounds of IVF, as part of that process. And unfortunately, it didn't work out for us. But it does help so many families. And President Trump shared with me what he has been consistent in all along, is how much he supports people's efforts, who are going through these struggles, how much he supports IVF, even going farther than I think anyone else has, as far as I know in politics, and making sure that we have access. As you know, it's extremely expensive. Even for service members in the military, TRICARE doesn't cover IVF. So, for him to take that action and say he wants to make sure that it's accessible for everyone, even if you don't have money? This is the truth about President Trump's position, on this, as well as a whole host of other issues that Vice President Kamala Harris, and many in the mainstream media, continue to lie about and foment fear about, as though he is not supportive of families and women, who are going through this very tough period.",

And prosecutors have been meeting with multiple people, who worked for him previously. Combs, of course, pleaded not guilty, this week, after he was arrested and indicted, in New York, on Monday night, on sex trafficking and racketeering charges. My source tonight is CNN's Senior Legal Analyst, and the former federal prosecutor, Elie Honig. And Elie, this is so interesting. Because you and I have talked about this, essentially every night since it's developed. And what we're hearing tonight, from a source, is that the allegations from these witnesses, that federal agents have been meeting with, they actually go beyond the scope of the indictment that was unsealed, Tuesday morning. What does that mean for that indictment, and just for his case overall, going forward? ELIE HONIG, CNN SENIOR LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NY: Well, Kaitlan, prosecutors love to say, we always say, our investigation is ongoing. And the truth of the matter is, sometimes that's just boilerplate. You just automatically say that, when you indict, you're effectively done with your investigation. Not here. We now know that this investigation truly is ongoing. And I've done cases, like this, with major numbers of victims in sex trafficking cases. These first two to three days after the indictment are crucial, for people to come forward, other victims, other witnesses. They see there's been an indictment. And we remember, the U.S. Attorney, when he announced this case, a few days ago, said, If you believe you are a victim or witness, come forward, contact us. So, this tells me that the prosecutors are not done, and they're still looking for, and thinking they're going to find new victims.",
