Tuesday's protest devolved into chaos with Kenyan police shooting and killing at least five people with dozens more injured. A warning some of the footage whereabouts air is graphic, and you may find it disturbing. CNN teams witnessed two bodies on the ground amid the violence.

The WikiLeaks founder is now on his way to his native Australia without ever setting foot in an American jail. The U.S. had charged Assange with 18 felony counts for publishing hundreds of thousands of leaked U.S. military documents and diplomatic cables in 2010 revealing sensitive data on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Julian Assange, as he has been throughout his life is a polarizing figure, but I think certainly in terms of the current Australian administration, this is a victory for one of its citizens. Under Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, there have been lots of negotiations, sometimes behind the scenes, sometimes quite openly, when he himself raised it on a visit to Washington with President Biden last year saying enough is enough for an Australian man who isn't a U.S. citizen but was being prosecuted by American authorities for arguably not committing a crime at all.Of course, the U.S. Department of Justice doesn't see it that way, hence why they've been pursuing him. And eventually it's led to this plea bargain with Assange, suffering failing health in jail, Belmarsh prison, a high security jail where he spent 23 -- 24 hours of each day inside a cell with only one hour allowed for exercise. So, no wonder jubilation that this ordeal for this man is over and for all those supporters that have campaigned on his behalf, including his lawyer, who had this to say outside the court a little bit earlier.

And on top of that, there's been a number of recent arrests of people who have not yet or won't necessarily be classified by the State Department as wrongfully detained. Another journalist for Radio Free Europe Alsu Kurmasheva was detained last October, accused of failing to register as a foreign agent. There's a Russian beautician married to an American who lived in Los Angeles who's been arrested on charges of treason. And just recently, a U.S. soldier, Staff Sergeant Gordon Black arrested and has already been convicted and sentenced up to four years for theft and threatening murder. So, the speculation is that Russia is sort of trying to build up a collection of Americans that it can use as currency. I think, as I said, the worry is that the U.S. doesn't have that in return to swap, and that any potential prisoners of in the future may have to involve a third country.",

Now, one famous line from Donald Trump that one source had said could come up on Thursday night is his claim that he would be a dictator on day one. And we should note that one challenge or potential challenge for the Biden team as they are preparing to go up against Donald Trump on foreign policy issues is that his positions are not entirely clear, are sometimes murky and ambiguous, including on the conflict in Gaza. He hasn't actually said much about that situation.
