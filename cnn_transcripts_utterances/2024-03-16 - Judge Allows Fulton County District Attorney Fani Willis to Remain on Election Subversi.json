Fani Willis on the Donald Trump case, will the former president succeed in turning a legal loss into a calendar win.Then ticked off. As angry TikTok users want video attacks on Congress, is the U.S. going too far against the popular social media app? And where's Kate? The question everyone seems to be asking you after this week's royal photoshop scandal. The panel is here and ready to go. So sit back, relax, and let's talk about up. Up first, a major criminal case against Donald Trump after a judge in Atlanta ruled Friday District Attorney Fani Willis can prosecute her political interference case against the former president. But she'll do it without her lead prosecutor, Nathan Wade, who had to resign from the case. Trump and his co-defendants tried to disqualify Willis over her romantic relationship with Wade. And in the way only Trump can, he's now trying to turn a legal loss into a win. (BEGIN VIDEO TAPE)",
