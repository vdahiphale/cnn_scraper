And this is an area where there could be an opportunity, but it could also be a bit tricky for the Democrats.

Israeli negotiators are said to be optimistic about the talks, but Hamas is expressing reservations. In Gaza, officials at the Al Aqsa Hospital say an Israeli airstrike today killed seven members of the same family. The victims are said to be a mother and her six children. On Saturday, civil defense officials say an Israeli strike killed at least 15 members of another family, including nine children. Israel says its strikes killed several militants in Gaza. Also on Saturday, the Israeli military issued new evacuation orders in Gaza. The United Nations says after these new orders, only 11 percent of Gaza can be considered humanitarian zones. Meanwhile, Hamas says an Israeli airstrike in the West Bank killed two of its military commanders on Saturday. Israel says the pair were involved in planning a shooting attack last Sunday in the Jordan Valley. Now, on the streets of Tel Aviv, protesters lit a fire at an anti- government protest saying there would be a deal or escalation. Some Israelis are skeptical that a ceasefire deal will happen and say they doubt that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu actually wants one.

So, that's going to be very interesting to see how that shapes Iran's foreign policy in these very key times in the Middle East.The other thing, of course, that is going on as well is that you do have this turmoil that is still going on. I spoke to a couple of members of parliament here inside, including some very prominent one, and they certainly say that they're not very confident about the ceasefire negotiations that are going on. They don't believe that Israel is serious about the ceasefire negotiations. And also, they say they don't trust the United States to be an objective mediator in all this because they believe that the U.S. is firmly in the corner of the Israelis. Nevertheless, parliamentarians that we've been speaking to here on the ground, they do say that they hope that there will be a ceasefire, obviously, so that the bloodshed inside of Gaza ends. And at the same time, you do have that Iranian retaliation for the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, which happened just a day after the inauguration of the new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, that still very much looms here. And parliamentarians we've been speaking to here, and they fully -- say they fully expect that a strike is going to happen.

But we do need, I think, to look at the past nine months of on off talks between Israel and Hamas mediated, of course, by the United States and in particular, the Qataris and the Egyptians and see that we have been here so many times when there has been this optimism. We heard from that relative of an Israeli hostage saying that they want to get their hopes up too high because in the past, those hopes have only been dashed.And I'm constantly reminded of that time when in February, President Biden in Michigan saying that he hoped to deal would be done that weekend. So, I think, you know, caution rather than optimism is probably a better way to describe the current situation. We've heard from a source familiar with the talks that were taking place in Doha last week saying that for the Israelis, at least, in the words of this source, the gaps have been narrowed in terms of the positions of Israel and Hamas. And then, we had a statement on that from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office on Saturday evening, saying that there were elements that were acceptable to Israel in terms of the proposal that is on the table and that they were expressing cautious optimism. But as we were just hearing, this isn't the stance, certainly not of Iran, nor from Hamas, which has been saying that, first of all, the United States seems to be slanted towards Israel, that the proposal on the table is kind of factoring in more the Israeli side of things. And at the same time, they are also saying that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu should be is obstructing these talks. Now, it may be that both sides -- this is all part of the negotiating process, it may be also that both sides are trying to ensure themselves in the event that these talks also come to nothing so that they're in a position to blame the other side. But certainly, the pressure on both sides to do a deal has never been higher. Not just because of the death toll and the war that is still ongoing in Gaza and also, now, it seems an outbreak of polio for the first time in 25 years, prompting the U.N. to call for a seven-week pause in fighting so they can vaccinate more than half a million children. But also, because of this prospect of a Hezbollah and or Iranian for the assassination of Hezbollah's top military commander in Beirut and also the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's political bureau, in a guest house in Tehran. Both of those happening at the end of July. Now, as we've been hearing, there is still an expectation that there will be some kind of retaliation, perhaps a calibrated retaliation that doesn't drag the Israel and Iran/Hezbollah into all-out war. And that, for the moment, because of these talks, that retaliation seems to be on hold. But of course, if these talks -- if and when these -- if these talks come to nothing, and even if they do actually reach a deal, some kind of retaliation is still expected, and that's, of course, why Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the air right now to try to pressure the Israeli side to move towards doing a deal. And at the end of last week, we had the U.K. and French foreign ministers in Israel also to put pressure on the Israeli side to do a deal. So, as I say, there is perhaps hope that a deal can be done rather than optimism, but given past form over the past nine months since the last one and only ceasefire collapsed, it pays to be cautious.

The Israelis know very well that this is talk, that this is rhetoric, that this is -- you know, these are discussions and words.Whereas when it comes to actual pressure, i.e., at the United Nations Security Council and the use of the U.S. veto, the provision of aid, the provision of military assistance, the provision of weaponry. None of that is on the table. None of that has been touched. Nobody's even threatening to put this off the table. And that's what pressure is actually looks like, using the leverage that the United States has to actually ensure a change in Israeli behavior and bring Gaza to a ceasefire, but also de-escalate in the region more generally so that we don't spiral into another round of conflict with regards to Lebanon, with regards to Iran.

A lot of them are simply about international law and trying to make sure the United States holds to a consistent line when it comes to international law. They have the same demands of the Israelis as they do of the Russians when it comes to Ukraine.Now, in terms of what sort of pressure this might apply, I think that the Harris campaign is already aware that the majority of Democratic voters want a more balanced perspective presented in policy from a Democratic administration whether or not this is actually going to push the Harris administration at this juncture, you know, when the election is only a couple months away, when the Vice President Harris is still Vice President Harris, right? She serves in the Biden administration. I think is rather unlikely. I suspect that we'll see a few sort of signals to try to put people at ease or try to make sure that they realize that this is, A, much better than any Trump administration is going to give them, but also give them some hope that these change from the current Biden administration's policy.
