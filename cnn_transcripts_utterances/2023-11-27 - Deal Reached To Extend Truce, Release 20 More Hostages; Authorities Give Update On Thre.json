      "sentences": "U.S. and Israeli officials and others. If little children were released, they would have to be released with at least their mothers, if their mothers were being held as well. And Raya, the mother, the sister of Yair, is still being held. She was not released.And this is considered to be by the Israelis, the U.S. and others, a clear violation of the initial agreement. Once you release children, if they are with their parents, the parents are least as well. The children don't have to leave their parents behind. And little Hila had to leave her mother behind. And I spoke with Yair, the uncle, about all of this, and he was very, very powerful in what he was saying, obviously thrilled that he could spend a little bit of her 13th birthday together, but so, so upset that his sister was not being released. And I want to play a little clip, Dana, from our interview. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YAIR ROTEM, UNCLE OF 13-YEAR-OLD RELEASED BY HAMAS: She told me, mother is here. And they came and they took us, and they didn't give us a lot of time to prepare, but I had time to give her a hug. And Raya, my sister, her mother, was crying when the girls, the children left. And, yes, that's how it ended. And Raya is still there. She had to just say goodbye to her mother. She don't know what is going to happen with her mother. The mother is not going -- the mother doesn't know what happens with Hila. I'm sure my sister, Hila's mother, don't know what's going to be next. Are they going to set her free? Are they going to jail her again? Are they going to murder her? Hila and Emily, the first thing that they said when they met me was, yes, we've been with Raya the whole time, my sister. And Hila also told me, look at my hair. My mother cut it for me when we're in captivity. So they were together. (END VIDEO CLIP) BLITZER: Hamas put out a statement saying they didn't know where the mother was. The little girl, Hila, said she was with her mother the whole time, including at the very end. They know exactly where she is, but they refused to let her be released. As part of this deal, if a child is released, the mother is supposed to be released as well. And this is causing a lot of anger here in Israel. I got to tell you, Dana, a lot of Israelis saying this is a clear violation by Hamas, and Hamas is going to pay for this. They want those kids released, but they also want the parents released at the same times so that the children don't have to be suffering. Where's Mommy? Where's Daddy? Why aren't my parents with us right now? So they're very, very upset about this, and it's going to be a continuing issue, I'm sure, until this mother is freed.",

And according to the uncle you spoke with, they were together and she was ripped apart from her mother. It's yet another thing that is unimaginable that is happening at the hands of these barbaric terrorists.Wolf, thank you. We'll be right back to you. But first I want to talk about the hostages that have been released by Hamas. We explained that there have been about 40. There are still hundreds more inside Gaza, including Raya, as we've been just discussing. I'm joined now by Shira Havron. She knows firsthand what it feels like to be on the waiting side, on the -- part of the waiting game. But the good news, Shira -- thank you so much for being here -- is that six members of your family were finally released by Hamas over the weekend. We should say that one remains in captivity, 38-year-old Tal Shoham. But first, I just want to tell our viewers that you and I spoke on October 16. You had just been in Brussels. You were pressuring members of the European Union to push for the release of hostages. Here we are six weeks later. As I mentioned, six members of your family are free. What do you hear from them? Have you been able to speak with any of them to get a sense of their situation?",

They've been asking for weeks, where is their father? Who knows how long they didn't see him? And obviously they need him, as I said. So I'm sure it's such a shock to them, but also very exciting.

But obviously, you know, I can only imagine what they've been through. BASH: Yes, absolutely. And we should say that your grandparents were the founders of kibbutz Be'eri back in 1947. And also, as I mentioned, three members of your family, Avshalom, Eviatar and Lilach were all murdered. So may their memory be a blessing.

Ambassador Nikki Haley. They are going to be in a whole new context with each other in these next weeks ahead, and that is both on the debate stage, on the ground in organizing, and of course, in tens of millions of dollars of advertising on the airway.",

I think we're a few weeks away from that, but start owning their own framing of the narrative around these candidates. To me, the two big dynamics down at a watch. Ron DeSantis has put all his chips on Iowa at this point. In fact, coming up this coming weekend, he's going to hit his 99th county, the full Grassley, if you will, touring the entire state. He's put all his energy there. He needs to show an actual, if not outright win against Donald Trump, a clear success that boosts him out of Iowa to have staying power in this race. Nikki Haley's chosen a different strategy. She's playing in both Iowa and New Hampshire, trying to emerge from the first two contests as the last person standing against Trump to head into her native South Carolina and try to take him on there.",

She has done really well with independent-minded Republican primary voters, with suburbanites, with some of, actually, the demographics that Republicans are so eager to do well with in a general election context. But Donald Trump is still dominating with the hardcore Republicans and the like and his committed supporters. The question is, are there enough Republican primary voters, Dana swimming where Nikki Haley is fishing, or it seems perhaps not.
