(MUSIC) (END VIDEOTAPE) RAJU (on camera):  Good morning. Welcome to INSIDE POLITICS SUNDAY. I'm Manu Raju. We're just one day away from the start of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, giving Kamala Harris a crucial chance to redefine herself in the eyes of voters after her sudden ascension as her party's standard bearer less than one month ago. And new this morning, Democrats unveiling their overall theme for the convention for the people, for our future. And President Biden set to kick off the week Monday, followed by other big name speakers like Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, as well as Harris's running mate Tim Walz, and the man who wants to be the country's first ever first gentleman, Doug Emhoff. The culmination will be Thursday, when Harris addresses the nation. Now, meanwhile, CNN has a new electoral outlook this morning, underscoring just how much this race has changed and what Harris's electoral path to the White House looks like at this moment compared to Trump's. This is brand new polling out this morning shows Harris is leading the race nationwide with registered voters. It's the first major national poll where she has a lead outside the poll's margin of error, since she entered the race last month. Now, Harris is also closing the margins in the key Sun Belt battleground states of Arizona, Nevada and North Carolina, although the races are still too close to call. Now, right now, final preparations are underway in Chicago for the celebrations and the protests. So let's begin with CNN's Jeff Zeleny, who is live for us in Chicago. So, Jeff, how different will this convention look with Harris at the top of the ticket?",

When President Biden arrives to a hero's welcome. No doubt, and then will be giving his speech about his accomplishments. But looking forward to the rest of the campaign and sitting in the audience, in the convention hall will be Vice President Harris. After that, President Biden will take his leave, spending the rest of the week outside of Chicago. And it will be all about Vice President Harris. Trying to fill in some of those blanks about her biography and she will have a cast of stars doing that, of course, former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton. A big question hanging over this: Will Michelle Obama be speaking at the convention? We'll find that out in the coming days. But this is all about Vice President Harris, her plan for the country, and as you said, Manu, trying to keep that momentum alive, that's really been a remarkable shift in just the last 3 or 4 weeks in American politics. She's upended this race. No question. But Democrats hope and wonder they can keep that going.

He said, this is an entirely different moment. The police have been trained in a different way. He said protests are a central part of this convention as well. He said he wouldn't be elected without protests. But of course, the question is, will things get out of hand? Democratic officials are more concerned about what happens inside the hall. Will there be any uncommitted voters that we've seen in Michigan and other states across the country protesting the Gaza War? Will they interrupt the proceedings?

The top of the Democratic Party is sort of fractured. And you're also going to see that on Monday night. Joe Biden is going to frame Kamala as basically his successor, as one that's fighting for democracy. Now, you've already seen that Kamala Harris has really ditched a lot of the democracy January 6th rhetoric that was really at the forefront of Joe Biden's strategy. She's going to talk about freedom. She's going to talk about abortion rights. She is going to frame herself as sort of a different candidate, as in some ways, a non-incumbent trying to get some of the advantages of incumbency, but really trying to make herself the change candidate.",

It's very clear that since coming into the race, she has consolidated the Democratic base. She's a better than Biden with Black voters, with female voters, with younger voters ages to 18 to 29. So the base is starting to come home. But the difference is the independent numbers for her at this moment are not as strong as perhaps she would like. And those that same poll had the battleground states testing Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. She's still struggling in some states and independents with Trump. So if you're Harris, who do you read your -- look, you obviously need the base to come out in the election.

When you show those polls, that is what Donald Trump's team is holding on to.When you talk to senior advisers on the campaign, they point to the fact that Harris is just winning the base back, that Biden was losing in all of these categories that have just been key Democratic voting blocs. And now, she has just gone back to the point of a baseline. And that's what they hold on hope to. Now, who is she going to reach out to? That's obviously a question for you guys. But I can tell you from the conversations that I'm having, when you talk about Joe Biden at the beginning of the week, they want -- they being the Trump campaign -- want her to be continued to be linked to the -- to the current president. They believe that they can paint her as an incumbent. Now, the campaign and the candidate are obviously two different people. The candidate himself can't seem to wrap his mind around the fact that she is now at the top of the ticket. He is clearly still fixated on Joe Biden. He obviously cannot stay on message even when they give him running long runway to just focus on the economy. He manages to veer off into these personal attacks, but their focus is painting this week as a week about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that this is their joint administration and these are their policies. KANNO-YOUNGS:  I do think it's worth noting, though, that any progress made in the Sun Belt states is going to be met with a lot of enthusiasm. By the campaign, I mean, folks in the campaign were really anxious when Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket over just how low their number -- their numbers were in Nevada, and the Sun Belt states. So, any sort of increase there, which it appears that there is some increasing momentum now that Harris is at the top of the ticket, that's going to be met really positively.",

It was given the times that they were walking into a win in Georgia.There is -- no one believes that now. KANNO-YOUNGS:  It's also emblematic of just the diverse sort of coalition that Harris has. I know you were talking about independents and sort of the concern there, but I mean, the concern when Biden was at the top of the ticket was also some of the low numbers that he was getting with Black voters and Black men specifically.

So that's why they're if you talk to them, yes, they're freaking out. But at the same time they're thinking, okay, there's a chance that this levels out into a race. The big question again, and this is one that I think has been really hard for anyone on the ground to answer in a way that it wasn't hard in 2020. And 2016 is like we are in an unprecedented moment here. I mean, this late change at the top of the ticket, how voters are reacting and what exactly that means for driving voters to the polls.

The fact is that she has been so protected and so guarded these first few weeks that there is increasing scrutiny on every single thing that she is going to do. Now, the first interview is going to be really dissected and picked apart. Every single policy rollout is also going to be the same. You saw basically \"The New York Times\", \"The Washington Post\" really like be very critical of her first big policy rollout, which they essentially called price controls. And they called it basically a political gimmick. And that is the one consequence of while she's being guarded and enjoying these good vibes, there are potential consequences down the road after they get out of this convention. And just like we'll somehow get a sense in the coming weeks how voters view the onslaught of television advertising that they've been seeing, really, since she entered the race. And this effort to define who Kamala Harris is on both sides. The money has just been staggering. $118 million spent between the two parties and their groups and allied groups. Since Biden dropped out over the last month, most of which not most of it, the most going to Pennsylvania, $39 million on the Democratic side, 37 GOP and then the rest down the line.

And we're starting to get new surprising polling just as J.D. Vance is ramping up his attacks on Walz while both men have agreed to a one-on- one debate this fall. My panel is back. So let's just dig a little deeper into this new polling from ABC/\"Washington Post\" poll favorable views, unfavorable views. Vance underwater, so is Walz, but a lot of voters simply have not heard of them. But one thing is the negative impressions about Vance are increasing the more voters are hearing about him and then forming their opinions. And then look at the way the subgroups of voters view him right now. Walz versus Vance. More have positive views over Vance -- Walz over Vance. And even among some surprising groups that you think that he -- Vance would be doing better, he's still trailing with white voters, for instance 3 percent -- minus three versus Walz or basically even, you can see there on your screen.
