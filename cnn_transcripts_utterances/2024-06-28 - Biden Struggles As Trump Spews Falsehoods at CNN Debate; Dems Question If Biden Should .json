They left the children in there. They never took care of them. They never provided them with aid and care.And so that is why the D.A. -- really, it surprised everyone that there were even charges brought here. So the D.A. there should be applauded for going ahead and moving forward with bringing these charges because many people did not think that would happen. And as you said, Pete Arredondo -- he surrendered last night. He was arrested, booked, and then released. Today, we are expecting the second police officer, Adrian Gonzales, to surrender and face additional charges as well. His indictment is a bit of a surprise because there hasn't been a lot of focus on Gonzales. He was one of the first police officers on the scene there. He was assigned to the school as well. He worked for the school police department. One of the things that I found when I went back and looked at some of the investigative files was that officer, while he was first on scene, he also caused a lot of confusion by putting certain information out over the radio about what was going on inside the school that perhaps may have led to some of the confusion in officers thinking that there were no children inside that classroom that perhaps led to the delay in officers going inside that room and eventually taking out the gunman.
