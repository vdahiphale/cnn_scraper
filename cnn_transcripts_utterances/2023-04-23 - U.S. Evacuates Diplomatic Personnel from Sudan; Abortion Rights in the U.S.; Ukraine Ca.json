I'm Laila Harrak.Getting out, the United States evacuates its diplomatic personnel and their families from Sudan. Fighting there is intensifying even as a ceasefire is technically in place. And the U.S. Supreme Court has preserved access to a widely used medication abortion pill for now. How the country got to this place. And the battle for Bakhmut, why Ukraine says it needs so much more military aid to defeat Russia. France has begun evacuating its diplomatic staff from Sudan now, as well as other European officials as more fighting has erupted between rival forces in the capital, Khartoum. Well, comes hours after the U.S. also pulled out American diplomats from the country and announced that its embassy in Khartoum has been temporarily closed. U.S. President Joe Biden spoke about the situation in the region, saying, quote, this tragic violence in Sudan has already cost the lives of hundreds of innocent civilians. It's unconscionable and it should and must stop. The belligerent parties must implement an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, allow unhindered humanitarian access and respect the will of the people of Sudan. A U.S. defense department official says fewer than 100 people were pulled out of Sudan in what he called a fast and clean operation. CNN's Kevin Liptak has the details.",

So, we can safely say that this was ordered by President Biden and you have seen him take steps over the last several days to prepare for this eventuality, including prepositioning military assets resources equipment in Djibouti.The U.S. has a large military base there. But you've also seen this effort in Khartoum to consolidate the American personnel who are working there into the American diplomatic compound into the embassy. That's been described to me as a fortress-like structure. It has taken some time to get all of the personnel into that facility. The roads in Khartoum are extremely unsafe. And so that was sort of a process that took place over the last several days. But we did hear from the State Department earlier today that all American personnel where accounted for and were in a safe location. We also did hear from an official with the National Security Council earlier today that said that they had made clear to both sides of this conflict, both of the warring factions, that they are responsible for ensuring protection of civilians and non-combatants. So, certainly, everything was sort of building up to this moment. But we should be clear that the U.S. says -- has said that those preparations were for American diplomatic personnel, people who worked for the American government only. This does not include private citizens, Private American citizens who remain in Khartoum. And the U.S. has said that they has given ample warning to private citizens who may remain in Sudan that it is not safe, but that it does not have the resources at the moment to facilitate a broad scale military evacuation of private citizens.",

Certain countries may have their favorites among the contenders, but nobody wants this war to proceed.

It's really a mechanism that tries to save the rainforest and at the same time delivers the cheapest type of carbon reductions that one can find, much cheaper, for instance, than converting a power plant or investing in electric vehicles.So, basically, if Brazil is able to prove that it has reduced deforestation from one year to the order, it can then claim payments from other countries. Norway, historically, has been the country that most contributed to that, over a billion U.S. dollars, and also some others, like Germany, were part of this effort.

He's been advocating for conservation and for the sovereign management of the coastal waters of his nation, which is the Kitasoo/Xaixais nation. So, they have created the Kitasoo/Xaixais Bay MPA. And it's amazing because that is their bread basket. And he's done an incredible job of not just leading his people but bringing the rest of Canada to his point of view.",

It's a holding area for herring, so that's where they all gather.I think indigenous knowledge is super important and I think it needs to be integrated and all of the management that's out there, whether it's wildlife management, fisheries management, oceans management. We have a belief that if you take care of the land, the land will take care of you. And so that's ingrained in all of our work here. It doesn't matter if it (INAUDIBLE) in tourism, if it's economic development. We want to make sure that we have a place that the world can enjoy. If we don't have protection, we know that we're going to be in trouble. Kitasoo Ebay was declared by the (INAUDIBLE) chiefs, supported by the community, and it was launched. So, the rest the world knows about it. We've engaged provincial governments, federal governments. We've engaged stakeholders, letting everyone know that it's closed. We've left the document open to collaborate. We're in this era of reconciliation and how do we work together. There're laws and practices that we practiced for thousands of years, and those practices are geared towards conservation and sustainability and stewardship. And so I think when we are writing our management plan, like the Kitasoo Bay management plan, that is our opportunity to indigenize some of these policies. This island is called Marvin Island. This is probably one of the most important seasonal harvesting areas we have. And so herring eggs is super important for the community. It's one of the first foods you would have access to after a long winter. What happens when the hearing come in and lay all their eggs? People harvest the eggs and they would prepare him right here on the island.",

Together, they live in less than 20 percent of the land surface of Planet Earth, but they manage 80 percent of the biodiversity. So, should we be letting them make more decisions about how their territories are managed? Absolutely.",

That bay has sustained this community for thousands of years, so it's really important that that bay survives. But I also hope that this provides a model for all these other protected areas all over the world. I think Kitasoo Bay is a very strong example of what we can do.(END VIDEOTAPE)",
