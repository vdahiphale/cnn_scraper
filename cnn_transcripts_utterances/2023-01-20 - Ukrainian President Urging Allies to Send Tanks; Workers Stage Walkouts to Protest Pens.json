The Bradleys, the Strikers in particular, are, you know, sort of not exactly simple pieces of equipment to operate. They're not nearly as complex as the M1 Abrams tank, but they will require some training and support. There's other aspects in the package, additional ammunition for the HIMARS capability, additional air defense capabilities. All of these are really important.

There's a possibility that it could occur from Belarus towards Kyiv, but that's more likely to occur later in the year.But even so, the Russians have been mobilizing massive forces in preparation and anticipation for these offensives. So, it really would help the Ukrainians if, firstly, the German Chancellor would give the OK for European actors that operate the Leopard to send that to Ukraine. And secondly, for Germany to send their own Leopards. And thirdly, for the Americans to send some M1s to make sure that the Germans are on board.",

Because Putin will be emboldened. He'll have time to reinforce and rebuild his forces in anticipation of relaunching the war in Ukraine in a few years' time, or even attacking NATO directly. So, if Chancellor Scholz wants to avoid that escalation, the way to do it is to defeat the Russians here and now and to deter Russian aggression in the future, probably by bringing Ukraine into NATO.",

Maybe that's an indication they should be thinking about simpler tanks in the future.But they also need to be stepping up in terms of providing Ukrainians with longer range fires, including attacking missiles. But the real concern at the moment is the Germans and whether the Germans are going to burden share as appropriate alongside their NATO partners at the critical moment where NATO and Europe and Ukraine is threatened by an aggressive expansionist, Russia, if they don't step, they don't step up to that task, then there has to be real concerns about whether Germany would, in fact, burden share and do the required thing under Article Five of the NATO alliance in another crisis that could threaten, for example, the Baltic States or Romania.",

They were exacerbated during COVID and by the recent cost of living increases.And so, I think they were put on pause. And we're seeing some of that coming back here now. What's interesting about Emmanuel Macron's retirement proposal here, always a very sensitive and emotional issue in France is I think there really -- there are two components. There's, on the one hand, measures that, you know, that people support, such as providing a minimum level of retirement and costs and contingencies that are made for those who started working at a very young age or very difficult jobs, or that were not able to contribute to their pension plan because they were taking care of elderly or disabled and family members. But the other aspect which Melissa alluded to there is this increase from 62 to 64 and the fact that the contribution years are extended to 43 years.

And I think that he's already had recourse to Article 493, or his Prime Minister had to push legislation through without it having to go to a vote. But that's increasingly problematic for something of this kind of side.And I think that Macron's position is weakened to the extent that he will be termed out in 2027 and the folks around him are concerned about reelection and they're concerned about the future of the party. And ss this continues and we'll see how this plays out. The big question is going to be whether it's worth for Macron to win this particular battle when the electoral war may be lost down the road, given the level and the degree to which these measures are so incredibly unpopular.",
