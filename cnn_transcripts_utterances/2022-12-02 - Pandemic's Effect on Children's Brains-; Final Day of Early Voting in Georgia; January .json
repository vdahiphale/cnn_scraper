It's the U.S. economy, and this week's ping-pong match of conflicting key economic indicators is enough to give you whiplash this Friday. Let's start with the good; 263,000 jobs were added last month. Unemployment held steady. But the hope was these numbers wouldn't be so strong. And that's because it could lead to more monster rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. It's trying to cool the decades-high inflation hitting so many American families hard, and President Biden this morning talking up the good.

We didn't get a Goldilocks number.We got too hot, 263,000 jobs added last month. That is more than expected. There has been a bit of a slowdown. But it's been pretty glacial. As you can see on that chart, you almost need a magnifying glass to see that slowdown the last few months. Some sectors did lose jobs. We had retail, transportation, temporary help, all of them were down. But, otherwise, there's a lot of demand for workers. We saw strong job gains for leisure and hospitality, health care, government, construction. All of them were up. Now, the part of the jobs report that is really getting the attention of investors and economists is wages. The hope coming in and the expectation was that wages would cool off, which would actually be seen as good news, because that would take some pressure off of inflation. That did not happen. Wages actually heated up 5.1 percent year over year. Context, that's about twice the pace of pre-COVID. That suggests strong demand for workers. That is not what the Fed wants. That's actually the opposite of what the Federal Reserve wants. Now...",

The bad, this report is going to probably embolden the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates, not just at the upcoming meeting this month, but into next year. And that is a concern, because the more the Fed does, the greater the risk that they slow this economy so much that they accidentally cause a recession. But the good news -- it's a Friday -- let's end on good news -- is that there's really nothing about today's report that speaks of an imminent recession. And, obviously, that is relief. No one wants to see this jobs market fall off a cliff, gets so cold that it's ice cold. And it's not. It's not. So, for now, the jobs market continues to chug along.

Let me just tell you, Ana, in a typical month, in the United States, roughly six million people separate from their employers. This is the natural state of an economy. Some people are getting jobs, some people are losing jobs. And what normally happens is all that's going on in the less sexy companies. What's happening right now is, they're in big headline- making companies. Now, let me ask you a question.

That instead suggests an inflation problem. And that's the reality for many families. So, yes, the good news is, 2022 Christmas should be a little bit more normal than the last couple.

And here's what this panel wrote: \"The law is clear. We cannot write a rule that allows any subject of a search warrant to block government investigations after the execution of the warrant, nor can we write a rule that allows only former presidents to do so.\" Trump has until Thursday next week to appeal this to the Supreme Court. Meantime, today, the January 6 Committee huddled for one of its final meetings. This panel is racing now to tie up the loose ends before Republicans take the House in January. And when you hold 1,000 witness interviews or you have that many people that come before you, there could be a lot of loose ends.

We used to get them all the time when I was a prosecutor. A criminal referral does not require prosecutors to do anything, and they don't need a criminal referral in order to investigate. And, in fact here, we know that DOJ is already investigating Donald Trump. Why? Because Merrick Garland, two weeks ago, when he appointed the special counsel, Jack Smith, said that's for our Trump investigations. They haven't received a referral yet. That said, the committee might want to make a strong sort of final political statement in its final days. And if they do make a referral, they're going to have to figure out, what does that look like? Do they name names? Do they specify Donald Trump? Do they specify those around him, John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark, Rudy Giuliani, Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, and Michael Flynn? Do they specify what particular crimes they believe might have been committed? Also, a really important issue to me, will the committee give all their evidence over to DOJ? DOJ has been asking for that evidence for months now. They have gotten some of it, but not all, we know, because Merrick Garland told us the other day, he said at his press conference, we would like to have all the transcripts and all the other evidence, so that we can use it in the ordinary course of investigations. Now, the committee members since then have said they will get it. But if they do, Ana, that's going to be really important evidence for the criminal investigations.",

First, the January 6 Committee itself has to vote for contempt. Then it goes to the full House of Representatives, where you need a majority vote of the House. And, of course, the House will remain under Democratic control for the next month or so. And if that happens, it goes over to DOJ, and they get to decide whether to prosecute., this has happened four times already. Excuse me. Steve Bannon. He was charged, tried convicted and now he is serving -- or he is he is sentenced to four months. He's not begun serving that yet. Peter Navarro was charged with criminal contempt of Congress. His trial will be next year. But DOJ declined to bring charges against Mark Meadows and Dan Scavino. So what did they do about their colleagues, Kevin McCarthy and four other Republican House members? Look, they have not sought content thus far. They have had many months to do it. And they're well aware that, a month or so from now, these guys are going to be the majority. They're going to have subpoena power. The committee may not want to pick that particular fight. And then, finally, what do they do about Donald Trump? Remember, the last thing that committee did at the very last hearing was announce their big subpoena to Donald Trump. Of course, he has fought them. He has gone to court. The committee has come in with some hot rhetoric. They have said: \"The truth is that Donald Trump, like several of his closest allies, is hiding from the committee's investigation. He is obligated to provide answers to the American people.\" There's no indication they're going to seek contempt on Donald Trump. I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for that.

Presumably, they're not going to be focusing on Donald Trump's role so much. And let's also remember they're going to go even farther into this. Kevin McCarthy tweeted on the day of the Mar-a-Lago search warrant: \"Attorney General Garland, preserve your documents and clear your calendar.\" So I think the new Republican majority is going to try to bring Merrick Garland up, have him answer questions.

I mean, we know that these types of changes that they saw in the brain are often associated with the symptoms that you see there on the screen, anxiety and depression, what we call these internalized problems, sadness, low self-esteem, fear, and just challenge regulating emotions. They did not see, interestingly, in the study, an increase in what are known as externalizing symptoms, where you have rule-breaking behavior, violence, aggression.
