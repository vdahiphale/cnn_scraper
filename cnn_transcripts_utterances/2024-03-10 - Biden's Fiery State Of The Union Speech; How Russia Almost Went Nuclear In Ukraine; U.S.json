Number one, you saw Speaker Mike Johnson throughout the evening barely suppressing sort of his uncomfortableness with the speech and he has been very non- committal, including in an interview that he gave to reporters after the speech on Friday morning where he's still refusing to even allow the matter of the $60 billion in additional military assistance and other assistance for Ukraine that Biden has asked for, he's still not agreeing to bring it to a vote, which is really tantamount to killing it in the sense that it would pass if it got to the floor.But for months now, remember, Biden set up this request back in the fall in October and first was asking for more aid as early as last August. So it's been months and months of delay, which is tantamount to, you know, leading to direct setbacks and deaths on the battlefield in Ukraine. The other thing that he did, Fareed, that I thought was very interesting is he's making an explicit connection between Trump's threats to American democracy and Vladimir Putin's threats to democracy in Europe.

And so that argument doesn't work for them.But I do believe it was very smart for Biden to start with Ukraine. And a lot of people were surprised by that because the war is not going as well right now but he knows that majority of the men and women in that room support him on Ukraine. And they applauded. And that includes Speaker Johnson. He didn't stand but he did applaud when Biden was saying we can't let these people down. We have to actually continue to provide support. And privately Johnson has been working with Democrats and Republicans in the Senate saying we want to find a way to bring this to a vote.

So the Israelis are acting with impunity here. I liked the fact that Biden and Jake Sullivan and the rest invited Benny Gantz to talk to them directly. Netanyahu told him not to go. The exactly the opposite of what Netanyahu did to Biden and Obama when he came to talk to the Republicans in 2015 because of the Iranian nuclear deal. Why was -- where was Biden five months ago on this? He looks weak. It looks late. It's the one place where the Democrats, State of the Union, were holding up signs saying ceasefire now, so one place there were demonstrations outside of the Capitol that actually blocked some of the streets beforehand.

In other words, yes, you may lose a certain number of people in Michigan and you may lose a certain number of people, but generally speaking, those we will often don't vote on foreign policy, you know -- but if you were to shift support from Israel that would be, you know, Jewish Americans are overwhelmingly Democratic.

Israel, earlier on that it was the president and himself who has determined this and that in a way Netanyahu, being aware of that has played Biden, has played the American government. Remember the political dynamic on Israels end as well, which is Netanyahu is incredibly unpopular. Right now. There's a sense that many Israelis want to hold him to account for this, but that as long as the war goes on, they're not going to do that. Netanyahu has a built-in incentive to continue this conflict. This is in direct opposition in many ways to the political imperative of his supporter, Joe Biden here in the United States, who needs it to be over as soon as possible and on your point on Michigan, yes, it's true that over all this might not be a voting issue for Americans, but if the election once against comes down to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, remember Hillary Clinton only lost that state by 10,000 votes in 2016.",

Then I think we realized extreme concern to the point where I'm told, and this is a direct quote, that the U.S. was preparing rigorously for that very possibility.This was late summer, early fall 2022. At the time, you'll remember, Russian forces were getting pushed back from Kherson, which was their biggest prize from the invasion. And there were thousands of Russian troops that were in danger of being surrounded by Ukrainian forces. That was one input to a broader calculus, which led the U.S. to an assessment that Russia was very much considering a tactical nuclear weapon strike in Ukraine. There were other pieces to it. Beyond that threat, the U.S. assessment of the Russian military doctrine as it relates to nuclear weapons use, which is -- which is somewhat foggy. It's not quite clear was that that was the kind of threat where Putin might calculate it was necessary to use nuclear weapon. At the same time, Russian officials began to speak openly about what they claimed was a Ukrainian dirty bomb plan, a plan to have a radioactive weapons strike which the read from the U.S. was was that this was a cover.",

There was one more piece to this, and this made it even far more serious, is that the U.S. received intelligence, communications among Russian military officers discussing that very possibility of a use of nuclear weapons. And this then led U.S. officials to go on really an international full-court press to prevent this from happening. Direct contact with Russian officials, getting allies on board as well.

And of course, this is Ukrainian territory, but Russia had claimed it was their own.And the other piece that was concerning was this because tactical weapon -- nuclear weapons are small enough, the U.S. was concerned because they weren't certain they would know if Russia had moved those weapons into place. They're small enough to move around and they could be fired from conventional systems that were already on the battlefield.

The word Israel actually translates to something like struggles with God and comes from a story in the Bible. Well, my next guest says this kind of struggling is fundamental to what it means to be a Jew today as his new book is called.Noah Feldman is a professor at the Harvard Law School. Noah, pleasure to have you on. Now, you are one of the most important scholars of constitutional law in the country. You've written incredible books about all kinds of other things. You have read the constitution of Iraq. Did you -- did you ever think you would write a book about being Jewish and why are you doing it? NOAH FELDMAN, AUTHOR, \"TO BE A JEW TODAY\": I actively thought I would never write a book about being Jewish, even though being Jewish is hugely important to me and I was raised in a traditionally observant home and have studied Judaism most of my life, because I thought of it as a personal thing that no one would really want to hear what I thought about. And as my kids got ready to go off to college, I started thinking about how different their experience was going to be with respect to being Jewish than mine was back when I did. And that got me thinking, this is long before October 7, about three years ago, about how things have changed in the Jewish world, how beliefs have changed, how politics has changed, and really how the experience of being Jewish has changed. ZAKARIA: And what do you think is the central message or the difference you want to talk about, about being a Jew today?",

At the same time, not everybody agrees, even who is in the family. You know, it's a modern family with divorce and adoption and marriage and all sorts of people showing up.For a lot of Jews Israel has become very central to defining what their Jewish experience is, whether they like it or not. And that's driving in turn real conflict within the Jewish community, especially generational conflict between Jews who are still closely identified with Israel and see that is central to being Jewish, but who are themselves relatively liberal or progressive people in many cases and believed that Judaism is social justice. And then a younger generation of folks, many of them on college campuses, who are also like their parents, committed to the idea that being Jewish means being committed to social justice but who don't necessarily see Israel as fitting that paradigm. They're being critical of Israel in a way that their parents or their grandparents just consider to be shocking and mistaken and in some way a betrayal of their Jewishness. And so, what I'm trying to do in the book is account for all of these different ways that people are experiencing being Jewish and to try to remind everybody that it's OK -- that it's OK to have disagreement because as you mentioned, being Jewish is fundamentally about combining the love and the struggle. And that's because it's like being in a family and families are where we get our first experience of love and belonging, but they're also where we get our first experiences of struggle often.",

Sometimes they would be called modern Orthodox. The idea is that these are folks who both adhere to the tradition and also move freely in the modern world and their numbers are interestingly also growing. And they tend to be very Zionist and very committed to the project of Israel as central to their religious experience. So, you actually have this big diversity and the ultra-Orthodox, the Haredi whom you mentioned, they're rising in numbers too, because they have a much higher birth rate.
