The latest on the urgent rescue efforts. Then, leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and Brazil -- Brazil again, are meeting for a summit that could attract more countries to join the so-called BRICS economic bloc. We'll discuss the implications. And a real estate tycoon with relatively little political experience to become Thailand's new Prime Minister. While we begin in Pakistan, where an extremely risky mission is underway to rescue eight people, including six children trapped in a chairlift in Pakistan's mountainous northwest. Two army helicopters have rushed to the scene. Video shows the cable car stranded nearly 275 meters above a ravine. Officials say the children were heading to school in the Gondola when one of the cables snapped. CNN Sophia Saifi joins us live from Islamabad. An extremely difficult operation in a very remote area. What progress are they making, Sophia?",

      "sentences": "Max, the entire country's eyes have been on this operation. We're not broadcasting it live on local television at the moment because it's such a precarious and risky rescue operation. These children were going to school early morning in that part of the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and the roads in that region, it's a beautiful region of the country, but it's also incredibly impoverished.So the children and the communities that connect each other to those valleys, they make their own sort of hokey cable cars that they use to commute from one valley to the next. So these children were on their school run in the morning when one of the cables detached. And so they've been hanging inside this almost cage like situation above this precarious valley, where below there's only rocky terrain and some streams 900 feet below them. An operation has been underway. But there is a lot of precariousness regarding the rescue operation. There are SSG commandos who have arrived there. They're in two helicopters. The helicopters themselves have to be incredibly careful because the movement of the helicopters is, according to rescue officials on the scene, causing the one cable that this cable car is hanging on to move rather precariously. So it's a very fragile and sensitive operation. Those children and their two teachers have been hanging up there since about 9:00 in the morning. It's going to be a sundown in about two hours from now, which is going to make this rescue even more difficult as the sun sets. So a lot of concern, a lot of efforts underway to make sure that they are rescued, but again, not being broadcast live, but the prayers and hopes of the entire country are with those eight people stuck in that cable car in Battagram in Khyber.

And there's a long list of countries who are trying to draw -- join, including Saudi Arabia, Democratic Republic of Congo, the Emiratis, are all trying to join this grouping.And you do get a sense just being here. I was at the last brick summit in South Africa. There is a lot more frigging here at this one. And I think part of that, to be honest, is because of the war in Ukraine. This is seen as a potential alternative for countries that may not be wholeheartedly criticizing Russia and are more sitting on the fence. That's something the South African president has spoken about frequently. How these countries join and who exactly join is still very much under intense debate. It is also an odd grouping BRICS. You have the world's biggest autocracy in China, the world's biggest democracy in India. But the question is, what holds them together? And I asked an analyst that exact question.

And in one sense at least, some analysts believe, because the G7 and the G20 seem to have faulted in terms of having a unified voice on topics outside of Ukraine, that there is an opportunity here for the, quote, unquote, \"global south\".

Srettha Thavisin has relatively little experience of politics, but still won the backing of both houses of Parliament in a vote just hours ago. His election came just hours after former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra returned to the country after 15 years in exile. Thai courts have convicted Thaksin of corruption and he was promptly arrested upon his arrival back in the country. CNN's Paula Hancocks is here to explain all that's going on in politics and quite a scene to see Thaksin come back to the country.",

      "sentences": "It has been an extremely busy day in Thai politics, Max, to be certain. So what has happened in the parliament is, as you say, a new prime minister has been voted for. Now, this is not the party that actually won the election, it's the party that won the second most votes. And this is causing some concern within the voters of Thailand as well.The fact is that the Move Forward party who won the most votes has been sidelined. They are not even part of this coalition which Pheu Thai, the ruling party now has created. It has also come under controversy because Pheu Thai has decided to align themselves instead of -- with the progressive parties, with two military-backed parties. They had been campaigning, saying that military needed to be taken out of politics in Thailand and presumably that's why some people voted for them. But they have said that they needed to form this coalition to break this political deadlock that had been going on for about three months in Thailand. So that's the political situation at this point. And as for the former prime minister who was ousted in a military coup back in 2006, he is in a correctional facility at the moment. He has been sentenced to eight years in prison, although there is speculation he may well serve less than that and speculation that he may have comeback to Thailand to ask for a royal pardon. Experts say that certainly is a possibility. Now we understand from doctors who examined him once he went into this correctional facility that Thaksin Shinawatra does have underlying health issues and that he will be kept in a separate room to the regular inmates and he will be under 24 hours observation. So that's the latest situation with Thaksin Shinawatra as well. Of course, there are millions of voters who are disappointed this evening that the party that they voted for and the party with the most votes was not the one able to form a government, move forward, had tried to form a government, but was blocked by the conservative military-backed parties. And certainly there is some disillusionment from the younger voters who wanted to see more structural change within Thailand and who voted for that party. Max?",

Trump has announced on social media that he plans to turn himself in at the Fulton County Jail in Georgia on Thursday. The former president has been indicted on 13 felony counts in the 2020 Georgia election subversion probe.There are 18 co-defendants in the case, but unlike the other defendants, the terms of Trump's release comes with a lot more strings attached. So could Donald Trump actually go to jail? Let's bring in CNN Senior Legal Analyst and former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Elie Honig. Thank you so much for joining us. We now have bond agreements in place for some of the 19 defendants. What exactly does that mean and how do these bonds work?",

      "sentences": "So, Max, there are two conditions, really, on each of the people who have agreements right now. First of all, there's a cash component where the person is responsible if they fail to show up for a set amount of money. In Donald Trump's case, that's $200,000. That doesn't mean he has to go write a check for $200,000 right now. It means that if he fails to show, he will be on the hook for that.The second part of this, and this really relates most strongly to Donald Trump, is restrictions on what the person can do or say. Now, this is a complicated issue because Donald Trump, of course, he has First Amendment rights as an American citizen, and he's running for president. But the restrictions that the judge has set here is that Donald Trump cannot threaten or intimidate any of his co-defendants, any known witness, or any known victim. And if he violates any of those conditions, then the judge can either increase the bail conditions, make them more severe, or in extreme cases, can send the person to prison. I think it's virtually impossible, very, very unlikely that will happen here because Donald Trump is a leading candidate for president.",

      "sentences": "Sure. Well, he will post the bond. He's agreed to do that. But Max, it's important to understand, in the American system, people do get remanded sent to prison because they violate their bail conditions all the time. It was a fairly routine occurrence.When I was a prosecutor, we just saw a high profile example here in the United States when Sam Bankman-Fried, who's been charged with a massive fraud relating to his crypto trading platform, he violated the terms of his bails and he was locked up. So now he will wait his trial in prison. So this does happen, not infrequently, but I think it's very unlikely that we see a candidate of the stature of Donald Trump remanded just because that's going to pose such political and First Amendment issues.",

The prior cases, as you say, they've decided not to take a mugshot. But here it looks like the Georgia authorities will do that.And it's important to note, if there is a mugshot, the laws really vary state by state. But under Georgia law, it's very likely that we will see that mugshot in the public quite quickly. And who knows what political meaning that will carry. I'm sure Trump's team wants to use it a certain way. I'm sure the DA is worried about what political and broader implications that could have.
