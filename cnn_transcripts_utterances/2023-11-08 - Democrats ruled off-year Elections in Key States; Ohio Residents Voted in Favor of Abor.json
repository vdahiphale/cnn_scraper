And he made abortion rights a major issue in his campaign. In Mississippi, CNN projects Republican Governor Tate Reeves has won a second term, defeating Brandon Presley, the second cousin of rock legend Elvis. In Virginia, Democrats have taken full control of the state legislatures hanging onto the Senate and flipping the House of Delegates. Abortion was not directly on the ballot, but was a motivating issue for Democrats. In the key swing state of Ohio, voters delivered a strong rebuke to Republicans trying to restrict abortion access. The right to an abortion is now enshrined in the state constitution. Ohio also voted to legalize recreational marijuana, becoming the 24th state to do so. Well more now on that historic abortion vote in Ohio. CNN's Kyung Lah reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KYUNG LAH, CNN SR. U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Abortion rights will be enshrined in Ohio's state constitution. That is the result here in Ohio. According to CNN projections, it is the first Republican state to take such a move. And this was a hard battle fought on both sides of what's known as issue one, the effort to enshrine those rights in the state constitution. When CNN called the results of this election projecting the results. I want you to take a listen to this room. It is a watch party of those who supported Issue One. (VIDEO PLAYING) You can hear the cheering for yourself. Others, I actually saw a woman burst into tears. It was jubilation as those results were read. Now, the supporters of issue one say that they won by trying to keep this as nonpartisan an issue as possible, urging voters that this was about keeping government out of their lives. The group that was against Issue One said in a statement, it is heartbroken, but it will regroup and aim. to 2024 in battleground states. And in regard to those battleground states, it's sending shockwaves through states like Arizona, where abortion rights advocates there are also trying to get such a measure on that 2024 ballot.

You can't just kind of wave them away from these election results. But I think the message for Republicans is that the biggest problem they have had in the last few elections, really, since Trump became the dominant figure in the party, is still there, which is that in these well-educated and diverse, populous and mostly prosperous inner suburbs, there are too many voters who question whether Democrats are delivering for their interests, who still won't vote for Republicans because they consider them a threat to their rights and their values and to democracy itself.And it does suggest that it is premature to assume that all of those doubts about Donald Trump and the kind of the Trump-era GOP cultural agenda have dissipated in those places. I think right now the polls are telling us that we are seeing a lot of dissatisfaction with Biden. That is primarily what is being registered in the polls. What these election results are telling us is that when you have campaigns that can focus voters on the choice and ask them to also consider whatever their doubts about Democrats, whether they want Trump-style Republicans in position to implement their agenda on abortion, on book bans, on voting and other issues, you can get a very different result in a broad array of states, but consistently in those big suburban and urban population centers.

I'm Rosemary Church and this is \"CNN Newsroom.\"An update on the latest U.S. elections now. One of the big takeaways is that abortion rights matter to many voters in crucial swing states. Democrats are celebrating key wins in Virginia where they swept the legislature, hanging on to the Senate and taking control of the House of Delegates. That's after the Virginia governor vowed to outlaw abortion after 15 weeks, in most cases, had Republicans one full control. In deeply-Republican Kentucky, Democratic Governor Andy Beshear won re-election after campaigning on reproductive rights. And in Ohio, voters have chosen to enshrine abortion rights in their state constitution. Some senior U.S. House Republicans are downplaying the Ohio ballot measure, insisting abortion won't be a driving issue in next year's major elections. But Ohio's Jim Jordan expressed disappointment with his state's decision. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): I'm on the side of protecting the sanctity of human life. I'm worried that there are going to be less kids who are going to enjoy life and be able to experience the gift of life that because of this issue that's now in the Constitution. (END VIDEO CLIP) And here you can see all the states where abortion is banned or restricted since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs Wade last year. Ohio is among the green states where it is legal. The orange states show where abortion is banned. CNN's Jeff Zeleny picks up the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: For the next year, as Republicans try to win the Senate, keep their narrow majority in the House, and indeed win back the White House, abortion will be front and center in their strategy. The lessons of Tuesday night's elections in Virginia, in Ohio, and in Kentucky, certainly serve as a reminder that abortion is still a very potent issue, and now it has become a motivating factor for Democrats. Of course, since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade with the Dobbs decision a little more than a year ago, there are so many examples now, election after election, where Republicans are largely on the losing side of this argument. We're going to see much of this discussion at a Republican presidential debate here in Miami on Wednesday. There has been a difference of viewpoint to some degree about the way forward on abortion. Nikki Haley, for example, the former South Carolina governor, has tried to strike somewhat of a middle ground. Now, Donald Trump, for his part, will not be participating in the debate, but he has tried to not dwell on abortion. He believes it's a losing issue in the words that he has spoken to some of his advisors. But look for Democrats to try and turn this to their advantage over the next year. In fact, it could be one of their big motivating factors. So there is no doubt, as Republicans try to win control of the Senate, hold their narrow majority in the House, and win back the White House, abortion will be front and center.
