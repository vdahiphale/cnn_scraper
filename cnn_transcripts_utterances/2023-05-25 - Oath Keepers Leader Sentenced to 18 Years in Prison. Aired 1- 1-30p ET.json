He will be spending 18 years in federal prison for the crimes he committed, up to and including on January 6, as he gathered those Oath Keepers to Washington, D.C., and then they went inside the Capitol, and when he was leading the organization and wanting to essentially foment violence in the United States because of what the government was doing, because of the transfer of power from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. The judge, Amit Mehta, is just finishing his speech to Rhodes and delivering that sentence right now. And he is fully aware, you can tell by what the judge is saying, how worried he is for the ongoing threat that -- this political extremism that Stewart Rhodes espouses even today. He -- the judge just asked: \"I dare say we now hold our collective breath when an election is approaching. Do we have another January 6? It remains to be seen.\" And then he pointed out to Rhodes how much Rhodes is not showing any remorse at all, and that how he is believing, fro what Stewart Rhodes just said in the courtroom to him today, that Rhodes is ready to take up arms the moment he is released from prison, that now we know that will be many, many years from now; 18 years is what the sentence is at this time -- Brianna.",

And so there is the possibility that he could get a much lighter sentence, or at least a lighter sentence, than Stewart Rhodes today. We know that 18 years for Stewart Rhodes. The Justice Department was asking for more than that. We know too that Kelly Meggs, the Justice Department wants 21 years for him. It doesn't look like he would get that much amount of time, but we don't know yet exactly how his sentencing will go. That is not until 1:30 this afternoon. But Judge Mehta really does have some harsh words for Stewart Rhodes today and how much of a threat seditious, conspiracy and what these men did, what the Oath Keepers did on January 6 did to shake the foundation of democracy and the transfer of power.",

He believes that there is a criminal regime governing the United States. He believes he is a political prisoner. But Judge Mehta said to him:  No, you are not.

The Oath Keepers and Rhodes were waiting for President Trump at the time to basically call them and invoke the Insurrection Act to take over the Capitol and block the transfer of power. And when they failed on January 6, Rhodes continued to send messages to his group essentially saying that maybe they should consider -- maybe they should regroup and continue to figure this out. So that is really part of what this case is. And, yesterday, whenever the Justice Department was beginning to lay out some of their arguments for this sentencing today, they were reading back to back many of the things that Stewart Rhodes was saying and brought it up again today, that how often he talked about fighting, about bloody revolution, about civil war. And then, after that, the judge acknowledged today that there had -- was no documented message of Stewart Rhodes ever expressing regret after January 6 in the many, many messages that he sent.",

And when I heard the words that Stewart Rhodes said, it made it clear to me that he is playing for a pardon. He knows he's going to be serving years in prison, and he thinks his best chance to get out of prison is not by showing remorse. It's not on appeal.

It's politically charged for a reason.

And, also, the case with the Mar-a-Lago documents, that's a clear-cut one. That is easy for prosecutors. But you know what? This was a risk that paid off for Merrick Garland, and it could make Jack Smith more confident and emboldened to go for it and charge the former president. One interesting tie between the defendants, the Oath Keepers, and Trump's inner circle is that one of the Oath Keeper defendants was in a separate group providing security for Roger Stone on January 6. So, if they're going to continue to flip these -- these individuals, that could lead to Trump's inner circle and then eventually perhaps to Trump himself.
