Garland defending the Justice Department against the barrage of GOP attacks.Also tonight, Trump campaigns in Iowa, sharpening his focus on the first Republican presidential contest. This as a brand new CNN poll now reveals who's on the rise and who's sliding in another critical early battleground, I'm talking about New Hampshire. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy facing a new disappointment during his U.S. visit. Sources now say the Biden administration is not expected to grant his request for longer-range missiles when he visits the White House tomorrow. Zelenskyy telling me that scenario would be a, quote, loss for his country during our one- on-one interview. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. Let's get right to our top story tonight, a verbal assault on the U.S. attorney general by some of the most hardline Republican critics of the U.S. Justice Department. Let's go straight to CNN's Sara Murray. She's got all the fireworks. Sara, some GOP lawmakers laid into the attorney general, Merrick Garland, and he pushed back rather hard. SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf. In many ways, what we saw today was a preview of this impeachment inquiry Republicans are embarking on. They were pressing the attorney general for more specifics, particularly when it relates to a criminal investigation into the president's son, Hunter Biden, and they got what I'm sure to Republicans are very unsatisfying answers as the attorney general punted on several questions involving sensitive, ongoing investigations.

It was back to the drawing board. They've spent the last two days in and out of meetings trying to come up with a compromise that will get the support of their entire GOP conference, including a number of hardliners who said they would oppose that GOP plan. But, Wolf, it might all be for nothing because I am told that in today's meeting Matt Gaetz stood up and said he knows of seven Republican colleagues who would not vote for any short-term spending bill under any circumstances. Now, it's unclear if that number is true. After that, another member, Randy Weber, stood up and said, all of those seven people, please stand up and identify yourself. Only one of them did, Cory Mills of Florida. But it really speaks to the challenges that leadership is facing because they can't afford to lose seven members. If they do, that means they're going to need to look to Democrats to try to fund the government. And that could be a risky proposition for Kevin McCarthy, who's being warned by his right flank member not to work with Democrats or he could be ousted as speaker.

We're joined now by Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat of the House Judiciary Committee and the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Congresswoman, thanks so much for joining us. As you know, House Republicans spent much of the day today grilling the attorney general of the United States over the Hunter Biden probe. Are you satisfied with the way Garland answered these questions? And is the White House doing enough, do you believe, to push back on the allegations that the president benefited directly from Hunter Biden's business dealings? REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Well, if it's good to see you. Look, I think the attorney general did an excellent job today. He was very calm. He did not take their bait. You know, frankly, he was asked over and over and over again about the Hunter Biden case, about David Weiss. He reminded people of the simple fact that Mr. Weiss was actually appointed as U.S. attorney by Donald Trump and he had full latitude from Attorney General Garland to conduct whatever investigation he wanted to conduct. And that is consistent with Mr. Weiss' testimony as well. And so I think that Republicans came away with absolutely nothing. But it is -- it was sad to me, Wolf. You know, I've been on the Judiciary Committee for seven years and I have just seen it increasingly be transformed into this soapbox for absurd, baseless conspiracy theories. And I think it is unfortunate because it is undermining government institutions. It's feeding lies to the American public. And I do think that is detrimental to our democracy. The attorney general had a lot of good work that he could have talked about, about issues that Americans really care about, like gun violence and, you know, fentanyl and abortion rights, which was what I focused my questioning on.

Then he started an impeachment inquiry into President Biden to try and preserve his House speakership. That didn't work. And the reality is now he can't even pass the 11 bills for funding the government with a majority in the party. He can't get agreement to bring those bills to the floor from his own majority.

It was also the governor here in Ohio, Kim Reynolds, who went on Twitter saying, essentially, it's never a terrible thing to protect an innocent life, which is a direct hit at Donald Trump's comments from over the weekend. But I think one thing to watch carefully is how exactly he continues to walk this tightrope. We know that it's not something he wants to talk about.

I've learned the U.S. military, however, believes that those weapons are less critical for a successful counteroffensive than, say, vehicles and mine- clearing equipment that can breach Russian troops on the ground.

His first message is thank you very much. It's clearly going to be an appreciation. The second message is we continue to need these long-range weapons. I mean, I think that he's going to still make the case for these ATACMS missiles. They can help right away. They can go into the fight tomorrow. They can have an effect on this counteroffensive. And that is going to be an important aspect that he'll make. Thank you very much. I need more. And he'll make that case to the Republicans and to the Democrats, and they'll be listed (ph).",

If I don't have the best weaponry possible, he also talked about air defense and patriot systems, if he doesn't have these things, more civilians will die and more military will die fighting the Russians.So, for him, it's a moral issue as the leader. He has to try to get the best and the most equipment that he can. And at the same time, politically, certainly the west, we can be fickle. And that's what Vladimir Putin is counting on.",

But this all came as a surprise today, Wolf, when Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, went down to the Senate floor to try to stop a move from Tommy Tuberville that was expected later in the afternoon. As part of his effort, what Schumer did was he set up votes on some of the top brass in the military, after saying for months that he did not want to do these nominations one by one.The argument from Schumer was that he had no other choice because Tuberville later today was supposed to go to the floor and use a rarely deployed tactic to try to bring these nominations, to force them on the floor. And what happened was Schumer basically said he did not want to put his Democratic colleagues in the position of potentially having to vote against Tuberville's procedural move, because, doing so could make Democrats look like they were the ones holding up these nominations. So, Schumer arguing this was a final step that he had to take, despite the fact he argues it is dangerous for the Senate to begin this precedent where you have these nominations that any one senator can hold them up that they can politicize the military. These are typically nominations, Wolf, that are just advanced by voice vote or by a simple consent agreement among senators. We should also note, as you did at the top here, there are a number, hundreds, of military nominees whose nominations are still in limbo because of Tommy Tuberville's holds. The expectation is that after the vote is final on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, there will then be a procedural vote on the chief of staff for the army, then tomorrow, a final vote on that nomination, and a final vote on the commandant of the Marine Corps. So, three of the military's top brass expected to be confirmed in just the next 24 hours, Wolf, after months of delay.",
