But everything that the president's political team and is senior team have been pushing towards is that 2024 re-election campaign. You've seen it in the public messaging, the events that he's attended and critical swing states to talk about his key agenda wins in the first two years in places like Arizona and Georgia, Pennsylvania. Those are all not subtle, they are all very intentional. And that's what we've seen publicly.Obviously, you also saw the \"State of the Union\" address which really kind of put it together many of those political themes. But it's behind the scenes they've been building privately over the course -- not just months but to some degree two years that has really set the table for what lies ahead. In infrastructure, bill to the Democratic National Committee, hundreds of millions of dollars raised, tens of millions of dollars to build out state-based organizations in all of those critical battle ground states, all driving toward the moment where the president announces his re-election. Now again, it is important to caveat, the president has not said that and aides make clear they don't believe that there's an urgency at this moment, despite the fact that they had planning for potentially making an announcement this month. What they've seen over the course of the last couple of months, both on the Republican side, the slow buildout of the Republican field, the former president's kind of lackadaisical effort in those first two months of his own campaign. But also the Democratic side, the larger national Democratic establishment is largely coalesced behind the president. It's not trying to run against him. There is no primary challenge this year. There's no urgency, but what they want to do is continue the path that they have been on and that path as the president laid out in that \"State of the Union\" address is very driven by those first two years' agenda item wins. And also driven by the idea of what comes next. As the president said more than a dozen times, in that \"State of the Union\" address, three words, finish the job. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But some good news year over year inflation fell to 6.4 percent falling for seven straight months.But inflation in January rose 0.5 percent. And inflation and the economy have been key issues for President Biden and coming off this report, he said that it is good news, but there is still work to do as inflation remains too high. So, the biggest inflation drivers were energy costs which includes gas up 1.5 percent from a year ago, shelter which contributed to nearly half the increase last month, that rose 7.9 percent year over year. And food costs remaining extremely high up 10.1 percent year over year. Some key items at the grocery store costing more. Eggs up 70 percent, butter up 26.3 percent and lettuce up 17.2 percent year over year. But you'll see some savings on a couple items at the grocery store. Beef, veal and bacon, all town down year over year. So how does it translate to Americans' budgets? Well, according to Moody's Analytics, families are spending nearly $400 more a month this year than they did last year on the same goods and services because of inflation. So, this signals that there is still work for the Federal Reserve to to.do. We can expect continued interest rate hikes to try to bring down inflation in the months to come -- Bianca, Max.

This is especially true of those who may be pregnant or breastfeeding. Also including people who have private wells and have not had their water tested. So again, now some people here are going to have to be drinking bottled water as a result of everything that has happened.State officials say that the air quality is still safe. Most of the contaminants they say has been contained in the water, but some of the can contaminants are clearly still out there. They are waiting municipal test results to come back from the city in order to lift that that recommendation that bottled water drank by some here in the area. Also, as a result of the train derailment and the so-called controlled release that happened after it, they are also saying that their effort now is focused on four waterways. And so far, their best estimation indicates that some 3,500 fish have died from 12 different species. We've spoken to a number of people here on the ground who do not quite frankly trust what the government is telling them. They are very frustrated and when the governor was asked about this, he was asked if you lived in the area and had to return home, would you feel safe living here. GOV. MIKE DEWINE (R), OHIO: Look, I think that I would be drinking the bottled water and I would be continuing to find out what the tests were showing as far as the air. I would be alert and concerned but I think I would probably be back in my house.",

CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam has the details for you. VAN DAM: Hey, Bianca and Max. It's almost like we have a one-two punch swinging through the western and central U.S. two distinctly different storm systems, both creating havoc where they travel. And you can almost track this first initial storm system as it moves across the upper Midwest bringing blizzard conditions over western Minnesota and parts of the Dakotas. The second more powerful storm system swinging in across the southwestern portions of the U.S. That's creating snowfall throughout the four corners region. But it's also going to bring us a multiday severe weather setup. I'll explain that in a moment. Here's our latest weather alerts in terms of winter weather alerts, you can almost separate the two storms. One two the north that's where the blizzard warnings are occurring. But the winter storm warnings throughout the four corners and then winter storm watches -- where you're see that shading of blue -- extending into the Chicago suburbs. That's where we have the anticipation of heavy snowfall within the next 36 hours so we'll be on the lookout for that. Lots of pent-up energy with both of the storm systems moving through and of course that has translated into high wind at the surface. In fact we have over 80 million Americans with high wind alerts stretching from the Great Lakes, the lower Mississippi River Valley, all the way through the southwest. You can see some of those locations that wind alert warning actually could see wind gusts over 60 miles per hour. Now as this cold front traverses eastward, it is going to encounter an abnormally warm air mass for this time of year. And you know what happens when we get that collision of air masses, the cold from the north and the warm and humid from the south. That's right, you guessed it, we have the potential for thunderstorms and severe weather. We want to keep an eye to the sky if you are located in Paducah, Memphis, Little Rock, southward to Shreveport and Lake Charles. This is for Wednesday. Isolated tornadoes, damaging winds and large hail. And then on Thursday we have more of a widespread severe weather event possible stretching from the Gulf Coast right through the Tennessee River Valley into Ohio, this is where we could anticipate some isolated tornadoes and damaging winds as well. So, keep an eye to the sky and be weather aware if you're located within those locations. Going to highlight this as well -- central Tennessee could see several inches of rainfall. So look out for potential of flash flooding in and around Nashville. Cold arctic blast settles in behind it, but the good news is that this will be a short lived cold blast of air and you can see that in the 7 day forecast with temperatures moderating by the weekend in Chicago. Max, Bianca, back to you.",
