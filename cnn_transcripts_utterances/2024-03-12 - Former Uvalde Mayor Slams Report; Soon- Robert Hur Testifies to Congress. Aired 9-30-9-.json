There will be a lot about all of this as we will hear on Capitol Hill.

And that's what happened in this report. The city hired an expert who was controlled, not by the city, was controlled by an outside attorney who was working for the city and essentially wrote this report where he exonerated all of the city officers and their actions that day.What this has done is it's just brought so much pain again to this community. And when I sat down with the former mayor yesterday, he told me about that pain. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
