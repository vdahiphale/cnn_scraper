And while we have ballot initiatives in several states across this country relating to abortion access, the reality is, abortion is on the top of the ticket in all 50 states, because Project 2025 outlines specifically how to ban abortion even if we don't have a Congress willing to do it. And so for Donald Trump to so foolishly claim that abortion doesn't matter after the electoral impact we have seen abortion make in the last two years not only shows that he has bad political instincts, but it also shows that he's trying to shift the narrative away from something that he knows as a loser, just like he is.",

He talked about his nearly 50 years of service and most importantly about when he decided to get back into the arena four years ago. The country is coming out of its -- or in the middle of its greatest pandemic since 1918, maybe the greatest economic disruption since 1929 and the greatest social unrest after the killing of George Floyd since 1968 all wrapped up in one. And he stepped in the arena. He fought the fight. And, as a result, the country is in a much better place. So I would say, I think, last night, we all looked at it through that lens, that this man who's dedicated his entire life to public service once again did something noble. He stepped aside in the spirit of George Washington, and he's passed on the torch to a new generation with Vice President Harris. So, as someone who's had the privilege of working with and for our president on behalf of the people of this country, representing that sacred trust that the Office of Public Engagement represents, it was humbling. It was exciting. I was getting calls and text messages from my two teenage girls who were loving and savoring the moment as well. So it was a special night.",
