But when you see it happen, particularly rocket of that size, it's exciting. Tell us tell us what it was like, and what it took to get here.",

And in that moment, I just could not believe that this rocket was finally launching after all of those delays, the technical delays, two hurricanes. And don't forget it was hit by one of those hurricanes just five days ago.So for it to finally be launching, I couldn't believe it. And you could see there, it just lit up the whole night sky, it almost looked like daylight. And what was also so amazing was the fact that this was a very clean countdown up until the end. And then we had two real nail biters. One of them was the fact that we had another hydrogen leak. And so this time, they were able to send out some people called the Red crew to the launch pad to try to fix it. This is basically like the bomb squad because, you know, a fully fueled rocket is essentially a bomb and they had to go out into the danger blast zone to literally tighten some nuts and bolts, they were able to fix it. Listen to how one member of that red crew described the moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And essentially it said you will work longer hours, at high intensity, you will need to be extremely hardcore, exceptional performance is what's needed for a passing grade. You have until 5 pm tomorrow to either sign on or get out, you'll be paid three months severance, and you'll be out of here.He's already fired half the staff and then had to go in and handpick some people to come back because he still needed them. Right? And he's having public feuds with public figures with people who work for him. It's a very, very messy process over there at Twitter. And by the way, he runs another country - company too. He runs Tesla. And he also has SpaceX. So this is a guy with a lot on his plate in this very messy transition at Twitter is very, very public. SCIUTTO: Public feuds with sitting U.S. Senator Ed Markey, one of them I spoke to him yesterday. One Twitter engineer, he was supposedly fired by tweet after a disagreement with Musk.

      "sentences": "Jim and Erica. Well, it has to do with a holiday that is tied to a former Confederate General Robert E. Lee in a state law that dates back to 2016 that says that there's no voting on a Saturday following a state holidays on Thursday or Friday. So that week, we have Thanksgiving and also a holiday that formally commemorates the birthday of Robert E. Lee, who is a Confederate General.So they're saying that they can't vote on this day, Warnock and the Democratic Party of Georgia arguing in their lawsuit that they're at a serious disadvantage if this day is taking away from early voting, arguing that it's Democrats who would use that day to vote. Warnock and the Democratic Party pointed this last year to comments made by Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger and his Chief Operating Officer Gabe Sterling in the immediate aftermath of the midterms in which they said that early voting could be as early as November 26. We reported that in fact, here on CNN. However, since those comments were made, Secretary of State, Raffensperger has issued a memo to counties saying that that 2016 law now prohibits them from voting on Saturday. Warnock is saying that that state law only applies to primaries and general elections, not to run offs. And here's what they're saying in part of their lawsuit saying here quote, \"Without temporary injunctive relief, plaintiffs members and constituents will be deprived of the right to vote during the advanced voting period permitted by Georgia law, immediate and effective relief is essential to protect against that irreparable harm.\" So this lawsuit is asking a judge to block Raffensperger and other state officials from prohibiting counties to allow early voting as early as November 26. And what this really underscores, guys, is the controversy surrounding the Senate bill that was passed in 2021, which cut the amount of time from run offs here in the state of Georgia from nine weeks to four weeks. The result is now that we have this controversy over this date on November 26. A controversy that's now going to be fought in court. Jim, Erica.",
