Part of the issue is that we aren't getting a lot of transparency.But what I do know is that some of the demands, at least, are to divest from Israel and to cancel our Tel Aviv University program.

I'm not super optimistic. With that being said, I would be absolutely -- I would be so embarrassed if the university were to capitulate to these students, its own students, bullying its administration and dictating the terms of how we finish the school year and how we graduate. I mean, I would be -- I would just be absolutely humiliated on behalf of Columbia, and as a Columbia grad at that point. Regarding the Police presence, I will say I have no problem with it. All of my Zionist friends and all of my Jewish friends have no problem with it. We appreciate the police presence.

They can't do that, which is obviously confusing to us.But so, I think that that's the real issue, is that they are not doing their job to protect the students and they're also not doing their job to get the students off the lawns, which is, to my knowledge, what they were first enlisted for.",
