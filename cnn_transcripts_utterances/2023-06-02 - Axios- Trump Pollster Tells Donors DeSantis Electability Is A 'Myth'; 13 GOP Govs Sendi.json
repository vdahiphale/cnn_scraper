And part of the way that he has courted donors is basically saying, Trump can't win. He said this in calls with private calls with donors. Trump can't win. I can win.The only three people in this race that can win are him and Joe Biden. Now, what Tony Fabrizio has done is he's gone through polling and swing states. And he said, the only reason why DeSantis is winning is because people don't know him yet. And after Democrats attack him on issues like Social Security, Medicare, you know, these issues with books in certain school, in certain school districts, taking them out of libraries, and his flat tax, you'll actually see that he's even less electable than Donald Trump. That, in fact, Donald Trump is the more electable Republican. And now this was laid out in a memo that we obtained that he sent to donors just yesterday afternoon to try to make this case.",

But the New York Times noting in New Hampshire, DeSantis avoids talking about Florida's abortion ban. As he traversed socially conservative Iowa this week, the 2024 contender highlighted his state's six weeks ban. Now in more moderate New Hampshire, he's shying from the subject. You could say it's smart politics, or you could say it's disingenuous? If you're running on your record, shouldn't you run in your record?",

These governors say they are responding to a plea from their Texas colleague, Greg Abbott.Our great reporters are back at the table. Governor Abbott does have this operation underway. He says it will reinforce the border. The Border Patrol says there's a 70 percent drop. 3,500 migrants a day now being encountered. That's down 70 percent from May right before the expiration of Title 42. So I guess the question is, are these Republican governors doing this for some policy reason? Does Greg Abbott really need the help? Is it even his responsibility? Or is this politics?",

DeSantis is saying he's going to finish the wall.You know, he just recently signed a bill in Florida which restricts social services for undocumented immigrants. He sent 1,100 National Guard troops to the border. He's also done, you know, sort of the Martha's Vineyard stunt by sending migrants up there. The fact is that the politics on the Republican side have just drastically changed. And part of the reason is because there are legitimate issues at the border which some Democrats have been criticizing the President. RAJU: It is really remarkable. I mean, after the 2012 election, remember how bad things went for the Republicans. They had a whole autopsy. One thing was to be more -- to be open to a comprehensive immigration policy, deal with things such as the 11 million people who are illegally talk about these issues. There was bipartisan support for the bill to legalize, create a pathway to citizenship for these undocumented immigrants here in the United States. That had Republican support as well.
