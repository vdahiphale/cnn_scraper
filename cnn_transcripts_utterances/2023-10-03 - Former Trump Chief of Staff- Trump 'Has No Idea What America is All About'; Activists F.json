The Pentagon's budget for next year is about $890 billion, just shy. They've spent a bit more than $43 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since the war began in February 2022.So, in terms of percentage of GDP though, Estonia tops that list, spending the equivalent of 1.26 percent of its annual GDP. The US comes in at number 12, about a third of a percent. So, you know, you can slice and dice these numbers and serve them up however way you want, but just put aside the whole ethical and moral reasons and, you know, putting aside defence of liberty and rules of a global based world order. What has been the return on investment for US taxpayers here, and simply, you know, degrading Russia's military capability, and how long can the US sustain this level of funding for Ukraine just from an economic sense. O'HANLON: Well thank you, and first of all on the return on investment, it's too soon to say. I mean it's like asking whether, you know, the construction of the first iPhone was a good idea halfway through that process. I mean we are in potentially early days in this war, we don't know where it's going. It could still escalate, it could still expand. Or it could result in the overthrow of Vladimir Putin. So depending on which outcome we get, it's going to look a lot different when we assess the numbers. I think that so far this has been a remarkable effort by the West, collectively defined, including Europe, Canada, United States and Japan, and a few other countries, to show a lot of commitment to the idea of helping protect a sovereign country that's under attack from a ruthless dictator. We have devoted more than $200 billion collectively over the last two years, between Europe, the United States, Canada, Japan. That is a remarkable and huge amount of money. It's greater than the Marshall Plan, all of the Marshall Plan. It is comparable to the Lend-Lease Program of World War II where the United States helped Britain and the Soviet Union with weaponry before it even got involved, and then thereafter. So the overall effort should make us all, if you're supporting and rooting for Ukraine, make us all feel proud. And make us all feel impressed with our unity so far.",

And then of course the Donald Trump dimension which brings its own peculiarities, adds another layer of uncertainty. And I think, as an American, I'm afraid I cannot predict where my country is headed on this issue.

We may not give them the support they're hoping for indefinitely. But I will say two things. One, its Russia's fault this war is happening. And secondly, we're not going to collectively desert Ukraine to the point of letting them be overtaken by Russia. I think a plausible worst-case scenario is we stop providing them weapons to take back more territory. But I'm confident, even with the Trump phenomenon in the United States, we will provide Ukraine enough help, we and our European and Canadian and Japanese allies, and Koreans and others, to make sure they can hold on to the 82 percent of their country they currently hold, protect their sovereignty, protect their government.

Some of the park's trees are nearly a century old, part of rare green face among the world's largest urban areas. CNN's Will Ripley has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A fight for the future of a much-loved Tokyo park. Protesters urging officials respect history, stop the Jingo Gaien district urban redevelopment project. HIROSHI ONE, PROTESTOR AND TOKYO RESIDENT (through translator): The Jingo Gaien is ours and our kids' cultural inheritance. It's not fair to push through a redevelopment plan without properly consulting citizens. RIPLEY (voice-over): Protesters fear heritage gingko trees will be endangered by a new stadium, hundreds of others axed, making way for tall buildings of concrete and steel. This, they say, is not just a fight over one part. It's a fight for the future of Japan's green spaces, the right to have a say. Built with public donations in 1926, the Jingo Gaien is seen as a people's park, home to a famous rugby venue. A historic baseball stadium where Babe Ruth once played.

The victory is important, because as you can see on the map, Ukraine is bordered by Russia to the East and Slovakia to the West. Now, as Robert Fico tries to build a coalition government, there's a new focus on his comments against sending arms to Ukraine and calling Slovakia's president an American agent. But as CNN's international diplomatic editor, Nic Robertson, explains, there's no guarantee whether he'll be able to form the coalition he needs to govern. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Robert Fico, Slovakia's pro-Putin populist leader, has been here before: 2006, 2010 and 2016, winning the biggest vote share in national elections, 22.9 percent. But not enough for his SMER SD party to govern alone, as they did following the elections in 2012. His challenge now: build a governing coalition. The clock is ticking. He has two weeks. ROBERT FICO, SMER PARTY LEADER (through translator): I want to say to all Slovakia that we are ready. We are enlightened. We are more experienced in the fight we have taken. ROBERTSON (voice-over): If he succeeds, it would be his third term as prime minister and could have a big impact beyond Slovakia's borders. Fico's \"no weapons to Ukraine\" policy would be a massive U-turn, potentially ending Slovakia's stalwart support for its neighbor. FICO (voice-over): We are ready to help Ukraine humanitarianly. We are ready to help in the restoration of the state. But our opinion on arming Ukraine does not change. ROBERTSON (voice-over): For now, no change in Slovakia's Ukraine policy.
