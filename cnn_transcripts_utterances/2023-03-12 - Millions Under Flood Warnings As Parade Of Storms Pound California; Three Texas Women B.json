You can't detect it on a self-breast exam.So, I think moving forward, if you have dense breast tissue, our women, our patients should know about that so you can have a discussion with your doctor. We can do an ultrasound. We can do an MRI. But I really think that this is a good move by the FDA. It will actually result in a misdiagnosis and early detection of breast cancer.",

Dukes win by ten with Duke alum Jon Scheyer becoming the first person to ever win the ACC men's tournament as a player and a coach. This is his first year replacing legendary coach Mike Krzyzewski. Now, every year, a Cinderella makes it to the big dance when no one gave them a chance. This year Kennesaw State is one of them. We caught up with coach Amir Abdur-Rahim who won just one game three years ago in his first year there, but he has inspired the Owls to 26 wins this season, a conference title, and a first-ever trip to the tournament.
