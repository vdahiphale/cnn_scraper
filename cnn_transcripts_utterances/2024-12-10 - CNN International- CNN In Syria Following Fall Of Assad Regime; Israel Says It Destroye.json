Mostly it was with Bashar Assad's father, Hafez al-Assad, negotiated the Golan Heights, and most recently, just before the civil war in Syria erupted in 2011, there was some indirect negotiations via the U.S. to see whether or not we can resuscitate or relaunch a peace process.Then fast forward to our time. Look, Israel was just as surprised as everyone else with the spectacular suddenness. It reminded everyone of the old adage, Amara, of how do you go bankrupt? Well, first, I do it gradually, then I do it suddenly. That's exactly what happened to the regime. And if you recall, in the last several years, Israel has been quietly, tacitly supportive of the Assad regime, despite his connections to Iran, despite him being -- despite Syria, I'm sorry, being a conduit of arms to Hezbollah.

But, there was a Prime Minister, Mr. Erdogan, who actually was convicted and went to jail. The thing is that that Mr. Olmert had the moral compass and the integrity to resign once he was indicted, which Mr. Netanyahu did not, and instead, turned this into some kind of a crusade against the deep state and a vast conspiracy against him and a cabal seated in the judiciary and the media.Anyway, eight years ago, an investigation began, and four years ago, it matured into indictments. This is what we saw today in his testimony. He is being -- he was indicted in three separate dossiers with three separate cases. One is about -- is a personal thing. It's a hedonistic thing. It's about taking -- it's about grip and taking presents and cigars and jewelry and expensive champagne worth in excess of $150,000 from close friends, which he then helped. That's probably easy to prove, but that's the lighter of the three cases. The second is that he tried to sway media coverage of him by colluding with the editor -- well, not the editor, the publisher of Israel's largest newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth. That's called Dossier 2000, and the heavy one is called Dossier 4000. That's how the state prosecution called them. None of our viewers need to remember these numbers. They mean nothing. Dossier 4000 is the heaviest because there he is accused of clear cut corruption on top, I'm sorry, clear cut bribery on top of corruption and a breach of public press and a whole host of other lesser charges.",

Mangione was on the run for five days before he was finally found at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania after an employee saw him and tipped off authorities. Police say he was carrying a backpack at the time of his arrest, with a loaded gun. They described the weapon as consistent with the murder weapon.The Mangione family says they were shocked and devastated by Luigi's arrest, and asked for prayers for all involved. Now, a former roommate of Mangione spoke with CNN earlier, saying he can make zero sense of this unimaginable situation. R.J.

Now, they can't trace it to a serial number, but it is traceable in a sense of the ballistic evidence that would be left behind from a shell casing or from the bullet itself, the pellet itself, if it's recovered. And so, from that perspective, you can't trace it. You just can't trace it through a serial number to be able to find out who bought it, be able to trace the history of that particular firearm.Now, when you look at the video of the actual shooting, that gun that was used there appeared to be slightly different from the one that was recovered, but only ballistic evidence will really match the two, and I don't know if they've gotten that ballistic match or not.",

But, certainly, it is wise at this point in time to increase your security and be very vigilant, very aware.The one thing that really kind of puzzles me about this case is why he would hold on to the murder weapon. I mean, he was clearly shedding evidence along the way. He got rid of the backpack. The bicycle is gone. But yet, he maintained both the fake ID and the -- and a firearm. Again, that's assuming that's the same firearm that was used in the murder. And the question is, why would you do that unless you plan to have other targets and you wanted police to know that the two were connected? I mean, who knows what would that -- or is that a different firearm that looks similar but not exactly the same, another ghost gun. So, those are unanswered questions. I'm sure NYPD knows a whole lot more than we know publicly right now, and perhaps they have been able to match that particular gun, but they also have the DNA, and I'm sure they got a search warrant for his DNA. He would have been fingerprint in Pennsylvania, because he is arrested on gun charges, which automatically would require fingerprint. So, they'd be able to get a match that way as well.",

Now it's over a couple of thousand acres. It was expanding at about the size of a football field every 15 seconds. That's how fast it was moving there. And we saw this earlier in the summer. The Park Fire became the fourth largest in state history just in a blink, the bridge and line fires.And one reason for this is that these really wet winters create a lot of vegetation, which then dries out the atmosphere on a warming planet. During climate change, it soaks up a lot more water. It can dump it, but it can also soak it up a lot faster. And so, it dries out all that fresh vegetation, turning into fuel in the late summer, early fall months, and here is what we're seeing right now.

Syrian rebels have appointed a caretaker Prime Minister for the next three months to oversee the country's transition to a new government. Mohammad al- Bashir, he is seen there on the far right, was the head of the rebel- led Syrian salvation government in Idlib.Meanwhile, Middle Eastern nations are accusing Israel of using the political instability in Syria as an opportunity to execute a new land grab. The IDF has launched airstrikes across Syria and deployed ground troops into and beyond a demilitarized buffer zone at the border there with Syria following the fall of the Assad regime. Israel claims the strikes are meant to keep weapons from falling into the hands of extremists. The world was caught by surprise, really caught off guard at the stunning, rapid fall of the Assad regime. But, the Syrian rebels who toppled Bashar al-Assad are a complex patchwork of fighters, and it remains to be seen how they will work together, if they will, during this transition. CNN's Katie Polglase takes a look at how the rebels captured Damascus. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KATIE POLGLASE, CNN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER (voice-over): The shouts of freedom. This weekend, the Assad regime's decades-long rule over Syria ended with the fall of the capital Damascus.",

He is joining me now live from Washington, Joby Warrick. He is also a national security reporter for The Washington Post. Joby, appreciate your time. I do want to start with a potential stockpile of chemical weapons in Syria, especially amid the strikes by Israel at targets in Syria, and Israel is saying that they have also struck Syria's chemical weapons capabilities. But, about 10 years ago, Assad agreed to give up some of his, or I thought most of his chemical weapons. So, tell me about what we know regarding any more chemical weapons in that country, and of course, these concerns that if there are -- if there is a stockpile, that it could fall into the wrong hands.",

      "sentences": "Well, Amara, that's a really big question right now, and you're right. About 10 years ago, 2013-2014, a UN-backed mission succeeded in getting rid of most of serious chemical weapons. That's the assessment, not just of the inspectors on the ground, but of the intelligence communities. Its estimate maybe 90 percent, 95 percent of the really bad stuff, Sarin nerve agents, the really horrific chemical weapons, were removed from the country and destroyed.Now, there were things that were left behind and things that were hidden. And we know this because, in 2017, Assad used them again. So, he did keep some stuff back. And so, the big question now is, what's still there, and how dangerous is that? Because you -- the last thing you want, frankly, is to have loose materials sitting around, loose chemical weapons. It could be stolen by anyone, by ISIS, by any bad actor. But, I think what you see with the Israelis now, since there is some unknown about this, Israelis -- the Israelis are hedging their bets a little bit and going after things that might be research facilities or might be storage facilities, not knowing, with 100 percent certainly, what's there. But, let's get rid of those, just in case.",

And on top of that, a lot of uncertainty about al-Jolani. This is a name that was not familiar to a lot of us, but to you, this is someone that you had covered.

It turns out he broke with ISIS, decided to hit his wagon with al-Qaeda instead, which is not much better. And he claims to reform. He claims to be a different man now. We can see positive rhetoric. He is saying all the right things, and he is doing some of the right things.But, we really don't know what's going to happen, and we don't know what's going to really happen to some of these former regime officials. Some are internationally wanted war criminals or have been accused of very serious war crimes like torture, like using chemical weapons, but we don't know how these rebels are going to sort of execute justice, maybe literally by executing people in the coming days and weeks, to be seen.",

That's Senator Lisa Murkowski, someone who has broken ranks with her leadership, with Donald Trump time and time again. We'll meet this afternoon with her, as she has really kept an open mind about this nomination, has really not weighed in much on this, but she could be one who is someone to watch here.As Hegseth's nomination appears, his prospects appear a little bit brighter than they were just a week ago. Why? Because of his efforts to try to consolidate Republican support, the pressure that's been coming on the outside, particularly on one Senator, in particular, Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa. She sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee and has been seen as a pivotal vote herself. She has had -- she is someone who served in combat, someone who has endured sexual assault herself, and has -- of course, Hegseth has said that he opposes women serving in common. He said that in the past. He has now walked back those comments, and also has been accused of sexual assault. He has denied those allegations. But, Hegseth, in his conversation with Ernst, appears to have least won her over for now. She says she is supporting him through this process, not quite a yes yet, but is moving very, very close. Now, the question is, ultimately, will all Republican senators fall in line, or will most of them? Remember, 50 Republican senators out of 53 need to vote to advance a nomination because the Vice President, soon-to-be Vice President, J.D. Vance, would break any tie. I caught up with Senator John Cornyn, who is a senior Republican. He sits on some key committees, has met with several of these nominees, and I asked him if Republicans were willing to fall in line behind Donald Trump. SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): Well, we haven't had a signal hearing or a single FBI background check completed. So, I think as frustrating as it is for some people, there is a process, and I'm foreseeing the process through so we can make informed decisions. This isn't just about doing our job of advice consent into the Constitution. It's also about making sure that these nominees are properly vetted, so that there are no surprises later on that weren't identified before him.",
