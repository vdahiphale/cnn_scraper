She can call for it at any moment and the question is, if she does call for it, will she have the votes to oust him from the speakership? There is some belief among those detractors that, you know, that, you know, some people believe that this was the moment for them to go forward when really the pressure was boiling, when there was so much tension internally.But now they're going home for a week-long recess. And then will those tensions subside? Will the anger subside? Will Mike Johnson benefit from some distance from his deal making? Marjorie Taylor Greene is betting that it will not. She believes that voters back home will be furious at Republicans for cutting this deal, furious at Mike Johnson for moving ahead with this $95 billion aid package, that includes $61 billion in aid to Ukraine that does not include border security measures, even though Johnson himself had pushed, pledged to move forward on this. Why doesn't he do that? Because he'd simply didn't have the votes in the razor thin Republican majority and ultimately decided it was time for him to cut a deal with Democrats and move forward with Democratic support as he went essentially stiff armed that right flank that had called for him to take a firmer line and push for the Republican and conservative proposals. Now, there is this -- while there is significant opposition on that right flank, there also is significant support, including from some more Moderate Republicans, some more center right Republicans and Republicans who are in swing districts. One of them, Congressman Don Bacon, who comes from a district that Joe Biden carried in 2020, said that history will judge Mike Johnson's move kindly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DON BACON (R), NEBRASKA: They've undermined the norms of this place. We never had to vacate the chair in our history and they've done it right. They -- we went 18 years, I believe, without a rule vote going down. We got seven of them, most of them by them and now they're campaigning in other people's districts.

If you look at what everyone was saying, it was bipartisan support about that support to Ukraine was not just, you know, specifically for that country, but it's about making sure that we can protect our allies. And if you look at how Iran, China and Russia have come together to basically try to form an alliance against the U.S. giving the support to Ukraine, which is much needed, it was so important. And the president, to me, got away with not too much damage done with this party because you saw Democrats join the Speaker and the Republicans to get this done.

Now, Zelenskyy said the decision to pass the bill will save thousands of lives.After monthslong resistance by House Republicans, the aid package is seen by some as a turning point in Ukraine's fight against Russia. Ukraine's foreign minister tells CNN the risk of a larger war in Europe has fallen after the vote. CNN's Fred Pleitgen joins us now from Kyiv. Just give us an idea of how badly this aid and what the aid will buy is needed there on the battlefield. [07:25:08]",

If you look at some of the situations on the battlefield, especially in the east of the country and in the south of the country, I would say right now the situation is still a stalemate, but certainly one where the Russians definitely have the momentum and the initiative on their side.They have been making some gains on the battlefield. Those gains are not strategic yet. They're not threatening to take large cities in those areas, but certainly you can see that there could come a point where Ukrainian defenses could get into serious problems because of a lack of ammunition. Especially, in fact, this morning, the Russians once again saying that they took yet another village from the Ukrainians in a key area in the east of the country. So the Ukrainians are saying essentially, they need to things very quickly and very badly. One of them is 155 millimeter artillery ammunition. That's something that we've been reporting on really over the past months as this aid bill was stuck in the House of Representatives where I think the first time that I reported on it was in September, where the Ukrainians were already saying that they were running desperately low on ammunition. Of course, that situation has gotten a lot worse over the past couple of months, and the Ukrainians are saying right now they're really starved for ammo. The other thing is surface to air missiles that the Ukrainians need really badly. The Russians are using their Air Force more effectively and also using missiles to target cities here in Ukraine. And the Ukrainians say they simply don't have enough to replenish the American and international systems that they have. They need more missiles for that. They hope they're going to get that in that aid package. But you're absolutely right, the president of this country, you could feel the sense of relief that he had, came out almost immediately with a tweet and then later also with the sound bite. Let's listen to what he had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): We appreciate every manifestation of support for our state and independence, our people and our lives, which Russia wants to bury in ruins. America has shown its leadership from the first days of this war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He did a little bit of everything last night. And you also never need to worry about Anthony Davis. These two future hall of famers were absolutely exceptional.Again, they racked up 59 points to keep things close. It was really L.A.'s guards that weren't doing the job. The front court did all that they could do, but really the bigger issue for L.A. outside of these two is just how good Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray are. I mean, Denver's duo, combining to score 54 and both finishing with double doubles as Jokic, the reigning finals MVP with a chance to steal things here, ends up getting the steal from LeBron James and then lays it in at the other end. The Nuggets win by 11, their fifth straight postseason win against the Lakers. Elsewhere in the Sixers postseason, their hopes may have just been dashed. Joel Embiid landing awkwardly late in the second quarter against the Knicks, reaggravating this knee injury that has sidelined him for two months. To his credit, he was able to gut it out the rest of the way, but he was clearly in pain, and Coach Nick Nurse did not seem confident about his availability moving forward. Philly kept fighting. They played a really good game. They could not stop Josh Hart late. He scored 13 of his 22 in the fourth quarter as New York rallies for the win. To the rink now, a playoff series featuring two of the original six NHL teams, the Toronto Maple Leafs and Boston Bruins in game one may have turned on this sequence early in the second. Bruins' goalie, Jeremy Swayman making a mad dash for the puck, he misses. He leaves Auston Matthews to the chance to tie it, he would miss. And then a minute later, it was Brandon Carlo bearing the one timer there. So, a massive swing and momentum. And you have to feel for Matthews. 69 goals this season. The most by anybody in 30 years and clanking it right off the post. So, Boston rolling from there, winning five to one. And eight playoff games on the schedule, guys, today between the NBA and the NHL.

And it's a story about how we're continually depriving them of the greenery, the space, the vegetation that they need to live because the human species continually wants to expand, to grow more in number, to find more land to grow food upon. The story of growth that seems to dominate our lives entirely.But it's also something of a metaphor for all the conflicts we're seeing around the world between humans, on borders over land and really something that brings home writ large visually the enormous confrontations now on this crowded planet for basic resources. Now, there are about 6,000 elephants in Sri Lanka. And in just last year alone, according to the government there, 476 of them were killed, and they in turn killed 169 people. And so, this isn't some sort of gentle dispute over boundaries. It's violence that plays out often every night. Here's how we got a small experience of that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WALSH (voice-over):  These are this conflict's weapons, firecrackers, thunder flashes.",

Possibly coming in this direction.WALSH (voice-over):  This is already too close. If they charge, it would all be over. A torchlight used to always be enough, or they would bang pots and pans. Now, nobody wants to risk going soft, so they reach straight for gunpowder. Usually, the elephants just run. But sometimes they charge. And it's us who have to run. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALSH (on camera):  Now, it is extraordinary, because the one thing you take away from being with these Sri Lankans, dealing with this issue all the time, is the sleeplessness. That they barely ever seem to get -- to go to bed at night. They're always up, terrified that at night the elephants will come in and trample, eat the vegetation, the crops that they rely on to feed their own families. And so, that's the reason for the fireworks. And at any particular moment, too, I should point out, if an elephant turns, that can be deadly. And so, it was an extraordinary week or so for us observing this, sort of, dark, new front line between species, hungry for the same space on this planet. And what that really shows for where we as humans are going, because those same tensions you see there, writ large between elephant and human are very much the ones that play out between people every day.
