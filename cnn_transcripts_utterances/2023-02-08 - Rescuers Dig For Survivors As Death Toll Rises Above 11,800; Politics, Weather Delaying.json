The last time I checked, they were in the red as you can see. The NASDAQ actually probably faring the worst in fact, almost one-and-a-half of a percent. Those are the markets and these are the main events for you: A race against time. Aid organizations face freezing cold and aftershocks as they try and help survivors of Monday's deadly earthquake. Volodymyr Zelenskyy is on a surprise tour of Europe and he is asking for fighter jets. And shares in Google owner, Alphabet slump after its new AI makes a mistake. Live from London, it is Wednesday, February the 8th, I am Isa Soares, in for Richard Quest, because I too mean business. A very good evening, everyone. We are following two major events unfolding this hour. In Turkey and Syria, the search for survivors of a devastating earthquake is entering its third night. And in Paris the leaders of France and Germany are preparing to welcome Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following his visit to the UK. We begin though tonight in Turkey where rescue efforts are growing more and more desperate. The death toll has climbed to more than 11,000 people as crews search for both victims and survivors. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited an emergency relief area near the epicenter. He acknowledged the problems with the government's initial response. He said there is no way to be prepared for such a huge disaster and vowed to rebuild the Kahramanmaras region within the year, and that's actually where we find our Nick Paton Walsh in Kahramanmaras in Turkey, he joins us now. Nick, just give us a sense of what is happening where you are, rescue operations you were telling me in the last hour still going on even though we're what -- sixty-plus hours now since the earthquake.",

We also have prepositioned kits that we've been giving out to people, things like mattresses, tents, jerrycans, blankets.

So those supply routes that do come through, we need them to stay open, we need the trucks to keep rolling, and that is not just with the UN or the humanitarian sector, we also need the commercial sector to be running as well. We need to be able to go to vendors, to go to suppliers, buy the tents, buy the equipment so that we can start distributing more and more. So we need that channel to be functioning simply to respond. We, as I said work in 98 camps. We also need to reach out to about 136 communities on top of that.

And Zelenskyy, as far as we know, the plane is not on the ground just yet. But I think what this meeting is all about is basically a show of force of the Europeans, I mean, to show the Russians that, in fact, Europe is not going to fade away and the support from Europe, for the Ukrainians is not going to just disappear like that. The shopping list, of course, is the same shopping list that we heard in London, which is basically, Mr. Zelenskyy would like to stand up two squadrons of combat aircraft, that would be about 24 combat planes. The French have not taken that off the table and basically have said that they would be -- that is a possibility. One of the possibilities of the Mirage 2000s, that the French Air Force has, and that may be what comes out of this meeting. But also in this meeting, well, kind of the dynamics of it, it is interesting is that Mr. Scholz has been kind of Doctor No, in terms of the kinds of requests that have come in from Mr. Zelenskyy. He has been the person that held up the Leopard 2 tanks and then finally gave in. He is now saying, on F-16, which is their combat aircraft that might be contributed to the defense of Ukraine, he is saying that's not on the table at all, but Mr. Macron is showing some flexibility in that regard -- Isa.",

He is key andkind of fundamental to this equation that we're seeing here as the Europeans try to work out exactly what kind of aid is going to go to the Ukrainians. In fact, the dynamic is that NATO basically has to give permission for a lot of these transfers of weapons that are going to go on as the war continues, and I think that they are going to have to convince the other NATO members like France, for example, about the wisdom of providing fighter jets, and just to give you an idea of what is on the other side, here is what the Russian Ambassador in London said, after that meeting, in London with British officials about sending combat aircraft. He said: \"I would like to remind officials in London, such a scenario (of providing aircraft) they will face the bloody harvest of the next wave of escalation of the war.\" So clearly, the Russians are not going to lay back and let this transfer of weapons take place without some kind of reaction - - Isa.",

So it's something that's talked about, but there is very little controversy over the idea of supporting Ukraine, as far as I can tell. The public opinion polls seem to indicate that, too. And I think this -- you know, what we may see out of this round of talks here that we are seeing with President Zelenskyy is, he is going from here to Brussels tomorrow, and I think that the real sort of major announcements will be made there because he will be meeting with the European Union and will come out of that with perhaps some kind of unanimity about further weapons commitment -- Isa.",
