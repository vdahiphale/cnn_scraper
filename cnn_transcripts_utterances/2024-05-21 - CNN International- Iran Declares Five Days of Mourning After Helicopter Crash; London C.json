Mourners are gathering in Tabriz, Iran. Over the next few days, the President's body will travel to Tehran. Mr. Raisi was one of nine people killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. Desperately needed humanitarian aid is getting into Gaza through that floating pier built by the U.S. military. Central Command says nearly 570 metric tons of supplies have been delivered so far. Donors include the U.K., the UAE and the European Union. And in the U.S. today, an outbreak of severe thunderstorms is possible for the Midwest region. That includes the potential for strong tornadoes throughout the day. In total, more than 65 million people are under some sort of severe storm threat. Well, as that funeral gets underway for Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, tributes to him are pouring in from Iran and around the world. The iconic Azadi Tower in the capital Tehran was lit up on Monday with Raisi's image and the Iranian flag. Raisi died in a helicopter crash on Sunday, along with the country's foreign minister and other high-ranking officials. This was the scene in the central city of Kerman in Iran, of course, where mourners lit candles and they laid flowers. People in Kazan, Russia also paid homage to Raisi outside the Iranian consulate. Iran is believed to be supporting Russia in its war on Ukraine. The scenes were similar in Baghdad, Iraq, where people gathered outside the Iranian embassy to remember the late leader. They held pictures of him and they lit candles. Well, CNN's Fred Pleitgen walks us through the events of the crash now. What it means for a country that's already deeply divided? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

His legal team successfully argued that as a foreign citizen, he may not be given the full rights to use the First Amendment in a U.S. trial despite U.S. assurances. Now, this means that his battle in the U.K. courts continues. And as of now, he remains in Belmarsh High Security Prison in London. So for his wife and for his team, this means a partial victory.STELLA ASSANGE, JULIAN ASSANGE'S WIFE: As a family, we're relieved. But how long can this go on? This case is shameful. And it is taking an enormous toll on Julian. KRISTIN HRAFNSSON, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, WIKILEAKS: It's a victory in the battle. Yes. And a recognition that Julian faces serious discrimination in the U.K. -- U.S. court system if he's extradited. So it should be an open and shut case in the formal process of the appeal to actually stop the extradition. But why wait for that? The signal is clear to Joe Biden and his administration. Don't prolong this. It's just going to get worse and worse for you. Drop the case.",

And joining us now is CNN's Will Ripley in Taipei.I can imagine how this is going on, how this is going down in China. WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, predictably, Beijing's Taiwan Affairs Office, Max, is slamming President Lai Chang- te's speech saying that it sends dangerous signals of seeking independence and provocation. Of course, President Lai himself sparked controversy in Beijing a number of years back when he talked about being a practical worker for Taiwan independence, which absolutely put him on the blacklist from the Beijing perspective. Not to mention his Taiwan Vice President, Hsiao Bi-khim, served as Taiwan's top envoy to the U.S. up until the election. So now you have these two people running this self-ruled democracy who've been elected by the majority of voters here who Beijing absolutely despises. And the question, as China says it will never tolerate or condone any form of Taiwan independence, even though these candidates have softened their language and are trying to maintain the status quo. Will Beijing accept their government? And how will Beijing respond? (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (voice-over): Taiwan begins a new era with a new leader, Lai Chang-te. The island democracy's 64-year-old president steps into a political minefield. China's communist leaders loathe Lai and his government.",

Taiwan is spending billions to bolster its military defense, forging friendships with like-minded democracies, despite a dwindling number of formal diplomatic allies. One of many huge hurdles facing President Lai Ching-te as democratic Taiwan prepares for an uncertain future. (END VIDEOTAPE) RIPLEY (on camera): Over the past eight years under Lai's predecessor Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan lost a total of 10 formal allies at the U.N., vital voices to speak on behalf of this island. They only have 12 tiny allies remaining, but they do have a large number of friends, powerful democracies like the United States. But in a closed-door briefing here in Taipei attended by CNN, Max, Taiwanese officials did acknowledge that the upcoming U.S. election and uncertainties about the political climate, the arguments in the U.S. about involvement by America in overseas affairs, that could potentially throw a wrench into things and create new challenges for this new president of Taiwan.",

Mr. Zelenskyy suggested that allies could help by shooting down Russian missiles. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): Russians are using 300 planes on the territory of Ukraine. We need at least 120, 130 planes to resist, to fight back in the sky. You can't provide that right now? OK, so we're going back to air defense. You can't provide that either? S-16, you cannot provide yet. So we are returning to the planes that you have on the territory of neighboring NATO countries. Raise them up. They are there. Use them.
