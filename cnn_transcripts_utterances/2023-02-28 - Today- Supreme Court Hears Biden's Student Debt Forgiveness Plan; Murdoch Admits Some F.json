And, of course, hindsight is 2020. But it really didn't take a news genius in the aftermath of the election to understand the ramifications of undermining the U.S. -- the integrity of the U.S. electoral system, election system.

He said that he would like to thank especially the ones who were active on the front lines.And I think one of the interesting things that he took from that is that he also acknowledged that there were some who were killed on the front lines in Ukraine. The other interesting stuff that he said is that the entire speech was really him ripping into the West, ripping into Ukraine, but then also saying how important he thinks that his intelligence service is, especially in the areas that are occupied by Russia. Now, of course, the Russian say that these territories have been annexed, that these are now part of the Russian Federation. But he essentially urged to set up the intelligence service in these places. And to make it stronger because it was going to be such an important place. He also claimed that there were attacks by the Ukrainians inside those territories. And he said that it was up to Russia's intelligence services to thwart those attacks and to stop those attacks. So really, the Russian President really and a very important speech that he gave there at the Federal Security Services of Russia, talking about how important that agency is, how important it is to be against some of the attacks that are taking place by the Ukrainians as he put it. And really, Poppy, what we're seeing the Russian President do over the past couple of days is really trying to rally some of these special services here in Russia. Just yesterday was the day of the special operations forces here in Russia where he told them how important he thinks their work has been.
