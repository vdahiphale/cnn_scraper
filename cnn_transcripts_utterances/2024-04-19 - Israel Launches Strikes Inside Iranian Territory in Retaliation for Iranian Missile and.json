As he also said, the focus for the United States and G7 remains de-escalation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  You saw Israel on the receiving end of an unprecedented attack. But our focus has been on, of course, making sure that Israel can effectively defend itself, but also so de-escalating tensions, avoiding conflict. And that remains our focus. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, listen, John, still no official word or confirmation of this attack by the Israeli government or the Israeli military. It is absolute silence over here as it relates to these reported explosions overnight. But what we do know from both Iranian officials as well as Syrian state media is that air defense assets in Syria appear to have been struck by Israel. And in Iran, in that city of Isfahan that you were saying, there were reported explosions at an a military base there. The nuclear facilities in that city were not struck. And there are reports of three drones having been downed by Iranian air defense assets.But both sides here are really staying quite quiet in terms of public statements, and that appears to be the intention here. This we have been hearing over the course of the last six days since Iran carried out its strike on Israel, that Israeli officials were looking for a way to thread the needle here, to send a message of deterrence, to ensure that this attack by Iran did not go unanswered, but also, at the same time, to try and find a way to avoid the escalation that could potentially lead to an all-out war between Iran and Israel. And ultimately this response by Israel appears to have achieved that aim at least for now, with a regional intelligence source telling us that this tit-for-tat between Iran and Israel is over, that Iran does not at this stage anticipate responding further. And so because of the fact that this was not publicly messaged, this is also, of course, allowing that international coalition, that anti- Iran coalition that we have seen blossom once again this week, be able to move forward as we heard the Secretary of State Tony Blinken talking about more ways for the G7, for the United States to move forward with a coalition against Iran to restrain Iran's activity in the region, and also, of course, to exact further diplomatic pressure on the country.",

      "sentences": "To be frank, not much. And this is sort of a tight-lipped approach that you saw from Secretary Blinken, that you're seeing from other parts of the administration. And it does reflect, I think, this attempt to put some distance between the U.S. and the decision by the Israelis to strike back, because of course, we know that President Biden in a conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu last weekend was counseling restraint when it comes to responding to the Iranian attack. His message was essentially that the Israeli attempts to intercept those missiles from Iran was successful, and that a military response might not be necessary. And he did try and reinforce that message just yesterday by implementing new sanctions on Iran, essentially trying to say that there are other non-military ways to punish that country.But I think in reality, when you were talking to American officials over the course of the last one week, no one was under the impression that Israel would do nothing. And the view among American officials was that this would be a limited response, and at least on the surface right now it does appear that that's what's happened. Now, President Biden's overarching goal here is trying to prevent this conflict from escalating further, and you heard that very directly from the secretary of state himself. We do understand from American officials that they did receive a heads-up from Israel before they launched this retaliatory strike last night, but officials have been clear that they didn't endorse it. They didn't green-light it, making very clear to point out that this was not a U.S. offensive operation. And of course, President Biden in that conversation with Netanyahu last week made very clear that the U.S. would not participate in any offensive action against Iran. So now the real question going forward for officials here, for President Biden, is what happens next? Does this cause further escalation, this tit-for-tat? Or does focus now return to the war in Gaza? U.S. officials have made clear that they still have those disagreements with the Israelis over humanitarian aid, over a planned ground offensive in Rafah. And certainly, those issues have yet to be resolved, Kate.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's very interesting. I think the United States and Secretary Blinken is probably reflecting this. I think the United States wants to a kind of be in a position where it can serve as a bridge between Iran and Israel.Obviously, the United States is supporting Israel in a defensive stance, but they are not supporting offensive  operations, and they are using the abilities that they have, the connections that they have, not only to defend Israel, but also to work on the diplomatic track. And what that really means is that through  intermediaries, they are talking to the Iranians. They are trying to defuse tension and it seems to be at the moment, at least in both sides' interests that these tensions do not escalate, and that is I think what we are seeing at this point.",

And that is the kind of system that is basically integrated in this. Of course, also integrated at least it was in this last instance with the us and with other countries. The Iranian air defense system is not integrated with other countries, at least not yet, although it does use  technologies from places like Russia. But the other part of this is, is that it is not a defense system that seems to cover the entire country and it is not effective at discerning the types of missiles and drones that the Israelis probably used in this attack.",

He also posted a quote from a Fox News host saying that the prosecution was finding or the defense was finding liberal activists who are trying to pose as jurors to get into convict Donald Trump. These are all things that the prosecution say are violating that gag order. Donald Trump talking about -- he is not allowed to talk about jurors. He is not allowed to talk about the various witnesses. We will see what happens in this case.
