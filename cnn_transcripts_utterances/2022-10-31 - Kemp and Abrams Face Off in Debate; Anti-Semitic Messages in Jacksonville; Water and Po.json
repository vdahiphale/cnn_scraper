And it is due in part to this highly anticipated rematch between Governor Kemp and Stacey Abrams.What last night's debate really underscored is that they couldn't be more different on policy matters. Whether it is economic issues or abortion. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R), CANDIDATE FOR GEORGIA GOVERNOR: Thankfully, in Georgia, because we were open even when Ms. Abrams didn't want us to be, our economy has been incredibly resilient. STACEY ABRAMS (D), CANDIDATE FOR GEORGIA GOVERNOR: Under this governor we've lost $150 million in investment. Music Midtown pulled out. We lost the MLB game. We know that the entertainment industry is thinking about losing -- leaving Georgia because of the abortion ban that is driving women away. He refuses to protect us. He refuses to defend us and yet he defended Herschel Walker, saying that he didn't want to be involved in the personal life of his running mate, but he doesn't mind being involved in the personal lives and the personal medical choices of women in Georgia.",

Thank you.Officials in Jacksonville, Florida, are now condemning anti-Semitic messages seen in public spaces across the city over the weekend. One of those messages scrolled on the outside of TIAA Bank Field. You see it there. This was during the Georgia/Florida college football game on Saturday, referencing anti-Semitic comments made by Kanye West. Well, the universities of Florida and Georgia issued a joint statement condemning the message, as well as others seen on an overpass and a public building. CNN's Leyla Santiago is covering these developments for us. So, in terms of an investigation into the incidents, what do we know and how are people reacting there in Jacksonville?",

And many folks here saying at the center of this is pure hate. So, let's talk about what happened. Outside of the stadium where I am right now over the weekend, during the Florida/Georgia game, scrolling on the outside read, Kanye is right about the Jews, referencing the artist formerly known as Kanye West and his anti-Semitic comments there. And it wasn't just that. We also saw over the weekend displays of anti-Semitism over an overpass here in Jacksonville. The mayor calling them cowards and coward messages, as folks are condemning this quickly. So, here's what else the local Jewish Federation said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, Nic, as I understand it, you're in an area where one of the lines there - you're at a line where people are trying to get water. The mayor has also said some 80 percent of the city's population doesn't have water supply right now because of the attacks. What more can you tell us about just how significant that damage is?",

Thank you.Joining me now to discuss further, Andrea Kendall-Taylor. She's a former deputy national intelligence officer for Russia/Eurasia at the National Intelligence Council. Good to see you this morning. When we look at what happened today, when we look at this pressure that Russia and Vladimir Putin are trying to put on Ukrainians by specifically targeting infrastructure, not just electricity, but water, what does this tell you about Putin's plan moving forward? Is this - this -- could he be moving further west ultimately to target some of those infrastructure -- some of the infrastructure there as well? ANDREA KENDALL-TAYLOR, FORMER DEPUTY NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE OFFICER FOR RUSSIA/EURASIA, NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE COUNCIL: Well, I think, I mean, as you're covering, the attacks are horrific and we should not grow to -- grow immune to them. But they shouldn't be surprising. And I think the way that we understand these attacks is that, as Vladimir Putin is unable to accomplish his objectives on the battlefield, he will continue to terrorize Ukrainian cities, he will continue to terrorize Ukrainians to try to get them to make concessions and end the war on Russia's terms. But you covered an interesting point, Erica. You noted that Ukraine shot down 44 out of the 50 missiles that Russia launched. And it just underscores how critical the air defenses are that the west continues to provide Ukraine. And that will be key to preventing Putin from moving west with those attacks.",

      "sentences": "There's not just the infrastructure that we're following, right, as those attacks continue, but also the fact that Russia is now pulling out of this grain deal. Earlier today the Kremlin called it, quote, risky and dangerous. What do you see as the path forward here? Is this just another way that, you know, that Putin is essentially trying to hold Ukraine hostage, and potentially Europe?KENDALL-TAYLOR: Exactly. I think -- yes, exactly. Both of these represent forms of escalation. So, again, as he can't accomplish on the battlefield, he's looking for any options, he's leveraging any remaining influence - or he's -- I'm sorry, he's weaponizing any remaining leverage that he has. And I think that attacks on the civilian centers and his suspension of the grain deal are related. As the lights go out and it gets colder, we're likely to see an influx of Ukrainian migrants into Europe. I also think that Putin is calculating with an increase in prices, more food insecurity, potentially instability in the south and the Middle East, that that, too, could push another wave of migrants up into Europe to the south. So, those two things could very well converged and put tremendous pressure on European governments. So, I think it's Europe that he has in his crosshairs and he's trying to make their support for Ukraine as costly as possible to get them to stop their support because this is a critical juncture for Putin. He needs to make it through this winter without losing additional territory. So he is weaponizing everything he's got.",

Thank you.Still to come here, the Mississippi River's slow rebound from record low levels is forcing the shipping industry to recalculate. How that drought is also impacting the supply chain, next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:50:50] HILL: The growing drought in the central east is having a serious impact on the Mississippi River. It's already at critically low levels in a number of areas. That's forcing shipping companies that transport on the Mississippi to recalculate how much they're sending down river. Joining me now, Austin Golding. He's the CEO of Golding Barge Line in Vicksburg, Mississippi. It's great to have you with us. So, you know, this is something I have to admit I never really thought about. I hadn't thought about just how important the Mississippi River is in this country when it comes to transporting goods. So, you deal mostly with petroleum. You can plan a little bit for a drought. But given what we've seen and how long it's lasted, what's the impact been on what you can transport and also those charges down the line?",

When the water becomes shallow, you have to reduce the amount of cargo on your barges to not run aground. We also have reduced the number of barges we're carrying per tow. A lot of these tow sizes have been cut in half. So, when you reduce the draft and the number of barges, you really scale back on the efficiencies that our industry offers, which makes things a lot more expensive and makes our industry a lot less competitive. It's very, very tough to get by during times like this.",

When we look specifically, I believe it's 92 percent of agriculture exports depend on the Mississippi. This is a major highway in the United States. What are you hearing from other shippers?",

These materials make more sense to be moved by barge than any other mode of transport because literally we're moving thousands of 18- wheelers worth of cargo, hundreds of rail cars worth of cargo with two diesel engines, half a dozen men and one boat. It's very, very cost effective. It's very, very green. It has very, very little environmental impact. So, when you move all of that cargo onto more expensive, more carbon-based modes of transportation that are less green and less efficient and more expensive, nobody wins. So, we need to keep that cargo on barges, but we need water to be able to maximize our efficiencies to do so.",
