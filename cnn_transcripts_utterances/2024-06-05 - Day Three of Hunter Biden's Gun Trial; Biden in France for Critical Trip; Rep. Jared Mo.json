His public struggled with drug addiction is part of the prosecution's case as they try to prove that Biden illegally purchased a gun because - while battling addiction.

They showed pictures and video from his iCloud that showed him with drugs. They showed him talking to people who were providing drugs to him. And, of course, we saw - we heard his own voice for about an hour. Prosecutors used his own memoir, his audio book. And you can hear his voice filling this courtroom. A lot of emotion from his own wife choking up at points during the - that part of the presentation. And the point the prosecutors are driving home is that when Hunter Biden bought this firearm back in October of 2018, he knew full well that he was a person who was struggling with addiction and should have known that buying this firearm was against the law.

The ICC thing is outrageous, OK. They have no jurisdiction over Israel. They had no jurisdiction over Syria. In fact, the ICC specific said, well, the reason why we didn't go after Assad for war crimes and we didn't issue a warrant at - after he killed 300,000 civilians with chemical weapons, by the way, gassing them, is because we don't have jurisdiction. Well, they don't have jurisdiction here with Israel, but now we have a made-up rule, right? It's magical. All of a sudden they gave themselves jurisdiction when they don't have any.
