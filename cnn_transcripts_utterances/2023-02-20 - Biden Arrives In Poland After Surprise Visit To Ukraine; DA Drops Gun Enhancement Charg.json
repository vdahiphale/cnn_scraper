      "sentences": "Good to see you, guys. This is incredibly significant because Alec Baldwin just went same with Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the armorer on the set of \"Rust.\" They went from facing upwards of five years, right, to just 18 months. So they still face both two counts of involuntary manslaughter.But to remove this firearm enhancement charge is a very big deal. So this is what the District Attorney's office is saying out of New Mexico to CNN. In short, \"In order to avoid further litigious distractions by Mr. Baldwin and his attorneys, the District Attorney and the Special Prosecutor have removed the firearm enhancement to the involuntary manslaughter charges and the death of Halyna Hutchins on the \"Rust\" film set. The prosecution's priority is securing justice, not securing billable hours for big city attorneys.\" OK. So they're coming out swinging with that statement to qualify removing the firearm enhancement charge. Although we still don't exactly know why they removed it, because some say, and I was just talking to CNN's Josh Campbell. We have experts on our error the day that the charges were announced that perhaps this was overcharged. And this comes after Alec Baldwin's attorneys filed their own, you know, legal petitions last week trying to remove certain charges and also to remove the special prosecutor, which I'm sure made her very unhappy when that petition was filed. So we still haven't heard back from Alec Baldwin, from his legal team yet. We've reached out to Hannah Gutierrez-Reed's attorneys as well, but this is a big deal because this is potentially going to go to trial. And we all know that Alec Baldwin, he's going to put up a fight for this.",

And clearly, the U.S. is growing concern. This is a measure of the fact that the U.S. is concerned that China is preparing to do something that would dramatically change not only the U.S.-China relationship, but the decision to send arms and ammunition into the war would have the effect of carving up the world.It would hasten up -- hasten the feeling that we have two rival strategic blocks of the kind that we had in the Cold War. Both the U.S. and China say they don't want a Cold War scenario. I think part of the message that you hear the U.S. sending to the Chinese is if you do this, you will isolate yourselves, because you'll put yourselves in league not only with Russia, but also with countries like Iran and North Korea, which are some of the only regimes that have been sending arms and ammunition to Russia.

And that means also it's a warning to China to take a step back on its approach to surveillance, either the posture of being as aggressive as it has been or the management.You know, one of the big debates, Victor, is whether this was a case of a mistake at the highest levels or whether it was designed to push the relationship into riskier territory. But I think the feeling is this was a kind of stress test of the U.S.-China relationship, and we passed in the sense that we didn't come out of here with casualties, but it was a sign of real vulnerability there.

If you're France or you're Germany, the decisions that you make around how you deal with China, whether or not you join in a regime of isolation against them, is just completely different.And yet at the same time, and I hear this from European diplomats just up into the last few days, there is a general reassessment going on among many European allies that say that business as usual. The idea of the old China relationship, it's simply no longer possible that we've entered into a new phase. They're more vigilant. They may not be prepared to join an effort to try to isolate China, but it is not the same as it was a year or two ago. And if, in fact, China does join Russia's effort by sending lethal aid to Russia, that would undermine fundamentally any hope that China might have of maintaining its relationship with European allies.",
