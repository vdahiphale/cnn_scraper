I mean, there definitely have been a steady amount or an increase in ransomware attacks on financial institutions and other industries over the last year. But the fact that there's little more transparency and requirements to actually report the data is giving us more of a sense of the scope of the problem.For many years, this was mostly swept under the rug. Companies were very quiet about whether they paid off cybercriminals, it's not a particularly good look. And they just kind of wanted to get it over with and restore their data. Now they're getting a lot more scrutiny from the government, and they're being forced to disclose how often they're doing this. And the figure, the $1 billion figure comprises potential payments and extortion amounts. So the actual number may be a bit lower than that.
