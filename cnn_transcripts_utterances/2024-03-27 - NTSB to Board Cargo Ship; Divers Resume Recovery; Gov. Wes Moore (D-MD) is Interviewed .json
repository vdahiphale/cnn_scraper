They still have not located any of those six missing construction workers.And their teams are really dealing with brutal conditions out there. It is cold out here. There have been winds whipping. There are serious waves in the water right now, choppy waves. And so it is very difficult for the crews that are out on the river trying to find them. And as you mentioned, this investigation is really ramping up today with the NTSB, their investigators finally boarding the Dali, getting that black box off, as you mentioned. We are expecting to get a timeline from them later this afternoon. Hopefully that black box will tell them what went wrong that caused that near total blackout on the ship just before the collision. And we are learning much more about the six construction workers, their lives. They were members of various communities here in Maryland. For some of them, over many years. We have learned about 38- year-old Maynard Yasir Suazo Sandoval. He was an immigrant from Honduras who had been in the United States for the past 18 years. A married father of two, an 18-year-old son and a five-year-old daughter. And, John, I can tell you, you could feel the heartbreak here in Baltimore over the past 24 hours. And it's only grown since we are learning more of those stories. It is just brutal for so many people to think about the lives that are most likely lost in this terrible tragedy.",

Look at how long it has taken in the past, though. 1980, the Sunshine Bridge over Sunshine Skyway near Tampa was also hit, by a freighter in that case, and it failed. In that case, it took seven years before they were able to get that all fully re-establish there.Usually though, and that bridge looks very nice now - usually, though, it doesn't take quite as long. I-35 in Minnesota, 11 months when it collapsed. Pittsburgh, ten months when it collapsed. I-95 in Pennsylvania, the roadway messed up there, took two weeks to get a temporary roadway into place. So, the question will be, how fast can they do it here? Hopefully very soon for a lot of people involved. Again, right now, still dealing with the human tragedy. But you know the plans are in the works here. And what the White House is saying is, look, this is a federal priority. This isn't a state issue. This isn't just for Maryland. The country needs this to be working again, and fast. So hopefully that makes a very fast recovery effort.",

And with those divers in the water, it's just incredibly dangerous. Hats off to those brave and incredibly skilled first responders who are in that environment. As you have pointed out, visibility is very low. And because of that current, whatever they're looking for, victims or areas of debris that will be important to the inspection, it may very well have moved.

You're kind of taking them by surprise.Now the second piece of this, going in with guns, the amount of agents, that indicates that they might have anticipated some resistance. We know in some of these civil lawsuits there have been allegations raised about gun use, gun trafficking. Perhaps they thought there could be guns at the homes and that there would be a threat or a risk.
