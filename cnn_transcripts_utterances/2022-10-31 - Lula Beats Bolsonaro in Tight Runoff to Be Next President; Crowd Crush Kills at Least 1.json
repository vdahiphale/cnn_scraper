He served two earlier terms from 2003 through 2010, when he led the country through an economic boom that helped lift millions out of poverty. He thanked supporters a short time ago.

And he joins me now from New York. So good to have you with us, Brian, want to get your reaction first, the moment Mr. Lula took the lead, as results were rolling in. What was your first thought? BRIAN WINTER, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, AMERICAS QUARTERLY: My first thought was this completes one of the greatest political comebacks in modern political history anywhere, when you consider that Lula was in prison two years ago, and it seemed like he's -- say his success story from when he was president in the 2000s had ended in tragedy. And now here he is about to take power again. But he knows that this is a very difficult challenge ahead of him. And I still think there are dangerous days ahead in Brazil. This nation is very polarized. We haven't heard anything yet from President Bolsonaro or his family, which is very involved in politics as well. There is still a possibility they may try to make this transition difficult. And many are still worried about political violence in days ahead.",

He lost, but his allies will be governors of Brazil's three most populous states. And so, Bolsonaro and his, you know, he may end up deciding to try to live to fight another day, and basically grumble about fraud and the media and the courts being stacked against him, but still not try to burn the house down on his way out.

Many want to know why there was very little crowd control during the large Halloween celebrations. The area was brimming with partygoers, making it hard to move or breathe. Many people fell over and were trampled by others around them. Some were so desperate to get out they tried to climb over walls. It was so crowded, in fact, by the time emergency crews got there, they struggled to reach people in need. And as CNN's Will Ripley shows us, it was a massive crowd in a narrow space.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This is one of the alleys. The alley actually right next door, just down the block from where this happened. This was supposed to be packed tonight. And you can see that it's completely shut down. This space, maybe six and a half feet across guys. Can you imagine being stuck in the middle here? With literally 1000s of people in this small area, packing and pushing you. It's hard to wrap your mind around how terrifying that must have been for those people who were essentially crushed to death or for those who slipped and fell and had people piling up on top of them. Some people so desperate, you know they were trying to climb up these walls here just jumping in and grabbing for anything they could to get up above the crowd of people. There's a lot of questions that need to be answered here in South Korea. Why were so many people allowed to pack into a narrow space like this? Where was the crowd control? Some of the images that we've been showing you, they were from an hour, two hours before this deadly incident. Was there nobody sounding the alarm saying, hey, too many people, let's clear them out before something horrible happens. I mean, these are the really tough questions that they're having to ask here. But tonight, as you see, it's all about, well, most people who were here last night want nothing to do with this place. Now, it's empty, aside from a handful of reporters and the police blocking off the area. And, of course, those shoes and the pieces of people's Halloween costumes just sitting in trash bags. I guarantee you, a lot of the pieces of costumes there come from people who didn't make it out alive. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
