Trump and his 18 co-defendants have until noon Friday to turn themselves in on charges tied to his attempts to overturn the election in Georgia. We are closely watching two key sites in Atlanta, the Fulton County Courthouse, that's where those negotiations will happen, and the jail where the defendants will have to show up and be booked.CNN's Katelyn Polantz is outside the courthouse. Katelyn, what more do we know about these talks and about how long they'll take? KATELYN POLANTZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE REPORTER: Well, we're expecting these negotiations between the prosecutors here in Georgia and Donald Trump's defense lawyers to happen this afternoon. And that there may be other lawyers for other defendants, some of those or maybe all of those 18 to be coming in or somehow negotiating with the prosecutors in this case. What they have to negotiate is how these arrests are going to work because Donald Trump, he is going to be arrested here. He has now been indicted. He ultimately will have to enter his initial pleading very likely of not guilty, same with the other defendants. But that can't happen until their lawyers come in and talk to the prosecutors about getting bail terms set, and how these people will be released if there are any specific terms that the prosecutors want. Maybe travel restrictions, maybe money that they might have to put up. And so we're waiting to see some evidence that these negotiations are taking place here. We have a large team spread out around here at the courthouse complex awaiting this development to see how it goes. There is a pretty heightened level of security here. But it really isn't clear yet when these negotiations would be finalized. And also, we're watching to see if Donald Trump is going to be treated like any other criminal defendant in the system here in Georgia. The sheriff here previously said at the beginning of August that any defendant would be treated the same no matter who it might be. But at the end of the day, Donald Trump isn't just any defendant. He is the former president with Secret Service protection for life himself. And whenever he goes over to the jail, he would be very different than many of the people who would be held there in that he comes in with his own security. He might not need to be mugshot because he's so recognizable. But that will be for later in the week. We're waiting to see exactly what emerges from these bond talks when we can confirm that they happen.",

I mean, time DeLay, I think had one as well. I mean, you have a lot of people who've had mug shots before, so it's not unheard of. But the notion of him having one could be very well used as a kind of campaign propaganda. A kind of saying, listen, his whole platform has been it is me against the world, they actually want to get to you, but I'm standing in the way. So, really, this weaponized government is doing just this. So, that could be a possibility. But really, mug shots are supposed to be a part of the entire booking process for really two reasons. One, to identify the person. We already know who he is. But of course, we know other famous people as well. And number two, as a part of the system and a part of what the track record has been. He has now three other indictments. They certainly have a record of him. They know where he is. They didn't probably have his fingerprints already.

Now, if they have complementary laws that are at issue or complementary indictments, that is merely a coincidence. But it's not an insurance policy that one actually coincides according with the other. It's on more saying, look, a state prosecution will stand as it is. There's a reason for that. Fani Willis and Fulton County and Georgia have a vested interest in how their elections are run, and how they are undermined. We know the Constitution, our Founding Fathers, our laws, give our states the power to regulate and oversee their election. So, in some respects, if Georgia and the allegations are true, that would all be Georgia state territory and a federal prosecution will have to stay on its own lane. So, there are very interesting reasons to look at both of these. But at the end of the day, a state prosecution overseeing state voting laws is going to be extremely important in how elections are run from here on out. But the federal charges do not give a side eye to him, Boris, because they're very significant. But if he is the president, he could poopoo that and do away with it.",

Now, I'm also have had many conversations with Donald Trump's team over the last few days and hours. And I know that Donald Trump, both privately and publicly has been boasting about his commanding lead in the polls and pointing to them as some of his reasoning for why he thinks he can just skip that debate on Wednesday. And remember, while all of his Republican rivals are currently preparing to take the stage in Milwaukee, Donald Trump won't be there. And so, this is kind of where their posture is right now. They're focusing on a general but of course, again, this is very early on in the race, the primary elections are a far way away. And a lot can change between now and then especially as you have all of his legal troubles hovering around this. And of course, Donald Trump is expected to head to Georgia this week and surrender.

And he was moving that forward.We actually have seen quite a lot about him before we've seen his e- mails. A judge previously, totally separately in a lawsuit. In the House investigation previously, there was a judge that released his e- mails to the House, which became a crucial part of some of the facts of this case and all of the other investigations around January 6. And that judge when he had looked at what John Eastman had done with Donald Trump, said yes, it did look as if these two men were trying to advance some sort of crime. Now, we have Johnny's been charged alongside Donald Trump in this case. We also have him in the federal case related to January six, as a co-conspirator. And so, his bond term, $100,000.
