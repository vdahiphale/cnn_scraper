      "sentences": "Well, Democrats and the country starting out this week facing a new political reality in this election race. Still a lot of questions in replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the presidential ticket.The president's announcement on Sunday that he's dropping out of the race, surprising so many, now endorsing Kamala Harris to succeed him, sparked a surge of Democratic support, as well as donations for the vice president. Harris says she is ready to earn and win the nomination. Her words. As of now, some party leaders are withholding their endorsements but boy, lots of sitting lawmakers are already out saying they will back her and she should be the nominee. The party's rules committee will meet Wednesday to map out a path forward ahead of next month's convention in Chicago. Republicans they have been making some preparations for this day. They reacted as you might expect after Biden's announcement attacking the vice president and her record calling on President Biden as well to resign from the office of president immediately. We've got a team of reporters covering all the latest developments, Arlette Saenz with us from Rehoboth Beach, Delaware where President Biden remains as he recovers from COVID. Eva McKend, outside the vice president's official office, residents in Washington. Steve Contorno in Ohio for us where the Republican vice presidential candidate J.D. Vance will hold a solo rally today. Jeff Zeleny in Washington for a big picture view of all that is going on. I wonder first EVA with you, this was quite a day for the president. Clearly, a difficult decision for him. And one that surprised even some in his own party as to how quickly it came out. What are you hearing this morning as they wake up to this new reality? EVA MCKEND, CNN U.S. NATIONAL POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: It is, Jim, you know in just a few moments, we might see the motorcade pass by here as Vice President Harris heads to the White House. She is expected to give remarks honoring the NCAA champions, but we don't know if she is going to address the shakeup directly. We don't know if she wants to give President Biden the opportunity to do that first. What we do know is that she has been on the phones, aggressively making calls, feverishly making calls to governors, members of Congress, President Obama, the Clintons, faith leaders, labor leaders, civil rights leaders. And it's all in an effort to shore up support internally among Democrats. I was speaking with the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. And he told me that the sense that he got from their conversation is that he is under -- she is under no illusion that this is going to be easy. And that she expects really to have to earn this nomination in the weeks ahead. But she does have on her side though, is that key Democratic coalition. So, I'm talking about groups like higher heights, black voters matter, they are firmly behind her, thousands of black women, on a call last night strategizing about the best path forward.

      "sentences": "Well, President Biden made clear in his letter announcing that he was bowing out of this race, that he does intend to focus on his work as president as this rest of the year and early next year plays out.Now, the president right now is still here in Rehoboth Beach Delaware, where he has been recovering from COVID 19. This is also where he made that final decision to exit this race huddling with just two of his very closest longtime advisors who really presented the president with the most recent polling, briefed him on where top Democrat stood and ultimately told the president that the path to victory for him in November was virtually nonexistent. The president setting into motion his plans to drop out on Saturday evening and then finalizing those plans with that letter just yesterday. But there are still big questions going forward about how President Biden will play in this campaign. Now, the president in his letter announcing his withdrawal from the race said that he does want to address the nation soon about his decision. One big factor that's determining the schedule is the president's COVID diagnosis. He is still recuperating here, he's still waiting for the all clear from his doctor, so it's not yet certain when he will return to Washington to potentially address the nation. The president, as you mentioned, is also expected to meet at some point this week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israelis, the prime minister's office had said that that meeting was -- would take place on Tuesday, though, on the White House said they have not confirmed any dates, and said that it's more likely to happen mid to late into this week. But it's all dependent on that COVID diagnosis. The president was also scheduled to travel out west for a fundraising swing over the weekend, there was at least one fundraiser scheduled in Laguna Beach, California, another expected in Northern California. Right now, they're still working to determine whether those fundraisers move forward. But if the president were to fundraise, it likely would go towards the vice president's campaign. You've also already seen the campaign apparatus really move gears to fully support the vice president. They've changed their social media accounts, they've come up with a new logo, and they are also pushing their fundraising apparatus to bring in more money for the vice president. A source this morning telling us that the vice president brought in $49.6 million in grass -- online grassroots donations alone, a sign of enthusiasm, but also a much needed boost to the campaign war chest as she is seeking this Democratic nomination. Of course, for Harris, the big question going forward is can she coalesce all Democrats around her there, some in the party who want to see an open nominating process, have other people potentially get into the race. But so far, there has been a lot of public support for the vice president, all things she will have to work towards. Of course, she has the support of her current boss, President Biden, who within 30 minutes of dropping out of the race threw his support behind Harris.",

But it is absolutely a remarkable, really half century of leadership in America, from the youngest U.S. Senator elected in 1972, of course, leaving office as the oldest American president. His advisors and I believe he would say, look, he's not done yet. He has a day job as president, the spotlight is going to shift away from him. There is no doubt about it, Republicans are trying to still make him an issue in this race that will likely make Vice President Harris shift the spotlight even more. But Jim, it's absolutely remarkable span of American life. But as for Vice President Harris, we are seeing those endorsements come in just really a minute by minute. The Illinois Governor JB Pritzker is the latest potential running mate, but also Democratic governor to throw his support behind a Kamala Harris. So, that is what people are watching here today. This will be her first big presidential decision, should she become the nominee, that she will make her running mate decision. I'm told before that the formal process of the nomination happens. But that will be her first big look. So, behind the scenes today, yes, she's still trying to galvanize Republican -- her Democratic support, excuse me, but she's also thinking to her -- for her potential running mate as well, Jim.",

If this would have been even perhaps a couple of months ago, there likely would have been at least somewhat of a Democratic primary, thinking that the stronger candidate would emerge from the primary. And that might have been the vice president.I mean, she obviously would have had a huge head start here. Her name literally has been on the via campaign signs. And you know, she is the beneficiary of this campaign apparatus. But the fact of the matter is, with the Chicago convention, the Democratic Convention less than one month away, there are few options, and the time has been moving on here. So, time has been on her side. But Jim, above all, and Democrats want to get back to the whole idea of this campaign that's trying to contrast with Donald Trump, it should be about him, not about Joe Biden. But look, she still has to shore up a bit of support. And beyond that, it's her constituents. She's a -- she has to support but Donald Trump, he's the big Democratic unifier in this, Jim.",

Right around the time that Joe Biden announced his intention to seek a second term for office then, of course, the events of October 7th, and then many months in the interim where the administration's position on Israel came under immense criticism for being seen as supporting Israel at all costs, and not being willing, at least from the outset to acknowledge the Palestinian death toll. That is something that the administration has tried to carefully calibrate since then. And it's a position that the vice president herself has been instrumental in developing behind closed doors. But certainly the spotlight will be on both President Biden and Vice President Harris, who is expected to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu this week, although the timing of these meetings is still in flux, given the President's own unexpected diagnosis of COVID last week that has thrown into something of disarray, that schedule of events that he had planned for this week. But certainly the Secretary of State has suggested in recent days that a deal to release hostages and reach a ceasefire in Gaza is inside the 10 yard line. Of course, an American football analogy that expresses the sentiment that it is extremely close to new (ph). The National Security Adviser just yesterday meeting with families of those still being held hostages. But Jim, just today, there are still protests for pro-Palestinian groups outside the White House demanding a deal be reached, demanding the horror inside Gaza be stopped.

But of course, there have been those tensions around the ceasefire deal, around the terms of the agreement and around the U.S.'s own foreign policy, objectives and also wishes of what it wants to see happen in the Gaza Strip.
