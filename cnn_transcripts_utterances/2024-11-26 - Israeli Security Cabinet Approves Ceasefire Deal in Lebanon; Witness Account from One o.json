A ceasefire dealbetween Israel and Hezbollah seems now to be a reality, putting the fighting that has led, of course, to the death of thousands of people along Lebanon's border on hold. Just a short time ago, in fact, the Israeli security cabinet voted to approve the U.S.-supported plan, hitting pause, of course, in the violence for 60 days with hopes that it could be the basis for a more lasting truce. We're still waiting the crucial details here. We did hear from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following the vote. Have a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, PRIME MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator):  Citizens of Israel, I promised victory to you and we will achieve victory. We will complete destruction of Hamas, all of our hostages, we will make sure that Gaza will no longer be a threat to Israel, and we will bring back these residents of the north to their homes. The war will not finish until we reach all of its goals, including until we bring all of the residents of the north home. I'd like to tell you, it will happen exactly as it happened in the south.

Of course, thisis something that he and his team have been monitoring very closely, knowing, of course, that U.S. officials have for many months now tried to contain any tensions in the Middle East, and certainly this was a deal that they were intimately involved with. And over the last several days had expressed a level of cautious optimism and confidence. John Kirby, yesterday, the National Security Council spokesperson saying that they were quote, \"close to a deal and said that negotiations were based on a lot of back and forth, also earlier today, we heard from Secretary of State Blinken, who said that they were in the final stages of these negotiations. Now, of course, U.S. officials have always warned that no deal is a deal until it's done. But they do appear to have gotten to that point. Now, of course, we also had seen some signs of this over the course of the week when U.S. officials were also traveling to the region. White House Middle East Coordinator Brett McGurk had gone to Saudi Arabia as that ceasefire deal came to a close and was expected to stay there through Tuesday. That of course, a telling sign of just how close they were to reaching this. But again, the President will be speaking more on this later this hour, and we can anticipate that not only will he be talking about U.S. efforts as part of this deal.

But that friction between Israel and France that has grown over the last few months, as France with other European countries has called increasingly for arms embargoes against Israel, been more and more critical of its policies, not just in Gaza but elsewhere. That is also an important part of what has happened. And we saw that in the shape of what happened just in the last few days when the ceasefire talks seemed suddenly in doubt. Israel was insisting that France be removed from them entirely. The court, the decision by the International Criminal Court in The Hague to issue those arrest warrants, not just for Benjamin Netanyahu, but also for Yoav Gallant; the former Defense Minister. And the fact that countries like France, which are signatories to it, said, well, look, if they do come to French soil, they will be arrested because we will respect the law, had particularly incensed the Israeli leadership. And there were some questions about whether this -- these ceasefire talks, including as they did France could carry on. And it was -- we understand, under the insistence of the United States that France was left within, but also within what will be this crucial monitoring process over the course of the next 60 days. That will decide whether or not there have been breaches and how firmly the ceasefire can hold, whether or not France would be a part of that. And what we understand is that, again, Washington's assistance, it will be. And that's important, Isa, not just because the ceasefire has been able to come to pass, but for the rest of the world, and in particular, the Arab world and amongst it, Lebanon's belief that their interests as well will be heard as this ceasefire is implemented, Isa.",

And a widening of a very intense and frankly, very extreme policy when it comes to Gaza. But when it comes to Lebanon, I don't think he had that same sort of calculation. I think that on the contrary, he felt that on Lebanon, Trump doesn't want to see a widening of the conflict. I think that there would have been messages from the incoming Trump team that they want to see that winding down, and, you know, Israel thought that it could get as far as -- let's say this, when it came to Lebanon.

First of all, she addresses him as President-elect, and then she starts highlighting that he might not be aware of what Mexico has been doing to stem the flow of people towards the border. But then she goes into very specific details about the relationship, and she highlights that even though Mexico is the place where people come to the border, the U.S. is the source of 70 percent of all illegal weapons in Mexico, and that the consumption of drugs   in the U.S. fuels this business. So, she basically is signaling that the relationship with her government will be different with -- than the one that Trump had with Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. She says as is true that Mexico is the United States main trading partner, and any tariffs that the U.S. imposes on Mexico will probably be followed by tariffs imposed by Mexico on the U.S. She mentions one of the -- some of the bigger automakers and the impact this would have and the jobs that would be impacted. So, I think it's a hard line sent from President Sheinbaum, saying they're not going to put up with this, and it's going to be a different type of relationship when it comes -- when President Trump takes office in January of 2025, he's still not the President, but obviously, he's still rattling the markets, it just feels like things that happened while he was President. And remember, he already did threaten with the tariffs and then backed down and said he got everything he wanted.

The Lebanese health ministry says at least 10 people died in Central Beirut. I want to go to our Jeremy Diamond, who's in Northern Israel. And, Jeremy, there is a lot we do not know at this stage about this deal and the specifics of this deal. But from our conversation that we've had in the last 24 hours, what does seem to be -- what it seems to be clear is that the ceasefire deal was not universally popular, specifically where you are in some parts of the north of Israel. I'm going to play some sound from some residents, of course, to have been displaced given the attacks from Hezbollah. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

U.S.officials have been reticent to go out in front of the agreement before everything is in place. But we heard from Secretary of State Antony Blinken just a little while ago saying that the broad contours of the agreement were as such. We would see a withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon, a pulling back of Hezbollah forces to the north, an inflection of Lebanese armed forces to the south in that border area in order to protect that region. And it would also be basically the U.N. Security Council 1701 actually put into place. Blinken said that they believe that this is an actual possibility to finally have the security council resolution that was passed almost two decades ago to bring the 2006 conflict to an end actually put into force. Now, the secretary of state also said that this could have serious positive implications for what is to come in that region. Take a listen to what he told reporters. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  It will make a big difference in saving lives and livelihoods in Lebanon and in Israel. It will make a big difference in creating the conditions that will allow people to return to their homes safely in Northern Israel and in Southern Lebanon. And I also believe that by de-escalating tensions in the region it can also help us to end the conflict in Gaza. In particular, Hamas will know that it can't count on other fronts opening up in the war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, Isa, as we wait for President Biden, we should expect them to be touting this as a diplomatic victory. The U.S. has been pushing on this for months and months to try to get a Lebanon ceasefire in place, to try to get the terms of a diplomatic resolution in place. We've seen Secretary of State Antony Blinken going to the region. Amos Hochstein has been leading talks between Lebanese officials, Israeli officials, and the U.S. alongside partners like France. So, we will wait and see what Biden says, but they will be hailing this as a victory, Isa.",
