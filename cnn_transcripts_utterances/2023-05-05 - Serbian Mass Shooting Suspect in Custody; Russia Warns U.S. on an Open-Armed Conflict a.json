This is just outside of the village of Sepsin, and you can see -- I mean this is a very rural area; it's a very wide-open area, this shooter frankly could've been anywhere. The manhunt was absolutely massive, involving some 600 officers spreadacross the very wide SWAT. We saw them 20 miles away from here on the highway, combing it hours and hours ago. We're now eight hours -- more than eight hours from where the shooting took place last night. We spoke to one man in the village just now, who said that at the time, he was actually arrested by police, who mistakenly thought that perhaps he could've been the shooter, after he came out of his house, after he got into an emergency notification on his phone. He actually asked me, once we got the news that arrest had been made, whether it was safe to come out, because he hadn't quite gotten it yet, and only then did he emerge from his house. What's interesting here is that the arrest, Kim, was actually made in a larger city called Kragujevac, that's -- which is more than an hour away here in Central Serbia. The shooting, as I said, took place in very rural areas. We went to the site of what we think is the initial shooting. And it is -- I mean it's in the middle of nowhere. It's between two villages, it's a soccer pitch there. It has apparently, a barbecue area where young people would gather at night. And it seems to be what happened last night when the suspect, according to authorities, fired with an automatic weapon. There would be a lot of questions on how he would have got that weapon, and obviously why he fired, because though there are guns, plenty of them flying around in this country illegally left over from the conflict in the 1990s, you cannot buy an automatic weapon here in Serbia legally. And even getting a semi-automatic weapon you have to jump through a whole lot of hoops and background checks in order to get one. Kim.",

Reporting in Atlanta, Ryan Young, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE) BRUNHUBER:  Police have made an arrest in a series of deadly stabbings, near the University of California Davis. A 21-year-old former student was taken into custody Thursday. Carlos Dominguez is accused of three stabbings that left two people dead. A woman was severely injured in the most recent attack on Monday. U.C.

Now, we're going to show you the video of the incident. We just want to warn you, some images may be disturbing obviously there. So, before Neely was allegedly choked, witnesses say he was yelling at fellow passengers claiming he was hungry and thirsty. Neely was a well-known Michael Jackson impersonator, but fell on hard times in recent years. A friend said he'd been struggling since the murder of his mother in 2007. She said he'd been living on the streets. The official autopsy results in the Memphis police-beating death of Tyre Nichols shows he died of blunt force trauma to the head. His death has been ruled a homicide. The medical examiner's report shows Nichols rupturing in his brain and cuts are bruising all over his body. Nichols' death sparked national protests after police body camera video and surveillance footage showed five Memphis Police officers repeatedly punching and kicking him after a traffic stop on January 7th. Five former officers pleaded not guilty to several charges, including second degree murder. The District Attorney says, former Memphis Officer Preston Hemphill will not face criminal charges, but he was charged with a department policy violations. Well, now to a stark prediction from Russia's deputy foreign minister says the U.S. and Russia are on the verge of an open armed conflict. It comes as Moscow is blaming Washington for directing the drone attack on the Kremlin, early Wednesday. The White House calls that claim ridiculous. Russia has vowed to retaliate against Ukraine, but on Thursday, Ukraine shot down its own malfunctioning drone over Kyiv. The Air Force says there were no casualties. Now, the attack on the Kremlin isn't the only drone strike inside Russian territory, in recent days, Moscow blames Ukraine, but it's not entirely clear who's been the wave of attacks CNN's Matthew Chance reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  \"60 Minutes,\" the Kremlin version, with breaking news of three more attempted drone strikes on Russian soil. [03:10:03] The anchor, a Kremlin mouthpiece, tells her millions of viewers how two attacks on oil facilities were unsuccessful. But another targeting a village near the Ukrainian border, she admits, got through. Increasingly, Russia's war in Ukraine is coming home. Just hours before, it was the Kremlin itself in the line of fire, a Ukrainian assassination attempt on President Putin, said officials, denied by Ukraine. Now, the Kremlin says it's the United States that's the blame. DMITRY PESKOV, KREMLIN PRESS SECRETARY (through translator):  We know very well that decisions about such actions, about such terrorist attacks, are not made in Kyiv, but in Washington. And Kyiv does what it is told to do. JOHN KIRBY, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL:  There's a word that comes to mind that I am obviously not a, not appropriate -- CHANCE (voice-over):  But U.S. officials are pushing back.",

We heard from Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister cited by state media, essentially saying that while these actions they claim were executed by Kyiv, where those drone strikes they alleged were directed at potentially assassinating President Putin, these plans have been devised in Washington, D.C. by the U.S. government. That is the claim coming from the Kremlin. They say the U.S. has long been directly engaged with Ukraine in this war, in Ukraine.So, of course, these are strong comments coming from the Kremlin. This is something we have of course heard before. And as you saw there in Matthew's report and the U.S. and Ukraine vehemently denying those allegations. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that anything coming from the Kremlin should be taken, quote, with a large shaker of salt. Of course, we are repeatedly hearing those denials from the U.S. government about the said of course, there is a stark warning coming from the Kremlin. They say the U.S. and Russia are verging closer towards an open armed conflict. But they also say that they are working to ensure that that point isn't reached. There's still communication and dialogue between the two parties, even at a higher level. So, words of caution are coming from the Kremlin. Of course we have heard from the U.S. intelligence official, warning that Russia is in fact, potentially, scaling back its immediate ambitions when it comes to the situation on the ground. And what we have seen in recent days, the doubling down of that aerial bombardment of Kyiv. When it comes to those longer terms ambitions by President Putin, and the Russian armed forces, they are facing significant challenges on the ground. The current U.S. intelligence assessment is that they are facing significant shortfalls, when it comes to manpower and ammunition, looking towards gaining territory. In fact, that has actually stalled in comparison to the past three months, and they gained less territory in April than was anticipated.",
