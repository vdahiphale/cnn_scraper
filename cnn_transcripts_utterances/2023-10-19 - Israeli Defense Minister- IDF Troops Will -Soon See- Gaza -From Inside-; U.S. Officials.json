Right now the U.N. Secretary General is in Egypt witnessing preparations for those shipments.

This is the most fired upon city in all of Israel, about 25 percent of all of the rockets have been targeted at this very city.And so we spent the day kind of trying to get a sense of how the people who are living here, still about 75-, 70 percent of the population is still believed to be living here and yet 90 percent of businesses are closed. What is open though are supermarkets, for example, where we were today when one of those sirens went off. And you saw the different reactions from folks. Some of them really still very fearful trying to catch their breath as they rushed inside to try and get cover you only have a few seconds before those rockets head this way. Others carrying on with their shopping even as those sirens wailed in the skies above. And what we also witnessed today was the command center here in Ashkelon. They really have worked this down to a science to try and get the response as quickly as possible. They have two massive screens in there. And what they're actually able to do is get a sense of where these rockets are going to land if indeed they get through the Iron Dome missile defense system before they actually even make impact in order to rush those emergency services to those locations as quickly as possible. But Kaitlan, beyond that what we also got a sense of today is this sense of waiting, this sense of anticipation for the next phase of this military campaign as Israelis here are certainly expecting that a ground invasion is imminent and certainly as those comments that Nic was just talking about we are hearing Israeli officials increasingly using bellicose rhetoric and increasingly using very crystal-clear rhetoric about exactly what is going to happen next and that it will involve Israeli forces going into Gaza.",

And moreover that Ukraine itself is a distraction from this region that helped exacerbate this problem.So Vladimir Putin's number one goal in the entire world is to get the U.S. government and the U.S. Congress to stop Ukraine aid. That's what President Biden is giving a whole speech about. Tonight he's going to say that Israel, Ukraine they both need the aid. We can't choose one or the other.

So this is the only chance they have, so they're going to throw the kitchen sink in. That means border funding, that means funding for the Pacific, that means Ukraine funding, Israel funding, funding to modernize and replenish U.S. stockpiles. We're talking a lot of money. It could be upwards of $80- to a hundred billion dollars. That's no small amount of money, but the alternative would be to enter a year in 2024 when all of these challenges and all of these wars are likely to get deeper and worse and to have the U.S. military and our allies unprepared and I think that's an alternative that the President United States is going to argue vehemently against in his speech to the nation tonight.",

Sidney Powell is the second person charged in that 19 defendant case to plead guilty and she is a pretty significant person and that she's admitting to essentially tampering with voting equipment or wanting to tamper with voting equipment as well as voter data in Coffee County, Georgia that's part of the case that prosecutors had accused all of these people of as part of a large conspiracy, but also something they had accused her of specifically being involved in.And they are having her plead guilty to six misdemeanor charges that comes with a cooperation agreement, meaning that Sidney Powell if the prosecutors want to put her on the stand in front of a jury as they have another defendant on trial potentially even Donald Trump himself, they can call her and she will have to testify about the things that she's admitting to as part of this guilty plea and potentially other things they may ask her about. And when you step back, Boris, the big picture here is that Sidney Powell is someone who knew about that Coffee County, Georgia voter data breach, but also she was around Donald Trump and around people like Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows in a freewheeling chaotic screaming match of a meeting in mid-December at the White House that was - that at the end of the meeting as she and others were trying to convince Donald Trump to keep pushing these lies of election fraud. He then had that infamous tweet \"will be wild\" on January 6th.
