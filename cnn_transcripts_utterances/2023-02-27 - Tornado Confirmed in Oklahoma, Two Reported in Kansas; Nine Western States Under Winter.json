Before joining the court, though, he was the deputy general counsel at what is called the First Liberty Institute. It's a nonprofit religious liberty group. He worked on religious liberty litigation. And look, though, any decision here to block access to medication abortion, even on a temporary basis, will have an enormous impact in this country. And, you know, I also want to point out that there is a coalition of Democratic attorneys general who have come out in support of the FDA. And they make some important points.
