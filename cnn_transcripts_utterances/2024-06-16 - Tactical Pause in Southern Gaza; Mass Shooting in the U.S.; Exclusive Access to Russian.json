      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN Newsroom. I'm Anna Coren live from Hong Kong.Ahead on the program, Israeli forces announce a tactical pause to get more aid into Southern Gaza. We're live in the region with what that means. Another mass shooting in the U.S., this time at a splash pad where children were playing. And exclusive access to a Russian warship in Cuba, CNN gets on board. What we found there, ahead. New developments this hour in the Israel Hamas war, the Israeli military says it has started a daily tactical pause in one part of Southern Gaza to allow more aid to reach Palestinians. But the military says the fighting in Rafah continues. The IDF says the pause will run from 8:00 A.M. local time until 7:00 P.M. local time every day until further notice. Meanwhile, Hamas' military wing claims it was behind an explosion that killed eight Israeli soldiers in Rafah, calling it a complex ambush. It happened Saturday in the Tal al-Sultan neighborhood in Rafah. The IDF says it's investigating the incident. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the deaths a heartbreaking price to pay. Well, anti-Netanyahu protesters blocked highways on Sunday. They are demanding new elections to remove Netanyahu and a deal to bring home all of the hostages held in Gaza. CNN's Ben Wedeman joins us now live from Beirut with more. Ben, what does this tactical pause mean and why now?",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, Anna, it's very specific. It's between Kerem Abu Salem crossing, or the Kerem Shalom crossing, as it's known in Hebrew, where a lot of the humanitarian goods enter Gaza, to the Salah al-Din Highway, which is the main road that links Southern and Northern Gaza.Now, the Israelis say this was in coordination, after consultation with United Nations and other humanitarian organizations allowing for trucks to get into Gaza and then to leave Gaza with those humanitarian goods, of course, given the dire situation in Gaza where we have people, you know, young children dying of malnutrition. Clearly, the pressure is on Israel to start to allow more humanitarian goods in. Now, this is announced less than 24 hours after we heard of this Hamas strike on an Israeli armored vehicle that left at least eight dead. That strike happened early in the morning yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, there was another strike by Hamas on an Israeli tank in the northern part of Gaza killing two Israeli soldiers. In addition to that, there's addition, there is news of an Israeli soldier who sustained wounds on Monday, dying as well. So, clearly, the Israelis are starting to feel that perhaps that in terms of losses within the ranks of the military, they're beginning to get high. Hamas has not been vanquished after we're well into our ninth month of this war. Keep in mind that back in 1967, in six days, the Israelis defeated the armies of Egypt, Syria and Jordan. Here we are eight and a half months into this war and they still have not been able to defeat Hamas. They still have not been able to militarily liberate more than seven of the Israeli hostages in Gaza. So, clearly, this war is not working in their favor. And I think they're looking for ways perhaps to scale down, find an exit ramp for the level of fighting that has been going on now and that yesterday took such a high toll among the Israeli troops.

The distribution of the aid, this is a war zone, nobody says that it's easy. And there's no question that in October of 2023, that's eight and a half months ago, Israelis said, Israeli officials, that they would stop or limit humanitarian aid. And that was a horrible thing to say. That was eight and a half months ago.Let's get past that for the last eight months. Ask and look at the data. Not just what the Hamas say, and in that sense, not -- I absolutely feel because it is horrible inside the Gaza Strip, but Israel has enabled the aid to get in. We are not the ones distributing it. We are not the ones all over. And as we do that, we're trying to act against Hamas, not against the Palestinian people. And the framing of what you said right now is putting the full onus of the blame on Israel. We've been trying to tell people to move into safer areas, trying to enable that. It is Hamas that stops that, not Israel. Let's be clear about this.",

The director of Al-Ali Hospital confirmed to CNN that 13 bodies had arrived there. CNN has reached out to the Israeli Defense Forces for comment.Police near Detroit, Michigan say at least nine people were shot and injured Saturday at a splash pad, a water fountain, where children play, with the suspect dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Families were just enjoying their day when it turned into chaos, with people scrambling to get away. A mother and her eight- year-old son are both in critical condition. Victims were taken to several hospitals with what authorities called varying kinds of injuries. Police say the shooting appears to be random. They followed a suspect to a nearby home and found him dead inside. Police also found a handgun and three empty magazines at the crime scene, saying the 42- year-old gunman potentially fired 28 times. Michigan's governor says she is heartbroken and monitoring the situation. For three years, Afghan girls have been banned from school, banned from studying and bettering their lives. The world's most famous champion of girls' education is urging the world not to look away. Her message is next. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It comes as more than 1.8 million Muslims are taking part in the annual Hajj pilgrimage, one of the biggest religious gatherings in the world. And this year, it comes amid an extreme heat wave. Temperatures in Mecca are forecast to reach 48 degrees Celsius or 118 degrees Fahrenheit. Officials are asking pilgrims to carry umbrellas and stay hydrated amid the harsh conditions.UNICEF is drawing the world's attention back to Afghanistan and reminding us that the Taliban are robbing girls of their futures. When Taliban fighters captured Kabul in August of 2021 and took over the country, they banned girls from attending school past the sixth grade. On Thursday, UNICEF marked a thousand lost days of education for Afghan girls. That is 3 billion hours of learning for 1.5 million girls just gone. UNICEF's executive director says without education, girls are at risk of early marriage, malnutrition and deteriorating physical and mental health. Well, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai knows very well the value of girls' education and how to fight for it. Earlier, she spoke with CNN's Bianna Golodryga about how Afghanistan and the Taliban stand alone on this issue in the Muslim world. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MALALA YOUSAFZAI, GIRL'S EDUCATION ACTIVIST:  There are a dozen of Muslim countries in the world. And none of those Muslim countries do you see girls prohibited from education, or women prohibited from work. It's not a crime for girls to have rights in those countries. At the same time, we know that culture and religion are often used as an excuse by the Taliban and by other extremists as well to limit women, to protect their misogyny. There is no solid basis for that at all. Islam actually encourages education for all children, for everybody in Islam. It is your responsibility to get education. I don't know what sort of system, what sort of ideology they're talking about, but the culture that, you know, I come from and the religion that I know, it encourages education. And I think the Taliban need to -- we also -- like at this point, I would say we need more Muslim leaders and more Muslim countries to step forward and actually challenge the Taliban to say that in Islam, there is no justification for a ban on girls' education and for preventing women from work in the Islamic context.",

There were some positive notes that came out of it, and transitions and changes, too, and this was one of them, what women had the opportunity to do, the opportunity to go to school, the opportunity to contribute to the workforce to the economy overall. We should note that this isn't just a human right that's being deprived of women. It's a right that's really hurting the Afghan economy as well, where so many women are just not allowed to contribute.You are though contributing though through your fund $1.5 million, as we noted. Explain to us how you and your fund through this money are able to help in any way you can specifically. What are you doing?",

It's a call back to an old Cold War alliance between Cuba and Russia, an alliance the countries may lean into as Russia antagonizes the west over its war in Ukraine.Well, CNN's Patrick Oppmann went on board one of those ships and has this exclusive look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) OPPMANN (voice over):  Several hundred Cubans wait in the boiling sun to tour a Russian warship. Russian diplomats told me the public would be allowed to visit the Admiral Gorshkov, one of the most modern warships in President Vladimir Putin's Navy, capable of firing hypersonic missiles that travel at more than 6,000 miles per hour. It's the first of three days the ship will receive visitors, a rare opportunity for people here to see up close a frigate belonging to Cuba's Cold War era comrades. We're going to get it live and see if we're able to get aboard. After nearly three hours waiting, having my Cuban resident I.D. card run through a database by police and passing through metal detectors, we are told to board the Gorshkov. Just next to us is the nuclear- powered submarine Kazan, the first of its kind to come to port here. The visit of the four Russian ships, the largest Russian convoy to Cuba in years, is not a threat to the U.S., both Russian and Cuban officials say. But the U.S. is closely tracking the ships and their movements. A sign in English by the gangplank to the Gorshkov says the ship's, quote, main purpose is combat operations against enemy surface ships and submarines. Although none of the vessels were currently carrying nuclear weapons, the Cuban Armed Forces Ministry said -- Hello, I say in rudimentary Russian to the sailors aboard the Gorshkov. We are only allowed on the main deck. And Russian sailors watch our every move. A deck above us where sophisticated communications equipment is visible, a soldier armed with an assault rifle keeps guard. Cuba good?",
