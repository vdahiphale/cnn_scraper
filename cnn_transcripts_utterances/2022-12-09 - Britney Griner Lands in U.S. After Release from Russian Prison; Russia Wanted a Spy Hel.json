She touched down in San Antonio earlier this morning after spending nearly 10 months in Russian prison.She has been reunited with her wife and was then taken to Brooke Army Medical Center for a routine health evaluation. The Biden administration secured her release by turning over convicted Russian arms dealer, Viktor Bout. Earlier today, I spoke to Griner's head coach, Vanessa Nygaard, who had this message for her. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VANESSA NYGAARD, BRITTNEY GRINER'S HEAD COACH IN THE WNBA: B.G., we love you and we're so happy that you are home. I burst into tears when I heard that you were returning. And I know so many other people did as well. We're just so touched to have you back. We love you so much. We live in a world that can be divisive. And there's a lot of noise out there. But from us, from the people nearest to you, we love you and we're so happy you are home. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Listen, it was a complex process that carried out over the course of several months. And it was really in recent weeks that the Biden administrationrealized that it was one or none, that they were going to get this deal for Brittney Griner and trade Viktor Bout or they weren't going to get any deal at all. So that is why they went ahead. But over the course of those negotiations, U.S. officials were growing frustrated because the Russians were putting people on the table that they wanted as part of a prisoner swap who wasn't even in U.S. custody. That's according to a senior administration official I spoke with. And our colleague, Natasha Bertrand, has actually confirmed that the person that Russia kept asking was Russian who is in prison in Germany facing a life sentence due to murder. It's a former Russian spy. And the Russians kept saying that's who they wanted in return for a prisoner swap that included Paul Whelan. And so that was frustrating to U.S. officials. Now, going forward, the question is, how can they figure out something to put on the table that will actually get Paul Whelan home? Because administration officials said they were quite creative over the course of the last few months to try and put something down that Russians would actually accept. But what they are saying today is that they are trying to think of new innovative ways, new things that they can offer to Russia to try and get Paul Whelan home. And I do think that it is significant that, just today, we're hearing from President Putin. As you know, he is the one who will make any determination on any prisoner swap. And he said that there's the possibility of a future prisoner swap. So that is a positive signal. But U.S. officials are headed back to the drawing board to try and be creative to get out this American who has been wrongfully detained in Russia for about four years now -- Bianna?",

The food was more than distasteful. And I don't want to judge the other prisoners, but there was certainly some comment about how agreeable they would be with her and how helpful or how possibly disagreeable they might be and that would make her stay very difficult. And how much you could trust the guards, if you will, to be protective of her, the living conditions, the water. It was more than -- it would have been more than grueling. We certainly understand. I'm a big supporter of POWs, MIAs and men and women in the United States military. And as she honored her father, knew the difference. But I will tell you, it was inhumane. It was cruel. And it would have been violent, if you will, just by her presence there and the inability to speak the language, and what would happen with the other prisoners, what would happen with the lack of protection with the guards.

This is fascinating, Josh. So why is Orange County doing this and what is the reaction? JOSH CAMPBELL, CNN SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yes, my friend, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we've seen many progressive jurisdictions taking on racism, particularly in the light of so many hate crimes we've seen against Asian-Americans. What is notable here, it is a Republican leading the co-sponsoring of this resolution in Orange County. His name is Andrew Do. I spoke to him about his own experience dealing with racism and what he is trying to accomplish with the resolution. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANDREW DO, (R), ORANGE COUNTY, CA, BOARD OF SUPERVISORS: My experience personally is I have faced racism in many forms. When I first came over, it was more extreme. Now, lately, it's more subtle. But I believe it is there. What we are trying to accomplish with our resolution is to promote understanding, to review our policy, to see if there's any aspect of it that might be a remanence of past prejudices that we did not realize that are there. And we will support diversity. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And, Bianna, I want to show you something that happened just this week, in the meeting where these supervisors were preparing to vote on this resolution declaring racism a public health crisis. There were many people in the audience who were against it, who were saying that this is overblown, it's unnecessary.

A mixed bag with this report. The good news is, as you can see on that chart, inflation is cooling off. This is the fifth straight month where wholesale prices on an annual basis have cooled off. This is the lowest reading for this figure in 18 months. I think the bad news is inflation remains way too high. This is hotter than expected. As far as the Fed goes, the thinking remains the same. The Fed is likely to raise interest rates at next week's meeting. But they're probably going to take it a step slower.
