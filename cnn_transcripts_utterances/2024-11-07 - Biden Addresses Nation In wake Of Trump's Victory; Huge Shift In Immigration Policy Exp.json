      "sentences": "Yeah, if you remember, previously Donald Trump had focused on the border wall. That was the cornerstone ofhis campaign. Now, over the last several months and years, it has been mass deportation and we're learning more details about what that could look like. Because over the last several weeks, there have been Trump allies, as well as some in the private sector who have been quietly preparing for the detaining and deporting of immigrants on a large scale. Now, the private sector here has evolved because the federal government does lean on contractors to manage these detention centers, and in some cases, to run them. There are only a few that are actually federally owned facilities. And in order for this type of plan to come to fruition, the incoming Trump administration would have to identify detention space and very likely have to build that up quite quickly because after arresting someone, they'd have to detain them to then eventually remove them. So all of this planning has been quietly happening behind the scenes and now it is expected to ramp up that we have -- now that we have the results of this election. Now, of course, in talking to officials, they tell me, it's going to come down to money. Do they have enough funds to pull off something as big as what they have projected over the last several weeks? That remains a big question. Because in the past, the Department of Homeland Security has reprogrammed funds. That means moving funds around from different agencies to try to get the monies that they need. But this kind of operation to do it at such a large scale would have to require far more than just moving money here and there within the department. So all of this will have to be sorted over time. And there are still questions as to how quickly they could pull off an operation like this, because in addition to detention, there's also the deportation aspect, which requires diplomacy with countries because they'd have to receive those people. But the other part of this, too, is the Department of Homeland Security, which is charged with immigration enforcement. They have been no strangers to whiplash on immigration policies. They went through it, most recently with the Trump administration to the Biden administration. And they're fully expecting that the policies that were put in place under President Joe Biden are going to be reversed under Donald Trump. So certainly, this has been something that they're grappling with within the department. Some telling me that they have been shell-shocked by the results, others telling me that they're optimistic about it. So they are preparing in their own ways for what's to come, knowing of course what Donald Trump has already said on the trail and what he wants to accomplish when he comes into office.",

People feel like they've been crushed for the last few years under inflation, and that was after they felt like they got crushed under COVID. And they got very unhappy with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' policies that they believed led them to these negative economic outcomes. So number one is just get us back to an economy where people feel less anxiety and they're not being crushed. Number two, I do think he's got to solve immigration. It's obviously a huge problem. Everybody recognize it's a crisis. Number three, I think the feeling that, you know, there's just too much chaos in the world and doing whatever you can do to try to tamp down the chaos. You don't always have control over all world events, but, you know, you've got war in Europe. I mean, there's -- you know, you've got North Korea with troops in Europe. I mean, it's -- we're not talking about it a lot, but it's kind of crazy when you think about it. We still have American hostages being held in the Middle East. I mean, there's a lot of hot spots and things out there from just a world chaos perspective that he could work on. I think if he focuses on those things, the American people are going to be quite happy. And I really, really hope that we don't have two or four years of Democrats trying to tie him up administratively in the courts or whatever. He deserves a chance to govern. I don't really think he got that chance four years ago, to be honest with you, in his first term, but I think he deserves it now. It's what the American people are asking for.",

And in it, you really expressed an indictment of what you described as the political information complex, especially the last few weeks, what you think that a large part of the media and some of the bigger cities were focused on here in New York and Washington, D.C., and that is damning words against Puerto Ricans and whether or not Kamala Harris should or shouldn't have distanced herself more from Joe Biden on the view.

      "sentences": "Well, my instinct is they had made up their mind long ago. I mean, if you look at the trajectory of Joe Biden's job approval, he wentunder 40 percent about August, September of 2021. And he never really came back up. And Kamala Harris was right there with him. Now, she experienced a bit of a spike in her popularity after she became the nominee of the party. But I think it was a mirage. I mean, it was a -- it was a mirage created largely by the media to try to prop up a candidacy against the backdrop of a very, very unhappy American electorate. They were unhappy with what they had gotten. And I think we just saw night after night after night coverage of the campaign, floating from one gimmick to the next, one outrage to the next. You know, we knew what we were getting with Trump. Trump is a known quantity. He had been the president. We've been having him dominate our political life, you know, for almost a decade now. But we didn't really know what we were going to get from Harris other than, well, she's already working for Joe Biden, which we don't like. And so I think that people, frankly, were trying to will into an existence, and will into existence the idea that she could somehow be totally divorced from the negative results that the country thought they were getting from the current administration. So I really think impressions of what the Democrat program had done to the country had set in very early. She was unable to separate herself from Biden, and the American people reacted to that. It's on Trump now to try to act on his promises. And I appreciate my friend Maria's comments about Democrats giving him the space and grace to try to execute on that. She did have a hard job. I fully acknowledge that. I do think it was ultimately a tactical mistake for her to never really have an answer to the question, what would you do differently? Do you regret any of the things you've done? I've said this to politicians for years. Like a little -- an ounce of humility would go a long way for you and your party and for your campaign.

The crazy part of this is the policies that he's talked about, the tariffs, the immigration potential restrictions, as you pointed out at the beginning of this, all inflationary.

So, obviously, we roll the sound there of Donald Trump repeating many times when he was running for office and actually during his presidency several years ago that NATO is obsolete, that member nations aren't paying their fair share. I do want to start by talking about Ukraine and what Donald Trump has said he's going to do this time around, if he wins, and, of course, he did. He said that he would end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, obviously. He didn't mention how. He also said that Zelenskyy should never have let the war start in the first place and dubbed Zelenskyy one of the greatest salesman he had ever seen who gets $100 billion on every visit to Congress. Of course, Zelenskyy is concerned about what a Trump administration is going to mean for the war going forward. What concerns you the most, Mr. Stoltenberg?",

Russia had annexed Crimea back in 2014. They had gone into Eastern Donbas in 2014. And there was a war going on, a much smaller, not a large-scale war we see today, but it was an ongoing war. And then it was under the Trump administration that the decision was taken to start to deliver lethal weapons, and in particular, the anti-tank weapons that were so critical at the beginning of the full-scale invasion back in 2022. But the main message is that we all want the war to end. But we know that the quickest way to end the war is to lose the war. And that will not bring peace. That will bring occupation. So if we want a solution where Ukraine prevails as a sovereign independent nation, then we need to strengthen their position on the battlefield so they can get a stronger position on the negotiating table, so there can be a lasting just solution to the war in Ukraine.",

It should be something that happens inside NATO. And the good news is that actually that is exactly what European allies have done over the last years. We made a commitment back in 2014 to increase defense spending to two percent of GDP across the alliance. At that time, only three allies spent two percent of GDP on defense. Now, this year, it's 24 allies spending two percent of GDP on defense. So this has really changed and it demonstrates that European allies are stepping up, but not outside NATO, not instead of the security cooperation with the United States, but as part of strengthening NATO.",

I don't think we can change Putin's mind. I believe that Putin still has the ambition of controlling the whole of Ukraine. He tried to take Kyiv in the beginning of the war. He wants to control the whole of Ukraine. But I do believe that we can change its calculus. That he realizes that the price he has to pay for that on the battlefield is so high that it needs to accept a solution where Ukraine continues to be an independent sovereign nation in Europe. And to make sure that the price is so high, we need to continue to support Ukraine with arms, with weapons, because that's the only way they can have a position around the negotiating table that enables them to get a solution which is acceptable. So what happens around the negotiating table is inextricably linked to the strength on the battlefield. So if you want a fair, negotiated, peaceful solution to this war, the way to achieve that is military support to Ukraine.",

Second, I think we need to realize that -- well, the situation on the battlefield is difficult, but President Putin has not achieved what he wanted when he started the war. When the war started, most experts and also Putin believed that he was able to take Kyiv within days and Ukraine within weeks. That didn't happen. What we have seen is that Ukrainians have liberated half of the territory that Russia controlled at the beginning of the war. And Putin wanted to ensure that those less NATO along his borders. He wanted NATO to guarantee no new NATO allies. He has got the opposite. More NATO military presence in eastern part of the alliance and two new members, Finland and Sweden, and Ukraine is closer to NATO membership than ever before. So Putin has not achieved what he wanted. Yes, there is a -- there is a hard situation, difficult situation along the frontlines, but the Ukrainians have proven commitment, courage, and with our support, actually, been able to liberate half of the territory that the Russia controlled at the beginning of the war.",

But look, this election outcome is going to most directly impact those two federal cases. Of course, there's the one that deals with his alleged efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, and then there's the other dealing with his handling of classified material. Donald Trump has said repeatedly that he would dismiss both these cases or have these cases dismissed if he was elected in 2024. He's also said that he would fire Jack Smith in two seconds. But we're learning that that might not be necessary. As you mentioned, Special Counsel Jack Smith, who oversees both those cases and the Justice Department, are engaged in talks about how to wind down both those cases before Inauguration Day. That would -- it remains unclear exactly how that process will play out, but it is clear that Jack Smith is trying to bring those cases to a close before Donald Trump takes the White House. And look, we -- the one question is, will Jack Smith put out a report of such that is part of the federal statute that oversees the special counsel? So we will have to see what that report says. And then there's the criminal case in Georgia that also deals with Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss there. That case has been on hold for several months now. Fulton County DA Fani Willis, who's the prosecutor overseeing that case, she is still at risk of being disqualified. That's something that would effectively end the Georgia criminal case against Donald Trump. And if she's allowed to remain on the case, whether or not she can continue to prosecute Donald Trump remains an open question, but sources have bespoken to say that state-level judge is unlikely to allow her to continue moving forward while Donald Trump is in the presidency. So that would mean at best the case would be on hold until at least 2029. And then there's the hush money case in New York that you mentioned. Donald Trump was scheduled to be sentenced for those 34 felony counts later this month, but Trump's legal team is doing everything it can to try to make sure that doesn't happen. We expect them to file some sort of a motion arguing that a president-elect cannot be sentenced, and so that legal issue will have to get sorted out as well. But at the end of the day, all of this really underscores how Trump's strategy of delay, delay, delay has largely been successful.",
