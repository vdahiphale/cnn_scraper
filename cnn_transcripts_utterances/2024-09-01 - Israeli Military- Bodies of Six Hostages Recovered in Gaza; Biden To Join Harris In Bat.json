Israeli military official said that they recovered the bodies from Hamas tunnel under the southern Gazan city of Rafah on Saturday. The IDF claims that they were killed a short while. They say before troops were able to reach them. A spokesman for the IDF describing the operation to CNN earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And certainly when you talk to American officials, they do say, at least on paper, and in principle, the sides are not all that far apart.I think what this does, according to American officials is called into question in some way, the seriousness of Hamas and towards reaching a deal. But what American officials also acknowledge is that that will create more pressure for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to try and come up with some kind of agreement. And certainly, you see that on the streets in Israel today. Now, President Biden and Vice President Harris have now both spoken to the parents of Hersh Goldberg-Polin. They talked to the parents today. They have gotten to know them fairly well over the last 11 months or so since their son out went into captivity. President Biden released a statement last night, he said, I am devastated and outraged. He goes on to say: I've worked tirelessly to bring their beloved Hersh safely to them and I'm heartbroken by the news of his death. It is tragic as it is reprehensible. Make no mistake, President Biden says, Hamas leaders will pay for these crimes and we will keep working around the clock for a deal to secure the release of the remaining hostages. President Biden last night after it had become clear that these hostages were found underneath Rafah, did say that there were -- there were still on the verge of an agreement. He's not writing off that this agreement will be struck, but certainly, I think it's clear that this will make it more difficult. I think for Vice President Harris, the calculations are also wrapped up in presidential bid. Of course, we saw the parents of Hersh Goldberg Polin speaking at the Democratic National Convention. It was one of the emotional sort of high points of that, of that event. You know, I was in the arena. You could hear a pin drop as they were speaking. She doesn't mention the hostage negotiations in her statement. She says that Hamas is an evil terrorist organization. With these murders, Hamas has even more American blood on its hands. She goes on to say the threat Hamas poses to the people of Israel and American citizens in Israel must be eliminated and Hamas cannot control Gaza. The Palestinian people, too, have suffered under Hamas's rule for nearly two decades. So making being very clear in that statement that any agreement that these sides come to cannot include any scenario that Hamas would come back to control Gaza. But certainly, you know, there's a lot of sadness I think in the White House and the administration writ large today, just given how closely they had been working with this family, how well they had gotten to know them and really how close they think they were to securing their release. Ultimately, that wasn't able to come to pass.",

They're crushed and they don't want to believe that this is an either/or. And as the prime minister and his team look at this, the rest of us, as we look at this, also, don't want this to be viewed as a choice between security or between bringing the hostages home, and that steps need to be taken to bring them home understanding, yes, this is Hamas's fault. This could all end the moment Hamas lays down its weapons. They're murderous, disgusting terrorists. But ultimately, this has to be -- we have to seize every opportunity to bring the hostages home. It cannot just be a hashtag that we use on social media, that it has to be real. That's what people are feeling in the streets today. It's what they're feeling literally, literally across the world.

And crucially, since Vice President Harris officially became the Democratic nominee. And notably this will also be the first time the two will be together in any battleground state, campaigning for this particular role. And where are you off to as you noted, arguably the most important battleground state for the Harris campaign, Pennsylvania. So, they're heading to Pittsburgh. Admittedly, we don't have a lot of details on exactly what they were doing when once they touched down in western Pennsylvania. But I'll note that President Biden has gone to western Pennsylvania a number of times, specifically on Labor Day, as recently as 2022, he was rallying local steel workers there. So I think we can expect to see something similar along those lines, Alex. And when you think about it, the Harris campaign clearly sees President Joe Biden as an incredible asset in a place like Pennsylvania where white working class voters are so important to winning that particular state. And they see value in having Scranton Joe back there on the stump for her. But we still shall see what Biden's larger role in the campaign ultimately evolves to be as we get closer to November. President Biden telling reporters, just yesterday that he plans to be on the road basically from tomorrow on stumping for Harris in some way. Meanwhile, we learned that this coming Tuesday, there's going to be another level of this campaign unfolding Harris campaign is going to be kicking off a bus tour starting in Palm Beach, Florida. It's going to feature a number of surrogates and its going to be primarily focused on reproductive rights. This tour expected to make at least 50 stops and not only do they hope to get out this message again with surrogates, with celebrities, the campaign is teasing, but they're also hoping that a bus tour like this will help energized supporters and volunteers on the ground.

He loves soccer, is wild about music and music festivals. And he has been obsessed with geography and travel since he was a little boy. On October 7, Hersh and his best friend, Aner, went to a music festival in the south of Israel. It was advertised as celebrating peace, love, and unity. They also went to celebrate Hersh's 23rd birthday. As rockets began to fall, Hersh, Aner, and 27 other young festivalgoers took refuge in a five-foot-by-eight-foot bomb shelter. Terrorists began to throw grenades into the shelter. Hersh's left forearm, his dominant arm was blown off before he was loaded onto a pickup truck and stolen from his life and me and Jon into Gaza.

It's unclear at this point in time whether the Russians this time used missiles or once again, use those aerial glide bombs dropped by their fighter jets. That, of course, can fly pretty far and then hit targets, including Kharkiv, at which we do have to remind our viewers is actually really close to the Russian border.So Kharkiv is a town that actually does get hit quite frequently and we've seen in the past couple of days the attacks against specifically the Kharkiv the area really intensified by the Russians on Friday, seven people were killed when the Russians dropped some really heavy munitions on the city of Kharkiv. In fact, there was one bomb that was so heavy that having some 20 apartments in just one go. And then yesterday, there was another massive attack on the area of Kharkiv, where in one place two people were killed and the Russians there dropped a bomb that had half a ton of explosives in it. So that area definitely suffering a lot. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy obviously irate about this situation. He went on X earlier and he said, quote, give Ukraine what it needs to defend itself. Of course, the Ukrainians have been lobbying the U.S. to lift some of the restrictions on some of the weapons but the U.S. has given them and allow the Ukrainians to strike deep into Russian territory, for instance, with those ATACMS surface to surface missiles. That has not happened so far. We do see in general, in that area in northeast Ukraine, in the Kharkiv area, in the Sumy area, a lot of those Russian longer distance strikes really intensifying, hitting civilian infrastructure, but also critical infrastructure in the Kharkiv area.
