And it is done in a very definitive way. One hour from now, the war cabinet will meet to discuss the issue of freeing the hostages. Shortly thereafter, the security cabinet will clarify the distinction. The war cabinet is a very small group. The security cabinet is a broader group of ministers. And then the full cabinet, that would be the process needed to approve or release an exchange of Palestinian prisoners. That is all set to happen from 6:00 pm, one hour from now, to 7:00 to 8:00 pm. Then there is a 24-hour period when anyone to appeal to stop this process. But as you can see, the process is moving forward. It is about to begin with the war cabinet meeting. We have learned from multiple officials from the groups involved in this negotiations, the U.S., the Qataris the Israelis, Hamas even stating openly that a deal is perhaps very much imminent. Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier today, he hopes there will be good news soon on this. In terms of the broader outlook, it would involve 50 hostages, women and children, being freed in exchange for a four- or five- day pause in the fighting. If that works out, in addition to that, I should say, there will be 150 Palestinian women and children held and Israeli prisoners released. You can see the 3:1 ratio, three Palestinian prisoners for every one Israeli prisoner. If that works out, then perhaps a larger group released, another 50 hostages held in Gaza released. Hamas says they need more time to round up hostages they do not hold so they can bring those together. In terms of who exactly is released, that part is much less clear right now. Whether it is full families, different groups, different nationalities, for example, we know there are Nepali and Thai citizens held, that has yet to come into focus. But any progress is critical and, we expect after the votes, we will hear from Benjamin Netanyahu in some fashion as to where this all stands and if a deal is moving forward and what the timeline looks like from here.",

They are not soldiers that were taken hostage. That includes both men and women. So that gives you an idea that we are very likely looking at the young and the elderly.

Udi Goren was part a group that met with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday. He was quoted, \"What we've heard is that taking down Hamas and bringing the hostages home are equally important. This is incredibly disappointing because we know that taking down Hamas, we keep hearing from them that it is going to take months or years and it is going to take a long time.\" Udi Goren joins us now from Israel. Good to have you on the show. We will talk about your frustration here, I think in your words. I want to get your take on what we are hearing today. We have heard optimism in the past. But the potential for some type of deal, to release at least 50 hostages today, your response? UDI GOREN, HAMAS HOSTAGE'S COUSIN: I think if that comes through, it will be an unbelievable ray of sunshine after 45 days of miserable darkness. There are 50 or 60 or 70, we do not know, families, who are going to get their lives back. And, you know, it cannot be described in words. These people, they do not eat, sleep, they do not really live for the past 45 days, they can go back to existence. It does not really matter if my relative is there or not -- I mean, of course, it matters but in the overall efforts, even if my relative is not back this time around, it promotes the possibility of them coming back.

We are a sovereign democracy, a Western democracy that values human lives. And we have to show, we have to prove that this is not only what we say we believe in but this is how we act. This is a principle, this is a matter of our core values as a country. So absolutely, yes, Israel must do anything. If that involves a cease-fire, of course, yes. This war with Hamas or in general, this situation and the long-term effects of how Israel and Gaza, Gazan civilians, Hamas, whoever controls this part of the land, can coexist. And we would have to coexist because nobody is going anywhere. This is something that needs to be thought through long-term. This will take time. Bringing back the hostages alive cannot take that time. We don't have it. People are chronically ill and some of them are wounded. Some of them are elderly, not to mention the children, who are very vulnerable. So we do not have that time, that luxury of waiting. Bringing them back must be the top priority at any cost; of course, at a cost that does not risk Israel proper. Sadly, I do not have this information, what does or does not risk Israel.

And if there is an agreement there, then announcement can be made, as far as we can tell. So if that happens, you will see, as I said, for the first time, a real diplomatic breakthrough for the first time since October 7th. We have seen the release of four hostages to date, two groups of two; an American and her daughter and then two elderly Israeli women. We understand this next deal will include women and children and foreigners. That will be in exchange for Palestinian women and teenagers being held in Israeli prisons. And multiple sources have told CNN that the exchange will be on a 3:1 basis. For every hostage that is released from Gaza, there will be three Palestinians released from Israeli jails. The release period, after the announcement, we understand, will be during a four-day pause or truce in the fighting. As we understand it, that means that the Israelis would cease their ground operations and what they are doing in the air for periods of time; particularly, flying surveillance drones. As far as multiple sources have told us, this has been a real issue of contention. Hamas wanted to see those drones grounded. And the Israelis, not agreeing to that but saying it would be up to six hours per day, over the next four-day period that those surveillance drones are taken out of the air. Why? Hamas, as we understand, needs to get around or needs to be able to get the IDs of all hostages, the names and the IDs of all hostages being held by other groups and indeed by other individuals in Gaza. Remember, when that border was broken, back on October 7th, it was not just Hamas who rushed it. There were other people involved with other groups in Gaza and just individuals, who were swept up in what was this atrocious massacre, they swept up individuals and took them back to Gaza. This is a start. Israel has said for weeks now, that there will be no cease-fire, there will be no end to hostilities until all hostages are released. Hamas has said no release of all hostages until there is a cease- fire. We are not at that point, let us be absolutely clear about that. The point that we are at is the release of some of the civilian hostages at this point. There appears to be no agreement at present as to the release of soldiers being held in Gaza or individuals of sort of serving age. That is an important distinction to make. But in all of this, a big diplomatic breakthrough if it happens, a breakthrough for the families of some 50 hostages -- women, children and some foreigners, who have been going through absolute torture with their family members being held, as you have heard, in Gaza. It is the beginning, negotiators hope, of a period of pauses in which others will be released. Again, no deal is a done deal until it is announced. Qatar hoping, according to diplomatic sources, that the deal will be announced in the coming hours, i.e. today, tonight Doha time.",

Thousands of patients unable to receive care because of the deteriorating humanitarian situation. There are continued calls for civilians to move southward. But the situation is dire and it is deteriorating and we are seeing airstrikes. And there is a huge amount of concern regarding the potential for an epidemic. We need to remind our viewers, the U.N. is saying some 1.7 million in Gaza displaced. And as the weather begins to worsen, there are real fears that without these humanitarian pauses, long enough for essential aid to get into the Gaza Strip, more and more people are going to die as a result of the deteriorating situation. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (voice-over): Darkness and destruction inside northern Gaza's Indonesian hospital. Twelve killed here overnight including patients and a member of medical staff when Israeli tank fire hit the hospital, according to health authorities in the Hamas-run strip. The Israeli military says they were responding to gunfire from inside, targeting their troops. But the civilian toll has been condemned by the U.N.'s World Health Organization chief, describing the attack as appalling. For civilians in central Gaza, Monday morning brought with it more devastation. Local residents say this building was struck overnight, blaming Israel's ongoing aerial bombardment of the region. Locals here say more than a dozen were killed, now buried beneath the rubble. CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment and allegations of an overnight airstrike on the neighborhood. Amid the rubble, bodies are pulled out one by one carefully wrapped in blankets. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): The building collapsed on top of 30 people. Many were killed and there are still people buried under the rubble right now. BASHIR (voice-over): The Israeli military says it is targeting Hamas but with each passing day, more civilians are killed. Among the victims on Monday, a young girl, carried away by a neighbor, killed alongside her father, a doctor at the nearby Al Aqsa Martyrs' Hospital. This is not a war anymore. This is genocide, he says. This scene now all too familiar, even for the young. Many here are from northern Gaza, taking shelter in this embattled town, hoping to move southwards. The U.N. says hundreds of thousands have already fled northern Gaza. Many seen here over the weekend waving makeshift white flags, the injured chaining behind. It is a long and difficult journey. Many are exhausted and distraught. MOHAMED AL-SHAHID, DISPLACED JABALYA RESIDENT: We will die if we stay. One minute we will die. Many rockets fall on our heads. BASHIR (voice-over): Mohamed says his daughter was injured following an airstrike on a school they were sheltering in the northern city of Jabalia. Now they are hoping they will find some semblance of peace in the south. But even here, in the very place Israel is telling civilians to evacuate to, there is no escape. And as the weather begins to turn, the situation is growing more dire with each passing day. This family from Jabalia now sheltering in the southern city of Khan Younis, making do with what little they have left. RANDA HAMUD, DISPLACED JABALYA RESIDENT (through translator): Yesterday was very difficult. Our tents flew away, the rain came down on us, we were drenched. We just want an end to the war. BASHIR (voice-over): But as the war threatens to intensify in southern Gaza and calls for a humanitarian ceasefire continue to go unheeded, there is little hope remaining for the people of Gaza.

And that deal could be reached as early as today. Part of the deal, what we would see happen, it would be 50 hostages, women and children, released in exchange for four to five days' pause in fighting. In addition, 150 Palestinian prisoners would be released by Israel. And there would be a cease in the flying of Israeli surveillance drones for at least six hours per day. The hostages, the 50 that we are talking about right now, are of various nationalities, we are told. U.S. officials are hoping that one of those hostages released will be 3- year-old Abigail Idan (ph). This, of course, is the 3-year-old American toddler, the youngest American hostage known. Her parents were killed by Hamas. And there is a little bit of hope, after President Biden himself talked about this toddler, that she may again be part of the initial 50 released. Beyond those initial 50, we are told Hamas would use the time during the pause to gather up additional hostages. If they are successful, the pause could be extended for additional days. Of course, we have been reporting over the last few weeks Hamas' demand for additional aid coming into Gaza. That has focused on fuel. Everyone knows it is so critical to Hamas' military operations, like ventilating underground tunnels. So that has been a very contentious part of the negotiations. We do not know where things will end up on that point. But U.S. officials have been  clear that they, too, are pushing for as much humanitarian aid to get into Gaza as possible. Again, what we expect is that a deal could be announced as early as today. But it is worth emphasizing, over and over, as we talk about the possibility of the deal, just a caveat, at any moment, the deal could fall through.

A few of them, very low birth weight;  other injuries as well like an eye injury. It is very disturbing to read about this, because you get the sense of the vulnerability of these patients and they were suffering as they were awaiting the help that they need. And in terms of who these children are and where their parents are, we know that only four mothers came across the border yesterday with the 28 babies. What we are hearing from the Egyptian side is that they do not know anything about their parents right now. They do not know if they are alive. They do not know about the whereabouts even of extended family. But they are fearing the worst. Some of these babies were found under rubble. Frankly, there are so many stories attached to this. For the Egyptians, the priority is to stabilize these babies. We saw some of the images after they were taken to the border, taken into Egyptian hospitals, we have seen some of the interventions from the Egyptian side. And frankly, they could have been receiving this assistance for over a week now. Last week, when we spoke to the Egyptian health minister, he was expecting 36 neonatal babies. They were standing at the border with ambulances and ventilators and other equipment. And many doctors were ready to assist. But the evacuation out of Al-Shifa was far too dangerous. The IDF raid last week made it far too dangerous to create that corridor. There was also a lack of communication with Al-Shifa, after a blackout in coms. So no one was communicating from the hospital. We saw the images of how the babies were shifted from the neonatal ward in Al-Shifa, taken by hand and laid on beds without ventilators. And you got a sense of just how dangerous that was. The U.N. stepping in, helping to evacuate those babies to Rafah. They were in too much of a critical condition to be moved on Sunday. Once they were stabilized, we saw them being moved across the border. It was a race against time; that was really pointed out by the Egyptians. Every single moment that these babies weren't in proper incubators, it was a risk. That's why some of the babies did not make it through. Egypt now feels very confident, if they can get them stabilized, the next point would be to try to find the parents of these babies. There is just very little information.
