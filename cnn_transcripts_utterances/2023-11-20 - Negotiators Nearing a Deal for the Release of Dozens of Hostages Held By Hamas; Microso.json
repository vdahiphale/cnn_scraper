And his sudden ouster shocked Silicon Valley. Now the founder of OpenAI Sam Altman has a new job.And the world says good-bye to humanitarian mental health activist and \"Steel Magnolias\", the former first lady Rosalynn Carter. Good morning to our viewers in the United States and around the world, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's Monday, November 20th, 5:00 a.m. here in Washington, 12:00 noon in Gaza where the Israel Defense Forces have released surveillance video that they say shows a remote operated camera being lowered into the tunnels that Israel claims are a Hamas command center beneath the hospital. The IDF also released video that it says shows Hamas fighters bringing two hostages into Al Shifa Hospital on October 7th. One man is forcibly marched through the main entrance, another wheeled bleeding down a hallway into a room. These are handout videos, CNN cannot independently verify these IDF claims. CNN has learned a deal for the release of some hostages may be just days away. Sources familiar with the negotiations say a recent draft proposes a four to five-day pause in the fighting for the initial release of 50 hostages. Deputy National Security adviser Jon Finer didn't get into the details with Jake Tapper, but he did have this to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Speaking to some of the doctors inside the Emirati Hospital which there are now in -- still in Gaza, but in the southern part of Gaza.They say that the condition right now is difficult, but it's stable, and they could deteriorate, given the fact that they might run out of electricity because of the fuel situation. So while they've evaded some of the biggest risks at Al Shifa Hospital where they've essentially been trapped, now, they're in the southern part of Gaza where medical supplies and also fuel is running short. We know and you've spoken about Al Shifa Hospital. We know there was an IDF raid there over the past week. The Egyptian authorities have been waiting for 36 neonatal babies for over a week now. They would -- sounding the alarm bells, they were saying that every minute is absolutely critical. We know that number has now changed, Kasie, we know that it's now gone to 31 babies. Some of them have tragically died. We don't know if they're going to be accompanied by parents. W.H.O. says only some of them have living relatives. We're still waiting to hear news of that. But what we do know is the Egyptian Health Ministry is currently at the border crossing. We know there are ambulances with ventilators as well as incubators ready for them. They've been waiting on high alert for the whole week, and now we're seeing that they're closer to moving into Egypt where they will receive the care that they need. We know the conditions in Al Shifa has been absolutely catastrophic. And so many more patients are stuck inside. Evacuation efforts are currently under way to get more people out, but all lies on what we're seeing with these babies. We've seen images currently from the Emirati Hospital, it is really harrowing and difficult to look at. You hear the babies crying and they need intervention right now. The Egyptians are hoping to offer that.",

Of course, one other possibility, you know is that they could be behind that blast door which I don't think is likely. But you never know in a case like this. You know, as far as the fact that they came into this hospital, if everything checks out in terms of the accuracy of this video and the Israeli assertion that according -- you know, to the IDF.That tells you that, you know, clearly, Hamas has some kind of activity at the Al Shifa Hospital. Normally, hostage takers will bring their hostages to a place that is safe for them. And it could also be a major node for them, either a headquarters-type element or some other installation that they feel that they have control over, and that's why this is particularly noteworthy.",

Ukraine has felt very neglected and overshadowed by what's been taking place in the Middle East. So Lloyd Austin arriving here in Kyiv in this surprise visit is really a shot in the arm.A show of confidence and support in the timing, you know, is crucial. This comes at an incredibly difficult time in the war here. You mentioned that counteroffensive which, quite frankly, has been dismal. They have not been able to produce the results that they had hoped for, you know, those breakthroughs that the West wanted Ukraine to make. But this is now a war of attrition on the eastern front and the southern front. That operation that you mentioned in Kherson, the Dnipro River where Ukrainian Marines have managed to cross the river and create a foothold on the left bank. I mean, this is no doubt significant. But they are coming under heavy Russian bombardment. We spoke to a Marine on an operation there last night, and during the interview, you could hear the explosions taking place around him. He says he has not heard silence there for more than an hour. It is constant bombardment. So, this is heavy fighting taking place in the south and the east, and Lloyd Austin coming here, as I say, a show of support that America has Ukraine's back.",

The support that America has given Israel is more controversial outside America. Because there is support, obviously, for Palestinians, particularly in the Arab world. But there's a lot of support here in Europe as well.We've seen those protests and demonstrations here. So I don't think outside America, the two wars are seen as comparables, certainly, defending freedom is very much part of the debate when supporting Ukraine. But there are two freedoms in the Middle East, which some groups here keep pointing to and there's not always a balance there in their view.",
