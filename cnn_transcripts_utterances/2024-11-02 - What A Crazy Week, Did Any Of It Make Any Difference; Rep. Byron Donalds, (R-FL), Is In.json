      "sentences": "Three days left, it's no time to be shy. I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.This election could come down to the thinnest of margins. Data points and opinions don't show a clear winner. Nationally, CNN's poll of suggests Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are running near even in the race for the White House. Harris a slight edge at 48 percent to Trump's 47 percent. Then you've got the CNN poll of polls in the battleground states, it's all margin of error territory hinting at a tight race that could go either way. In three runs for the presidency, Trump has never been in this strong of a position according to the polls, even though you wouldn't say that he's leading. In 2016, the polls were predicting a Hillary victory, FiveThirtyEight had her up by three nationally, on this day, November 2, 2016, 45 to Trump's 42. At this point in 2020 FiveThirtyEight had Biden up by almost eight and a half, 51.8 to Trump's 43.4. Once the final numbers came in, Hillary Clinton did win the popular vote by 2 percent but lost the election. And Biden did beat Trump in the popular vote, yes, but it wasn't by eight and a half nationally, it was by four and a half. It's enough to raise this question, are Trump's numbers under reported yet again? If they are, he wins. Or have pollsters adjusted, accounting for the so called hidden Trump voters? And what about shy Harris voters? Could they tip the ballots? Justin Brown, writing in Politico, said \"It's taken pollsters eight years to pin down Trump's voters. Is 100 days really enough to accurately capture potential Harris voters? These voters are not necessarily shy with their support for Kamala Harris, instead, the question is whether they're being overlooked by current polling methods.\" Polling data expert Nate Silver slammed election forecasts showing a close race, accusing many pollsters of herding to ensure their predictions aren't too far off from other predictions.

And the question is how do you close the race? And in the main, I think that Harris has been more disciplined in her closing.I've said many times, Michael, that the Trump campaign itself, its advertising and general blocking and tackling has been very professional and very well-conceived. Their problem is their candidate who takes them off message in his two hour standups. And so they never can punch through with the message they have. We're with Byron Donalds, he's a talk, a talking point machine. He never -- you can't blast him off his talking points with a bulldozer. That candidate needed a little more of that this week because I think between the rally on Sunday and some of his other comments certainly the Liz Cheney comment, he is taking the campaign off of the message they want to deliver. SMERCONISH: Byron Donalds respond to that. REP. BYRON DONALDS (R-FL): I mean first, I don't know to be happy or upset by what David said. Try to stay away from talking points. I just speak the facts as I see them. Look, I think at the end of this race, all of the stuff that's been dusted up over the last week is really not going to matter much. I think the core issues in the country remain the same. This has been an economy that where working families have struggled because of high inflation. The year over year number might be down but the cumulative effect over the last four years has been disastrous for them. Immigration still a real issue all throughout the United States and voters en masse do want the border secured and they want some level of deportations to occur. But if you talk about the last week in terms of the comments that have been made, I think what people are also starting to see is some of the gross mischaracterizations and in some respects the equivalency, depending if you're talking about President Trump versus President Biden or a comic versus Mark Cuban. There's this relativism in terms of how to equate those comments to me just doesn't really measure up. You can't compare my comment --",

When Donald Trump was president, he didn't turn the Department of Justice on his political rivals. He did not do that. And if you're going to talk about the comment about whether the National Guard is deployed, remember the question and the context it was, if there is unrest in the country post-election and post inauguration, if Donald Trump is to be victorious, would he use the National Guard to protect citizens? His answer was, yes, he would.

Well, first of all, it's -- if Trump as president didn't use the Justice Department to go after his opponents, it wasn't for lack of trying, it was because there were people in the Justice Department and in his own counsel's office who intervened and prevented that. But it certainly was his impulse to do that. And he said throughout this campaign that he wants to do that. But just getting back to the campaign itself, you know, I said that Harris has been disciplined, Trump has not been disciplined.The Harris message really is I am focused on the problems of people. Here are my ideas to help people, you know, who are looking for affordable housing, who want to start a small business, who are worried about caring for an elderly parent. There are things we can do to help. And he's so busy with his enemies list and his vengeance that, well, he'll never get around to the problems of people because at the end of the day, Donald Trump is about Donald Trump. And the way he's behaving this week reinforces her message, which is why I think it's more than noise, Michael. I think it actually has strengthened her closing argument.",

And that's what voters are concerned about more than anything else. They are comparing the last two presidential administrations and it's without a doubt Donald Trump had the more successful presidency for the American people.And if you're going to talk about the Constitution, it was the Biden- Harris administration that spied on the American people during COVID- 19 and suppressed the free speech of the American people using the weight of the White House to do so.

They couldn't get the votes in the legislature to do it before the election. And it's likely that she will win that seat in Omaha. If she does, the question is, will there be an attempt after that to change the rules before the electors vote on December 14th? I wouldn't put that out of the question. I don't think -- I think Trump's going to do everything possible to win this race. He's got more at stake than just the presidency. He's facing all of these legal problems.

This is nothing new. The truth is she's doing better among white voters generally because of the votes of college educated voters. But I just want to say one thing about what Byron said. The question is not whether people believe the rhetoric about Donald Trump, it's whether they believe Donald Trump's rhetoric. Because James is right, I mean, throughout this campaign, he has talked about punishing his enemies. He's talked about, you know, his political enemies as the enemy within.

And is this what he's going to be spending his time on when he's president and what does that portend for the country? I think that's one of the things that's holding him back in this election.

She likes to say from the Situation Room to the Oval Office, I was one of the trusted voices on policy.And she has simultaneously held the position that she was a key player in the administration, which I absolutely think she was. I have data that shows she has been the most active vice president ever, by some measures. And that when she is asked about the Biden administration's controversial policies, he is not on the ticket, that doesn't matter, don't ask about that, I'm on the ticket. Well, yes, you are the candidate and it is fair to ask you about those issues. And her answers have been really inconsistent. Including Biden's fitness.",

That's quintessentially anti-democratic. It's quintessentially anti-American.But Harris on the same issue of democracy, which she has urged voters to evaluate the candidates by, has defended essentially what might be a shadow government in the Biden administration. She can't say with a straight face that he is fit for office, because he was removed from the top of the ticket, which is an extraordinary event, and replaced in three months before the election. Americans saw it with their own eyes, that debate back in June. And that's why he is no longer the candidate. I also think on the policies she has defended and shown an openness to expanding the Supreme Court. That's exactly what Hugo Chavez did to seize power in Venezuela. It's anti-democratic. She has shown her willingness to censor unpopular (INAUDIBLE) voices on social media. That's anti-democratic too.
