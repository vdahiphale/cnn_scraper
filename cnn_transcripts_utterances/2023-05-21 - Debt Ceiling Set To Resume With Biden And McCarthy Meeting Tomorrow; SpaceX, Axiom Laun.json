One thing, as Mel noted, they're hoping to freeze defense and nondefense discretionary spending at current fiscal year 2023 levels. That is something that Republicans have called insufficient. They have also pushed for raising revenues in order to lower the deficit. Something that also does not sit well with Republicans, though President Biden did say earlier that he does not believe tax revenue is off the table. There are a host of other issues that the White House is eyeing at this moment. But let's also remember that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen earlier today once again stated that she does believe the U.S. could default on its debts as early as June 1st. That is just 11 days away.

Once there, they're going to get to work. They've got a very busy schedule. They're scheduled to essentially perform well over a dozen experiments, taking a look at a number of things including the effects that microgravity has on the production of stem cells.

As you said, a local nonprofit is being accused of luring homeless men, offering to pay them money so that they would pose as homeless veterans and claim that they had been pushed out of a hotel in a suburb outside of New York City in order to make room for migrants.This turns out to have been a complete scam. In the middle of all of it, two very vulnerable groups of people, migrants and homeless people. The attorney general of the state of New York Letitia James has said that she is looking into the matter to see if there is any possible legal action that they might be able to take against the leader of this nonprofit group that allegedly was behind this scam. But, going back to what the mayor -- the Mayor Eric Adams was talking about there at the top asking for the Republican Party and the Democratic Party to get its act together and do something about immigration reform. That is certainly a tall order. We haven't seen significant immigration reform in this country in several decades. And in the meantime migrants are continuing to arrive here in the city of New York. In fact, just a couple of minutes ago, while we were getting setup, you could see that city bus directly behind me there in front of the Roosevelt Hotel. There were a couple of dozen migrants that got out and arrived here. They are being bused from Port Authority bus terminal, that's where a lot of them are continuing to arrive. The city says they have 42,000 people in the care of the city right now. And more than 70,000 people have come through the city in the last year. Now one thing that we are asking questions about, we have yet to get some clarity from city officials is why migrant arrivals continue to increase here in New York City despite encounters at the border being down significantly since the expiration of Title 42 on May 11th. So we are trying to connect the dots there because the city says migrants continue to arrive, they are strapped for resources, strapped for shelter, asking for federal intervention. And also asking their neighbors outside of their city to share the, quote-unquote, \"burden\" according to the mayor. So as long as they continue to report these very high number of arrivals, the city will definitely have to continue to ask for help because shelter capacity is really at its end and the city says they have no place to put people if they continue to arrive -- Jim.",

Tea Party Republicans were ready to send the country into default if Obama didn't concede.So it was a normalization of a tactic that had not been used as a normal tactic in partisan warfare. Obama in the end agrees to spending cuts in 2011 and many people think that is when the GOP on this issue really crossed a threshold and today it's playing out again where I think many of the younger Republicans think this is something you can do.
