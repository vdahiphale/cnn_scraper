There is new CNN polling of likely voters in two key Senate races in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Wisconsin showing no clear leader in the showdown between incumbent Republican Ron Johnson and Democrat Mandela Barnes. Pennsylvania with Democratic Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman very narrowly ahead of Dr. Mehmet Oz just outside the margin of error. To underscore the importance of this day, we learned late today that former President Obama will be campaigning there along with President Biden on the final weekend before Election Day. A party official familiar with the planning, telling CNN they've got appearances scheduled for Pittsburgh and Philadelphia with the possibility of adding more. Early voting is underway there and in 38 others States. So far, turnout has been heavy, on pace for the record 2018 Midterms, with nearly 7.3 million ballots already cast. With it, we've already seen multiple reports of voter intimidation, including two armed men dressed in tactical gear spotted at a ballot drop box in Mesa, Arizona Friday night. Attorney General Merrick Garland was asked about at this afternoon. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She confronted them and as she put it, \"I take care of business.\"As to the bigger threat picture, we learned today that the FBI and Sheriffs representing some of America's biggest counties have already discussed the possibility of misinformation fueling violence at polling stations during the Midterms. Late today Samantha Vinograd, the former CNN contributor who is currently the Department of Homeland Security's top counterterrorism official, described the threat environment ahead of Election Day as \"incredibly heightened.\" That's where we begin tonight. We'll begin with the Pennsylvania Senate race and tomorrow's debate, which we will have real-time closed captioning on the debate stage, that's to accommodate Democrat John Fetterman's difficulty right now filtering and interpreting sound since a stroke back in May. It's a condition according doctors that doesn't affect the Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor's intelligence or thinking and this weekend, his Republican opponent sought to downplay the health angle. He has however made an issue at other points during what has already been a bruising campaign from both candidates. Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar has been helping Lieutenant Governor Fetterman get ready for tomorrow's debate. She joins us now. Senator Klobuchar, it's good to see you. I want to ask you about your experience with Lieutenant Governor Fetterman in a moment. But first, I just want to start with new CNN polls that show Democrats more or less holding their ground in three key States obviously still very close. There has been recent polling that suggests momentum and is moving toward Republicans. Does your party need to make any course corrections over the next two weeks? SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): I think actually the CNN polls are positive here, and I've seen a number of other ones like this. Tammy Baldwin told me in Wisconsin exactly what that poll shows. It's tied there and this is about voter turnout. I've lost my voice because I've gone to so many voter turnout events. This is about getting people to realize what's on the line here. Democracy is on the line. The future is on the line. We've got candidate who will take on Pharma. We've got candidates that are willing to take on price gouging, and actually stand up for people. And I love our candidates and one of those candidates, of course, is John Fetterman in Pennsylvania, who has the, first of all, the one attribute, he actually lives in the State. We like that, unlike his opponent, who appears to have spent a lot of time in New Jersey. And Pennsylvanians love John Fetterman. They know him as Lieutenant Governor. They know him as Mayor of Braddock, and they know he is someone that has their backs.",

So that was his position then. I'm not surprised it hasn't changed. But I think what the voters out there have to understand is what those guys didn't accomplish with bear spray, and batons, and bayonets back on January 6th, they're now trying to do with voter suppression laws, and what you just pointed out at the beginning of your program, if people show up in gear at voting places to scare people, that's what's happening. So if anything, as we saw in Georgia in that last election in the run up, it makes voters mad. They want to turn out and say, You know what, this is our democracy and you're not going to take it away from us, whether you're Independents, Democrats, moderate Republicans, and I think that is a factor for a lot of voters. Donald Trump's shadow, as you could see from Ted Cruz's answers, is still looming above this election. So, that's why I'm all in with Fetterman and Catherine Cortez Masto, Mandela Barnes, all of our candidates, Judge Beasley and Val Demings and Tim Ryan, who I was just with a few days ago in Ohio, against all odds is in a tie in Ohio, and I think can win that race.",

He has remained committed to his Oath to the Constitution, to defend it. Senator Lee has done the opposite. He is one of the least productive members of the Senate in 12 years of service. He has only passed 10 bills, a good number of them were naming Federal buildings. He refuses to work with members of his own party, let alone Democrats to get things done, and he has betrayed his Oath to the Constitution. And when he tried to help President Trump remain in office, despite the will of the people, it is something that had they been successful, I think would have ended or led to the end of the American Republic.
