Second, figuring out timing is difficult since the negotiations require the approval of the military arm of Hamas. And of course, they're deep in the tunnels and the communications with them have been very indirect. So that's been, you know, part of the delay.Third, it's a little bit hard to imagine a situation in which you get the first 40 hostages out that will be roughly half of what we believe the number of Israelis who are now elder Israelis and Americans and some others. And then after a ceasefire 40 days or so you go through for a second round and then that time the build up is supposed to happen. And there's a lot that can go wrong there. You could have either side declare that they haven't been fully transparent or executed on the releases. You could have complaints that the aid isn't coming in fast enough that the rebuilding isn't going on quickly enough. But I think there's a lot of pressure on President Biden now as he enters his uncontested primaries and heads to the State of the Union to show that there is some progress and some pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu.",

How is that playing into these negotiations? SANGERAnd that's why the last ceasefire fell apart. And you will remember when that happened, there was a big release of hostages.

The Israeli said they were incapable of that. And now with the leadership, having submitted resignations here, they don't appear to be in any position to go do so. Of course, the Israelis have always rejected that claim. And Prime Minister Netanyahu's plan would have Israel basically running the security, not the governance but the security of the strip for an almost indefinite period of time.And that would be the much harder negotiation now about how you would move from essentially ceasefire to something that would be somewhat permanent.

And it really kind of galvanized farmers in Germany to come out onto the streets, going through Berlin and the Brandenburg gates. And then this really kind of created a demonstration effect across the region. As we saw protests, as you noted, from France, to Spain, to Poland, to the Czech Republic. They have a lot of grievances that we can go into but one that they really noticed is that their own returns on investment have really shifted over the last year. They've seen a nine percent decline on average in terms of the returns that they're getting on their production. And so, they're feeling that some of these reductions in subsidies and other measures are really hitting them hard.",

So as Greece in both countries, they've talked about phasing these out over a number of years, but having a more gradual process.And France as well, there's been talk about a huge type of subsidy package, particularly for livestock farmers who've been really affected by a series of veterinary diseases in the last few years. And a discussion about how to reform the E.U. policies so that they are not so burdensome on farmers. There has been a backtracking on some other E.U. level policies, such as a reduction on pesticide use and the new kind of climate goals that have been put in place towards 2040. Talk about a lot of reductions and emissions, particularly from nitrogen that comes from fertilizer or livestock. But they're not necessarily placing the burden on agriculture. They're saying they want to reduce these emissions, but they're not necessarily saying where or what sector they're hoping that these reductions will come from. So, we're seeing -- we're seeing a real, a real backtracking on some of these green climate goals which. you know, obviously raise important political economy questions about how you get a green transition when you have such a powerful constituency pushing back against these goals.",

U.S. President Joe Biden says he is hopeful there will be a ceasefire by Monday that could allow for the release of more hostages. Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres is warning that an Israeli invasion of Rafah would put the final nail in the coffin of aid operations in Gaza. Food, water, and medicine already are scarce, and now residents are fighting over what little aid there is. CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Today, Gaza's humanitarian crisis looks like this. Palestinians desperate for food, paddling and swimming out to sea, after at least one plane airdropping aid appear to miss its target, sending pallets of food crashing into the sea. In central and southern Gaza, hundreds crowding the beaches to try and secure their piece of the rations. But this is the other side of desperation, groups of men wielding whips and bats, steering crowds away from their precious cargo. Months of hunger and war triggering fights for survival when there is not enough for everyone. This is what they are fighting over, ration packs, a lifeline for the lucky few. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I was lucky and able to get one of these aids. But what about all those other people who were not able to get this aid? Look, this one didn't get any and this one didn't get any. DIAMOND (voice-over): But so much more is needed. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I'm asking from the Arab nations. We are thankful for the aid through the parachutes, but we need more and we need it distributed in a better way. This will not stop our hunger. We don't need a capsule because when we eat this, we will eat it, and that's it. It's finished. DIAMOND (voice-over): But nowhere are people more desperate for food aid than in northern Gaza, where women and children wait in long lines for what now passes for food, a cloudy soup mixture made with dirty water and whatever greens can be found. AMAL MOHAMMAD NASEER, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): There is no food or drinking water, no flour, anything. There was no cooking oil, not even drinking water. Death is better than this. DIAMOND (voice-over): Humanitarian aid deliveries this month dropped by half compared to January, according to a United Nations relief agency which blamed Israeli military operations and the collapse of civil order in Gaza. In northern Gaza, aid groups suspending aid delivery amid looting and attacks on aid trucks, leaving many with few options to stay alive. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): Look, we are eating animal feed against our will, but have to eat it. DIAMOND (voice-over): Without food or clean water, their voices are all they have left. AHMED ATEF SAFI, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): The suffering of Gaza is extremely difficult. Where are the authorities? Where is the government? Israel made us hungry and our government made us hungry and people are stealing. Shame on you, Arabs. Where are you? DIAMOND (voice-over): But after nearly five months of war, is the world listening?

And quickly, they prepare another. The hunt is no game, but has the tools of one. They lose about a quarter of their drones to Russian jamming. TIMUR, UKRAINE'S 11TH NATIONAL GUARD: [Foreign Language]. PATON WALSH (voice-over): They see the Russians running into the blue house, its roof clearly hit before awhile ago, it becomes their next target. They go in again. It could be a move to position they think. Watch, how smaller explosions send fragments flying out. The Russians often have to stay injured inside the damaged building to not draw in more drones. They go in again, it could be a move to position they think, then suddenly the power goes out. The internet down and screens black, but remarkably, they barely miss a beat. The commander sparks up his cell phone 5G with the drone feed and a chat group directing the entire attack just from an iPhone. The smoke grows in intensity. They think they might have hit a weapons store. They never see Russian faces or taste the smoke. The blast noise takes a few seconds to travel to them. But this is still killing up close, yet far away. Strike, launch, repeat, all day. Sometimes it is cheers here, screams there. Other times, the other way around.
