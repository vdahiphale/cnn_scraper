Now, the Los Angeles Times is reporting that he died in an apparent drowning accident at his home here in L.A. And they cited a law enforcement source and said no foul play is suspected. Now we are, of course, waiting for more details on exactly what happened. We know Perry developed a love for acting in his teenage years. He started with smaller roles and eventually landed higher profile roles, but it was being cast as the funny and very sarcastic Chandler on \"Friends\" that truly made him famous. Off screen, the actors became as close as the characters on the show and they famously negotiated together to become some of the highest paid actors on a television series at the time. And despite the joy he brought to audiences, he also shared his struggles with addiction. He eventually was able to share many of those details with his fans and said that he wanted to share this in his book because he wanted to help people. Amara, Victor?",

He was in demand and he didn't just do comedy. I mean, he was really talented, but he did straight roles too on \"The West Wing\". And yet, there was -- he was in this elite group of six and yet he was separate because he was the one who struggled so, you know -- it's just epic to read about this. And the book, I think, was as much therapy for him. He, you know, going on this tour. He talked so openly about the pain and the damage. He talked -- you know, I didn't spend that much time with him, but it was like a therapy session. He said he could have married five or six women, but he couldn't commit and he wasn't worthy of them. He had to pay someone to live with him because he was so worried about using. And he said he was scared to be alone. And he's telling me this a stranger. He said an absolute -- here, I found the quote here. He said, \"I have a never ending need for attention. But it's never the right kind of attention. It didn't work. It didn't fix the hole in me.\" And that is also rare for somebody to be that honest. I think the book, he really saw the book as a way to fix him and to relaunch himself. He was hoping possibly that the memoir would be made into. A television movie, he hoped that he would get more work from it. He wanted the world to sort of -- he wanted to share his experience and hope to help people. But I also think it was extremely therapeutic for him. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But we also have seen over the past hour rockets that have come into the area.We actually have seen the IDF Iron Dome intercepting those rockets one by one. There were probably less than a half dozen that flew over Tel Aviv itself. But, you know, look, as you sort of look at what has been happening, we are now in three weeks and a day since the October 7th Hamas attack on Israel, where more than 1,400 people were killed and you still have those dozens of hostages that Hamas has in Gaza. But in Gaza, there is a humanitarian crisis that is unfolding in the sort of worst possible way because there's not only an Israeli blockade that existed, it got more severe, so you didn't have any food, any water, any fuel coming in and so you had the electricity go out. The fuel fuels the electric plant that is there. The one plant that is there. You also have a serious problem with communications. Communications were all knocked out, according to Jawwal, which is the telecommunications that runs all telecommunications in Gaza, saying that because of the bombardments two nights ago that they had lost most communications, if not all communications, there was a complete blackout for a while. There is a bit of communication, electronic communication coming out of Gaza now. But a lot of families still haven't heard from their loved ones. You've got eight agencies that haven't heard from their colleagues who are in Gaza, and there have been more members of UNRWA who has been on the ground for decades there in Gaza running things like schools who have lost more members who have been killed in airstrikes. So it is a real catastrophe for civilians in Gaza now as this war goes into what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a second phase, which indicates that the ground war has begun, not in the large scale way that we were expecting but there are ground forces. There are Israeli soldiers that are now in Gaza. I want to toss it over to my colleague Melissa Bell, who can talk to you more about what is happening in Gaza.

It's really a difficult scenario for the civilians and those trying to help the civilians there. Thank you so much for that report.I am joined now by former State Department negotiator for the Middle East, Aaron David Miller. You have a breadth of knowledge about this region and about this particular incursion and war that we're seeing. What is your take on what Benjamin Netanyahu called the second stage or phase of the war? AARON DAVID MILLER, FORMER STATE DEPT. MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR: You know, I think the prime minister who he likes to cast terms in dramatic and historical tile -- style, basically has elevated this conflict against Hamas to an existential level. He talked, quoting Hamlet, actually, that a state has two choices, to be or not to be. And by equating this operation with as a second Israeli struggle for independence, he's clearly identified a extremely difficult objective, which is the destruction not only of Hamas' military capacity, but its very sovereignty in Gaza. The problem that the Israelis face, I think, Sara, and you're there, you see it, is whether or not they have the means at their disposal to actually accomplish that task and to prevent Hamas' resurgence by engaging any number of actors that -- on which they are going to be become dependent. Palestinian Authority, the U.N., the United States, the international community, Saudi money, all of these things mean that far from becoming a -- an Israeli war of independence, Israelis will be left, I suspect. However, the military campaign turns out being dependent on a number of actors to ensure that Hamas, assuming the Israelis can destroy it, essentially is not able to return to Gaza. And I think the fact that they will not describe this as an invasion, they've been very careful maintaining flexibility in terms of exactly how they want to achieve that, reflects their indecision on one hand. And also, Sara, the frustration with the hostage negotiations. I think the Israelis believe they're being played by Hamas, no surprise there, in an effort to delay an invasion.",

We were listening to it together. He said that actually the bombardments are good for the negotiations because it will force Hamas to the table.

Results will demonstrate, Sara, whether the Israeli tactics are accurate or not. Number one, to press Hamas, to make it unmistakably clear what the Israelis are prepared to do if Hamas does not release hostages.And number two, Israelis all along have argued that once on the ground, they will be operationally in a better position to identify intelligence. And perhaps even rescue some of these people. I'm not entirely sure that either assumption is correct. There's just so much we don't know. It's not even clear to me that the Qataris or the Egyptians have identified the right individuals to talk to with respect to this negotiation since some of the hostages reports indicate are not being held by Hamas or the Palestine Islamic Jihad but by individual Palestinians or families who kidnapped them in an effort to trade them for financial gain. The Israelis dropped leaflets a week or so ago not for Hamas, indicating that they would offer financial rewards for Palestinians who would provide information on the hostages. So, I think it's an extremely confused situation, and it's so opaque that we really don't have a good sense of what the dynamic is.",

I might add that one of the Palestinian prisoners exchange was Yahya Sinwar, who is now not only the key planner of this October 7 terrorist massacre, but essentially is the military leader of Hamas. I don't know, frankly, right now whether the Israelis would agree to that sort of swap. It will turn Hamas, given the fact that Palestinian prisoners resonate so deeply on the Palestinian street, give it a heroic status. But Netanyahu's under tremendous pressure. I think you saw that yesterday from the families in the press conference, to make the hostages not just a secondary objective.

Those famous lines that were delivered in the way he did was something that he actually came up with. He came up with the way that Chandler was delivering those, and I think it's really, really meaningful to talk about that and how great he was. That he wasn't just an actor that was reading lines on a page. He really never stopped working. We see a lot of these '90s, early 2000s stars that kind of take a break from the spotlight.

There have been over 100,000 people killed, and thousands displaced due to the fighting over territory and over control, and multiple peace efforts have failed as well. So, the U.S. decided it really had no option but to get more involved and more aggressive about trying to seek peace talks.So, you know, as we think about Bosnia and we look to the Middle East, there are a couple of things that could be particularly helpful. One is, the U.S. refuse to deal directly with the Bosnian Serbs because of the leaders that had been associated with atrocities. And so, their interests are represented instead by Belgrade. And just as here, it is impossible to see Israel or the United States inviting Hamas to the table. Second, as you mentioned, in terms of incentives for cooperating and disincentives for not cooperating. Here, I think, to give you some examples, the incentives for the Palestinians, for example, would be genuine reconstruction of Gaza for the 1st time, really. Laying modern infrastructure, both in Gaza and in the West Bank. Also trying to ensure there's greater access and movement within the West Bank, as well as between the West Bank and Gaza. In terms of disincentives, those conversations are typically and most effectively done quietly. But I think it would certainly have to include curtailing support, different kinds of support, for all of the parties if, once this current crisis subsides, we're not able to see movement towards resumption of the peace process.",

And I know you offered up a critique of Benjamin Netanyahu's hard right government. It is the most right-wing government in Israel's history which, you know, has promised to expand Jewish settlements. We know the allies, the far right, ultra-Orthodox parties in his government have opposed Palestinian statehood. And, of course, on the Palestinian side, I saw, a poll taken by the Washington Institute back in July that showed that less than 40 percent of Palestinians in Gaza, West Bank, East Jerusalem, they do not support a two-state solution.[07:45:00] And of course, as you know, the Hamas' founding charter calls for the destruction of Israel. So, how do we even begin to talk? Is there truly a will on both sides?",

The previous government, not the unity government now there, but the previous government that the prime minister led, was not serious about peace talks in the sense that it was not accepting the two-state solution that had been the basis for talks since Oslo.And so, I think one of the most important questions will be what kind of government, what kind of leadership emerges in Israel. It will need to, again, embrace, genuinely, a two-state solution, meaning an Israeli and Palestinian state can reside side by side with all people having the opportunity to live with security and with dignity. I think that's going to be fundamental. Similarly, the Palestinian authority needs to be in a more viable position to represent the interests of the Palestinians. And that's going to take a lot of work from the U.S., from our states in the region from the E.U. as well to coordinate their support much more effectively so that they can really build institutions. You need in the West Bank for governance and ultimately, as well in Gaza.",

One source told CNN, there was major concern in Pence's campaign that he was not going to qualify for the third debate stage next month.Now, this leaves eight Republican presidential candidates vying to take on President Joe Biden in November 2024. Donald Trump, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Vivek Ramaswamy, Chris Christie, Doug Berman, and Asa Hutchinson. I tried to do that all in one breath, I did not make it. Several of them made clear at the conference that they would support Israel in the ongoing war with Hamas. For more on that, let's bring in now Catherine Lucey with -- she's a White House reporter at \"The Wall Street Journal\". Catherine, good to see you again. All right. So, let's first talk about Pence and then broaden it out. The question about a Pence candidacy from even before he made it official was what was his lane? He was too Trumpy for the never Trumpers. And if you like Trump, well, he's running so you can just support him. In the end, was that what ended the campaign?",

The pro-Trump folks resented him for certifying the 2020 election results. The people who didn't like Trump thought he had been too loyal to Trump before that. So, there was never really an obvious space for him.He spent a lot of time trying to court voters in Iowa, you know, where he had, you know, long -- had relationships with evangelical voters. It's such a crowded primary, a primary you can't get through in one breath that they had lots of other people to look at. And so, he just never really caught fire with anybody and has clearly been struggling. And as you said earlier, in his -- it was not clear that he was going to make the next debate.
