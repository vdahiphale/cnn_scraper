In some cases, we can see these soldiers prone position on the streets, kind of deploying around military buildings while there are ordinary Russian civilians standing next to them in shorts and T-shirts.Certainly, there is a very dramatic power struggle taking place right now. You've had one of Russia's most senior military commanders, General Surovikin, who's come out on camera urging Prigozhin and his Wagner mercenaries to submit to Russian law, to lay down their arms, and saying basically, we are brothers in arms. We have fought on the battlefields of Ukraine. Do not do this, stop before it's too late. So, there is clearly some kind of collision that is taking place right now. And Prigozhin is openly accusing the Russian defense ministry, the Russian defense minister himself, and the top general in the Russian military of genocide against the Russian people. And he wants to bring them to justice, he says. This is so dramatic. I do not know how this will unfold in the coming hours.",

      "sentences": "That to me looks like the center of power in Russia being fortified against potential threats. We have not seen any signs of any instability in Moscow itself right now. Ukraine and its borders and where the Wagner mercenary forces were deployed, it's at least, on a good day, a 15-hour drive from there, from Rostov, for example, all the way up to Moscow. But it's clear that there are checkpoints being set up, that there are efforts to try to stop whatever movement could be trying to come up from the south of the country.And let's try to keep in mind what the Wagner mercenary group is. This is a force, again, of mercenaries that has recruited from the penal system, from the prisons around Russia, and sent them into battle for months now, predominantly around the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut. They were pulled out of there in the last month or so. The Russian Defense Ministry had issued an order that said that all mercenary groups had to sign contracts with the Russian Defense Ministry. The Wagner boss, Prigozhin, who is very present on social media, who has been leading basically an information campaign, propaganda campaign against the defense ministry for months now, accusing the top generals of being corrupt, of sending soldiers into battle without appropriate ammunition and weapons. He's been building this campaign for some time, and now he's basically turned a hundred and eighty degrees against them and accused them of launching this invasion into Ukraine on false pretexts, to basically get promotions for themselves and to earn money for themselves. So, he's challenging Vladimir Putin's rationale for the war in the first place. And all of this is coming as active combat is still taking place all over Ukraine. There have been airstrikes against the Ukrainian capital overnight. The Ukrainian military is carrying out its counteroffensives. It's been launching raids into Russian territory that have been difficult for the Russian military to stop. So, the question is, how will the Russian security forces deal with armored, battle-hardened ranks of convicted criminals and mercenaries now charging into the Russian heartlands? It's a scenario that is, frankly, kind of mind-boggling.",

We'll try to get some answers because we're going to bring in now CNN Military Analyst and Retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton and CNN Political and National Security Analyst David Sanger.Gentlemen, thank you so much for being here with us late on this Friday night to understand the breaking news and the chaos in Russia. So, let's start there, Colonel, what Ivan was just talking about. In terms of a power, well, a military struggle, is it possible for Prigozhin and his troops to actually pull off a coup against the Russian military?",

      "sentences": "Well, certainly, Alisyn. This has been brewing for a long time. And this has just been the latest and the biggest escalation of Mr. Prigozhin's attack on the two leading generals of the Russian military, who he's called incompetent and liars and so forth.Whether or not they really did attack that group is -- it's hard to tell. And so far, I haven't heard any independent intelligence from the United States or allies that would support it. Doesn't mean it didn't happen. I'm sure everybody in the White House right now seems to be trying to figure this out, as well. But I think a couple of things are probably likely to emerge from all of this murkiness. One, I agree with Colonel Leighton. I can't imagine that they could, that Prigozhin could succeed here. But he's showing deep cracks in what Putin has tried to show for the past 20 years has been unchallenged rule. Remember how upset Putin got back in the early Obama administration when he accused Hillary Clinton of interfering in elections in Russia because she said that an election was rigged and he wanted to have an overwhelming support. Second, the Russian people who have had suspicions that this war was being conducted on false pretenses now have a Russian in their midst, one who they know well making that case. And the third thing that's happening here, I think, is that the Ukrainians must be thinking, this is great. We've gotten rid of the Wagner group, the most effective of the Russian troops. And, the big concern, of course, for the American side is they're all watching Russia's nuclear arsenal, as we have at various other points. So far, I've heard no indication of anything moving, but that's always the big fear, what happens if you lose control?",

One of the things that I think that they would do is perhaps, prosecute their advantage, their tactical advantage in Bakhmut, for example. That would be a major turning point potentially for the Ukrainians.Another thing that they could do is, as the Russian forces withdraw potentially to defend against the Wagner group, they could backfill that area and take over areas that the Russians abandoned if that happens. We don't know if that's going to happen, but those are the kinds of things that the Ukrainians are going to be looking for, I'm sure, and they will probably take advantage of them as quickly as they possibly can.",

I think it is interesting, quite some of your guests earlier were saying that there's not a great chance that Prigozhin, acting on his own, is going to be able to pull this off.And I sort of agree with that point. You know, he's not gonna be able to take his soldiers and sort of march from the war zone in Ukraine up to the Kremlin and just take over or as he claims to the Ministry of Defense so that he can affect justice. But if he's smart and he has moved at pretty high circles in Moscow for a long time, he understands that if you're actually going to try to pull off some sort of coup, that you're going to need people on the inside who are at the very least not going to stop you and are gonna look the other way. So, if that's really what he's trying to do, then he has reached out to this group that I've referred to previously as the Siloviki. These are the chiefs of the intelligence services, some of the senior military folks, some of the senior ministry of interior and police folks. If he's reached out to those folks and sort of greased the skids and said, look, we need to do something here. Those elites might be saying, yeah, things haven't been going particularly well in Ukraine. They haven't been going particularly well for Russia. And they haven't been going particularly well for us. We've been losing our yachts and our money. And, you know, this has got to come to an end somehow. So, if he's got buy-in, if Prigozhin has buy-in from folks in Moscow, he may have a shot.",

Don't say anything about this. Nobody talk about it. We don't want every day Russians talking about it. We want this to look like, you know, just some weird thing that's happened that Prigozhin perhaps had a little too much to drink, which has apparently happened in the past, and don't worry about it.When you've got senior Russian military guys saying, hey, you know, Prigozhin, this is not gonna stand. You have to -- you have to stop. That shows a big, in my opinion, fissure that you got going inside the Russian government. And of course, that's critical to the Russian population, because the Russian population is constantly told by the Kremlin, hey, no matter else what you have to go through, we will guarantee your stability. This isn't looking very stable right now, and I don't think, to anybody who's following it inside of Russia.",

And there's a lot of, as Steve knows, there's a lot of communications at lower levels amongst military members between the two countries, regardless of what's happening on the diplomatic side.At the State Department, you have these different pieces at the State Department, you're going to have outreach to our allies because they are equally concerned. This is -- this is -- and for Europe, it's close. So, they are -- destabilization is just never a great thing, especially when we don't know how this unfolds. And especially when the other side, you know, is this group. It's not like this is not, you know, the sort of a, you know, a populist movement. This is a -- another horrible group of people and leadership as the -- as the Russian leadership is. And so, you will have the diplomatic outreach to have a unified front amongst the allies as we've had with Ukraine. And so, those are the different pieces. I think from the homeland front, it is just -- it's just monitoring at this stage, no reason to believe that there's any threat. There's no evidence of it whatsoever. But as I said, destabilization is not a great thing as this moves forward very quickly. And the most important thing right now is that no one -- do anything too quickly, especially on the U.S. side.

They want to be able to argue over the classified documents used in this case, handling that appropriately. They also want to give the defense team some time to prepare.

Those two people, both from Nevada, both fake electors, they went to the grand jury two weeks ago and they were compelled to testify. They had to share what they knew and give evidence.

You want to avoid witness tampering, and it's a condition of release. Remember, neither one of them are in jail. They're released on their own recognizance.

It's a sad day for the country. But it's clear that Donald Trump acted recklessly. His innocence is presumed. This is the United States of America. It's a pillar. And what we need right now is to respect the process. And so, I think that's exactly what is happening here. I've received a top secret security clearance. It is an arduous process. They actually conduct interviews. If you've lived in another country, you know, it's extensive. And that's what his defense has to go through in order to actually view these top secret documents. If this was some weaponization of government where Joe Biden was actually using the tools of government to go after his political opponent in an unfair way they wouldn't be doing something like this.

Well, in his latest statement, he claims that a helicopter opened fire on one of his convoys and that his forces then shot that helicopter down, destroyed it, he claims, and that it's burning in the woods on the side of the highway leading towards Moscow. Now, take some of this with a grain of salt, because he is known to embellish and exaggerate.He has claimed earlier, accused the Russian military of firing rockets at a refinery base of his Wagner mercenary group and of killing many of his people. But this is a sign of the kind of rhetoric that we're hearing and the accusations that are being made. He goes on in this audio message to say that he and his forces, all 25,000, he claims, are all ready to die, ready to die for the Russian homeland and for the Russian people. Now, a little bit of context here. We know that he has announced that he is going to lead a march for justice into Russia after accusing the top Russian military command of genocide against the Russian people. We have seen images on social media of armed groups, of tanks and armored personnel carriers deployed in the southern city of Rostov, a southern Russian city, which is not far from the Ukrainian border. We have heard that the Russian government has issued, launched a criminal case against Prigozhin, accusing him of armed rebellion. And we also know that one of the most senior military commanders in the Russian military, who was believed in the past to have been close to Prigozhin himself, this is the deputy commander of the Russian Joint Forces, General Sergey Surovikin. He came out and issued a video statement, an appeal to the fighters and commanders of this Wagner mercenary group telling them, hey, we are brothers in arms, but stop this before it's too late, basically submit to the Russian government. [23:45:00] So, there's clearly some kind of power struggle taking place. You have got the most powerful mercenary chieftain in Russia, who was fighting on the frontlines for more than a year, now being accused openly of armed rebellion. We have had statements that the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, is being kept up to date about this, but we haven't heard anything firsthand from him. I just got off the phone with a contact in Moscow, Alisyn. He was out partying in the nightclubs all night, but he says now this is all anybody is talking about in Moscow, right now, though the streets there, in his opinion, still look normal. We've heard from the governor of the Rostov region urging people to stay off the streets and to be careful. And we've heard from the governor of Moscow, the mayor of Moscow, that anti-terrorist activities are starting to take place. There are new security precautions underway right now. So, this is a tense situation, and we do not know how it will unfold. Alisyn.",

Obviously, we will keep an eye on exactly what Moscow looks like right now. Ivan, thank you very much for all of that context.So, more news tonight. The NTSB announcing that the U.S. Coast Guard will lead the investigation into the fatal implosion of the Titan submersible. I want to bring in now underwater forensics expert Rhonda Moniz. Rhonda, thank you so much. We really appreciate having you back tonight so that we can understand what this investigation is gonna look like.

There's not a lot of assets that can reach those depths and work in those depths. They need people that are highly qualified and trained to run that operation.Where they need to start is where they've been starting. They need to map and document those debris fields as much as they possibly can while they have those work class ROVs on the ocean floor. That's what they need to do. They need to get as much information, collect as much data, document it as much as they can. And if there's any small pieces that the ROV, they do have manipulator arms that they can collect, they can pick up some things, then they can do that. And then they'll have to come in with deep water salvage equipment following that to remove or recover the larger pieces of equipment.",
