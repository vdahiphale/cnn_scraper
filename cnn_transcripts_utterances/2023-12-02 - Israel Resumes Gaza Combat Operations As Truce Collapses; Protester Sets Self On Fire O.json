The Palestinian Ministry of Health reports that as of this morning, at least 200 people were killed and 700 injured, many of the dead and injured they said our children and this -- it's important to keep in mind that even the U.N. says that at least 50 -- at least 40 percent of the population of Gaza is under the age of 15. Now we've also seen that the Arabic spokesman for the Israeli military has ordered the inhabitants of Shejaiya Jabalya and Tofa (ph) which are three areas to the east and north of Gaza City to leave immediately and leave those areas by four o'clock in the afternoon. Now, it's difficult to see how some of these people can leave these areas and go to South of Gaza since many of them either don't have cars or don't have the fuel to put in their cars. Now, finally, some aid after 24 hours of nothing getting into Gaza. Some aid is getting through the Palestinian Red Crescent Society says that 50 trucks with food and medical aid entered Gaza through from Egypt through the Rafah crossing. Victor, Isabel.",

That's why this fell apart. And the White House was also very clear that the side that violated the ceasefire was Hamas. It was not Israel.

On October 7, there was a ceasefire until Hamas violated it entered into Israeli communities and butchered and massacred 1,200 people and took another 230, 240 as hostages.Israel did not want this war. Israel was compelled and forced into this conflict by Hamas. And what Hamas wants is for Israel to attack that civilian infrastructure, for civilians to be killed, because that's part of its strategy and wants the world to see those images and to crack down in Israel and believe that Israel is the side that is the aggressor, while Israel is the side that is actually defending itself. Now, can Israel do potentially more to minimize civilian casualties and collateral damage? From my experience and the knowledge that I have and what I've seen up close in those military bases, Israel goes to links that no other military in the world does. With that said, there's no question, Isabel, you're right, the pressure from the U.S. is going to impact Israel decision making, because Israel relies heavily on the support and the alliance with the United States. So if Biden, Blinken and the rest of the U.S. government starts to say to Israel, wrap it up, guys, it's time for this war to come to an end, that could lead to a crisis between Israel and the United States. But we have to remember, the elimination of Hamas, the removal of Hamas from power in Gaza, is not just an Israel security interest, it is in the interest of the world, is in the interest of the Palestinian people of Gaza, are also held hostage by this violent terrorist group. So Israel has a mission still to do, which would bring greater stability and safety not just to Israel, but to the entire region.",

And when you look at that particular argument, it's problematic.Number one, obviously, we all enjoy rights to free speech. Right. And particularly the president, it's elevated because you have to protect political speech. However, two things of note, Victor. Number one, there is limitations, as we know, on the nature of speech, obviously, in terms of not being unlimited. You know, defamation, that's a problematic, yelling fire is problematic. But that I think is beyond the point. Number two, the real reality is that it's not about just speech. If you look at the indictment, it's about conduct, right. The realities are is that not only does free speech, not protect criminal activity. But it's not only an indictment that alleges that you were speaking in there for your guilty, you were acting, it speaks to the issue of so many things, whether it's election in terms of the Georgia case, looking at the actual voting, looking at fake electors, looking at making suggestions with respect to how the election was averted and trying to lie to the legislature, the speaker, etcetera, to have them have your view. And so my view of it is, is that it will not carry the day the indictment will not be dismissed, Victor and the case will move forward.",

If you evaluate the 48-page ruling, boy, did she go through chapter and verse in terms of American history, and in doing so made very clear that the -- there's a distinction between a system of government wherein you elect a king, and a system of government where you have a person who is elected president, who certainly powerful position, very important with respect to what they do for our democracy.But there are limitations to what you can do, and that there is nothing in the Constitution that grants the broad immunity of allowing the president to do as they wish, when they wish, how they wish, particularly violating federal law and saying, Hey, there's nothing to see here. Let's leave that to the impeachment clause. And if they're not impeach, then, you know what, they have broad sweeping immunity for criminal activity, the judge said not at all and engaged in a sweeping rebuke of anything that would be near criminal immunity for any president. And so I think it was largely a rendition of what the Constitution says. I think it's pretty solid on the law will certainly be appealed. But I think that the elements of her reasoning are very sound with respect to a president being like everyone else in the commission of alleged crimes.",

However, only as to your official acts, this was not an official act. And so therefore, the court noted that, yes, you can move forward and suing the president. In terms of the difficulty, as you mentioned, Victor, they didn't reach that is the court whether or not the President on the merits should be held accountable civilly, only that you can try to hold them accountable. And I think that like any other case, it's a question of proof. What were the President's activities on that day? How involved and engaged was he? What specifically did he do? What led up to this? Was there a connection? And was that connection causal to the injuries that were sustained and occurred? And I think if based upon all that we've seen, the plaintiffs can prove that.

You can see here, level 3 and level 4. Now, when you talk about atmospheric rivers of level one and two, it's mostly beneficial, they like to have that. But when you start getting into level 4 and level 5, it now starts to cross into where it's more hazardous than it is beneficial.

So, the Huskies jumped out to 20-3 lead in this game, but the Ducks would rally back. Bo Nix, he is going to hit Terrence Ferguson, he takes it in for the score, Oregon scored 21 unanswered points, so they took the lead, but it was the Huskies with back-to-back touchdowns, Penix to Quentin Moore. Here, Washington, they go back up by 10, the Ducks though, they will just not go away in this game on the next drive. Nix is going to find Traeshon Holden, this was his only catch of the game, but watch him weave through all the defenders, break some tackles, 63-yard touchdown there. So that made it 34 to 31. Ducks needed a stop, and they couldn't get it. Huskies able to run out the clock, thanks to Dillon Johnson, he rushed for 152 yards, two scores, Washington finishes off that perfect 13-0 season, securing a playoff berth for the first time since 2017.
