Buffett Foundation created in 1999 focuses on food security and conflict mitigation. Pivotal concerns, not only for Ukraine, of course, but for the numerous countries that rely on Ukrainian exports. Last year, the foundation devoted $150 million to humanitarian efforts in Ukraine, from food assistance and reconstruction to helping farmers, plant harvest, and exports their crops. This year, it expects to double its donation. And Howard Buffett, Chairman and CEO of the Howard G. Buffett Foundation join us now. Howard, fantastic to have you on the show once again, I want to begin with Russia's decision to terminate at least for now their participation in the Black Sea Grain Deal. It was widely telegraphed, I think over the past few weeks, and it's been met with international condemnation, your response? HOWARD BUFFETT, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF HOWARD G. BUFFETT FOUNDATION: Well, I think it'll be incremental impact will be incremental compared to when it occurred originally, but it'll certainly have impact. But you know, last October, the daily inspections were at 11 or recently, they're down to two. So Russia has already used the inspection process to delay the shipping of grain. And that's had a big impact last October, they're shipping around the 4.23 million metric tons in May, in June, they're shipping about a little bit over a million metric tons. So they've already slow this process down to a very minimal pace. So I think there's been some adjustment over the last six months, but of course, it'll still have impact.",

But farmers have made a pretty big shift in Ukraine in terms of what they're producing. They're looking at how to produce crops that don't require as much fertilizer, that maybe are easier to store, easier to ship. So you've seen a big shift from some crops like corn or to soybeans and rapeseed. So it's already had a big impact on what Ukraine is producing.",

So we needed to find companies that could get the distribution process, right. And we focused on farmers that 500 hectares or less, because I think the smaller farmers oftentimes have a harder time getting financing, keeping the financing. And you know, when they lose something, it's a little bit harder for them to recover. So we focus on the small farms, we got a lot of seed, lot of fertilizer out. We also had a huge vegetable seed program. And those vegetable seeds were distributed in a lot of the food boxes that went out along the newly liberated areas and the front lines. So people could plant gardens, which sometimes is the only way that they can have access to the food.",

And, you know, that will have a lot of impact as well on global food security. So those types of concessions or agreements make sense. But some of the things that Russia demands don't make sense. I mean, we're going to war, and there's an unprovoked war, you know, Russia is should not be in a position to negotiate beyond what makes sense in terms of the system with global food security.

That obviously all contributes to the problem of climate change those types of things that people are talking about, but always talking about it after it's too late. You know, we don't have cooling stations, cooling centers in Italy. There aren't places where people can go necessarily outside of like a shopping mall to cool down.

Of course, the global average temperature that record which stood from 2016 was broken on July 3. It has not dipped below that since. So we were way above that the El Nino force that's happening now. We went from a La Nina cooling system in the Pacific now to a warming El Nino is just pushing these temperatures off the charts.
