Since sunrise, we've learned the campaign has sent a letter to House Democrats scheduled a private call with donors. And the President called into a morning show just in the last hour or so to forcefully reiterate that he isn't going anywhere.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

And in response to that, President Biden launching an offensive saying he's not going anywhere and issuing a letter to all House Democrats saying that the voters have already spoken and they have made him the presumptive nominee by a wide margin, urging them to put an end to those questions and to focus on the one job at hand and that is beating Donald Trump in the election. Now, President Biden is trying to tamp down intra-party criticism and frustration just before he has to step onto the world stage and present a unifying front where NATO leaders are gathering in Washington for the 75th anniversary of this summit. His predecessor, Donald Trump, has suggested that he could withdraw or limit resources to NATO if he were reelected, which is something that President Biden has tried to reiterate time and time again. And just this morning, on an interview with \"Morning Joe,\" unscheduled, unprompted, the president phoning into that show one of his longtime favorites. He said that that is just one of the many things that Trump would do. That's dangerous. Here's Biden his own words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He's down at Mar-a-Lago talking with his wealthy friends.I'm not running because of these guys, though. I'm running because he knew me well enough to notice from the very beginning, I ran because I never bought on and it's trickle down economic theory, I never bought into the notion that we have to walk away from the rest of the world and cave to Putin or anybody else.

So we are likely to see some movement on that front.But I will note that at least one source has told me that it could be as late as Monday meaning they would make that vice presidential announcement at the convention before that official nominating process began. But when they start this two week critical period, they are in a place that, one, they are not used to and one they didn't think that they would be in which is out of the spotlight. Now sources that are close to the former president, tell me that because Biden is mainstream, because he is really controlling the media cycle right now. It's not going to affect any decisions that Trump makes in terms of announcing a vice presidential pick. But knowing Donald Trump and knowing the fact that he watches all of this very carefully that he likes to be in control of the media narrative that he likes to be the center of attention, it seems unlikely that he would choose a day in which we're going to see President Joe Biden quite a bit. Now the Trump team and Trump campaign is in the same position really the rest of America and all of us are in which is kind of a holding pattern when it comes to the campaign and moving forward. They are waiting to see how this all plays out. And while they have been happy to sort of watch these Democrats in disarray, this spiraling that we have seen for the last several weeks post-debate, they also are eager to regain control to try and get back into the spotlight particularly as they are heading into once again, a very critical two-week span where he is going to name his vice presidential candidate and go into that convention in Milwaukee next week.",

But we did speak to a number of sources who said not to read into the fact that he was doing a rally in this critical week in Miami that it did not mean that Senator Marco Rubio was the vice presidential pick.But obviously, there is a lot of speculation circulating as we have reported. There are three names that have been continued to be batted around by the former president, by his allies. One of them is Senator Marco Rubio, the other one senator J.D. Vance, and the other one North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. But when you talk to the people, even those who are closest to Donald Trump, they say they still don't know who it's going to be.

There was only created a month ago or just under a month ago in order to stop the far right had succeeded in its mission, those celebrations you've given away this morning, something of a hangover here, the French National Assembly, the fact is the country wakes up without not only an absolute majority but without the slightest idea of how this left- wing Alliance which cobbles together many different forms of the French left from the far left and more moderates to ecologist, how they're going to agree on who they might suggest as the candidate who would become the next prime minister.So for the time being, what we've had is Gabriel Attal, the current Prime Minister trying to resign the French president convincing him to stay on in a caretaker role, no doubt, considering what that sign on the French National Assembly will remind you of that it's just 18 days until the start of the Paris Olympics, a grand opening ceremony that will be presided over not just by the French president, but that with a prime minister. We don't know his name yet. And of course, all the possibility there is that if he tries to keep his current prime minister in office, and the winning left-wing Alliance feel that they're not being given the opportunity to name or to don't have the possibility of agreeing on a candidate for prime minister, the protests that might follow. Wolf, what this election has done, it was meant to give the voice to the people because the government had heard loud and clear how popular the far right will were doing. People have come together tactical voting parties to stop them getting to power. But the fact is that Emmanuel Macron is now going to function with a far more divided fractious Parliament than the one that he dissolved just a few weeks ago. So unchartered territory here in France. And I think the difficult negotiations happening behind the scenes, just between the left to agree on a candidate are likely to take some more time, Wolf.",
