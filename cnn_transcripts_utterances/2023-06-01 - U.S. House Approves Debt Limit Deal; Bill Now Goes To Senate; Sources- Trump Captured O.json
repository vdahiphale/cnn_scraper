      "sentences": "Well, a big bipartisan victory in the house Tuesday night for both President Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The House passed a bill to raise the debt ceiling and limit spending with a number of members in both parties voting in favor of the bill. In the end, 149 Republicans and 165 Democrats joined forces to get this bill over the finish line where it now goes to the Senate.But this was not an easy vote. It was not an easy road to get here. It took weeks of intense negotiations. There were a number of breakdowns in the talks along the way. And there was also a last-minute revolt from some rank-and-file members, particularly among conservatives. Republicans were not happy that the debt limit is extended for two years now. They also wanted it to go further and cutting spending. And then some Democrats were worried about the new stricter work requirements for food stamp recipients. But in the end, leadership works behind the scenes to whip this bill to sell members on the steel. And they are confident that it is also going to pass in the Senate. But there is a question of how quickly they can get it done because over in the Senate, it takes the cooperation of every single member in order to be able to move quickly. But Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader is planning to take a first procedural step on Thursday to move this bill along. Then him and Mitch McConnell, the GOP leader over there will have to work out a deal likely offering some amendment votes to get all their members on board. But the bottom line, Congress is poised to avert a crisis although barely. Melania Zanona, CNN, Capitol Hill.",

But the task at hand is to advance them beyond the decision made at the NATO summit in 2008.When back then, the alliance said it supported Ukraine's bid. It would sort of actively engage on a path to membership. And since then, we haven't had any official advancements. So, they're looking for some way to push forward while stopping short of actually joining whether it's bilateral security guarantees or some kind of other mechanism to do so. That is one of the key tasks. We've just actually heard from Jen Stoltenberg as he -- as he entered the summit in Oslo. And he said, look, it's not just about the short term, obviously, we support Ukraine, we support their right to defend themselves, but they're looking as well, as you say, at the long term at a multiyear commitment to support Ukraine's transition away from Soviet weapons to the kind of army where its equipment has interoperability with what NATO has. So, that's a key task. They're also looking at advancing Sweden's bid to join NATO which has been held up as you know by Hungary and Turkey. And things like defense spending and all of that.

A judge has just dismissed the multimillion-dollar defamation lawsuit brought by a highly-decorated war veteran against several Australian newspapers. After more than 100 days of hearings over the past year, the judge ruled the articles in fact did not defame Ben Robert-Smith when they alleged, he had a role in the unlawful killings of Afghan prisoners. The judge found that the papers establish substantial truth in fact and a number of claims, though not all of them. CNN Producer Angus Watson has been following this story closely.

And he brought this defamation case against the newspapers and the journalists who wrote the stories. And the big news today is that the newspapers won. Now the newspapers played a truth defense, more evidence was brought before the court in their efforts to prove the veracity of their journalism. The judge decided that the most egregious elements of their reporting were true. Some of the allegations that the newspapers had brought forward in their reporting could not be proved by this truth defense. But the judge ruled that the context around those allegations was enough to ensure that Ben Robert-Smith had not been defamed by that reporting. Now, this is not a criminal case. This was a defamation case, but what it did was it served as a proxy for a war crimes hearing. This was the first time that war crimes allegations have been tested in Australian court and as I said, the most egregious of those have been proven to have been most likely true. Those include the shooting of an unarmed noncombatant with a prosthetic leg. Those included the allegation that Ben Robert-Smith had kicked an elderly Afghan man off a cliff and then ordered other Australian soldiers to shoot him. Some of the people who served with Ben Robert-Smith in Afghanistan testified against him in this blockbuster trial, which has been called by some here as Australia's trial of the century. Afghans, from their villages beamed into Australia's federal court by video leak to describe what Australian soldiers had done in their villages over 10 years ago. So, this has grant -- gained huge fraction here in Australia. It will have huge impact on Australia's military legacy in Afghanistan as we know a separate Australian military war crimes investigation has shown that 39 Afghan civilians or noncombatants were killed by Australian soldiers throughout Australia's longest war. Ben Robert- Smith faces the possibility that he might face other charges, criminal ones, potentially in the future. Paula?",
