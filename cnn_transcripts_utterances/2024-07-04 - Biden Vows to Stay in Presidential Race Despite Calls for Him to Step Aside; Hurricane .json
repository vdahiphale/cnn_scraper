Deadly Hurricane Beryl is now battering the Cayman Islands, but Jamaica was spared the worst, that's according to the Prime Minister on CNN. And there is another surge of fighting in the Israeli-Lebanon border. We will be live in Tel Aviv. Now, while the United States celebrates its independence this July 4th, President Joe Biden is trying to salvage a re-election campaign now on the brink, amid calls from some in his own party to drop out, he sat down for two new radio interviews. Mr. Biden admits his debate performance last week on CNN was a disaster, but he vows to stay in the race. Listen. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

OK, we are entering the final hours of a momentous U.K. election. The polls are open and voting is now underway for about 12 hours there. The moment follows a six-week campaign from all major parties, much of the debate has revolved around the economy, the cost of living and immigration. Labor leader Keir Starmer cast his ballot in London and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak voted in Yorkshire in northern England. Now, he called the snap vote to be held early in a move that caught much of the party by surprise. The polls are set to close at 10:00 tonight local time. CNN's Nada Bashir joins us now live from a polling station in London. Having lived in London, I do understand that the weather is always a concern, hopefully they're getting some Summer there.

There're just under three hours left until polls close for the day. We've had the whole entire day for voters up and down the country to cast their ballots. Tens of thousands of polling stations, and of course, the all important vote-count begins at 10:00 p.m. local time. That's 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time in the States. And that count is expected to go on overnight. We'll be seeing the results come in constituency, come by constituency. Now, important to remember, of course, that there are 650 seats up for grabs in the House of Commons. All parties involved in this year's elections will be looking to gain a majority. So that crucial 326 figure in order to secure an election win, in order to form a government. And of course, we are expecting to see early exit polls overnight since the early hours of Friday morning. But those official results won't be announced until Friday morning, but we may all get a sense of exactly where the country is swaying and leaning towards in just a few hours really. So, many will be waiting for that. Many will be staying up all night to watch those results come in. Of course, there are huge number of issues at the forefront of voters' minds. We can't get into the details of course, because of the very tight restrictions on coverage around the election during polling hours. We can't really discuss any of those policy matters, but they're certainly local, national and even international issues that will be of huge concern to voters at taking part today, casting their ballots today. And of course, this is the first general election that we've had since 2019 when Boris Johnson was elected. So, this is an important moment for the country, for voters to express their views. Of course, we have seen a number of Prime Ministers, there are no general elections held in the United Kingdom. So, this is definitely a significant moment, but again, we still got just under three hours left until those polls close. And then of course, all the action begins. That's when the count begins, and then we'll be bringing more details, more analysis crucially once those polls close.",

Now, the Category 3 storm is bringing heavy rain, destructive winds and a potentially dangerous storm-surge as it heads towards Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. At least, nine people have been killed by the storm across the Caribbean. Communities in Jamaica are picking up the pieces after Beryl pounded the island with 12 consecutive hours of powerful gusts and multiple months -- think about that, worth of rain.

But that doesn't happen until August, September, maybe October. We're here at the beginning of July, the storm actually formed at the end of June. And so, people are wondering what's going on, and then part of the answer, according to meteorologists and also our very own weather department is that the ocean waters are much warmer than normal, and that's creating the kind of conditions that lead you to have not only a storm like Hurricane Beryl, but to make it a very active hurricane season. Again, we're only at the beginning the hurricane season began on June 1st, it goes until November, so, people are wondering what's going to happen in the next few months. And yes, you were right. We have been going to different communities today here in Jamaica. Earlier, we went to the Dallas community. It is east of Kingston, the capital, where we saw some works, some infrastructure, a construction project. They were building a road, it was half built, now we're going to have to start over, people cleaning up as best they can. We also went to a fishing community on the opposite side of the bay here, where people lost many of their stand, the fishing stance that they depend on for their livelihoods. So, this country is going to face many days, if not weeks, perhaps months of cleaning, trying to recover. But at the same time, I can tell you, there's a collective sigh of relief because this could have been much worse. I had an opportunity to talk to a legislator, former state legislator from Georgia who happens to have been born here.

Now, Mr. Netanyahu is holding a cabinet meeting to discuss Hamas' latest response to that ceasefire proposal. Meantime, Hezbollah and Lebanon has vowed to keep up its attacks on Israeli positions until the war in Gaza stops. It says it fired more than 200 missiles and explosive drones at Israeli military sites today. That's retaliation for the killing of a senior Hezbollah commander. Israel responded to the barrage with new attacks of its own. The violence fueling concerns about a possible all-out war. Jeremy Diamond is following all of these elements for us from Tel Aviv.

And the reason for that is that over the course of these last several months, what we have been watching is Israel and Hamas via the mediators negotiating over a framework agreement to try and reshape final agreement for a hostage and ceasefire deal. We have watched those efforts come very close to a conclusion in terms of that framework agreement. But we have never seen them enter the phase of detailed negotiations. And that is exactly what is about to happen today. The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu approving his Israeli negotiating team led by the Mossad Director David Barnea to enter into detailed negotiations with Hamas via those mediators to address the issues that have been left to the side for now. And that indicates very strongly that both sides are satisfied at this point with the progress and where they stand with that framework agreement. It comes after the United States over the weekend submitted new language to try and get Israel and Hamas on the same page as it relates to two key clauses relating to the sequencing and the scope of the negotiations that would happen during the first phase of the ceasefire deal in order to get to the second phase, the one during which you would see the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza and a long term ceasefire. And so, that indicates that these two sides again are closer than they have been in months now to actually reaching an agreement. The caveats -- to state them very clearly, two to three weeks expected of negotiations on these details. And of course, no outcome is actually assured. The devil will indeed be in the details. And that next few weeks of negotiations are going to be difficult. They will be contentious and they will be technical. And it is not clear yet whether or not they will be successful. Paula.",

There were several other Russian attacks in other regions. Ukraine's President said only two things can prevent strikes like these, modern air defenses and long-range capabilities for Ukraine to hit back. And now, some of that new military assistance will be coming from the United States. CNN's Fred Pleitgen has our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (on camera):  Pretty big military aid package for Ukraine coming from the U.S., and essentially, all this is divided into two parts. Part of it is from the presidential draw-down authorities, meaning that the U.S. gets these weapons directly from American military stocks. Now, a lot of that $150 million worth is ammunition. Some of it is interceptor missiles for surface-to-air missile systems, very important for the Ukrainians to keep their city safe, but also around the frontlines as well. And then, a lot of it is also artillery ammunition, 155-millimeter and 105-millimeter, the Ukrainians obviously have been saying that they are in bad need of that as well. A lot of it is also HIMARS artillery rockets, which the Ukrainians have said have been very effective, especially trying to fend the Russians off in the northeast of the country. Now, the other part of this assistance package that is gear -- that the U.S. is going to acquire directly from U.S. defense companies. A lot of that also is going to be air defense. The U.S. has been saying that it's going to prioritize air defense weapons going to Ukraine, especially of course, the JASSM system, which is a medium-range system, but also the Patriot system, which is a long-range surface-to-air missile system that is really important for the Ukrainians, not just to fend off missiles flying at their cities, but also to try and stop the Russian Air Force from bombing Ukrainian frontline troops. All of this comes as the Ukrainians say that they've been managing to stabilize the frontline in many areas. However, there's one particular area in the Donetsk region called Chasiv Yar, where the Russians have said that they have made some gains towards a very key town. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, Berlin.

Sources say U.S. President Joe Biden told Democratic governorsduring a meeting that part of his plan going forward is to stop scheduling events after 8:00 p.m. so that I can get more sleep. Sources tell CNN that comment left several of the governors in the room frustrated. Now, President Biden plans to spend part of this Independence Day holiday in the U.S. with family members who will be critical in deciding whether or not he continues his re-election bid. Publicly, Mr. Biden remains defiant getting the backing of a group of those Democratic governors who met with him at the White House, but there are those from within his own party questioning the president's mental fitness and calling for him to drop out following his poor debate performance last week. Dr. Sandra Weintraub is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University at Mesulam. Now, that is the Mesulam Center for Cognitive, Neurology and Alzheimer's Disease. And I thank you for joining us today. As we all try and parse, you know, some of the latest developments here, we are not going to try and get into a situation where we're trying to diagnose the president. What is happening, though, is that for millions of people around the world, they recognize what happened during that debate, either in themselves or in loved ones. So, I want to start from where you would want to start, and that's what the research tells us. You know, you say that any kind of cognitive issue is a matter of age, biology, and luck. Can you explain that? SANDRA WEINTRAUB, PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES, NORTHWESTERN FEINBERG SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND MESULAM CENTER FOR COGNITIVE NEUROLOGY AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASES:  Sure. Age is the greatest risk factor for cognitive decline. However, as people get older, we know that there are great differences in the way that people age. And so, most of the research that's been done talks about average aging. But as you go up the age scale, when you get into 80-year-olds, you're -- you have a lot more divergence. So that there are some people in their 80s that are thinking as well as they did when they were 20 and others that are not doing as well. We don't really understand why age is such a factor in this, but that's how it is. And, of course, luck has to do with where you land up on this curve.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETE MUNTEAN, CNN AVIATION CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  If Everett, Washington is a Boeing company town, then Merle Meyers was a company man. A 30-year veteran of Boeing, Meyers says his job as a quality control manager put his kids through college. It is a family tradition. His late mother was a Boeing inspector, able to unilaterally decide if a new airplane just off the factory line was fit to fly.",

This is his first TV interview inspired by the January 5th door plug blowout on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX 9. Spray painted red, bad parts deemed not up to Boeing's standards are taken from Boeing's Everett plant and sent to its scrap facility in Auburn. But then one day in 2015, Meyers says a crate of bad parts were improperly sent back from Auburn to Boeing's Everett factory. Meyers alleges the practice continued for years, telling that more than 50,000 parts escaped Boeing quality control.",

We're looking at expected temperatures of over 105, 110 degrees for several days in a row. And then, on top of it, just this fire that's raging up there. It's all a bad mix of circumstances. And that is why they're really asking people to stay vigilant. We have thousands of people, like some 12,000 people in and around Oroville where this fire is burning, asking them to stay evacuated while they're battling this. They're also saying there's some 12,000 structures that are threatened. We already saw yesterday, when we were up there, we saw at least two homes that were burned. They said so far four structures have been lost in this fire. And part of what is at issue here is we've had two wet winters, and I know that that sounds like that means things should be better. But I want you to take a listen to an official from Cal Fire explain why that is actually part of the problem. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And in lots of California, they're not even legal, but in some places they are. But officials are saying to people don't spark them at all because it can happen so quickly that that will spark a wildfire, so they don't want people to play around, especially in this heat. And this heat is deadly. We've already seen some people lose their lives. The National Weather Service out here saying that this is a lethal heat wave that we're experiencing here, and it is rivaling the worst heat waves that we've seen in the last 18 years.
