It is an incredibly important turning point in this war since Hamas invaded parts of Israel, slaughtered so many people, took so many hostages, and in the aftermath since Israel went to war against Hamas, and has caused so many civilian casualties and what international officials say starvation and famine also imposed.So, these form the basis of the ICC charges and they are now seeking warrants, seeking arrest warrants that will have to be approved by a panel of independent judges here. I am at the ICC based on these things that I told you. And here are the crimes. There are some eight crimes, charges alleged on both sides starting with Hamas because of the timeline, obviously, October 7th was what Hamas did Here's what they what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, put this aside, although not the war in the Middle East, but put this event aside. Let's just be totally clear, the Iranian president is and works at the behest of what they call the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and more and more of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. So, the Iranian president is not an independent actor.This particular, therefore, not much is expected to change in terms of style of leadership and in terms of the direction of the Iranian regime. The foreign minister also was killed, along with others in that helicopter crash. They will apparently have emergency elections in some 50 days. We assume that much of Iran's focus will be internal right now as it tries to deal with this. Let's not forget that Ebrahim Raisi, the president, is one of the most hard line leaders in recent Iranian history. He is known not just for the crackdown on the protests against the death of Mahsa Amini, and the real grassroots protests all across Iran for months by people who just wanted freedom and democracy, women who wanted to dress the way they wanted to dress. He is known for that. That's his most recent legacy. Before that, years ago, he was part of a judicial panel that signed off on death warrants of some 5,000 so called Iranian dissidents after the Iran-Iraq war. He has been the vanguard of hard line politics following the Iranian supreme leader for decades. It is true that the United States and Iran were trying to deescalate tensions right now, certainly try to prevent a wider war, given what's going on between Israel and Hamas and the surrounding nations. The IAEA, the U.N. nuclear agency, said last week that there was some indications that Iran may be going back into a more strict observation of their nuclear program, which has escalated since Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal. So, all of that is going on. And then the last thing Raisi did really, he was at the helm when there was the tit-for-tat military open conflict between Israel and Hamas last -- sorry, Israel and Iran last month.",

CNN was first to report Christiane Amanpour on the ground that the International Criminal Court is seeking arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as well as another Israeli leader, and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, and a few other Hamas leaders, and this is on charges stemming from obviously the invasion into Israel and then the Israeli response.CNN's Jeremy Diamond is live in Jerusalem.

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, we've reached out to the White House. We've reached out to the State Department and still are awaiting reaction, but we likely will at some point receive a very strong response from the U.S. Top U.S. officials here at the White House and State Department have repeatedly expressed their opposition to this ICC investigation. They've done so from the podium with Karine Jean-Pierre and over at the State Department with Matt Miller, saying that the U.S. does not believe that the ICC has jurisdiction. So, we will see how exactly the U.S. decides to respond as the ICC is moving forward with targeting for the very first time a top ally of the United States.Now, this does come as you note, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan was in Israel yesterday and today, meeting with Netanyahu and also just hours ago sitting down to meet with Gallant. One of the main topics of their conversation was the potential operation into Rafah at a time when the U.S. has repeatedly been trying to warn Israel against going into Rafah in a major way without a plan in place to secure the safety and evacuation of the civilians on the ground there. Now, President Biden currently is up at his home in Wilmington, Delaware. He will be traveling back to the White House this afternoon. And we anticipate hearing from him for the very first time when he speaks at a Jewish American Heritage celebration here at the White House, which will also be attended by the second gentleman, Doug Emhoff. But all of this comes as the U.S. has repeatedly been saying that they are opposed to this ICC investigation, but while it has very wide ranging global implications, this also could have additional political ramifications for President Biden. There is still a lot of angst, especially among young voters of the U.S.'s continued support for Israel as it's waged its campaign. So, this is something that could also factor into the politics of this moment as we are still awaiting the U.S. response to this decision from the ICC.",

One of the big questions today, can prosecutors overcome the hit to Cohen's credibility during cross-examination? During that cross last week, the defense used Cohen's own text messages against him, hoping to point to inconsistencies for the jury in his story.Adding to the drama this week, still unclear what the defense case looks like if Donald Trump will take the stand in his own defense. CNN's Brynn Gingras is joining us now. Brynn, you know, Cohen's cross- examination resumes this morning, so more of a grilling. What can we expect throughout the day?",
