The First Lady, Jill Biden, is set to attend as police reveal the shooter may have had weapons training.Also tonight, we've learned that the New York grand jury investigating Donald Trump will take a break for most of April. How might that impact a decision on whether to indict the former president? And the crisis unfolding in Israel right now is testing relations big time with the United States. We're tracking the tensions after President Biden criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's divisive judicial overall plan. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. And let's go right to Nashville right now where mourners are gathering to honor the three children and three adults shot dead at the Covenant Elementary School there. CNN's Carlos Suarez is joining us right now. He's just outside the school. Carlos, this vigil is being held tonight as police say they are deep into the shooting investigation. Give us the latest.",

The Chief of Police tells CNN that detectives they are still going through this notebook that the 28-year-old shooter left behind. They are looking at some statements and some writings in there, all in an effort to try to see if they can come up with a motive for this shooting.Police officials also tell us that they believe that the shooter received some weapons training. It's something that they had hinted at earlier in the week when they described how the shooter took aim at officers from a window on the second story of this school building where this shooting happened. Officials also told CNN that detectives are looking into whether or not the shooter made a stop between leaving the shooter's home and this school. Now, in some of my reporting yesterday, we were able to confirm with the city's police chief that a mall was mentioned in some of these writings and in some of these statements. And so, again, detectives are now looking at the possibility that the shooter may have gone to one place before coming to the school. We're also hearing from an art instructor, a teacher who knew the shooter back in 2017, taught the shooter two semesters. The teacher described to us an encounter that she had in the classroom where the shooter became very frustrated with a task. Here's what she told us just a few minutes ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARIA COLOMY, HALE'S FORMER TEACHER: She didn't know what it was asking for and she got really flustered, and she just like turned red, started crying. And I could see that she was getting upset, and I just said, hey, if you need to step out -- (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I think we see time and time again in a lot of these high profile mass shootings that there were incidents, there were markers before the incident that could have been taken as a red flag and something could have been done about it. But so often we see that either the infrastructure doesn't exist, and in states where there are red flag laws, sometimes people don't know about them or are scared to pursue them.

So things are still very fluid. So, right now, they're not expected to hear anything. They could, the D.A.'s office if they want to, could even ask them to move forward and vote on an indictment against the former president. But as of right now, things are very fluid.

You had that witness, Robert Costello, go in. You had a rebuttal witness come in the form of David Pecker. You know, as well as I do that these holidays pass over Easter spring break. Those can be disruptive to the calendar in New York.

Everything is fine.But he did chide the United States, saying that a democracy should let other democracies figure it out, but still trying to say, everything is fine, this isn't a crisis. But still, at the end of the day, Benjamin Netanyahu has not received an invitation to go to the White House. It doesn't seem as though one is coming anytime soon. And the opposition leaders are really going after Netanyahu. Yair Lapid, the former prime minister, now opposition leader, tweeting, \"For decades, Israel was the USA's closest ally.

And that's a problem because people don't know it's there or they're too embarrassed to ask for it.What's going to happen soon is that it'll be available just over the counter, just right there on the shelf next to the shampoo or next to the aspirin. It'll be just right out there. Let's take a look at why this is so important. If you take a look at this graph, these are opioid deaths from 1999 until 2021. As you can see, they have just skyrocketed. In 2021, there were more than 80,000 opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. If you look from 1999 to 2016, about 9,000 children and teens died from opioid overdoses. So Wolf, the two questions that remain is, one, why didn't they do this sooner? People were calling for this to be done years ago. And two, what will the cost be? If the cost is high, even though it's over the counter, many people won't be able to buy it. Wolf?",

You know, just think of how much disdain he had shown the judiciary from the start. Even when he was running for president, he tried to deride a judge as a Mexican judge.And then he had that unprecedented clash with the president over the chief justice, over Obama judges. So he was always putting pressure on the Supreme Court. And Chief Justice John Roberts responded to that. He did not want the Supreme Court to look as polarized as the other two branches were. So he worked behind the scenes to try to minimize the five, four rulings that would pit the Republican appointees against the Democratic appointees. He tried to provide off ramps for cases. When I went back and reexamined cases, tried to deconstruct what went on behind the scenes, I could see how much the chief was maneuvering to offset the pressure from the Trump effect. And he was able to do that. He was able to do that up until late 2020, when all of a sudden, we had a supermajority with the departure -- the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the addition of Amy Coney Barrett. Until then, he really could control everything and try to counteract the Trump effect. That era is over, Wolf.",

They don't even have a clear majority yet. And I don't think we're going to see a formal ethics code for a while because they're so divided.",
