      "sentences": "And again, we're being careful to speculate about whether this was an intentional or accidental impact.And you did talk about sort of the follow-on effects, but when they're trying to figure out actually how this occurred, what sort of data tends to be available in these investigations? I mean, are they looking at computers on the ship? What do you know or what can you kind of tell us in terms of what sort of information threads are available for them to pull on beyond just obviously, of course, interviewing the individuals who were in charge of piloting the ship? ANDREW MCCABE, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, FORMER FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR (via Skype):  Sure. So a lot of that depends, Kasie, on how -- you know, on the details of the ship. How old it is. What sort of technology it's equipped with. So that's going to really set the table in terms of what sort of information or data you have to work with. But you can imagine the entire kind of scope of GPS data and systems data that really will show you exactly when the ship was last kind of put on the course that brought it to impacting that column. The number of people who were involved in piloting the ship at the time. The sort of inputs that those folks were delivering into the systems to steer the ship. There is -- that can very greatly -- if this, like, a really old vessel that's in a state of disrepair and hasn't been kind of updated, that data could be pretty rudimentary. But any sort of inputs that go into that system -- if it's on a set course that had been planned out sometime before, it looks less likely that someone at the last second took it off course and into that column. So those are -- those are kind of some of the systems that they'll be looking for to see if they even exist on the boat before they find out what sort of data that they have in this situation. But again, those people who are at the controls of the systems are going to be your best resource, and what they really need right now is some cooperation and some kind of really solid interview feedback from those folks.",

I'm so very -- we're very grateful to have you on this, Andy, just because -- I mean, the -- your knowledge of simply the capabilities that these agencies have at their disposal as we try to investigate this. Really fascinating. Please stand by because we're going to continue this conversation through the hour.I do want to bring in our meteorologist Derek Van Dam because Derek, obviously, the weather conditions are a very important component of something like this -- both questions about whether visibility may have been impaired for the ship as it was trying to navigate the harbor and also, of course, the temperature of the water there. We know that there are divers in the water trying to rescue -- what we last knew as about -- of about an hour ago that there were 20 people that they were trying to rescue in the water. And, of course, multiple vehicles as well What can you tell us about the conditions there for the people who are victims of what happened here as well as first responders?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, this is, Kasie, a critical moment in time for the search and rescue operation not only because of the water temperatures but the surrounding air temperature as well. So impacting not only the search and rescue operation but the potential of people still underwater or within the water conditions there.So the closest water gauge that we could find at the Patapsco River is roughly 48 degrees. That's a water temperature of 48 degrees. Air temp roughly 43 degrees. So air colder than water. Now, a water temperature of roughly 50 doesn't sound all that cold but, indeed, that type of water temperature can be deadly. Remember, cold water drains body heat about four times faster than cold air actually can. And when we get down to the important timing and what really matters right now is this cold water survivability. How long can the human body sustain these types of water temperatures assuming that there are people in the water from this collapsed bridge? And I showed you that we have water temperatures there roughly about 48 degrees. So you look at this and our gauge here showing about a one to three-hour window, give or take an hour or so, of how long that body can sustain water temperatures of that temperature. So that is why it is so incredibly crucial what's happening underwater with those divers getting in there as soon as they did. We're about four hours on since the bridge collapsed at roughly 1:30 in the morning. Remember, cold shock and hypothermia are a concern. When the body enters cold water in water temperatures of roughly 48 to 50 degrees without any kind of protection, your heart rate increases. Your changing and breathing increases. And even your blood pressure changes as well. So that's the type of psychological impacts to your body as we impact -- or feel the impacts of cold water and cold water shock. Now, in terms of visibility for this boat, we checked just moments prior to 1:30 and there was 10-mile visibility recorded. That is the clearest possible conditions that any kind of weather observation network could potentially report. So we don't see any concerns with visibility even though there have been some discussions about the potential of visibility problems on the ground. And we've talked about the air temperature at 43 degrees. The good news is for this search and rescue operation is the radar is dry around Baltimore and the bridge and you can see the rain is well off to the west. We don't see that to be a concern until tomorrow. But when we talk about the surge of water that is impacting this area we do have a coastal flood warning for this surrounding region, including the Patapsco River area, Baltimore, the nation's capital, and through the Del Marva Peninsula minor coastal flooding and dangerous rip currents that need to be taken into factor throughout this search and rescue operation, Kasie. So much weather and impacts here to unpack. But, really, water temperature is 48 degrees and we have this narrow window of time when it is so crucially important to get to those potential survivors there from this bridge collapse, Kasie.",

It seemed the skill that it would take to directly impact a column seems to be like far greater than the skill it would take to avoid it as the -- as you compare the difference in the spaces.We don't want to suggest that this was an intentional act but it's, of course, something that the investigators on the ground who are trying to understand how this horrible disaster took place are going to want to consider. And, of course, the place you start with that is the boat itself. It's a Singapore-flagged vessel -- which, in and of itself, doesn't really tell us very much. The way that international shipping is conducted, boats are flagged in all sorts of different places. The name of the boat is the Dali. As you can see from those photographs, it's a pretty large container ship which, again, is very typical traffic for this area. There is, of course, the massive port of Baltimore where a ton of products and material and stuff is all floated off of ships exactly like this every single day of the year. So this is a heavily trafficked commercial shipping area, which only increases your questions about, like, so why did it happen to this ship when so many ships pass through that same space safely probably hundreds of times a day? I can't do the math on -- off the top of my head here but it's a lot, right? This is, like, unbelievably --",

      "sentences": "-- uncommon.So they're going to want to start by talking to those folks on the boat to understand the complete timeline of who was on the boat? Who was in what positions? Who was actually piloting the boat? Who had access to the controls that could have steered or directed the vessel? Where those folks were from. What their backgrounds are -- their training, experience. Whether or not they've been involved in any prior incidents on this boat or any other boats that they were -- they have been deployed upon. They're going to want to know about their conduct leading up to the event. Whether or not folks have had the required amount of rest. How long they have been working. When they'd had their last meal. Whether or not they'd ingested any sorts of potentially altering substances -- like medications, or alcohol, or illicit narcotics. And again, there is absolutely no indication right now. We're not working on any information that would indicate that was the case. But these are the sorts of generalized questions that investigators are going to be asking to get an understanding of, like, what was happening on that boat in the moments leading up to this -- to this event. And then, as we discussed earlier, there's a whole array of technical questions. Understand the service record of this vessel. The last time it was maintained. Whether or not it has ever had any issues in the past relating to its control or direction. They're going to be looking to see if there are GPS-enabled devices and monitors on that ship to get more granularity about how and when it was last adjusted and in terms of its course. Was this something that happened suddenly as they approached the bridge or was it a -- or was it an errant course that they had been set upon some minutes or even hours before? So there's just really a universe of mechanical and then more human- related questions that they're going to be going into those interviews with. I'm seeing some reporting online that indicates that the company that owns the vessel has been contacted and is being cooperative, and that's really the biggest hurdle as you try to start an investigation over something like this.",
