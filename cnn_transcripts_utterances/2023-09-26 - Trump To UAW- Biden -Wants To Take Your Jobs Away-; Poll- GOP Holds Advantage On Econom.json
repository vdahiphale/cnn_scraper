      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, in minutes, something we have never seen before from any sitting U.S. president. Joe Biden stands shoulder to shoulder with picketers on the frontline of a strike against Detroit's Big Three. His team hopes to show the sign of solidarity with unions and hope that will pay dividends for workers and also for his own roadmap back to the White House.Plus, the Dem breaks. At least a dozen Democratic senators say Bob Menendez should quit, including his fellow senator from New Jersey, Cory Booker and lawmakers from swing states who face tough battles to keep their own jobs. And the lineup is locked in. Tomorrow seven Republicans clash on a California debate stage. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, history in Detroit. This hour, Air Force One will land in Michigan where the president will head to the picket line, auto workers are in the middle of a very big fight over pay and whether they get a bigger piece of record corporate profits. Joe Biden is fighting a war of his own to against a familiar foe Donald Trump. Detroit is now the stage for a 2024 contrast between the two men and their two very different visions for America. CNN's Arlette Saenz is in Wayne, Michigan. Arlette, what do we know right now? Is the president on his way to where you are and what do we expect him to actually do on the picket line?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, President Biden is expected to land here in Michigan in the next hour as he's looking to offer that show of support for those striking union workers.Now the White House has yet to detail exactly where President Biden will visit. But he is expected to visit a picket line here in Wayne County, where he will also appear with the UAW President Shawn Fain. Fain had extended this invitation to President Biden to come to a picket line. Just last week, the president decided to go ahead and accept that. But it comes at an important moment, as the UAW has refrained from endorsing in this presidential election, many of the labor groups have already backed Biden, but this is one of those endorsements he is still trying to secure. And it comes as the White House has really walked a very careful line when it comes to these negotiations between the UAW and these Big Three automakers. The White House doesn't have any legal authority to be involved in these negotiations. So, they've been very careful with what they have been able to say. President Biden has been out there, saying that he supports these auto workers that he believes that the record profits that auto companies are earning at this moment should be shared with those workers. But the White House has stopped short of weighing on in on the specific demands that the UAW has been making. Now, all of this is playing out as part of the president's core mission here is appealing to those working-class voters. And it comes as there is about to be a remarkable split screen in the 2024 race playing out here in Michigan over the next two days. Biden is here today. Former President Donald Trump will be here tomorrow to talk to union workers himself gathering a group together. The White House says that this trip is not about Trump. They didn't plan this because Trump was coming here, and then said they are focused on showing support for their workers. But it does signal some of the fights that could be brewing as the 2024 election. He sat between President Biden and potentially former President Donald Trump.",

He wants to take your jobs away and give them to China and other foreign countries shout out to your union leadership to endorse Donald J. Trump, I will keep your jobs and make you rich. Margaret?MARGARET HOOVER, HOST, PBS \"FIRING LINE\": There's a reason Donald Trump is going straight to Michigan and not even bothering to go to California to compete for the Republican contest. I mean, he's making a robust argument to the people who helped get him to the White House in the first place, that even if the jobs market is coming back, and even if rather the auto market and jobs in the auto market is coming back, it is still bigger in China. And if you want to keep with the same policy, stick with Joe Biden. He's just turning into a rally. And if you want a Republican who's going to fight for workers, which is what the Republican Party has come to represent amongst the base of the party that supports Trump. That's a winning message for him. Because the facts are an aside. The China auto market is bigger than the American auto market. And this is crux and this is sort of central to the issue. COLEMAN HUGHES, CONVERSATIONS w/COLEMAN PODCAST: Yes. So, it may be very good politics to tell people, we're going to bring manufacturing back to America. But when you ask economists what actually happens when you institute tariffs, they're fairly unanimous in saying, you know, industries that have gone to Mexico, gone to China, you can't just bring them back by instituting a tariff. What that actually does is it increases prices for consumers at home without actually bringing those industries back. So, what you end up with is a lose, lose in reality, although it may be a nice message.",

      "sentences": "Yes. And that that's maybe definitely true when you're talking about in the short-term about trade. But when it comes to, this is Inside Politics, when it comes to the workers who are striking. And the workers slash voters who are striking, not just in Michigan, but elsewhere.Let's just sort of stick with -- well, let's just talk broadly about the question. This just was asked in an NBC News poll that came out over the weekend, which party would do a better job for the economy among Dems and Republicans, middle class and the GOP, excuse me, Dems and Republicans? Look at that. The Republicans are about even with Democrats when it comes to the middle class, and way ahead when it comes to the economy. SHANE GOLDMACHER, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES: I mean, that's a pie chart. That's a big red flag for Democrats getting into the next election. And I think when you look at the two visits, it really speaks to both how President Biden and former President Trump want to be portraying themselves. For Biden, being a pro union Democrat is basically a non-negotiable, like it, given a set of choices politically, throughout his career, he has wanted to appear a working-class Democrat. As part of his image, you know, the fact that he was from Scranton, he brings up on a regular basis. He's ties back to Pennsylvania. And so yes, on the specifics of whether the workers should get the 40 percent raise that they're asking for, he hasn't necessarily gone all in on the specifics, but he wants to be there. And for Trump, it's the same thing, right? This is the place that helped send him to the White House. It was voters who are working class in Michigan, and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania that broke what had been a blue wall. And he is saying, I'm the guy who can go win them back. And yes, he's going to skip that debate in California with the rest of these people. I want to talk about Joe Biden because that's who I'm going to really be running.",

The story here, it would not be a story if Donald Trump were not a figure right now in the Republican Party, a very looming figure and potentially Joe Biden's Republican rival. You mentioned how things shook out in Michigan and Wisconsin, certainly he did very well, but didn't win with union households in Michigan and in Wisconsin.But let's look at what happened with Joe Biden. In Michigan, he got 62 percent of union households, and in Wisconsin 59 percent. Again, that was up from what Hillary Clinton got. And guess what, Joe Biden won Michigan and Wisconsin, Hillary Clinton did not in 2016. That tells the political story of why we're saying what we're seeing.",

Let me just zero in if I may on Wayne County, which is where the president is going. As we speak, we'll be there very soon.Again, Joe Biden got 68.4 percent there. I mean, he really cleaned Donald Trump's clock in Wayne County. For Joe Biden to win again, he needs those numbers and the enthusiasm to stay high like that, because this is part of the blue wall. And the blue wall keeps Democrats in the White House and when it crumbles like in 2016, Republicans win.",

One of them as of, about an hour ago is his fellow New Jersey Senator Cory Booker. Menendez is facing corruption charges including allegations that he used his influence to help the government of Egypt in exchange for cash and gold bars.My panel is back with me. Let me just read this Cory Booker statement, at least part of it. He said, \"Senator Menendez fiercely asserts his innocence and it is therefore understandable that he believes stepping down is patently unfair. But I believe this is a mistake.\" We were talking about how significant this is for his fellow senator to do this from New Jersey. GOLDMACHER: Yes. This has come really quick, right? You saw even at the beginning of today, a handful of the senators who are invulnerable seats up in 2024, lead the way you're saying. I think he should step down in Montana, earlier in Ohio, in Nevada, in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. And that matters politically for the party, but for Menendez's seatmate from New Jersey and for the person who stood by him when he was indicted before to say now it's time to go. Look, they can't force him out. But this is about as much political pressures he's going to face from that sort of people simultaneously calling for him to step down.",

He said something along the lines of we're going to see what happens with that. My sense and it's not just my guess, it just in talking to some Democrats from New Jersey is that part of what we're seeing here.

This is Tom Cotton, who tweeted the charges against Senator Menendez are serious and troubling. At the same time, the Department of Justice has a troubling record of failure and corruption in these cases against public failures from Ted Stevens to Bob McDonnell to Donald Trump to Bob Menendez, the last time around.
