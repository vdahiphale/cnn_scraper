First of all, the scope of the conspiracy that she alleges here and, remember, Special Counsel Jack Smith, he made a decision to focus, at least in his initial set of charges, on one man, on former President Trump. And while he lists other co-conspirators, he did not charge anyone else.But here, the former president is charged alongside 18 other people, including some of his closest advisers, like former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani is, of course, referenced in the special counsel's indictment. He is co-conspirator 1, but he was not formally charged. And Mark Meadows was hardly mentioned at all in the special counsel indictment, but he features prominently here, which, of course, makes sense because the January 6th committee concluded that when it comes to the alleged conspiracy, all roads run through Mark Meadows. Now, Sasa, it's interesting. We also got to hear from one of the witness who testified yesterday. Former Democratic State Senator Jen Jordan explained how she sees the comparison between the federal and state prosecutions. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FMR. STATE SEN. JEN JORDAN (D-GA):  I was there to really kind of set the scene and kind of begin the story, because, really, from my perspective, what happened in Georgia was just the implementation of the overall plan at the federal level. So, if you look at Georgia and then look the at the federal indictment, everything that they wanted to do or plan to do, they were actually doing on the ground in this state. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's take a closer look at the legal troubles that Donald Trump is now a facing by the numbers.As mentioned, 19 people are charged here, all in a sweeping 98-page indictment. That includes 41 criminal counts. And in those pages, District Attorney Fani Willis outlined 161 discreet acts that the defendants allegedly committed. As for the defendants facing the most charges, that is Donald Trump and Rudy Giuliani, each now facing 13 charges a piece. Those charges bring Trump's total count of criminal charges to 91 charges that spanned four separate indictments in four months, one for hush money payments, two under Special Counsel Jack Smith, and now this one in Georgia, which brings us to the number 17, as CNN's Stephen Collinson wrote very well today, in 17 months, GOP front runner Donald Trump could be raising his right hand as the 47th president and swearing to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution he was accused of plotting to shred.

In order to be charged with racketeering, prosecutors will -- to charge someone with racketeering, prosecutors will allege, in effect, a criminal enterprise that engages in a series of acts all toward one criminal goal.Now, each of those acts doesn't themselves have to be crimes, but they are sort of helping to further the conspiracy. What the state of Georgia says here is that Trump and other individuals around him engaged in a series of acts designed or directed at undermining the election of 2020 in an illegal manner. It's sweeping, it's broad, but the law does allow it and it's not -- RICO cases are not limited to just organized crime or criminal mafia enterprises.",

So, although I would like to see the case stay in state court, I think there's a very good chance this case is going to be moved to federal court.And there's another.

You establish that it was filed and then you establish that the person knew that what they were doing was a lie. It's relatively straight forward.So, yes, it's all going to vary and it's all going to depend on, number one, what prosecutors have, but, number two, what they can actually get into court.

Unlike the other cases, race is going to play a central role in this case, in all kinds of ways. We all know Donald Trump is probably a little more sensitive to black woman than he is to other people. And the Fulton County jury pool is going to be largely African-American, if it stays here. So, I do think there's an undercurrent of race in this case, and especially given that it's Georgia that's going to make it different than the other three cases.I do expect some of those witnesses to turn and to testify against the ex-president.",

We should not poo-poo the fact that once you get past these questions of whether somebody goes to jail, there are still serious consequences that can come to some of these people who have been attorneys for 20 or 30 years.

His attorney, his Florida-based attorney was with him in court, and they waived the formal reading of the indictment, and they asked for a trial by a jury.The-56 year-old is being accused of scheming with former President Donald Trump to try and delete surveillance video from Trump's Mar-a- Lago property that was sought by investigators in the Trump classified documents case. Now, according to prosecutors, De Oliveira asked another Trump staffer, someone who works in I.T., about purging the video servers after investigators paid a visit to the property back in 2022 to retrieve these classified documents. The indictment, you might recall, alleges that the 56-year-old told this I.T. staffer, quote, the boss wants the server deleted. Again, he is facing four charges, including lying to the FBI about helping to move some of these boxes around Mar-a-Lago that contain these classified documents. He left the federal courthouse here in Fort Pierce just a few minutes ago with his attorney. Again, this arraignment was relatively quick. It lasted about five to six minutes. He entered a not guilty plea. The judge told his attorney that in the next couple of weeks, the discovery process would get underway. And with that, he was allowed to leave the federal courthouse out here. He did not say a word to anyone in the courthouse.
