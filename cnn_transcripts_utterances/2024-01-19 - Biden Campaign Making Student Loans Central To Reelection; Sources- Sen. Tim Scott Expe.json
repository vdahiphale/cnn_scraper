People who have to sell their house or want to sell or have to want to -- want to be relocated cannot do it right now unless they take a loss. It hits every way of life, not just grocery stores, but in all these other major, major expenses that people have. ERIK A., NEVADA TRUMP/BIDEN VOTER: So the real problem is that we don't get to see things on the bottom line of it all. But when we go to the grocery stores, when we go to the gas pumps, we're not seeing those -- we're not -- those -- the savings are coming over to us. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, I'll start with this data point, which is that today is January 19th and the Biden White House hasn't had a single public event at the White House all year. We've seen him out and about in the country for both official White House events and campaign events.And increasingly we are seeing the campaign having him do these sort of smaller stops, you know, ice cream stores, which is like his favorite thing, diners, coffee shops. And, you know, this is campaigning and politics one on one. I'm not suggesting at all. And the Biden campaign isn't either saying that they've sort of like broken the code on this. But I think it is worth underscoring how especially important this is for Biden, the candidate. This is a person, and I know you know this very well, who truly loves being with people, talking to people, connecting with people. This is something that the campaign wants to capitalize on. You know, covering him at the White House, one way in which we try to figure out is everything going to stay on schedule today, is to see if there is an event where Biden has an opportunity to talk to people on the rope line. Whether it's when Marine One is taking off or when he's coming back, whether it's at an event. And if there is an event like that, yes, there's a decent chance that we're going to be late because he loves to talk to every -- he wants to hit up every single person in the room.",

But if there is evidence to support these allegations, well, that calls into question, certainly her judgment in handling one of the most politically sensitive cases in the country, but also will call into question whether Willis and Wade can continue to oversee this case. Now just because they may have this relationship doesn't mean that the charges don't have any merit or that they won't proceed. But if this is true, if a judge finds there is evidence to support these claims, that again might call into question who would be running this.
