Not massive, not as rapidly as they were a few days ago, but they have been resisting counterattacks.But the broader point here is that notwithstanding the claims made by the Russians, as for the Ukrainians concerned, this is two things are going on. First of all, it's the natural ebb and flow of an ongoing battle in an around Bakhmut that isn't necessarily ongoing the Russian way. And secondly, that this could provide ultimately a bridgehead for the Ukrainians if they were to take tactical advantage of what appears to be a Russian victory in the urbanized area of Bakhmut because that has now become, if the Russians are right and there are no Ukrainians there, a free fire zone. They are now arguably in the jaws of a military trap. And maybe that that President Zelenskyy was saying he wouldn't be drawn on in talking about further. More widely I think the Ukrainians are delighted that the -- what President Zelenskyy's called the jet coalition is coalescing around the idea that the United States now is prepared to sanction the export of F-16s to Ukraine to the battle friend and indeed, the training of the Ukrainian pilots in the flying a fourth generation fighter bombers. They won't be in time for the much more -- summer offensively will provide a considerable degree of strategic strength and depth in terms of their capabilities of striking deep behind Russian lines here inside Ukraine, and at the same time, ultimately, helping to protect Ukraine's borders if the Ukrainians are successful in attracting the Russians at some future date.",

So you also have that potential for areas of eastern Washington, portions of western Montana, Idaho, as well as Oregon as these rounds of showers and thunderstorms roll through later today. There will be the potential for some damaging wind and even some large hail for some of these communities. We're talking Spokane all the way down through Boise as we go into the afternoon and also into the evening hours. But again that is really just going to be the focus out into the west. Elsewhere across the country it is warm. You're starting to get that sneak preview of summer in a lot of these places with the exception of down across Florida where we do also have the potential for some showers. The key thing for Florida is it is not just today that is going to be a series of rain showers over the next several days. And when you factor all of that in, you are looking at some pretty high rainfall totals over the next several days. Just through Tuesday, again, you can see most of the area of Florida looking at widespread 2 to 5 inches of rain. Some areas could pick up even as much as 6 or 7 inches of rain when it is all said and done. But not just Florida. Also areas of Alabama and Georgia also looking at repeated showers and thunderstorms across the region, which in turn could also produce, ending up maybe about 2 to 4 inches of rain just over the next three days.
