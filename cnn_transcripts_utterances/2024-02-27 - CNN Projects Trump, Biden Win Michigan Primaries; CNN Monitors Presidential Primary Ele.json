      "sentences": "I want you to take a look at the votes in the Democratic race. It's a warning sign for President Biden there, a protest vote for uncommitted gaining ground.Now, this protest vote pushed by opponents of how President Biden is handling the Israel-Hamas War. Many of them desire a permanent ceasefire and they're demanding that the United States government cut military aid to Israel. Let's take a look at these numbers with 19 percent of the estimated vote in. President Joe Biden, expectingly, has 79.6 percent of the vote. That's a big chunk, 154,576 votes. He's clearly the winner of the night's contest. He has 125,914 votes more than the number two, which is uncommitted with 14.7 percent of the vote, 28,662 votes in the rear, Dean Phillips, congressman, 2.8 percent of the vote. But what I want you to understand is that, normally in a primary, 20,000 people will vote uncommitted. We only have about 20 percent of the vote in. We've already far surpassed that. So, there is going to be a sizable protest vote tonight that the Biden team is going to have to contend with and worry about because in November, it could come down to just a few thousand votes. Remember, Trump won Michigan with only 10,000 votes in 2016. Biden won in 2020 with 154,000. So, that uncommitted, that's an important group of folks. Now, let's look at the Republican side. Donald Trump has scored another decisive win against Nikki Haley. This propels him closer to the Republican presidential nomination with these blockbuster Super Tuesday contests just one week away. So, Trump's dominance is clear, but Haley is arguing that Mr. Trump is failing to unite the Republican Party and she continues to peel away much of the Republican vote. Let's take a look at that. 20 percent of the estimated vote in, Donald Trump, as we expected, is in the lead. He is the projected winner. 66.5 percent of the vote. He has 192,910 votes. That's 109,777 votes ahead of Nikki Haley, who has 28.6 percent of the vote. That's 83,304. But as I noted earlier, it is important to remember the narrow margin of victory in Michigan. Joe Biden, no doubt about it, is going to be targeting these 83,304 people who don't want to vote for Donald Trump, even though he's clearly going to be their nominee. So, let's talk about this all with John King, who is standing at the magic wall. And there's a lot going on here, even though for contests where there are two decisive victories, I have to say, there is a lot going on here.",

The bulk of that is about the Israel-Hamas conflict and the view of Arab-Americans, younger voters and others, liberals, that the president is too quick to side with Netanyahu not doing enough for the Palestinians.The White House would argue, wait, you know, it's a long time since October 7th, pay attention. But here's the -- you know, the president has repair work to do here. It's interesting, the repair work, you look at 15 percent in a key battleground state that tends to, you know, pick our presidents, be one of the two or three to pick our presidents, you say, where's the problem? I would argue, and we're still waiting, by the way, this is the most important part, how high does the number go, how high does the number of votes and the percentage statewide by the end of the night for uncommitted depends on Wayne County and we're nowhere in the count.",

They're not Donald Trump fans.There was one young man we talked about there, he's actually from Georgia, helped the ACLU register voters in 2020 to help Joe Biden win, who said he's going to vote third party. Now he has -- you know, it's easy for people at home, he has socialist leanings, he's way left. People can go, oh, it's just one kid, whatever. He's a socialist. But in a competitive election, every vote counts. You know, people say the same, a lot of Democrats say the same thing about Trump voters, speak of them in disparaging ways. You have one vote, I have one vote, they have one vote. When the elections are closed, that's what matters. But you do see -- that's why this Wayne County vote is so important, because you do see, you know, it's 24 percent now early on. So, the president has some healing to do, and it's very important in the state so close, it will be targeted mostly in the Detroit area and on the college campuses. Doesn't mean it doesn't exist elsewhere, but that's the biggest part of the problem. And, Jake, you see the same exact thing on the other side. The Haley campaign, it's hard to argue with their point tonight. Uncommitted is getting 15 percent right now, and we're saying Joe Biden has some work to do. Well, she's getting 30 percent, and we're saying that's an overwhelming win. Both things are true, both things are true. He has some work to do too. And, again, if you look at the map, where is the work, you come up to some of these rural counties, you just pick one out up here. Donald Trump is getting 77 percent. The rural base of the Trump party is still with Trump. Then you come down to Macomb County here. The blue collar base of the new Trump Republican party is with Donald Trump. But then just drive a little bit, leave Slim Shady and come over here to the suburbs, and look what happens, Nikki Haley gets 30 percent in the suburbs. Donald Trump still has, even as he rolls to the Republican nomination, still has weaknesses in America's suburbs. That's why Joe Biden is president.",

Even before that, we saw some evidence the president had problems with younger voters. And then the other issue is going to be -- Jeff Zeleny spent on several times tonight.

Well, tonight, the Republicans in Macomb County, Michigan, are saying we're still with him, right? That's not a big number. It's still 18 percent. But then you come over here to the suburbs, and it goes to 32. I mean, these people don't live that far from each other. But this is blue collar. This is more upscale suburbs.

And so she has put the stakes incredibly high for her campaign leading into that week. Now, by Super Tuesday, she will have visited 10 states that are going to vote on that day. We're in Utah. That's one of the states she's going to be visiting here tomorrow. And her job is really two-fold as she's out on the campaign trail this week. First, of course, trying to win over those voters. But then second is trying to raise new campaign cash. She had her most successful fundraising month to date in January. But we don't know how much campaign cash her campaign currently has in the bank. It's noteworthy that in the 48 hours since the South Carolina primary, even though she lost it, she was able to haul in two million dollars in new donations. That's what a campaign official tells me. But also this week, Anderson, we should note that the Koch political network, AFP, also decided that they are no longer going to be boosting her campaign. They're going to be focusing on down-ballot candidates instead. So, with those two realities, it is important for her when she's headed to these states, she's going to meet with donors as well to try and get more cash into her campaign bank account in order to fuel her campaign.

So, we have to keep in mind that that is still on the table for probably a large swath of that 30 percent. But as it relates to Nikki Haley and what she's doing, it does strike me just in listening to her tonight and listening to her over the last few weeks, she's making a case for herself. Maybe not in this cycle, but maybe in the next one. She's the last woman standing. She's putting up 30 percent, 40 percent against Donald Trump and doing so in a way that I think she thinks is leaving herself open to the possibility of being able to run when Trump can't be on the ballot again and saying, well, it's just time to turn the page. Look at what I did the last time, because people like Ron DeSantis are not sitting on their hands right now. They're preparing for the next go round.

This is in a primary where there was no drama and no uncertainty, right? And we know Joe Biden is going to be our nominee. So it's a very, very significant outcome. I don't take any joy in it. I hasten to say my idea of this was not that I was going to go out and get people who are otherwise going to come out and vote for the President, to vote uncommitted. My worry was that this primary would happen and the President wouldn't get the message about how mad people are. So, I was saying to all those Arab-American and other Muslim and African-American and young and all these other voters who are so mad at the President about Gaza, don't stay home. Don't stay home.
