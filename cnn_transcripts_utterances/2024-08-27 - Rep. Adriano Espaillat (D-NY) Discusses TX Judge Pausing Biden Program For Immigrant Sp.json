      "sentences": "A Texas judge has paused President Biden's new immigration program meant to help some spouses of American citizens who are in the country illegally. The move puts hundreds of thousands of families in limbo.Biden announced his executive action in June to offer spouses of us citizens without legal status a path to citizenship if they have lived in the U.S. continuously for a decade, do not have a criminal history, and we're married before the program was announced. The program just started taking applications last week. And the judge's pause, which is not the final decision, is in response to a lawsuit by Republican attorneys general in 16 states. It says Biden's action, quote, \"incentivizes illegal immigration and will irreparably harm the plaintiff's states.\" They claim that they're forced to pay for services for immigrants in the country illegally. Joining us now is Democratic Congressman Adriano Espaillat of New York, who is the first formerly undocumented immigrant member of Congress. Congressman, thank you for being with us. What is your reaction to the judge's ruling that pauses this program? REP. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT (D-NY): Thank you, Brianna. Again, this is another attempt by the MAGA-world to block any and all answers to the immigration issue. We saw how they objected to improving security at the border at the Senate level when a piece of legislation that was put together by probably one of the most conservative Senators in the U.S. Congress, yet the MAGA Republicans, the extreme MAGA Republicans, blocked that. Now we see them block a commonsense approach to immigration, allowing 500,000 spouses of U.S. citizens to be able to regularize their status without having to go back home and allowing them to have a work permit and 50,000 children of U.S. citizens. This is, yes, another extreme effort to block any and all answers to the immigration issue because of political reasons.",

That this is not an issue that a winner takes.

These were designed to be the first mission that they've ever flown in space. And in addition, they're just, as you we're saying, Brianna, perhaps looking a bit cooler. They also have some really cool features, like a built-in display in the -- in the visor. And you know, this is going to be something, the first time that any civilians have worn this spacesuit out into the vacuum of space. And even though only two of the astronauts are actually going to venture outside of the spacecraft, all four of them are going to be exposed to the vacuum of space because the spacecraft is literally just going to open up a while. And so they're all just going to be there in space. So super risky. This is admission I'm really excited to watch.",
