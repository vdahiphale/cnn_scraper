The U.S. company revealed on Saturday it conducted its second captive carry test flight of the Stratolaunch Talon A, which was carried aloft by the Spirit of the Mojave, a modified Boeing 747-400. Now, hypersonic weapons are being touted as the next generation of arms. Their speed and ability to evade defenses has made them the focus of increased funding. Now, defense contractors are also, as you can imagine, focusing not just on building these weapons, but developing new systems to detect and defend against them. Stratolaunch says it hopes to complete development of the reusable Talon A sometime this year. And here in the U.S., it's the time for the celebrated award show where only actors vote for their peers to be recognized. The 30th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards got underway in Los Angeles. Saturday, the star-studded ceremony shined a spotlight just ahead of the Oscars. No surprise, you get one guess as to what on best picture. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
