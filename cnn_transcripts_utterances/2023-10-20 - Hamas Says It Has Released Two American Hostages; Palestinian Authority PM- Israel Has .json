Tonight, Hamas has released to American hostages to the Red Cross. The militant group said in a statement that they freed a mother and her daughter \"in response to Qatari efforts.\" We now know their identities, Judith Raanan, and her 17-year-old daughter Natalie Raanan are from Chicago and were visiting relatives at the kibbutz when Hamas attacked. They are now on their way to an Israeli military base where they will be reunited with their family. Becky Anderson joins us now from Jerusalem. Becky, clearly huge relief for those two hostages and of course, for their families, just too many more hostages still being held, but let's talk about that major breakthrough first.",

Well, pro-Palestinian protests have again erupted across the Arab world after Friday prayers. Ambulances took the injured away from a fiery demonstration in the West Bank where I was earlier today. Protesters waved their flags and chanted at the Al-Azhar Mosque in Egypt; in Turkey, demonstrators set an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on fire.

      "sentences": "Look, Becky, we certainly have seen protests on an almost daily basis and they have been intensifying here in Amman over the last three days.We've actually just moved away from the main protest area which is just outside the Al Kaluti Mosque near the Israeli embassy. What we've seen just in the last half hour or so as Jordanian security forces pushing people out. There are still security forces behind us if you can just take a look over there. They are telling protesters to leave this area. And I have to emphasize that for the last two or three days, these demonstrations, these protests in solidarity with the Palestinian people, in opposition to Israel's aerial bombardment of Gaza, have been going on until the early hours of the morning. Now, it has just gone 10:00 PM here in Amman and they are telling people to leave. They are trying to clear the roads. The roads actually have been reopened now and we have seen armored vehicles patrolling the area. But I have to say it has been mostly peaceful throughout, the protests have been peaceful. In fact, while we have seen nightly protests for the last couple of days here in Amman, what we saw this morning after Friday prayers were thousands of people taking to the streets in downtown Amman, marching through the streets. Families, young children draped in traditional Palestinian scarves expressing their solidarity, but it is not just solidarity. There is also palpable anger here in Amman as there is across the region, anger directed towards Israel and the idea of over the mounting civilian deaths on Gaza, the dire humanitarian situation which rights groups say are pushing Gaza to the brink of collapse and a humanitarian catastrophe. But there is also anger being directed towards Israel, the Western allies, namely the United States. We heard protesters this morning chanting that they want the Jordanian government to close down the US and Israeli embassies here in Amman. So you can appreciate the anger that these people feel. This is a cause, an issue which is close to the hearts of many here in Jordan, more than 50 percent of the population are either Palestinian or of Palestinian descent. But as you know, Becky, this is not just happening in Jordan, this is happening as you said across the Middle East and what we have seen is protests really reaching a boiling point as many continue to demand tougher action by the international community, a ceasefire, an end to the siege on Gaza, an end to the airstrikes that we are seeing. [15:15:10] We are anticipating that these protests will only continue, but of course, as you can see, the Jordanian authorities now are taking a much tougher approach to shutting down these demonstrations earlier. But I have to emphasize once again, these have been peaceful protests in solidarity with the Palestinian people. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (voice over): In downtown Amman, worshippers gathered for Friday prayers, but it is not just the call to prayer that has drawn these crowds today. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) (CROWDS chanting in foreign language.) BASHIR (voice over): But a call to action in solidarity with the Palestinian people. (UNIDENTIFIED MALE speaking in foreign language.) BASHIR (voice over): This protest is a pledge, they chant, that the people of Jordan will not leave Gaza alone. Thousands of men, women, and children, entire families draped in the traditional Palestinian scarf, a symbol for many of Palestinian resistance. BASHIR (on camera): Well, you can hear how loud the crowds are here. We've got another day in Amman, thousands of people have taken to the streets protesting against Israel's continued aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip, protesting in solidarity with the Palestinian people. (CROWD chanting in foreign language.) BAYAN ABU GHARBIYA, PROTESTER (through translator): We are doing this for our families who are dying in Gaza because we are unable to do anything. So the least we can do is stand here in solidarity with them, to support them, so that they know that we are with them with our hearts and everything. (CROWD chanting in foreign language.) BASHIR (voice over): There is palpable outrage here in Jordan of Israel's ongoing bombardment of besieged Gaza Strip and deep seated anger directed towards Israel and Israel's Western allies. (CROWD chanting in foreign language.) BASHIR (voice over): Many here even calling on the Jordanian government to close down the US and Israeli embassies in Amman. For days now, protests have taken place not only across Jordan, but also across the wider region. In Cairo, where the state has long clamped down on mass demonstrations, hundreds gathered into Tahrir Square. (CROWD chanting \"We need justice.\") BASHIR (voice over): Hours earlier, the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was forced to cut his visit short after protests erupted there. Gaza has faced relentless Israeli airstrikes for almost two weeks now. (CROWD chanting in foreign language.) BASHIR (voice over): And protests across the Arab world and the wider region are at a boiling point. Iraq, Tunisia, Yemen, and Turkey, and even further afield, and with Gaza on the brink of a humanitarian catastrophe, this protest movement is only growing stronger. (END VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (on camera): Look, Becky, I cannot overstate the significance of the Palestinian cause for many people across the Middle East. Just walking around Amman, we've seen Palestinian flags hanging out of car windows, on balconies, vigils that have been set up for the people of Gaza and this is really something, a sentiment that is shared by almost everyone that we have spoken to here in Amman.",

You know, more than 200, as we understand it, still being held. So, you know, these families will be absolutely, you know, I'm sure thrilled to see the release of these two women, but obviously hoping for more to come. What I was told by a diplomatic source who is was very familiar with what's going on in these negotiations. Originally, we understood that this would be, you know, what Hamas was looking for was a prisoner exchange, it doesn't appear to have been that at this point, those of hostages that Hamas has taken, women and women and children to be exchanged for women and teenagers being held by the Israelis, Palestinians, as of yet. You know, more details perhaps to come. But as things stand, as we understand it, it is just these two Americans, a mother and her 17-year-old daughter, I'm sure the families are thrilled that they are now being reunited with their families. Nic, we are, of course, you've just described what's been going on in the past hours down where you are.

We're told that they're ready when they decide, when the military decides to have an incursion to go into Gaza and I think when we measure Hamas' actions now against what they've done in the past, that prisoner exchanges they've done in the past, they held the Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit for five years, exchanged him for over a thousand Palestinian prisoners.So I think when we see less than one percent of the hostages released now, at a moment, when there was an expectation, Israel was on the verge of an incursion. I mean, I think this begins to set a potential pattern, or at least a system of effort from Hamas, potentially to release a few and then wait some time, maybe release a few more, because the hostages for Hamas represent an opportunity to hold back in Israeli incursion. We don't know if that has happened, but it is beginning to create or may create in coming days that impression further that Israel's hand is being forced by this. Because at one time Hamas had also indicated that they wanted a ceasefire. The UN secretary-general had said hostages for humanitarian aid. We know that there are 219 UN trucks at the Egyptian border, and we understand that there was an agreement for 20 trucks. And President Biden has said that those 20 trucks of humanitarian aid should be able to get into Gaza in the next 24 or 48 hours. I think the US administration was ambitious earlier in the week, and that didn't pan out. We don't know if it'll pan out this time. But all of these things come into play, so where does the Israeli military stand? It seems they're slightly at the moment in hock to the way that Hamas is dealing A., with the hostages and potentially the pressure -- international pressure about humanitarian aid.",

There are just so many complexities, complications that make it really challenging for U.S. officials to even talk about and broach this subject.The intelligence that they're getting, whether it's from the Israelis, whether it's from the Qataris. A lot of the stuff they really just cannot share because so much of it is so sensitive and obviously when it comes to Hamas, they are not sort of the regular sort of group or actor that you can negotiate with.

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, about 40 percent of that death toll is made up of children. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh brings us their story and I have to warn you, some of the images in Jo's report are graphic and you might find them difficult to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Why? Why have you gone my son? He wails. He wanted to be a pilot. You're only sleeping, he says. Kissing his boy's lifeless body. Every day of this war has brought pain. Pain no parent wants to ever live through. Every 15 minutes in Gaza, a child is killed, a group say. More than 1500 children killed so far in a war that's only just beginning. A war they didn't choose. One for which they are paying the heaviest price. Those who live haunted by what they've survived. The lucky ones still have parents to hold their hands. 10-year-old Abdurrahman (ph) still doesn't know the strike that left him injured took away his mom, dad and three sisters. His on the only one left to try and comfort him. He wakes up, he cries, they give him painkillers and he goes back to sleep, she says. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): I'm worried about him. The shock when he wakes up and finds out that his mother and father are gone, his aunt says. He's the youngest. He was so attached to his parents. He used to play football with his dad. He would go with him everywhere. Families here say they all hated the Israeli military's warning and moved south thinking it would be safe. But it wasn't. Malik's (ph) injured in the hips and legs. She lost her mother and siblings in an airstrike. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator): A girl in the third grade. What did she do? Her aunt asks. Did she shoot Israelis? She didn't. We're peaceful people in our home, she says. We didn't launch any rockets or shoot. We didn't do anything. Nine-year-old Mahmoud (ph) was out playing when his family home was hit. He's in hospital with head and leg injuries. MAHMOUD AL-ALOUL, INJURED CHILD (through translator): We were playing in the garden and suddenly a missile landed on us, he says. Trees fell on me. My mother, my father, my brother and grandfather are injured. My uncle brought me unconscious to the hospital. Most of the injured in Gaza doctors say are children and women with no power, no water and medical supplies running out. The health care they need is on the verge of collapse. Around half of Gaza's population are children. Most have only ever known life under a blockade and war. Now in this Kill Box, no play safe from Israel's relentless bombardment. Desperate for any promise of safety, many have flooded Shifa hospital grounds. The constant buzz of military drones overhead has become part of existence in Gaza. Some find a little escape from this living nightmare no child should ever endure. Loujain and Julia say their neighborhood was flattened by airstrikes. LOUJAIN MASABE, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): We've been living in so much fear, panic and anxiety, she says. Whenever I hear airstrikes, I don't know what to do. I hug my mom.",

Reportedly having crossed the river into the Russian-occupied her song region. Ukraine has not officially commented on any cross- river operations but an update to its military staff Thursday notes. Russian aircraft -- airstrikes on the eastern bank suggesting a Ukrainian presence in the area.This comes after Russian military bloggers claimed earlier this week that Ukrainian military units had pushed into multiple eastern bank villages. To give us a better sense now of what's happening, CNN Military Analyst Colonel Cedric Leighton joins us now. Colonel Leighton, good to have you with us. Just so our viewers understand, Russia and Ukraine have been on the standoff on either side of the banks of this river in the Kherson region for what the best part of a year now after Russia withdrew from the west side. If this is true and Ukraine is now on the east side, how important is this in terms of breakthrough? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Julia that's a significant development because what that shows is that the Ukrainians have somewhat of an amphibious capability, at least in terms of their river crossing capability. And that means that the Russian positions on the eastern bank of the Dnipro are not safe. They are basically quite vulnerable too. At least some of the Ukrainian moves. And it also means that the hole that the Russians have in that area in the south in that western part of their land bridge between the Donbas region and Crimea. That is also vulnerable. So, at that point, what you -- we might see, Julia, is the possibility of further Ukrainian advances.",

The trenches. All of those things are definitely present on the eastern bank of Dnipro. A -- they are less extensive in some parts of this area in Kherson than they are in areas further east like in Zaporizhzhia.But they are still there. And it's going to take some time for the Ukrainians to move forward. They are going to have to deal with personnel shortages, trained personnel. I have, you know, basically suffered quite a great deal of losses of attrition. I, you know, during these months of warfare and it is going to be tough going for the Ukrainians. But with the use of ATACMS and other weapons from the West, they may be able to gain a bit more of a foothold on the eastern side.",

And the reason I say that is they've -- the Ukrainians have successfully begun to employ ATACMS missiles against some targets in the southern part of the areas of Ukraine that they're -- that the Russians are occupying. They've also been able to attack some targets in the northern part of Crimea.So, given that very fact indicates that they are using the system effectively. And as they get more used to incorporating the system in -- within their forces that could then result in further movement. And once that happens, I think it'll make some difference in terms of the territory that the Ukrainians can regain, and of course, on the Russian side territory that the Russians are potentially likely to lose.",
