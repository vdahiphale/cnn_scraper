Powerful aftershocks are still ongoing. They're expected to keep happening for days to come. We're getting new dramatic video into CNN we want to share with you, this one showing rescuers digging through the rubble of a collapsed building, scenes like this one playing out all over the island. The quake also triggered massive landslides. Watch this. This is dashcam video capturing clouds of rocks and dust cascading down a mountain. Dashcam video also caught this moment on a highway.

So, in terms of the scale of devastation, like you mentioned, we knowthat at least nine people have been confirmed dead and more than 900 were left injured as a result of this very powerful earthquake and the subsequent aftershocks that have been shaking the island. We also know that, of the nine people who died, all of them were killed in Hualien County on the eastern coast of Taiwan, where, actually, most of the island's earthquakes take place. Now, Hualien County was very close to the epicenter. So that's why we're seeing a significant amount of damage in this part of Taiwan. Now, a bit of context about Hualien County. It's known to be a very popular tourist hot spot. It's known for these gorgeous hikes and a very famous gorge, where actually three out of the nine people who were killed died by fallen rocks. Now, Taiwanese authorities are also telling us that of, in Hualien County, 137 people are still trapped, a majority of them in mining areas. Now, military troops have been deployed. They're also working alongside local governments to try to get those people out and to safety. They have been working since the morning, when this earthquake first happened, throughout the night, Boris.",

Before these storms, this bridge had a roof. You can see now there is no roof to be seen. In fact, some part of it is flung over the side here in this creek bed. Walking over here, we see some of the broken trees. This is what has led to some of the power outages in the region, thousands of people without power in Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia. We have seen creeks like this one that -- with the water rising. The water has begun to go down, but we know that there was also some flooding. And, now, there were two reports -- or two tornado warnings in Adams County, where we are right now, last night. National Weather Service teams are going to be on the ground assessing the damage.

No warnings, at least not at this point, but we could see them, because we do have tornado watches still in effect there. A brand-new tornado watch was just issued just east of D.C. This would be Easton, Maryland, the Eastern Shore, all the way down toward Richmond. You're going to have to watch as that line of weather tries to make an impact there later on today. Now I widen the view for you. And, yes, the white is snow all the way into Illinois, blizzard warnings for parts of the U.P., Michigan, flood watches on the warm side, where there's an awful lot of rainfall, and then obviously the wind event, seeing some slowdowns across the New York City airports because winds gusting over 45 miles per hour. That won't go away any time soon. I put you ahead here to 7:00 tonight, rain and snow kind of mixing in Chicago. There goes the weather off the East Coast, still probably a little stormy in New York City.

REIDto inject the Presidential Records Act into this case, we will likely move to appeal this, take it to an appellate court for review, because they don't believe that this has any place in this case. And it was interesting. They actually revealed some additional evidence that they have gathered in the course of this investigation. And they said, we have evidence of Trump's record-keeping practices in the White House, and there's no indication that he believed that any of this was personal. So the thing is, if they were to appeal any of her decisions here, right, that would likely take months, and that would delay this case. But look, Brianna, as of right now, we're still waiting for her to set a firm trial date. This case was sort of penciled on the calendar for late May. We're in court over a month ago, where both sides weighed in on just how long they would like to see this delayed. Of course, the special counsel wants to move quickly. Trump's team wants to wait as long as possible, in the hopes that he will be reelected, and then he can make both of his federal cases go away. What we're really seeing here right now is, a lot of this is the product of inexperience, this backlog of decisions, even though, in court, when we're with Aileen Cannon, you can see she is making an effort to try to at least appear to be tough on both sides. When you see the things that she is doing, the decisions that she is making, those that she has made, and the requests that she's making of the lawyers,there are a lot of questions about her handling of this case.",

We should hear in the next few days much more about it. They have promised transparency, because I think there's a clear understanding here in Israel of the outrage of the world and the fact that it is linked not just to who these people were and what they were trying to do, but to the Israeli government's repeated assurances that it was doing all it could to protect civilians and aid workers, Brianna.",

However, the Israeli Defense Forces have their own protocols, their own sense of honor. And when you listen to what the spokespeople were saying just before this strike, they were sure that everyone on their team was following the rules. And this incident has revealed to them in a way that sort of rips away the illusions, the same way when the IDF had one unit fire on hostages who were trying to give themselves up. It's a wake-up call that their procedures aren't working. For some of the aid workers, however, they're like, why did it take this? You have lost 177 U.N. aid workers, and there were three attacks on U.N. aid convoys that have also given their information in. I was just on the phone with a U.N. spokesperson about it.
