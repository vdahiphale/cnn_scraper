All the way through the end of the week we're going to start to heat things up, especially across the Southwest. It'll be nice across the North, and the East but the heat will begin to build again. With 50 record highs or more still coming through by the end of the weekend in the places down in across the South. So here we go, Dallas, your air temperature 107. Your normal high should be 97. So yes, it should be hot. But not ten degrees above hot and that's what we're getting here. And we also have to add in that heat and humidity in places are going to feel 114, 115 by the afternoon. And those numbers are always recorded in the shade. So keep that in mind. Here is the cooldown, at least briefly for Vegas, only 96 on Tuesday today. And then for Palm Springs 106. But don't get used to it. This is all because we are seeing these showers in the afternoon. The clouds pop up, a few showers come through, and temperatures are held down. When we don't get showers like we didn't last week at all, temperatures begin to heat back up again. And that's the case again for Phoenix, even though one day of reprieve by the weekend and back into the 116 range for you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The judge in the case saying that murder is the most serious offense, and the most unimaginable type of murder is to have a mother murdering her own children. Vallow Daybell addressed the court, denying having killed her children and citing religious text and beliefs. And she told the court that Jesus Christ knew that no one was murdered in this case, citing accidental death, suicide and fatal side effects from medications. She also went on to say that she had spoken to Jesus, spoken to her children and her husband's first wife after their death. And said they were happy and extremely busy in heaven. In explaining in his sentence, now the judge cited Vallow Daybell's mental health issues, but he also said that she showed no remorse, had not apologized and continues to deny her crimes. The judge saying this, you justified all of this by going down as a bizarre religious rabbit hole and clearly, you're still down there. And before imposing the sentence, the judge also heard a number of emotional victim impact statements. JJ's grandmother broke down in tears and said it was Vallow Daybell's greed and need to be the center of attention that led to these murders. Tammy Daybell's sister also speaking out and saying that this had a huge impact on her life and her family. Telling Vallow Daybell in her statement that she was not a dark person or a zombie -- and this was all referring to the religious beliefs that the indictment said were used to justify the killings. Prosecutors said that the couple believed in a system of rating people as light or as dark. And on Monday the judge did acknowledge that Vallow Daybell had been described as a good mother and had no previous criminal record. But again, said that this was an unimaginable crime, adding that he didn't believe that any God and any religion would want to have this happen. Camila Bernal, CNN, Los Angeles. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
