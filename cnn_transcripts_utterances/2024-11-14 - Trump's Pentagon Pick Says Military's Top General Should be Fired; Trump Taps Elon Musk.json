And the more I shared that, the more people also felt like they could share themselves with me. People that I thought I didn't have anything in common with, we were able to bond and bridge these gaps that otherwise we would have thought were separating us.And again, that brings healing. And what healing brings is hope. And so a message of hope and healing out of something that I've had to experience from the loss of my daughter and then having to survive Alex Jones and his followers, I think is a powerful message that I want people to understand and embrace.",

There are current and former senior military commanders who have described this cabinet pick as ridiculous and a, quote, effing nightmare.What do you make of this decision? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, by resume, Pete Hegseth inarguably is not qualified for the position. We need to thank him for his service to the nation. He's been in combat a couple of times, I think. So good on him for that. But he has been at a tactical level, which is essential. In other words, at the front lines, in direct action, whether it's on his officer record brief or not. But he has been in those positions. When you look at the body of his contributions, he's never led a large organization. He's certainly not been in the D.C. apparatus. And certainly the Department of Defense is a monstrous, huge bureaucracy that doesn't necessarily embrace those that walk in and take over. There will be resistance and hesitation. And so the key ingredient there is to understand where he can provide the best influential leadership to include DOD is doing what needs to be done to meet the president's obligations and the National Security Council's obligations to maintain our security globally. On the surface, you look at that and you go, I don't know that he's got the skills to do that. But let's assume for a second he's a smart guy. He's enthusiastic. He wants to do the right thing. But you have to be a little bit skeptical and dig pretty deep to find those qualifications that would give you confidence that he's going to be the right guy to step up.",

Elon Musk will co-lead what's being called the Department of Government Efficiency, along with fellow Trump supporter Vivek Ramaswamy. For his part, Musk has suggested some $2 trillion in spending could be cut from the federal budget. CNN's Renee Marsh has been looking into this. All right, so, Renee, what would this work -- how could this work, I should say? And what agencies and programs might be on the chopping block?",

But the two men that President-elect Trump has tasked with running it have been pretty vocal and open about what they would like to see. So, here's some of what could be on the chopping block in this effort to cut some $2 trillion in government spending.So, the Department of Education, Trump and Republicans have criticized the agency for, as they say, indoctrinating children with left-wing propaganda. Ramaswamy, on the campaign trail when he was a Republican presidential candidate in 2024, said that he would get rid of 75 percent of the federal workforce. Here's some context. There's some 2.3 million federal workers. So, that would mean about 1.7 million workers slashed. More context for you, nearly more than half of that are federal workers who work at agencies like the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs. Also on the list, eliminating the FBI and reassigning those agents to other agencies and getting rid of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and shifting its duties to other departments. Again, that's some of what they have publicly said that they would like to see. Again, their quest is to trim some $2 trillion in government spending, but we spoke to a lot of budget experts and we said, you know, how possible is this? And across the political spectrum, they said impossible. Because when you look at, you know, what the federal government mostly spends its money on, one expert said this would require cutting one third from every program. And when you look at what the federal government spends on, it's mostly spending to Americans for programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. So, you know, many of these experts are saying, you can't do this without taking away things like healthcare from some Americans.",

RFK Jr., the pick for Health and Human Services Secretary.DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL ANALYST: Well, it seems to be that he fits with a pattern that we've seen this week, which is the hiring of people that are not just unqualified for a particular cabinet post, but unfit. And as we've already, you know, heard in this segment, Mr. Kennedy has already shown over the last 10 years, his penchant for not just promoting unproven ideas, but promoting disproven ideas. He has loudly promoted conspiracy theories, such as the COVID virus being bioengineered to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese. He's promoted the completely disproven concept that vaccines are connected to autism. He's been a loud, not just skeptic, but denier of the safety and efficacy of all vaccines. Most recently, mRNA vaccines, which have been shown to probably have prevented one to two million deaths as a consequence of COVID in the United States. So basically we're putting not just a vaccine denier, but a science skeptic in charge of all of the nation's premier health agencies, FDA, NIH, CMS, the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid. It's literally putting the fox in charge of the hen house.",

He's attributed some of that to all sorts of vague causes related to food and oils. I wonder what kind of impact you think having him as the secretary of HHS could have on just everyday American life.",

And I think that approach is welcome.But his well-documented, very, very loud promotion of theories that cause a great deal of doubt in people's mind about the efficacy of vaccines is incredibly dangerous. If you want to see an example of what happens when you hire a vaccine skeptic into a post like that, just look at Florida. When Ron DeSantis hired Dr. Joseph Ladapo in 2021, someone who was associated with a group called America's Frontline Doctors, a group devoted to vaccine skepticism. When they brought him to Florida in 2021, the rates of vaccinations for kindergartners plummeted over the last three years. So we see what the impact can be on people who are, you know, maybe they're uneducated, maybe they've read things online that concern them. And those kinds of doubts are amplified when it comes to someone with such a large soapbox and a very famous last name. [15:55:04]",
