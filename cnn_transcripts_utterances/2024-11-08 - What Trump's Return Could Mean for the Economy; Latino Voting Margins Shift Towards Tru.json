He's promised much higher tariffs on China. This would cost a typical family about $2,000.He thinks that would be paid by countries overseas, that's totally wrong. It would be paid by American consumers. So again, I don't know if he's going to do these tariffs.

That's also why interest rates have gone up because when you have larger budget deficits, it drives up interest rates.I don't think Congress will pass all $7.75 trillion of what he's proposed, but my guess is it passes maybe more than $5 trillion of it, somewhere between $5 trillion and $7.75 trillion. And yes, ordinary families will pay the cost in terms of higher mortgages, higher inflation. It looks good upfront, but when you look at the full set of effects, they are a problem. BROWN: All right. We'll have to see in practical effect what happens. Jason Furman, thank you so much.

It means that the prosecutors have advanced the investigation and they found enough substance to go in front of a judge and say that they are investigating on these three people. Now the ball falls into the judge and he will have to rule whether these people are indeed -- there is enough substance to move ahead with applying formal charges, which is what we in the United States judiciary system would call simply charges, or if to dismiss. It's too early to say whether these charges are substantiated. However, it's not early to say that the investigation is proceeding. The prosecutor's office say that they have reviewed over 800 hours, Pamela, of CCTV footage from both inside and outside the hotel.

They were interviewed by the police and they said that they didn't see Payne taking substance in the hours that they were spending with him but they admitted that there was some alcohol involved.
