They declare an emergency, and they land. The crew members train for this. They -- it is part of their recurrent training. The planes are designed to fly perfectly well on one engine. As I say, if this was a bird strike, perhaps some of the engine disintegrated and caused damage to the stabilizer. We won't know until we see the data recorder, till we hear the voice recorder, but it is unusual that a bird strike would take down an aircraft on its own.",

According to officials, the attack took place overnight into Wednesday, with explosions reported across the country, including in the northeastern city of Kharkiv, where at least seven missile strikes were reported and six people injured. Ukrainian authorities say Russia launched more than 70 missiles, including ballistic missiles, and more than 100 attack drones, of which 50 missiles and a significant number of drones are said to have been intercepted.However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has confirmed that there were hits with at least one person killed. Zelenskyy said President Putin chose to carry out the attack on Christmas Day, describing Russia's actions as inhumane. Ukraine's energy operator, meanwhile, says it was forced to impose emergency blackouts in several parts of the country. This, of course, comes after a series of attacks by Russia in recent days, including an attack on the capital Kyiv, which was targeted on Friday. Ukraine's largest private energy company said, this marks the 13th time this year that Russia has carried out a major attack on Ukraine's energy sector, leaving the country in a precarious position, as the war grinds into a third winter.

The example that Jesus gave us is timeless and universal. It is to enter the world of those who suffer, to make a difference to their lives and so bring hope where there is despair.As the famous Christmas Carol, 'Once in Royal David's City' reminds us, 'Our Savior holy' came down to Earth from Heaven, lived among 'the poor and mean and lowly' and transformed the lives of those he met through God's 'redeeming love'.

The country's Christian community is celebrating the holiday for the first time since the fall of long-time dictator Bashar al- Assad. They and other minorities have been assured by Syria's new Islamist leaders that they will be free from persecution. But, on Monday, a group of men set fire to a Christmas tree in a Christian majority town near the city of Hama. Protests broke out later in Damascus, and a video surface showing a rebel flanked by Christian priests promising to punish the perpetrators.Now, in the West Bank, the atmosphere in Bethlehem, the biblical birthplace of Jesus, is very subdued again this year amid the war in Gaza. Worshipers gathered at the Church of the Nativity for a midnight mass, but many of the festivities typical of the season have been scaled back in the tomb. Christians in Gaza city celebrated mass at the Latin Church of the Holy Family. The church has served as a shelter for the small religious minority during the current conflict. Rev. Munther Isaac is the pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church in -- Christian Church in Bethlehem, and that's where we go now live. Reverend, really good to have you with us. Thank you so much for taking the time. Two years in a row now we've seen Christmas celebrations really subdued as -- things are going on with the cloud of war right now that is just taking front and center. Tell me about the mood right now in Bethlehem. How are people feeling? REV. MUNTHER ISAAC, PASTOR, EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHRISTMAS CHURCH BETHLEHEM: Yeah. It's actually a mixture of anger and disbelief that this war has lasted as much as it did. We have never thought that this war would last for now more than 14 months, and we are mourning. We're still mourning and in concern for our siblings in Gaza. Many people in our congregations, in our churches here in Bethlehem have relatives in Gaza and are still concerned for their lives, given the severity of the situation there. And so, given all of that, it's hard, really, to celebrate as if things are normal. So, we are mourning, yet defiant in our prayers. Churches this year, like last year, were empty of pilgrims that were full of believers, Palestinian Christians who have been carrying this torch of keeping the Christian witness here in this land. So, we've seen many defiant people coming and insisting that the tradition must continue, although, of course, through prayer only.",

The Israeli government made their plans clear about annexing the West Bank. Since October 7th, we've seen increased restrictions over our movement as Palestinians. Many roads were completely blocked and new gates were added around of our towns. Right now, all it takes is to close two checkpoints outside of Bethlehem, and Bethlehem becomes another Gaza, completely isolated from the world, and we feel this in the rest of the West Bank. Every city has become its own isolation, its own concentration camp, if you wish. And this adds a lot to the sense of fear and isolation.And again, this is why the Christmas message couldn't have been more timely to us, because we need faith to give our people resilience, and the Christmas story gives us truly that message of hope and resilience, as we see in the Holy Family that survived and Jesus out of this difficult situation ultimately brought life to the world.",
