The NYPD says university property is clear just about now three hours after hundreds of officers entered the campus at the university's request.This new video of police clearing Hamilton Hall which is taken over by pro-Palestinian protesters just last night, the doors had been barricaded with chairs and tables and vending machines. flashbangs were used to breach the building according to the police, and police say miraculously that nobody was injured during the operation. CNN on the scene tonight reporting dozens of people have been arrested and also loaded onto buses. And we're learning tonight that the wife of an indicted terrorist was on the campus last week. It was pointed to a post on X by Sami Al-Arian, a former University of South Florida professor who pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiring to provide services to the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in 2006. He posted on X last week showing a photo of his wife on the campus of Columbia University saying quote my wife Nala in solidarity with the brave and very determined Columbia University students. I want to bring in CNN's Miguel Marquez and also Julia Jones. Miguel, you're out with more law enforcement officers in the streets. What are you seeing tonight?",

This is the middle of campus. It is pretty late at night, but it's so quiet. You can hear a pin drop here at this point. The NYPD did definitely jump, the big thing was to clear, insecure camper, trying to walk us to learn at home Olson hall. We have to see what that looks like right now. I'm not sure if we're allowed in. Some students are slowly being allowed back in, like I said to you earlier, are allowed to go back to the focus to school of journalism. Escorted by NYPD back onto campus. The only way to get back on campus at this point, but it is really calm and feel like obviously a lot happened here tonight. There's been a lot of action and there's, you know, this site of NYPD officers on campus. It's something that the Columbia community have to get used to actually. I think they're starting to dismantle the tag (INAUDIBLE) started before about two weeks ago. I don't know if you can see it.

You know, it is his policies that are ostensibly being protested here. And he said very little, and again, this is at a time when he's being criticized by the opposition when some are even comparing this to Charlottesville, which was the reason why he supposedly first ran for president another protest in which a president at the time, you know, equivocated about which side he was on.

Because anytime there's something at a university campus, we can expect that there's a certain recklessness, people who are willing to sort of risk it all. But I think what's been lost really is at the core of what these students are protesting coast to coast. This isn't just happening at Ivy's, why are people organizing? It's not because they're pro Hamas, or they're antisemitic, and they're, of course, those people. But they are very few. I mean, there's bad actors in every movement, right. But these people are largely anti-war and anti-Netanyahu. So what they feel is our taxpayer dollars are going to do this hypocrisy, to give this unfettered support to Netanyahu say, take our weapons, take our money, do what you want. And Netanyahu is brazen, he just knows he'll get a slap on the wrist from Biden, on one hand. And here on the other hand, we're giving billions of dollars in humanitarian aid in Gaza, which is only trickling in for various reasons, as we know. So it's all very complicated. And looking at the politics of the moment, I am just saddened that this is where our country is right now. In an election year, we're so much is on the line for all of us our freedoms, whether you are man, woman, black, white, brown, whatever you identify as, there are a lot of things that have complicated themselves this year, because our leaders have failed us in many ways. So on the one hand, I'm happy to see the students putting democracy in action, because it's far better than apathy. But this painting with a broad brush that Speaker Johnson and congressional Republicans did last week, it saddened me, it was a missed opportunity. They could speak to the future of America. And instead, they were admonishing them saying that they were all part of hate filled speech. Well, it's just simply not true.",

I think it's an important thing to draw these distinctions that you just mentioned. But in essence, you know, I think there's just so much tension and frustration with the status quo being what it's been, this unfettered support we give for Israel, and not everybody subscribes to it the way Nikki Haley paints it out to be that we -- there are only ally in the region, and we have no choice but to give them that support. The students are engaging and have been engaging in what I think is an important critical thinking exercise. But it's gone too far. I've always been a big fan of assembly and nonviolent demonstration, but I also have one for law and order, which is what the vast majority of Americans are for.

However, the lack of communication, the sense of kind of a rash decision behind it, and the lack of transparency over why this decision was made tonight as opposed to another time and why more of the faculty body was not consulted, has left I would say somewhat of a sour taste in the general Columbia community when thinking about Minouche Shafik.",

I think what you saw there Laura was they knew a couple of things going in. They knew one for certain there was going to be no element of surprise. It was in social media, it was on the news that police had been authorized by in writing by the university to retake the building.And I think the considerations that were built into their plans were to bring an overwhelming number of police officers to be able to show that overwhelming number to whatever number of people they confronted outside and then inside that building, which was unknown, to minimize the use of force that they would have to use. And as we see, they made a number of arrests, still trying to get that number. The last we heard from police it was 50 and counting. But we don't have the total yet.",

I mean, what I'm seeing right now is tactical gear, helmets and shields and hand zip ties. And I'm assuming that they would also have weapons on them because they would not necessarily know the level of resistance or if it was armed resistance that they would be in fact encountering. Tell me about the coordination though that it would take to have this many NYPD officers on a college campus. Miguel Marquez says barricading and closing off streets like Broadway and Amsterdam major thoroughfares really in the certain areas, particularly Broadway. What kind of coordination and planning would it have taken to get to this point to have the resistance be as minimal as it seemed to have been?",

The NYPD has been talking to Columbia University literally every day for two weeks about the group that was camped out on the quad, on the lawn, about whether Columbia wanted police to come in and remove them a second time.So when the building was taken, the security cameras inside were smashed, barricades were put around at all the entrances, Columbia made the decision that this is where the line is drawn and called them in. For a police, this was a plan that they had already been considering. And that they brought a lot of people but they also brought a lot of special equipment, as you mentioned. They brought the emergency service unit, those are the people with the jaws of life if they have to breach a door. Those are the people with the tools to cut through any barricades that they have to. Those are the people who have the flashbangs if they needed a distraction device. But what you didn't see was a lot of special weapons. In other words, they came armed the way police officers do with their side arms. But there wasn't any particular large number of SWAT type weapons because they knew they were dealing with kids. They knew they were dealing with protesters, they knew they were likely to be unarmed. But they also knew that the possibility was they might meet some kind of resistance, as they'd seen in earlier protests.",

It's not safe for me to be there. So for a university, these kinds of events that we're seeing here is troubling.
