      "sentences": "All right. Coming to you live from New York, I'm Zain Asher.Bianna is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. We are waiting for news out of Israel where the security cabinet is expected to vote on a potential ceasefire deal with Hezbollah. Prime Minister Netanyahu will address the media in the next hour or so. The U.S.-backed proposal calls for a 60-day pause in the fighting to form the basis of a lasting truce. This as Israel keeps up its intense bombardment of Lebanon. Israel issued a rare evacuation order near American University in Beirut for the first time in years. Earlier, large plumes of smoke blanketed the capital after a rapid fire series of strikes. An Israeli military spokesperson says that 20 Hezbollah targets were hit in 120 seconds. So in about two minutes or so. The conflict that began a year ago has escalated dramatically over the past two months. Lebanon says that more than 3,700 people have been killed. We have CNN teams covering the story for you from all angles. We've got CNN's Alex Marquardt who's in Washington for us. We've also got Nic Robertson in Jerusalem. Nic, let me start with you because we understand that the Israeli cabinet meeting is now underway. Netanyahu is going to be speaking in about an hour or so. But that meeting had been delayed. It was actually supposed to start about 90 minutes ago. It was delayed as Netanyahu was negotiated to ensure that he had the votes that he needed. What more can you tell us?",

      "sentences": "Yes. It was expected earlier in the afternoon. And I think it was no surprise to anyone thatthis was always going to be a meeting that slipped a little bit and it slipped. And, of course, everyone in the region is watching this so, so, so closely. I don't think we can understate just how intensely they're watching every move here in Israel. And any delay in the cabinet session is really being sort of super analyzed in Beirut, really carefully scrutinized there. But so what was happening in the earlier part of the day, the prime minister was meeting with his coalition partners to try to get them on board and online to vote positively, vote in favor of that ceasefire. We know that at least two holdouts, Bezalel Smotrich, Finance Minister, the hard -- his sort of hardline fellow traveler, if you will, in the cabinet, the Itamar Ben-Gvir, the National Securities Minister, indicating they didn't want to vote in favor of the deal. But the prime minister, not only meeting with their parties, but also met with his own Likud Party, right-wing party, of course, right-wing government. They all decided to vote with the prime minister. That's what the prime minister's office believes. There are six of them. It's an 11-person vote. It's a simple majority. So the numbers are there. The prime minister's got the vote. Other people were expected to vote with him. So every expectation, anticipation is that this vote is going to go through, not done until it's done, as they say. The prime minister expected to speak in about an hour. If that slides, let's not be surprised. But that's the anticipation. And the expectation will be that he will have a language framing the reason to go for a ceasefire positively. But I have to say, there are residents along the northern border who say, this is a sellout. It amounts to a surrender. We're not getting anything better than what we got in 2006. And we'll be back in this same problem in a few years' time. Zain?",

      "sentences": "All right. Nic Robertson, live for us there.Alex, let me bring you in. Just explain to us what's in this deal and how close it is to Resolution 1701 from 2006. Alex Marquardt, cnn: Well, it's relatively close. And this deal has been in place or somewhat been in place for quite some time. This has been negotiated largely by the United States with the different parties over the course of more than a year. And we've been told for many, many months that it was very, very close, 90 percent done, if only the war in Gaza would end. And, of course, the war in Gaza has not ended. So the war, the tit for tat that then grew into a war between Hezbollah and Israel, not only did not end, but it actually -- it actually grew. So, yes, this U.N. resolution known as 1701, it provides the framework for this, for the ceasefire that we are expecting. In that, only Lebanese troops and United Nations troops will be allowed south of the Litani River. So essentially, that all Hezbollah forces will have to pull back with their weapons miles and miles away from the border with Israel. I think what is we're going to be looking at now, Zain, are the added stipulations and certainly the assurances that Israel wanted. And so what we'll be looking for are permissions that Israel wants to carry out surveillance by its air force, by its drones, by its jets, the right that it will reserve to carry out airstrikes if it sees that Hezbollah is moving south again or trying to move weapons into the country from Iran and from Syria. So the framework is largely that U.N. resolution, but there will be add-ons there. U.S. officials have been quite optimistic that this is going to happen while also warning that nothing is done until it's done. Zain, you'll remember that back at the end of September, the White House trumpeted that they had gotten a 21-day truce on the table that had been agreed to by all parties that had been brokered with France as well. And then Israel very quickly came out saying, not so fast, we're not agreeing to any kind of truce. So until this is done, until you hear this from both Hezbollah and Israel, you're probably not going to hear any kind of confirmation from the United States. And then I could think, Zain, there's a big question of why now. Of course, Hezbollah, who's been hit so hard, you can see why they would want to ceasefire. It does appear that Israel has accomplished what it's set out to do in terms of clearing out that Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon and getting Hezbollah to pull back. But on the U.S. political front, Zain, I think what is -- what is very interesting is Netanyahu appears to understand that this is not something that Donald Trump wants to deal with. He wants this off of his plate so that when he comes into office, this is all said and done. And so Netanyahu is not only agreeing to the pressure that we've seen from the Biden administration over the course of the past few months, but he's also giving Donald Trump a gift, if you will, in the sense that this is one more issue that he will not have to deal with when he becomes president on January 20th.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: Saving lives and livelihoods in Lebanon and in Israel. It will make a big difference in creating the conditions that will allow people to return to their homes safely in Northern Israel and in southern Lebanon. And I also believe that by de-escalating tensions in the region, it can also help us to end the conflict in Gaza. In particular, Hamas will know that it can't count on other fronts opening up in the war. So we're tracking this very closely. And I hope and believe that we can get this over the finish line.

      "sentences": "Well, Zain, it would certainly be touted as a huge diplomatic victory for the Bidenadministration among the officials who have been working for months to secure this deal to get it across the finish line. However, skeptics will say that it should not have taken this long. They will say that it was a failure of the U.S. and its partners to stop Israel from invading Lebanon in the first place to stop this escalation from taking place. Now, we should not discount the fact that this has been a major diplomatic undertaking. As you said, Blinken himself has been to the region scores of times over the past year to try to push forward both Lebanon and Gaza ceasefire, the latter of which we have yet to see much progress on Amos Hochstein has been leading efforts on behalf of the U.S. with the Lebanese officials as well as Israeli officials to try to get this ceasefire in place. And so we heard there from Blinken some cautious optimism that they are in the final stages to get this deal in place. But nothing is agreed until everything is agreed is what we keep hearing from U.S. officials because they have been burned before. So they are being very cautious about the optimism until they finally get a sign up from both of the parties from Israel, as well as Lebanese Hezbollah. Now, of course, this was a big topic of conversations, Zain, at the G7 ministerial where Blinken is right now. They talked about the Middle East in great detail. They talked about Lebanon that's reflected in a joint statement that was released just in the past hour from the G7 foreign ministers. They are endorsing a diplomatic resolution for the conflict between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah. They are also pushing for a Gaza ceasefire to be put in place. And they also reiterated their support for Ukraine at this meeting. That was another key topic of conversation trying to ensure that the support for Kyiv continues on despite what happens in the world, what happens with the next Trump administration, which of course has signaled that they could see major changes in foreign policy here. So a lot was covered in the past two days there in Italy. Blinken, of course, setting up for potential success here, but we'll wait and see what actually comes out in the coming hours from the key parties on the ground, Zain.",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's quite dangerous. And I think the Russians are saying that's quite adangerous escalation that's been going on. They obviously fully blame the West and specifically the United States for what they call this escalation, specifically sort of zeroing in on the Biden administration saying it's final days in the office that they are making the conflict worse and also making it more difficult for the Trump administration once they take office to try and tone things down and possibly get to some sort of ceasefire. So that's sort of the political framework that we're seeing. But I think one of the things that's really interesting about what the Russians have put out now with these ATACMS strikes that have happened is that they are actually acknowledging for the first time that these strikes are effective. If you go back to last week, the Russians, for the first time, said that the Ukrainians had used ATACMS missiles to try and hit what they call the military facility in the Bryansk Region. The Ukrainians were saying that they had hit a weapons depot in that region. But the Russians essentially said they shot all those missiles down. This time, the Russians are saying that a radar for a surface-to-air missile system, a very advanced system called an S-400, which is very long range, sort of a bit similar to the U.S. made Patriot system, that that radar was heavily damaged in an attack and strike and that the Ukrainians also managed to hit an airfield in the Kursk Region as well. So the Russians now acknowledging that that these strikes are effective. And then also for the first down -- for the first time putting out photos of what they say are the fragments of these ATACMS missiles trying to prove that, yes, these are indeed U.S. supplied munitions that were used in these strikes that took place. All of this, of course, as the Russians are warning the United States, warning the U.S.'s allies as well, that all of this could lead to some uncontrolled escalation in the future. Of course, we know, Zain, that late last week the Russians for the first time used a very heavy new experimentary hypersonic ballistic missile to attack the city of Dnipro in Ukraine, which of course put out several warheads that landed on that city. And the Russians really -- you know, when you're here on the ground, they really have been putting that left, right and center in all of their messaging that they're using saying, look, this missile is something that proves that Vladimir Putin is very serious about deterrence and very serious about the consequences that the U.S. giving the Ukrainians the go- ahead to use those longer range missiles can have not just for the conflict in Ukraine, but of course also for a possible wider conflict and possible military confrontation between the United States and Russia, Zain.",

And on day one of his presidency, he's going to prove it.The President-elect's announced that he'll impose a 25 percent tariff on all products coming from Mexico and Canada. He says the aim is to stop the flow of drugs and undocumented immigrants into the country. Then there's China. Trump plans to add a 10 percent tariff above any existing tariffs over the illegal drugs like fentanyl coming to America from China. He plans to also make these changes with an executive order that he's going to be signing on January 20th. Matt Egan joins us from New York. So Matt, here's the thing. I mean, these are taxes on imports. So obviously they are going to make things that much more expensive. And the reason why a lot of people voted for Donald Trump in this country, the reason why he won the election was because of the economy. And you had a lot of Americans saying that things were simply too expensive for them under the Biden administration. Am I missing something?",

But to your point, there is a risk that it undermines another war, right? The war on inflation, the frustration that a lot of voters had about high prices at the grocery store and elsewhere. And that, yes, helped to elect Trump and bring him back to the White House. But I mean, as you pointed out in your intro, the president-elect has made no secret that he views tariffs as this tool, this negotiating tool that can be used against friends and foes alike to try to bring them to the table. And we don't know exactly how this is going to play out. We don't know if he's going to actually impose these tariffs. We don't know how long they're going to last. We don't know what the exact impact will be on prices. And we also don't know whether or not he's going to be successful in getting new trade agreements with Canada and Mexico, getting them to address issues around immigration and drugs and the same thing with China. But we do know that there's at least the potential for this to cause real chaos for businesses, for it to invite retaliation. We've already heard from the leader of Mexico's basically saying there could be retaliatory tariffs. And, of course, this could impact prices as well. I mean, we're talking about U.S. and Mexico to the biggest trading partners. I mean, Mexico is actually the source where the U.S. gets most of its imported goods, everything from transportation equipment, agriculture is huge. Around 90 percent of U.S. imports of tomatoes and avocado all come from Mexico, auto parts as well. We've seen U.S. auto companies like GM and Ford and Stellantis fall sharply today on this tariff news. And U.S. also imports a lot from Canada as well. Oil is a big one. Minerals of cement, wood. You think about some of those building materials like cement and wood. I mean, how is that going to impact the cost to build homes, which is another major concern for voters when you think about affordability crisis for housing. And we have seen a reaction in the market. Not so much the U.S. stock market, which is kind of mixed, but in the currency market. If you look, you see the Mexican peso is down against the U.S. dollar, dollars up against the peso significantly. And this is a reflection of concerns about what this is going to do to the Mexican economy, because they rely on shipping goods to the United States. They rely on U.S. consumers buying those goods. And there are those concerns about what's going to happen in terms of retaliatory tariffs as well. But, Zain, to your point, we shouldn't be shocked by this, right? I mean, the president-elect made clear during the campaign trail that he was going to lob tariffs on our trading partners. And now the question is, what happens next? And what happens in terms of pricing? How consumers are going to be impacted?",

The irony of Special Counsel Jack Smith's attempt to make Trump accountable for what happened after the last election, his false crimes of fraud, his attempt to overturn the election in the Capitol insurrection, is that it ended up making Trump more powerful. We had a Supreme Court ruling that came out of this case that granted limited immunity to a president for acts in office. Donald Trump already thinks that presidents are almost uncheckable. That's only going to make Trump even more sure during his second term that he can do exactly what he wants. And I think one of the things that future generations may puzzle over is how the U.S. justice system and the political system was unable to act and to respond to a president who used his power to try to overturn the result of a democratic election. That is something that future presidents could well look at and decide that they have the power to do so as well. So this is going to resonate for decades to come, I think.",

But I did sort of think it was important to at least remind people what happened after 2020, what there will be no accountability for, and what I think historians in the future will find it difficult to believe because we're all living in Donald Trump's time. His irrepressible personality. His bulldozing persona is partly what allowed him to avoid paying a price for what he did after the last election.

And he achieved that feat in many ways, the case and the other cases against him, the four criminal indictments, allowed him to corral the Republican Party around himself, made it very difficult for his competitors in the Republican primary process.

It was 1701 after the conclusion of the fighting in 2006, if you recall.",

So it might be a little bit more complicated in Gaza, but at least now we have an opportunity to do that in Lebanon. And so there will be definitely an opportunity to honor that agreement on the part of the Israelis vis-a-vis President Trump. And I just find that there would be some mutual agreement between the two sides to move forward on this. The goals of the Israelis mostly have been achieved in Lebanon. There's very little, really appetite, frankly, both politically speaking, also from a societal point of view inside Israel to continue with the fighting.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is urging his supporters to fight to the end after thousands of protesters broke through barricades around Islamabad. Pakistani police fired tear guests to disperse the crowds and blocked roads to try to prevent them from pushing through.

And notably, our CNN team on theground, reported seeing soldiers guarding Pakistan's parliament as well as the country's Supreme Court building. So how we got here, exactly, we have the former Prime Minister Imran Khan, who a couple of days ago issued a clarion call to his supporters from jail. He's incarcerated right now. And he said, hey, I need you, supporters, to march on parliament and call for my release. And that is exactly what is happening or what the protesters want to happen. That's their objective. So the first demand that protesters, followers of Imran Khan, are asking for, they want the release of the former prime minister and the release of people whom they deem, quote-unquote, political prisoners. The second demand that these protesters have, they want the repeal of a constitutional amendment, Pakistan's 26th constitutional amendment, which makes it a little easier for the government to pick superior court judges and pick those judges for cases that involve political matters. The third demand that protesters have, who we're seeing in these images, they are calling for a return of their, quote, stolen mandate. There were elections nationwide in February and protesters, the followers of the front former prime minister are saying, you know, essentially our party did extremely well in these elections. And we won seats that have been denied. So they are calling for seats that they think are rightfully theirs to be awarded to them. So the government Prime Minister Sharif, he rejects those claims and he's calling for more talks with people who adhere to the party of the former prime minister. But what we have seen are swaths of Islamabad that are without cell phone service from time to time, without internet service as well, giant blockades, giant barricades of major thoroughfares in and out of Islamabad that have been put up to try to prevent protesters from coming into the city. So the main question, how many protesters will amass inside the center of the city? Will they perhaps make it to parliament? And how long can this go on with a city that has more than a million people? Mike Valerio, CNN, Seoul. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

It's taking people about 10 to 13 minutes, according to the TSA, to get through the main security line. You're a little bit less if you have TSA pre-check. Just check FlightAware, the cancellations and delays remain relatively low for right now. But the FAA is warning that that could change as the day and the week develops. The big problem is the FAA staffing shortage that it is facing for air traffic controllers. One of the biggest pain points is in Newark, New Jersey. That's a major hub for United Airlines. It's one of its biggest international hubs for flights going between the East Coast of the U.S. and to Europe and beyond. So far, the FAA says it has tried to move the responsibility of that airspace from Newark to Philadelphia, but there have still been some issues. The FAA says it has a pipeline of about 28 air traffic controllers to fill the void there. And FAA Chief Mike Whitaker is warning that there could be ground stops and delays because of the staffing shortage at airports nationwide.

So taking the things that youwould typically get with a ticket and making it something that you have to pay extra for. And this new report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations says that airlines raked in about $12 billion over a five- year period when it comes to charging you extra for seat selection. In fact, some ultra-low-cost carriers like Frontier Airlines even go as far as incentivizing their employees, paying them extra, paying them bonuses to try and get you to pay for carry-on bags. If you're trying to skirt their rules for carry-on bags, the airline -- Frontier Airlines, in particular, will give some of their employees $10 to nab a passenger. Really sort of a far and wide-reaching investigation here ahead of what is to be a Senate hearing on this sometime next week. Of course, airlines love this because they get to pay -- get paid extra by employees, by passengers rather, and when their employees catch people, they say it's effectively like catching them stealing.",
