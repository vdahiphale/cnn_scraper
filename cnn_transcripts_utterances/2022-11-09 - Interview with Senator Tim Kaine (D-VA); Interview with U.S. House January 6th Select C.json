Welcome to the program, everyone. I am Christiane Amanpour in Kyiv. In the battle to liberate Ukrainian territory, all eyes tonight are on statements from the Russian defense minister who has publicly ordered the withdrawal of forces from Kherson's West Bank. This, as Ukrainian forces advance towards that strategic city from two directions. And Kherson has been the only regional capital taken by Russia since February's invasion. And I just sat down for an exclusive joint interview with President Zelenskyy and the first lady. And I asked about the status of the Ukrainian counter-offensive against Russians occupying Kherson. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator):  I will try to answer in a way that does not give you an answer, to be honest. Because these planned military actions, they are discussed in a small circle. But then they're executed in silence. And I really want to have an unpleasant surprise for the enemy and not something that they are prepared for. So, I would like to apologize. But at any rate, our people and your public need to know that we are working on some very serious steps with a positive outcome for the citizens of Ukraine.

Because at the end of the day, this is not the money of the government but the money of the people. Secondly, we are grateful for the bipartisan support. We would really like to have this bipartisan support remain after the elections. Because, yes, there have has been these mixed messages that were in the U.S. mass media, particularly from the Republican side. And for or us, it is very important to preserve this level of support.

Our Virginia race has worked out the way that I thought they would. And I think -- there was sort of three issues at stake that maybe made some people look a little bit differently. First, the issues were the economy and autonomy and democracy. On the economy, voters who said that the economy was the top issue, many interpret that to mean that they were going to vote for Republicans. But that wasn't necessarily the case. People understand there is tough economic issues and they could look at a Democratic Party that was delivering an infrastructure bill, a CHIPS manufacturing bill, 10 million new jobs, hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. Yes, there are some tough signs. Inflation is real and people talk about it. But if you are an economy voter, that didn't mean that you are voting Republicans. A lot of people like what the Democrats are doing and want us to do more. On the autonomy side, look, the Dobbs decision that undermined a half a century, really a full century of Supreme Court precedent, granting women autonomy to make decisions about their personal life, that was a huge factor. As you could see in individual races. And also, in state referenda all over the United States, women and men and standing up and saying, wait a minute. The long arm of criminal law should not be used against women in making their own health care decisions. And then finally on the democracy side, I think voters looked at, you know, this is the first federal election since the January 6th attack. And there's been a lot of election deniers who are up running these elections. And Paul Pelosi gets attacked at his home and some -- on the other side, you know, made light of it. I think voters looked at all of those things together and they realized that democracy really was on the ballot and that they needed to participate and they needed to stand strong for the people who were standing up at home, but also in the world. You asked about Ukraine. There is a battle for democracy going on around the globe. And I think the American electorate understands that.",

And that -- my goodness, you know, things like women's right to choose and protecting democracy were not as important to Americans. But clearly, as you say, the results prove the opposite. Many abortion rights activists did win and many did say that it was the threat to democracy that motivated them as well.

But remember, many of the Biden administration accomplishments thus far have been bipartisan. Infrastructure, CHIPS, a veterans bill, common sense gun safety. There have been some bills that have been partisan only. But President Biden is very comfortable working in a bipartisan world. And so, he is going to keep looking for other wins in that space. On the Senate side, I just got to tell you, there is nothing harder for a Senate majority leader than to have a 50/50 majority. We have a chance because I think we are in the strong position in both Arizona and Nevada, not called yet. And I also think we are in a strong position in Georgia. If we end up at 51, not 50, it is dramatically different in the Senate because the committees do not have to be evenly divided. Democrats will have an edge on all committees which means we'll be able to get legislation floored. And most importantly, we'll be able to get all nominees that President Biden to the floor and not have to chew up inordinate amounts of time because we can't get nominees out of committees. That will help the president with judges, with ambassadors, with key national security officials at the Pentagon. The Republicans have slowed them down with a 50/50 Senate. If we get to 51/49, you are going to see a lot more high-quality people quickly in place in these positions that matters so much to how America is governed and our national security.",

The Russian illegal invasion isabout Ukraine but it's also about to democracies, link arms, and stand together. And as you know here in the Senate, by a 95 to one vote, we voted to gratify the treaty that Sweden and Finland are now entering NATO, which is fantastic. And so, it shows that there are some real bipartisanship there. I think you are going to continue to see strong bipartisanship. Not unanimity, but strong bipartisanship in terms of supporting Ukraine because they're a democratic ally. But also because we understand that that support sends a message to dictators around the globe that democracies can link arm and stand up for the democratic values that we hold dear. The second challenge, that's an everyday challenge for this administration is China. We have a very complex relationship with China. A trade relationship, a competition to some degree. There's confrontation on items. The president has recently taken some really tough steps with respect to Chinese chips manufacturing that are going to strengthen the U.S. together with our CHIPS Bill and pose some problems for China. So, China, after the CCP's fifth-year -- you know, five-year conference that they had, the increasing consolidation of powers to Xi Jinping. What does that mean for China? What does it mean for their economy? What does it mean for Taiwan? These are the two big issues. But as you know better than just about anybody working in the fourth state (ph), the foreign relations issues are numerous and we always wake up every day and there's new ones that we haven't thought that much about.",

And you did not run but -- we'll -- and we'll talk to that -- we'll talk about that in a second. But I asked Senator Tim Kaine to react to react to what I've heard from President Zelenskyy here. Particularly, looking at the incoming results and just hoping that no change in the shift or balance of power in the U.S. affects the really staunch support that the U.S. has given this country. What do you think? REP. ADAM KINZINGER (R-IL): Yes. I mean, look, I think we have to always be cautious of any, you know, shifts. We always have to defend against those, kind of, corrupt influences within the GOP or even on the far left that are saying things like, you know, Ukraine, isn't worth it. Fighting for democracy is not worth it. But if I'm in Ukraine today and I'm worried about the U.S. abandoning Ukraine, I wouldn't be too worried about it. Again, it's important keep attacking that.

They don't feel comfortable with candidates that do not accept election results. Candidate quality matters. You know, standing for the truth of democracy matters. And I think what we are seeing so far is that if you want to stand up and deny elections and you want to stand up and attack democracy, you're not going to win. That does not mean though, by the way, that MAGA is going to be, you know, extricated from the Republican Party. It's going to be an intense battle.

But now, in this next Congress, you are going to have people that truly believe that the election in 2020 was stolen. You look at a guy like Joe Kent out in Washington State who's been very openly, in essence, white supremacist and anti-government. You're going to see people like that go to the United States Congress. So, even though this election didn't turn out to be the red wave that so many people expected, there are going to be some very corrosive influences in the House of Reps. And let's say the Republicans do take the majority by a very slim margin which looks possible. Now, all of a sudden, those people have great power because they can deny the majority -- the votes pass something.

And I think that is a pretty universal story even as it looks like they are going to be able flip the House of Representatives. So, I think that you are going to have an -- I think, this morning, we have an interesting picture or margin where Democrats are kind of taking a victory lap even though they are going to probably lose one chamber of commerce and it's -- and chamber of Congress and it is Republicans who have been sentenced to soul-searching mode because they didn't meet those expectations.",

Though, the districts we saw Republicans win last night are mostly the give me districts, the districts that were already drawn to them -- to their advantage in redistricting and that they are almost baked into the cost of yesterday. They were not winning races where they had to persuade voters or had to really show strength in this environment, they mostly lost those races. So, I think your point is true that there is definitely a voter that we can talk about here, in Georgia or in places like Michigan, that split their ticket between a more -- a conservative what -- but what we might call a more traditional conservative and kind of keeping distance from the most Trumpy conservatives. I think if you are a Republican who doesn't think -- who thinks the Republican Party has gone too far, who thinks Donald Trump has been an anchor on the party, you are going to use today as really your alarm bell to say that the party has to really excise itself from those Trumpy messages if it wants to make the biggest gains.",

I think Michigan is a great example here. You have a Republican slate that had gone in that hyper conservative Trump direction and you had abortion protecting -- the ballot measure to protect abortion on the ballot last night, and you saw that really drive Democratic enthusiasm. And for Republicans, the fact that they were out of step, where most voters were on abortion, really came back to hurt them. This is something that is going to continue going forward, even as, on the local level, we saw some results that went in the opposite direction. I mean, state legislatures are going to be able to enshrine those abortion laws in places like North Carolina and Wisconsin. But when you see that measure brought to the people, when you see that measure brought to the public, almost always you have seen them rally to protect abortion rights, even among some places that we might consider too conservative to do so.",

We did not see that debate performance really touched his poll or fundraising numbers, and that was proven out yesterday. Voters still -- his voters came out and really rallied behind him. What you really did see is a Senate candidate in Mehmet Oz that turned -- that blew an opportunity, a huge opportunity for Republicans in an open seat in Pennsylvania. Remember, this is a state Donald Trump won in 2016, in the place that was supposed to prove his kind of cachet among white working class, particularly outside of cities, that has not come to fruition in the Senate races. And I think that really speaks to what was the overconfidence that Trump could say anything, he could back anybody and his voters would come around to it. But his voters don't have the same priority set as he does and maybe he likes watching Dr. Oz on television and he thinks he's a good vessel for those messages but he was not someone who was the right calibration to take Trumpism to Pennsylvania. And that was the feeling after the primary. But it was kind of thought that it had changed a little bit in the lead up to the election. I think yesterday makes clear that certainly Mastriano and definitely Oz were wrong candidates for Republicans who really fumbled what they would consider a clear and easy target for victory in the midterm era.",

People like Doug Mastriano, people in those Senate and governors' races on the down ballot way -- in the down ballot, in the state legislature or on some court seats. You have that viewpoint now enshrined into government. And I think that the people have kind of underestimated how much of that was set from the time of Republican primary. When Republicans back those individuals in their primaries, it ensured that Trumpism, election denialism had a home kind of, at least for the foreseeable future, in our political system. Now, Democrats have done -- had defied political gravity to make sure that home does not make it fully to Congress or fully in all those governors houses. But you are right that election denial-ism and that false conspiracy, that Trump base push has won some core races yesterday. But it will be about whether they have the party willingness to follow through. When we were talking about a wave yesterday, you know, the hope among people who support Trump was going to be that the wind was so overwhelming, so complete that not only did they sweep into office but they had a mandate of action on the election front, on the abortion front, to really make those conspiracies turn out into law. That is not what they have. And so, the question will be, in my opinion, whether the people who do come into office retain Republican support to act. And that I think speaks to our kind of larger central thing here is, will the Republican Party use yesterday as a chance to further distance itself from Donald Trump or is that not something that's going to be settled until 2024?",
