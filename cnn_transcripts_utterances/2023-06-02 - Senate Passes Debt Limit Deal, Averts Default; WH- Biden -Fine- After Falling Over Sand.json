(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), MAJORITY LEADER: House Republicans were ready to take default hostage in order to pass a radical hard-right agenda that never could have passed with the American people. So many of the destructive provisions in the Republican bill are gone. This bill was a total rejection of what the Republicans wanted. And look at the vote.

The debt crisis appears to be over until the President signs this into law. Always fair to be a little cautious about things.But the reality right now is in Washington, there is kind of a big sigh of relief to some degree. One White House official I was texting with last night during the lengthy Senate amendment and final passage vote process asked, what are you going to do now? And exhale was the one word response. And I think to some degree, it underscores just how all-consuming this fight, this issue. And I think the stakes here have been over the course of, not just the last several weeks when negotiations really kicked into gear, but, you know, Democrats, including senior White House officials, were talking about this shortly after Republicans won the majority in the midterm elections last year. They've always known this was coming. They always knew this was going to be a huge fight. And no one was totally sure how they were going to get out of this. So the ability to reach an outcome and a bipartisan outcome and, yes, there are some frustrated Democrats. There are certainly a number of very frustrated Republicans. That's kind of a space the President, a, always assumed they were going to end up in, according to officials, but also is a space he's pretty comfortable with. And I think that's something you're going to hear tonight. You know, it's really interesting after the vote last night, very late last night, is when they added to the schedule these Oval Office remarks tonight at 07:00 p.m. It'll be the first, at least by my count, Oval Office address the President has actually given since he's been in office. I don't think you're going to see a victory lap. I think White House officials, while they are quietly pretty happy with where this ended up, given the fact it's divided government, I think are cognizant of the fact that there's frustration from Democrats here that this isn't necessarily a good process to be going through for the sake of the U.S. government. But what it does is it kind of clears the decks going forward. And going forward, where you don't have this looming over everything, you don't have necessarily clear stalemates or back and forth going on is important, not just for Washington, not just for this White House, particularly this White House as it engages and starts to engage even more heavily in a reelection campaign, but also for the entire country. So how the President frames kind of the pathway forward the relationship that he started to establish with the speaker of the House, they didn't know each other that well before this, that has started to change a little bit. And whether or not that's a working relationship going forward, I think all of those are elements you're going to hear from tonight. I think the biggest thing and the biggest takeaway, though, by far, is this has been hanging over everything. It is now gone. What does that mean? And if the President's going to outline that tonight.",

The fall, as you noted, when you saw it happen live, I mean, it was hard, it was fast, and I think everybody was very concerned. He's 80. And I think that's just the reality here of any time the President stumbles or looks any bit uneven, but got back to his seat on his own volition. The culprit was a sandbag.

And the bottom line is, this is sort of the result of the Wild West Days for generations. They were able to pump whatever groundwater they wanted in Arizona without any sort of regulations.They tightened the cities in recent years. But this is sort of a moment in time were realizing that the days of a developer going out into raw desert and said, I'm going to build a thousand homes right here. And transform this place are over, unless you can guarantee that you have the water for those those homes for the next hundred years. Plenty of cities around Phoenix have that guarantee, and they can continue to keep growing. But this is sort of a line in the sand forgive the pun, that endless desert sprawl just doesn't work in the age of climate change and mega drought.",

And you also have to keep in mind where the most water use goes. For example, the Colorado River that almost 2 trillion gallons that goes in there. The vast majority 56 percent goes into Cow food, for dairy and cattle farms another quarter. So, for other crops only 15 percent or so goes to cities, and cities like Vegas and others have shown models of conservation recycling.Mark Kelly, the senator of Arizona is a big fan of desalination, which right now that technology it's super energy intensive, to turn the salt water into fresh. But that technology is getting better just like everything else. So, who knows?

That's, you know, cold comfort for if you are raising Alfalfa cattle out in the desert but this is the new era that we're living in. So, it could be that it could mean denser cities, like Phoenix, where they built -- where they build up instead of outs.
