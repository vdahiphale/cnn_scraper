And we offered him the opportunity to weigh in. And instead of getting a response or a comment, just about a minute before we were about to go live on CNN, he notified the world that he is withdrawing from consideration as attorney general. And this new story is that the Ethics Committee was told of a second sexual encounter with a woman who was just 17 years old. Now, she told -- the woman who was just 17 at the time, she testified to the committee that this second sexual encounter, which has never been reported before, also included another adult woman. And I want to note that she testified about both sexual encounters, not only to the House Ethics Committee, but also in a civil deposition down in Florida and that her testimony has been consistent. Now, the congressman, of course, was investigated by the Justice Department over these allegations. They did not charge him. I will also note that the adult woman who was allegedly part of this encounter has also denied that she had sex with the minor. But this was an important piece of reporting, because not only is it a second alleged sexual encounter with someone that was underage. It's also something that we didn't know before. I have covered the investigations into Congressman Gaetz for four years. We have broken so much news on the criminal investigation. We broke the news that he wasn't going to be charged. We have been following the House Ethics probe. This was the first time that we had ever heard that the under -- alleged underage victim said she had sex with him twice and that the second encounter allegedly involved an adult woman, incredibly significant piece of reporting, because it reminds people that the Ethics Committee has learned things that the public is not aware of. But when we reached out again, we did not get a statement. Instead, the world was informed that Gaetz will no longer be considered for attorney general.",

      "sentences": "Yes.And, obviously, his team was really arguing that they were feeling confident about that -- those meetings that they had yesterday. But one thing that has become very clear is there's a sense of relief up here on Capitol Hill among a lot of Senate Republicans who were either worried that they were going to have to take a very difficult vote on Matt Gaetz, potentially crossing the new and incoming president. There were also some Republicans who are close to the president's team who still had serious concern about Matt Gaetz. I want to read one statement that Susan Collins just gave in the hallway to our colleague. She said -- quote -- \"What I think it probably reflects is the meetings that he had yesterday with senators as they started going through the Judiciary Committee members. I don't know that for a fact, but I think that he has put his country first and I am pleased with the decision.\" Now, another Republican I spoke with on my way to this hit, Roger Wicker, said that this was a positive development. And when I pushed him on why he thought that this was such a positive development, he just smiled at me, did not answer the question, basically, I think trying to insinuate, we all know why this was going to be a very tough road ahead in the months that came after this nomination. Now, another thing to keep in mind here is there's still a fight to get that Ethics report out in the light of day. We are told that Representative Sean Casten, who had introduced a privileged resolution to force a vote of the full House on this issue, still wants to move forward when they get back from the Thanksgiving recess. So there's still some pressure points up here on Capitol Hill about getting the contents of that Ethics report out into the public eye. Of course, you would need some Democrats to vote with Republicans. It's not clear that that would happen, especially now that Matt Gaetz is no longer vying to be the next attorney general of the United States.",

And the announcement of Matt Gaetz as the as the nominee for the attorney general job was pretty much uniformly met with horror. He is profoundly incapable and unqualified for that job. So they have avoided that one really concerning result. But I don't think anyone is -- nobody's kidding themselves. There will be another nominee. And likely, whoever that is, they will also come to the department with the instructions and the mandate from the president and the administration to really tear things apart and take a very different view of the work that the department does. So people who work there are very committed to the mission of that organization, who have invested their lives and their careers in doing that work are understandably still be concerned about that.",

DOJ likely had access to all these same witnesses. They likely received the same testimony. They probably had additional information they were able to get with legal process and subpoena and things like that. At the end of the day, they determined they did not want to go forward with the prosecution. The standard in the department in making that decision is whether you think you could obtain a conviction at trial and sustain that conviction under appeal. So, clearly, whatever they had failed to meet that standard in their discretion, and they had a great discretion deciding that. There's a lot of reasons why they might have thought they couldn't get a conviction at trial. It may be they didn't want to put these witnesses through the -- and the really rough process of having to go to trial and testify about events like this. It may be they thought some of the witnesses wouldn't hold up to cross-examination in a way that would have been productive for the prosecution. There's a million different reasons. And I think at some point the Oversight Committees should talk to the department about that, should get a better understanding about why they walked away from a prosecution of a person in a very high-ranking position that allegedly involved the victimization of young women. You know, I'm not clear that DOJ would ever share their reasons with their Over -- with the Oversight Committees, but it's something that they should certainly look into.",

So Trump deserves to be able to nominate someone who has a fighting chance of being confirmed. That obviously wasn't happening with Gaetz. I mean, this transition, though, as I said at the time, it's entertaining. I mean, it has more twists and turns than an M. Night Shyamalan movie. And now we're going to get somebody else.

I think he's got all kinds of folks who were highly qualified for all these jobs who would be more than happy to serve the American people in this. So I think he will have a good list to pick from. I do think this. He went out on a limb on this one, and it got sawed off pretty quickly. My advice would be don't do it again, because if you nominate another person who starts below the line -- that was the thing with Gaetz.

Again, she's not named. She's referred to Jane Doe in this police report. And she describes Hegseth at this conference as giving off a creeper vibe. She says that she ended up in a strange hotel room. Hegseth took the phone from her hands. He blocked the door with his body, and she remembered saying no a lot. There are also a lot of parts she forgot that she just couldn't piece together. She said it's possible somebody slipped something in her drink, but there are other eyewitnesses who said she seemed sober and also other people who said they might have seen her earlier in the evening having an encounter with Hegseth at the bar. One person perceived that as flirting. Now, eventually, after this encounter in the hotel room, she decided to seek medical attention. She got her rape kit and the nurse reported it. Now I want to go to Hegseth's version of events, which is very different from what this woman recalls. He says this was a consensual sexual intercourse between two adults. He said she was in his hotel room and there was always conversation, always consensual conduct. He said he and Jane Doe had a conversation about how she was married and she was going to tell her husband that she had fallen asleep on a couch in someone else's room, and that she showed early signs of regret. So, again, he's denied that there was any kind of sexual misconduct. His attorney, Timothy Parlatore, has said the same. He said to CNN: \"The police report confirms what I have said all along. The incident was fully investigated and police found the allegations to be false, which is why no charges were filed.\" We should note what this police report tells us and doesn't tell us. There were no charges filed. That is correct. It doesn't say that her allegations were false, and there are pieces of evidence that we still don't have and the public may never have. There's surveillance video. There's a memo from the district attorney's office that could shed light on why there weren't charges in this case. And the woman again, Jane Doe, she's not commenting. CNN found her last week and tried to ask her about this incident. She broke down in tears when our team asked her about it.",

And that actually makes sense, knowing Donald Trump, because he's an adjudicated sexual abuser himself. So, of course he's not going to be concerned about allegations about one of his nominees doing the same. But, listen, Pete Hegseth, even before these allegations, is not qualified to hold this position. He's not qualified because he doesn't have the experience, either the experience running a large organization or the experience on defense and national security policy. And he's not qualified because of some of his comments on women serving in combat, which he has said women should not serve in combat, which is immediately disqualifying in my book. I'm a former Army Ranger. I served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. I served with women who fought for this country, who sacrificed for this country, in some cases died for this country.

She's gone to Syria and visited people in the Syrian regime. She's made very troubling statements about America's adversaries. And she doesn't actually have experience, right? She's unqualified because she doesn't have the experience running the nation's largest intelligence network. Now, you don't have to have done that before. That's not what I'm saying. What I am saying is, you should either have experience running large organizations, or you should know something about defense policy and national security, neither of which are true for her. But then you add on top of that questions about her loyalty and questions about her integrity are concerning, because the director of national intelligence is responsible for overseeing our alliances, right? So we get a lot of intelligence to protect Americans from our allies. There's an alliance called the Five Eyes relationship that we have with a couple of different countries. And we get intelligence that protects Americans from other countries. Those countries are not going to share intelligence with us if they don't have confidence that we're going to protect that information and honor it in the way that that alliance requires us to do so, which actually will make Americans far less safe.",
