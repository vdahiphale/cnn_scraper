It shares a 600-plus mile border with Ukraine.Now, Lukashenko, as you pointed out, has denied that he's going to get involved. He said that Russia has, in fact -- has, in fact, actually not asked him and that he would only do so if Belarus was directly attacked. But we have seen an uptick in military exercises -- joint military exercises between the two countries recently on the territory of Belarus not far from the border. A CNN team -- CNN's Fred Pleitgen visited that border area accompanied by Belarusian soldiers and they talked about tension. You could see fortifications on the Ukrainian side. Now there is a purpose to that even if there isn't a plan to launch an offensive through that border, which is to keep Ukrainian forces concentrated there so they cannot be elsewhere on the other front. And I think, Christine, there's another purpose to this meeting today between Putin and Lukashenko and that is an element of counterprogramming, really, to show that Russia is not isolated even as we see this big show of Western unity taking place at the Munich Security Conference -- Christine.",
