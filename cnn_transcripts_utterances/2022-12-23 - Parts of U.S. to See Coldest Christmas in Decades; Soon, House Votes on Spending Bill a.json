We're on Walnut Grove, which is very popular for people to get to and from work. And already this morning, we have seen people be defeated by this hill here in front of Hope Church on Walnut Grove in the city of Memphis.On our way to this area, we actually saw about ten cars that either had been abandoned or wrecked. You can see it right here. Already this morning in this section, we've seen four cars spin out of control. That car right there, that vehicle, that SUV is the lone one that is just stuck. It can't move because of the ice. Not only is this ice on this road hard to drive on but it is absolutely impossible to walk on. I got a chance myself to see for myself that it is ice, ice for sure. And for the most part, people are having trouble going up the hill, also down the hill, as you see this crashed out car right here. Also with people coming down this hill around here, people are ending up, up that hill.",

Even the room, we're staying in our hotel last night, you could just hear the wind pounding against the windows.But I can tell you we've been out about here in downtown Grand Haven, actually in Grand Haven, for the past day-and-a-half and we've seen the snow build up and the wind pick up. And people driving slowly, which is a good thing. We don't want any more grievances to the list this year. We've also seen just cars coming down with their headlights on. That's a big thing because we've seen some without that. But it is just cold. It's just the way it is. We woke up, it was nine degrees, now it's ten degrees. I wish I knew the difference, but I don't at all. But we've also seen the two trucks out and the salt trucks out, and people have been really mindful of each other as well, which has also been helpful. But it is cold out here. The lake, I would say, is a few blocks that way, like Michigan, Grand Rapids, is about an hour that way. My soul got lost somewhere in between all of this because it is genuinely cold.

      "sentences": "Let's start with the obvious things you can do. Wrap or cover all exposed pipes, don't forget about those at the back of the washer. Open the doors below your kitchen sink, especially any pipes on the outside wall, let the taps trickle if it's really cold out there.Find the main water shutoff. So, if it starts thawing and water starts springing, you could shut off water to the whole house until you figure out where it is. And keep the heat in. Block those drafty windows and doors, put a towel down there or something. Don't just let in and just go opening the door a whole lot. You don't want that heat to get out. Fireplace and the stoves are pretty much ineffective. Fireplaces don't really warm a move very much. Stoves don't do that. You're running the risk of carbon monoxide. Same issue with generators, got to get them outside of the house, outside the garage, do not put them near the building because of that, space heaters, look out for fire danger. And have your food, water, flashlights and warm clothes ready, know where they are. Don't wait until the power goes off and then say, I'll try to figure it out. If you feel you have to go outside in your car, full tank, full phone, plus your emergency supplies in the car and ready to go. Totally clear off your windows and lights. Don't try to sneak along. Drive slowly, brake gently, yes, headlights on, no cruise control. Put that off. Do not pass plows or emergency vehicles if they are going slow. It is going to be more dangerous in front of them than behind them. Give other people plenty of room because they can't control their cars either. And if you get stranded in the car, stay in the vehicle. You're safer there than if you get out and start trying to move around, unless you could easily see the safe place you're going to. And last of all, if you yourself want to protect yourself, first of all, stay sheltered. Some of these cold temperatures we're talking about, they can really hurt you and I mean fast. It can get after you quickly. Wear sufficient clothing, plus shoes and boots with good traction. There's an old saying, there is no cold weather, there's just people who don't know how to dress for cold weather. So, put on the warm stuff and keep it on. Use handrails when you're walking so you don't fall. Do not overexert yourself trying to shovel snow. People have heart attacks all the time and other people just get hurt and they also get all wet in their from too much exertion. That makes them colder. And most of all, limit your exposure. You cannot be out there as long as you think you can without getting hurt. And I'm a big believer in getting outside and enjoying the elements but these are simple, real rules that can keep you and your family safe. And the last thing you want to do in all of this to get hurt, to suffer from kind of exposure and then have to get to a hospital or emergency room, which is another risk level. Jim?",
