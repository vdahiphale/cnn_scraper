I can also already anticipate some of the response that will be coming from the Kremlin. They will most likely deny that the ICC has any jurisdiction whatsoever over the Russian government, over Vladimir Putin. And it's not just them.I mean, I can recall the Trump administration publicly saying the ICC has no jurisdiction over the U.S. government. So, it's a -- it's a powerful statement. It's a bold statement, the issuing of this arrest warrant. But it will likely have little effect whatsoever on the day- to-day behavior and policies of Putin himself. It is though, a strong message to Russia and to the Russian military that people are watching its behavior on the ground here. This is just one case. One very high-profile case that has just been announced. I was just yesterday meeting with a Ukrainian police officer here in charge of hundreds of investigators and he says most of their work right now is to gather information about alleged Russian war crimes on the ground here. You're hearing air raid sirens over my shoulder. They're -- every time the Russian military fires rockets, cruise missiles artillery at Ukrainian towns and cities, investigators come in soon after to document that and to prepare cases against the Russian military for alleged war crimes, Kate.",

      "sentences": "Well, it's certainly an extremely significant moment for those that are sitting head of state, particularly Vladimir Putin, whose country is on the permanent Security Council being issued an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court. It is very rare for a head of state to face this kind of warrant. And even if as Ivan says in the short term, it is symbolic, it is hugely symbolic. And this case deals with the thousands of children alleged to have been taken from their parents or coerced from their parents, taken from Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine into what the researchers and the ICC is called reeducation camps.Now, we've spoken to children and parents just a few weeks ago. We told the story of parents going into Crimea and rescuing their children from these kinds of reeducation camps. The most serious allegation, talks about the orphans that were taken from state facilities and into Russia, given to Russian parents. Now, while Vladimir Putin and the head of his group that is involved with children's rights have been named in this arrest warrant, they will say and they have repeatedly said this is the issue of them protecting the children. Something that really doesn't fly with the facts when you look at these children going to these camps and being taught in Russian, being forced to sing the Russian national anthem, separated there from their parents, forcibly. Those parents often and still are separated from those children. So, a very important symbolic moment, just one case of many that has been looked at to accuse Russian officials, the president, and the military men of war crimes.",

But also in the process going forward, we know that just from past experience -- past -- the history of the ICC that this can take years, a very long time for anything to actually see the light of day in terms of a trial. What do you think about that?",

But the New York Times has been reporting, as we've been talking about on the show for this week, is that there is resistance from the Pentagon, blocking that kind of coordination because of fear of the precedent that it would send. I talked to the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee about it just yesterday. I wonder what this -- what that -- what that means in this context now?",

And it would be significant if they were able to share that information.But up until this point, so far as we know, Kate, the Biden administration hasn't shared that information. As you said, it has been a matter of internal drama if you will, within the interagency. As you said, the Department of Defense has been opposed to sharing that information. The State Department has been supportive of it. So, that still continues on. But the fact that the ICC was able to move forward with this arrest warrant for the top official in Russia without even needing that information, I think demonstrates that they already have very, very significant evidence of their own of these war crimes of forcibly forcing these children to leave Ukraine and go into Russia.",

Specifically, they want to ask you what you may have seen or heard about classified documents or about boxes that could have contained classified documents. Because remember, this is not only an investigation into the possible mishandling of classified materials, they're also looking at whether there have been any efforts to obstruct this investigation.So, that's part of why they want to talk to housekeepers, groundskeepers, and one young man who was spotted on security cameras helping another aide move boxes. They want to talk to everyone. They're leaving no stone unturned. Now, some folks in the former president's orbit have argued this is a little extreme.

The court accusing the Russian president of a scheme to forcibly deport thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia. A war crime. The ICC lays out some of the cases in a statement saying this, and I'll read part of it for you.There are reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Putin bears individual criminal responsibility for the aforementioned crimes. One, for having committed the acts directly jointly with others and or through others. And two, for his failure to exercise control properly over civilian and military subordinates who committed the acts or allowed for their commission and who were under his effective authority and control. Going directly to the top here. CNN's chief international correspondent Clarissa Ward is at The Hague which is home to the ICC. She joins me now. Clarissa, this represents the first international charges to be brought since the start of Russia's war. What do you make of it?",

Any number of assumptions that he has made are turning out in fact, to be the reverse.We see a NATO that is strong -- more strongly empowered than ever. We see Ukrainians who are getting the support internationally, but also within who are more united in this fight than ever. Now, we see the International Criminal Court coming ahead -- coming out with these two arrest warrants, including for President Putin himself. This is significant. This means something. This is a big deal. Now, I don't think he's necessarily shuttering in his boots, per se but the symbolism of the moment is nonetheless important, Kate.",
