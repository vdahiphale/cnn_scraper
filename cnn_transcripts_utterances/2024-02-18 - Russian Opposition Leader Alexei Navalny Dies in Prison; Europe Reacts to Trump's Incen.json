An outspoken critic of Vladimir Putin for many years, Navalny was poisoned with a chemical nerve agent and evacuated to Berlin in 2020. He defiantly returned to Russia, was promptly arrested, and languished in prisons ever since. The 47-year-old died this week in a remote penal colony in the Arctic.We had his daughter Dasha on the show last January. Today, David Remnick joins me to discuss this tragic death, which many believe is a murder. He's the editor of the \"New Yorker\" and the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \"Lenin's Tomb.\" Welcome, David. Let me ask you first to talk for a moment about Navalny because I do think we sometimes, you know, in today's world we forget when we see genuine courage. This is a guy who was, you know, allowed to go because of Angela Merkel to Germany for treatment. Putin had tried to poison him. He refuses to stay there. He has political asylum. He could come to the United States. He goes back, and he goes back because as I think his daughter said to me he could not ask other people to protest Putin's Russia if he was sitting comfortably in Germany or the United States. That's a rare kind of courage, don't you think?",

It's been going on for a generation. Navalny was an attractive figure, somebody who had represented leadership for minorities of all kinds. He represented a different existence not only with the West, but places like Ukraine. He opposed the invasion of Ukraine in the most forthright language. Hewas a kind of latter-day Andrei Sakharov. If you remember, in 1986, in December 1986, Mikhail Gorbachev, that relatively new Soviet leader, signaled his turn toward liberalism by liberating Andrei Sakharov from Gorky where he'd been kept as a virtual prisoner with his wife. This is the opposite. This is somebody signaling his ruthlessness, his willingness to kill his enemies, and a very, very different kind of system that's in place right before his so-called election. Remember Putin is up for election in just a matter of weeks, which of course he will win because it's a fraud from beginning to end. So sometimes history moves distinctly backwards and tragically. We sometimes think it constantly moves forward in the best possible way. That's not the case. Navalny always spoke of a beautiful future for Russia. That's why today, this week, is so deeply tragic because it's very hard to imagine the opposition recovering its footing very quickly after this. This is a terrible, terrible blow.",

Indeed, they define themselves in many ways in opposition to it. Instead, they prefer to continue the war as they would say, to root out Hamas even though there's very little evidence that's an achievable goal.And indeed there's a chance you could see a widening of the war to Lebanon. On the Palestinian side Hamas is clearly unwilling to compromise, to even accept the notion of a Jewish state. And the Palestinian Authority is much too weak, even if it were inclined to deal with Israel. So you don't have any of the ingredients. So peacemakers, diplomats can do whatever they want, but they have virtually nothing to work with. And the situation, the answer is not to go home.

Now, ideally, given what you said, Fareed, there could be some kind of, quote-unquote, arrangement between Israel around possibly Hezbollah, that would allow people to go back some sort of informal de facto truce or cease-fire. I don't think the only alternative is for Israel to widen the war militarily. I certainly hope not, but I'm not going to sit here and rule out that possibility either.

What Imran Khan really taught them -- he's not a politician, but he was a mentor to a nation and he has built a nation and its -- was an indication of what he -- what he signifies, what he stood for. And what he stood for was that you have a right in this country. You have a right to justice. You have a right to education. You have a right to health systems. You belong to this country. He's better. He has built a nation. And I think the happiest moment my brother had was the 8th February when people came out and understood what he was trying to do for them.

They had no candidates, by the way, no party symbol, no candidates. They had no knowledge of who the candidate was. They came looking for their own symbol, and they came out, families came out.
