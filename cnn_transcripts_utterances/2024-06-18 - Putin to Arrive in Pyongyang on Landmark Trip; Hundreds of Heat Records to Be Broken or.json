The U.S. and others believe Kim Jong-un's regime is supplying Moscow with munitions to use against Ukraine. Well, CNN's Mike Valerio is with us from Seoul in South Korea.

But actually, I think what most analysts view this as is a trip in order to secure more ammunition for Russia's conflict in Ukraine. Already, even though the Kremlin denies that these kinds of arms transfers are taking place, already the United States, other governments say that millions of rounds of North Korean ammunition has found its way onto the front lines, is being used by Russian forces. They have a very high rate of fire, something like 10,000 rounds every day. And Russian factories are not able to sort of supply that. And so Putin has to look elsewhere for ammunition supplies. And North Korea, frankly, is one of the few countries in the world that has the right kind of ammunition and is willing to sell it to Moscow. And so that's why it's suddenly a country that is so important to Moscow. Well, look, much has been made, Becky, of this idea that Putin hasn't been there for 24 years. Well, there's a reason for that and that's because not that it was closed as an option to him but it just wasn't a foreign policy priority. It is now.

When the forecast calls for temperatures to exceed 32 degrees Celsius, that is certainly a concern for local officials. That's why folks here in Burlington have opened up several what they call cooling centers. An example:  library, city hall, some of the non-profits opening up their air conditioned space for anybody who needs it, particularly unhoused individuals who may be here in the community. There's about a third of the state's population here in Vermont, Becky, does not have any air conditioning. That's because this part of the country, typically, it gets to enjoy cooler summers. However, with this extraordinary weather event, there is concern that some of those people may let their guard down, especially those that may have either younger or older people with them. And that is who these warnings are being directed to. Officials here, not just in Vermont but really all of New England, New England recommending that folks who need those spaces to turn to those spaces because it can start. Even though right now it is still relative -- (AUDIO GAP) -- shortly, the forecast calling for the daytime highs to be higher. But also -- and this is kind of the extraordinary part -- for the overtime lows to be higher, basically not allowing for that overnight cooling period. And when you have not just one but two, potentially three days in a row of the unforgiving, humid, sweltering heat, then that is the -- that has that deadly potential, as we said, especially for younger people.

Now Israel was quick to respond. They have been to the U.N. human rights chief in the past when he's been critical of what they're doing in Gaza. Israel has said that, through this report, failed to explicitly mention the cruelty and barbarity and terrorism of Hamas and Hezbollah.

That has been very selectively edited. Republicans and conservative media are really making a huge deal of this all the time because they know that voters are concerned about the president's age and whether he is healthy enough and cognitive enough to serve out a full second term. At the same time, there are plenty of instances of Trump mixing up people's words and having his own senior moments.",
