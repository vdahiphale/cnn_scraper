      "sentences": "Good afternoon. Thanks for joining me. I'm Jim Acosta in for Fredricka Whitfield.We are heading into the home stretch in the race to the White House. The presidential election is now just about one month away, and both campaigns are pushing hard for those still undecided voters and critical battleground states. And with voting already underway in several states, polls, of course, show this race is still very much neck and neck. Both Vice President Kamala Harris, former President Donald Trump are campaigning as some big news stories are reshaping the race as we speak from the war in Lebanon to the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Helene and a surprising jobs report. But it's still unclear how all of this will affect the rest of this race. Today, though, the former president -- the scene of his first assassination attempt in battleground Pennsylvania. Trump is set to hold a rally later today in Butler and the western part of that state. He narrowly survived an attempt on his life on July 13th at that location when a gunman opened fire and a bullet grazed his ear. One attendee at that rally died. Two others were injured. And CNN's Alayna Treene joins us now from Butler, Pennsylvania. Alayna, I know you were there as well. And so, of course, I'm sure you're looking around and trying to figure out whether or not the security precautions are any different this time around. What can you tell us?",

The crowd in Butler today compared to when we were here in July is much bigger than it was back then.Now they have really amped up security day, even just being on the ground and comparing it with my own eyes. I can tell the area over my right shoulder, also where Donald Trump's right shoulder will be when he takes the stage. That is the direction from where the bullets had initially came from during that first assassination attempt by the AGR Buildings that's over there. They have big trucks now lining up to block your view from that. They have far more law enforcement on the ground, both Secret Service and local law enforcement. You can see that with your own eyes, but we're also told that was the plan for today. They have many more barriers. So, they've really amped this up. Now, I can tell you, we were told that Secret Service has created one unit for both their operations and local law enforcement. That did not happen back in July. So that's a new change that they added to make sure that today was more secure. They also have done more with their drone enhancement, to have the drones flying around, something that should have picked up on Thomas Crooks being on top of the roof back then, but did not. So that is also in place today, something that is also different. But look, I talked to many people on the ground, Jim, who told me some of whom were here back in July, some of whom are coming here for the first time, had never been to a Trump rally. They actually told me they weren't that concerned about their safety today, despite what had happened just a couple months ago. They said they believed security would definitely be more in hands. And then also they felt that if Donald Trump was going to come back after getting shot, that they feel like they should be able to do so too. I want you to take a listen to what some of them told me.

They continue to target them in Gaza and they've taken out a number of commanders of Hamas, as they call them over many months now in Lebanon. The fact that it was in Tripoli, in the north of Tripoli, I think is indicative of the fact that Israel, the IDF, the Air Force feel emboldened, encouraged, able, safely able to go after targets that are way up in the north of Lebanon.They've been after targets around Beirut and the Beqaa Valley, Tripoli.

So I think now that's over and the weekend's over, that does sort of open up the space potentially for strikes now. But then you have the October 7th anniversary on Monday. And, of course, people are going to want to come together for that. They're going to want to, you know, join hands and remember all the people who were killed, the 1,200 who were killed. The -- and the more than 100 who are still being held hostage inside Gaza. They're going to want to remember that. So there's a feeling that perhaps the strikes weren't -- on Iran won't happen until after that. But I think it comes down to secrecy.
