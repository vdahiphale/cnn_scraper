Prosecutors just called the police officer who responded to a report that Hunter Biden's gun had been thrown away in a grocery store dumpster in 2018. Before that, Hallie Biden, who was Beau Biden's widow, who then dated Hunter Biden after Beau's death, testified for hours describing how she found and got rid of the gun. She also went into detail about her own drug use while she was dating Hunter Biden. CNN's Paula Reid is outside of the federal courthouse in Delaware.Paula, catch us up. What's the latest here?",

      "sentences": "It's been quite a day here in Wilmington. Hallie Biden just got off the witness stand and she has been, by far, the most significant witness for the prosecution because she was able to share her observations about Hunter Biden's state in October 2018. And the reason that is significant is because, of course, that is the month when he purchased the firearm at the heart of this case. And prosecutors allege that he lied on the form when he purchased it, when he said that he was not using or addicted to illegal drugs.And his other romantic partners, his ex-wife and an ex-girlfriend who testified yesterday, neither one of them were ever able to testify to his condition in October 2018 because they didn't see him. Hallie Biden testified that she believed that he was still using in late October, around October 22nd, 23rd, when she saw him.  But on cross-examination, defense attorneys also got her to concede that she never saw him using drugs. But she did testify that she found drugs and drug paraphernalia, along with the gun at the center of this case, in the trunk of his car on October 23rd. Of course, then she took that gun and threw it in a dumpster. Subsequently, something upon hindsight, she says, was not a good idea. But her testimony has given a little for each side. But so far, she seems to be a strong witness for the prosecution. I was in court earlier, and I can tell you, the jury, they were very attentive. They understood that this was not only his one-time sister-in-law, the widow of his deceased brother, Beau. This is a former romantic partner of Hunter Biden. She testified that Hunter introduced her to crack cocaine, which she used for a period of time. It was a very compelling story that she had to share with the jury. They understood her significance for this case. And let me tell you, they were very attentive, hanging on every word that she said while I was in here. Now, prosecutors were expected to wrap up their case today, but Hallie Biden took a long time to get through that testimony. So it's unclear if they're going to be able to get through their other five witnesses today.",

It seems as if this testimony is somewhat mixed in the sense that there is a lot of evidence to suggest that Hallie Biden thought that Hunter Biden was using drugs at the time that he purchased the firearm in question. But at the same time, she never saw anything, you know, in terms of him using it personally.So I'm not surprised that the jurors are paying a lot of attention and that this testimony is really important.

On the one hand, they're saying that Hunter Biden was rushed in the process and was very quickly filling out this form. And in addition to that, they're suggesting that when Hunter Biden said on the ATF form that he was not a drug user or that he was not an addict that kind of in that rush process.He basically said, well, I'm not using it right now. And in addition to that, he didn't consider himself an addict. And so in that both rush process and in that open question about what the questionnaire actually is asking right - that could be left up to, according to the defense's reasonable interpretation, that this kind of interactive effect should undermine the case that Hunter Biden was acting in a criminal way.",

But I do think what seems to be the case here, and this, of course, has political ramifications too, is that, you know, these jurors are people and we live in a country that has an immense crisis with both mental health, but also with addiction and drug abuse and the like.And so I suspect that the defense is going to attempt to tap into that kind of empathetic response or hope to elicit an empathetic response with themes of that nature, in addition to, you know, going with this line of argument that Hunter Biden was just kind of rushed along.

There's also another reason for it, Turning Point is based in Phoenix, Arizona.Turning Point is a big part of Donald Trump's ground game campaign. They are an outside group. Because of the recent ruling, the FEC lifting up the communications allowing the campaign to coordinate with outside groups.

They've raised an extraordinary amount of money, some $53 million in the immediate day and hours after the conviction.The longer term is a little bit less clear. When you talk to advisers for the former president, they don't want him to dwell on this. They want him to continue to make this election a referendum on the Biden administration, Biden policies there in Phoenix, perhaps, the border policies. But we have all covered Donald Trump for a long time. He often talks about what he wants to talk about, what he thinks works for him. So kind of the bigger question is how much this becomes about him and his convictions. So we will see how much the felon moniker helps. But in a room like that where Kristen is, it absolutely rallies the base. I was in Wisconsin earlier this week talking to Trump supporters. They stand behind him.
