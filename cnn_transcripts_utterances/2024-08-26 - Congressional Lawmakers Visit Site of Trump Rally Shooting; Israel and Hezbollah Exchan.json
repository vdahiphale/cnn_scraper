The two sides exchanging an intense barrage across the border of Lebanon early Sunday, Israel launching preemptive strikes after learning of an imminent Hezbollah attack. The Iran-backed group says that they targeted Israel's military infrastructure with more than 300 rockets. Retaliation, they say, for Israel killing a top military commander in Beirut last month.",

      "sentences": "That's right, Brianna, and the fact that those negotiations were still ongoing hours after these cross-border attacks happened between Israel and Hezbollah, some of the most significant that we have seen since the beginning of the war, that may be the most positive sign so far about the fact that these negotiations are real and they are ongoing. Whether or not they're actually going to lead to a deal, though, is another question entirely.U.S. officials have consistently projected optimism about these talks, and they are doing so once again, saying that progress was made over the weekend to bring Israel and Hamas's positions closer together. But we don't know how substantive that progress actually was. And yesterday, those meetings in Cairo ended with senior officials leaving Cairo, leaving lower-level delegations to continue the work, but no deal still in sight. We know that those negotiations are going to be continuing over the next several days. They are working on the details, the implementation details of these talks. But we also know that big sticking points still remain, including over major issues like Israeli troop presence along the Philadelphi Corridor, along the Gaza-Egypt border. What is clear, though, is that for now, this region has headed off a potentially major escalation, and it is remarkable how quickly all of that happened. Yesterday early morning, we saw over 100 Israeli fighter jets in the skies over southern Lebanon, striking dozens of Hezbollah rocket launcher sites. Hezbollah, about an hour and a half later, firing hundreds of rockets and drones into northern Israel. No Israeli military bases were hit, according to the Israeli military. And the Israeli -- both sides are basically claiming success at this point. Hezbollah saying they were successful in their attack. Israel saying they were successful in fending off that attack. And for now, that sense of victory from both sides is what is de-escalating the situation for now. But again, there is still that possibility of Iranian retaliation that is still very much looming over this region -- Brianna.",

Durov is the founder of the encrypted messaging app Telegram, which is known for its unfiltered content. His arrest is renewing the ongoing debate over free speech on social media.CNN business writer Clare Duffy is following the latest. Clare, a lot of folks in the United States may not be familiar with Telegram, but it is one of the most popular apps in the world. Why was this guy arrested? CLARE DUFFY, CNN BUSINESS WRITER: Well, Boris, for some background, as you said there, Pavel Durov is the billionaire founder of Telegram, and he's a really interesting character. He was born in Russia but exiled in 2014. He now lives in Dubai and also is a citizen of France. And he likes to post pictures of his world travels, lots of shirtless selfies on Instagram. He claims to have more than 100 biological children after he donated his sperm over a decade ago. And he's also grown Telegram into one of the most popular and important messaging apps in the world, 950 million users around the world. And Telegram is encrypted, which means that the company doesn't actually have a lot of oversight or control in terms of how people are using it. And that's by design. Durov has become a sort of champion for free speech. And it's made Telegram a really important tool in places like Russia and Iran where free speech is curtailed. It's also been used in Ukraine among citizens to warn each other about air raids. But that privacy also means that the app has become really popular among terrorist groups, extremist groups, drug traffickers, and other types of criminal groups. And French prosecutors are now saying that they've arrested Durov on charges of conspiring to aid, being complicit in aiding fraudsters, money launderers, drug traffickers, and people spreading child sexual abuse content. And as you said there, what's really interesting is that this case gets at the heart of a debate that cuts across the entire social media ecosystem. How do you balance protecting free speech with protecting the safety of the users on this platform? So it'll be interesting, Boris, to see how this plays out and what more we hear from French prosecutors.",

Friday between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. Those are really the hot spots. There's some return hot spots, too, but let's start with getting you there. If you look at those, they say it's a little bit better if you can go earlier or if you can go later than that. Although, I'm going to say, you know this, are you in a travel battleground, right? Because there are certain places where this is a deal. You know, L.A. to San Diego, tough, tough, tough. D.C., a lot of places you have to go. There are many places. Cross Bronx Expressway. There are all sorts of places that will be very tough. But if you do, as our friend Boris said a short while ago, pack your patience and plan a little bit, you can get there. Just be cool.
