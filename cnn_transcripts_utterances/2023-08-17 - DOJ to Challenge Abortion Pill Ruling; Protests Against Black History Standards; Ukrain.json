It will make it harder for women to access this drug, go, as I said, from just seven weeks of pregnancy. They wouldn't be able to get it all the way into ten weeks. A non-physician wouldn't be able to prescribe it, as happens now. You wouldn't have any telehealth access or access by mail.But, to get to your core question of, what would happen at the Supreme Court, it was an extremely conservative lower court judge who first started all this with the ruling that said that even the 2000 year approval was wrong. And it was a very conservative panel of the Fifth Circuit. But we're not dealing with a liberal Supreme Court anymore. We haven't been dealing with that for decades. But we certainly have the most conservative Supreme Court in decades about to hear this case. I do think, though, Phil and Poppy, that there's a chance it might not go as extreme as their abortion ruling had gone last year, just because of what's at stake here.

And we were with them as they got and announced the capture of the first village in about two or three weeks in the southeastern part of their counteroffensive, an advance that seemed partially aided by cluster munitions. Unclear who supplied them. But, remember, the U.S. has recently given them to the Ukrainians, and they appear to be in use.Here's what we saw. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WALSH (voice over): There may be ruin around them, but their direction is forward. We're with the 35th Ukraine Marines. The first supporters to get to outskirts of Borodianka. Yet another village announced liberated Wednesday. The victories may be small but are constant. WALSH (on camera): So, just down here, Borodianka, yet another town taken as the counteroffensive does move forward. We were just seeing the neighboring village taken last week, but they keep moving. With that much incoming we're getting out of here as quick as we can. While they control Borodianka, the Russians do everything they can to make it a nightmare for the Ukrainians to be there. WALSH (voice over): The unit showed us the intense fight captured by drone. This, their tank, advancing, dropping a string of anti-mine explosives behind it, they said, which then, once it turned, detonated. The unit release a video of them in the town Wednesday of how they turned their firepower on what was once a Russian stronghold that shelled them. The company commander recalls many more Russians hidden there than he expected. Very many died, he says, especially when they started to run. And when they held houses, lots of them died there. But they were caught as they fled. The smoke around Russians likely made by cluster munitions. Ukraine has said it is already using some rounds controversially supplied by the United States. We could not confirm if these fights here with a new American cluster bombs, but the losses suffered were clear, and they say their use is less of an ethical dilemma when you're in this brutal fight. I don't understand it, he says. That side is using whatever they want. Our people are dying from all this and it's OK. When the other side die, it's not? I don't understand. This footage shows how young some in the assault were. He has no time for western analysts who say this should be moving faster. I would say they could always come to me as a guest and fight with me, he says. If someone believes that you can flight over the mine field on a broom like in \"Harry Potter,\" it doesn't happen in a real fight. If you don't understand that, you can sit in your armchair and eat your popcorn. WALSH (on camera): Yes, I smell it. WALSH (voice over): Out here, the last month of advances feel both empty and grueling, littered now with Russian dead. They haven't moved perhaps as far as it is felt. WALSH (on camera): These just empty farm fields in which many have died to take each kilometer. WALSH (voice over): The Russians mined so hard here, they use this machine to do it. So much damage done, it's hard to imagine what plans Moscow had for here at all had they kept it. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
