      "sentences": "It's 7wherever you are in the world, this is your \"First Move.\" And a warm welcome to \"First Move\" and here's today's need to know. Clooney's concerned, the actor and political donor joining calls for Joe Biden to exit the presidential race. Military manufacturing, the U.S. president urging NATO members to ramp up industrial production to help keep pace with Russia's weapons supplies. Camp Korea. Russian children holidaying in North Korea met with chores and propaganda. And ecstatic England. The three lions roaring into the Euro 2024 football final. All that and plenty more coming up. But first, President Biden hosting NATO leaders as the crisis surrounding his re-election campaign threatens to overshadow the talks and other urgent international issues. Now, eight congressional Democrats have publicly urged the president to step aside from the 2024 race. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said he could still reconsider his decision to keep going. And the Democratic super donor George Clooney has urged the president to voluntarily step aside. The actor has been one of Biden's biggest supporters. And just last month, he led a Hollywood fundraiser that brought in $28 million for Biden's campaign. The risks of staying in the race were laid bare when one of his party senators warned that Donald Trump could win in a \"landslide.\" From the White House. Kayla Tausche has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KAYLA TAUSCHE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  With world leaders at hand, President Biden eager to get back to business as usual. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  Stronger supply chains, stronger economy, stronger military, and a stronger nation. TAUSCHE (voice-over):  And the White House wants to move on from speculation about the president's political future. But for Democrats, the domino effect continues. Actor George Clooney penning an op-ed in \"The New York Times\" calling on Biden to step aside. Writing, it's devastating to say it, but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe big F-ing deal Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. Filmmaker Rob Reiner joining Clooney writing on X, democracy is facing an existential threat. We need someone younger to fight back. Joe Biden must step aside. And House Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi noncommittal. REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA):  It's up to the president to decide if he is going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision because time is running short. TAUSCHE (voice-over):  And Colorado Senator Michael Bennet on CNN became the first Senate Democrat to break with Biden publicly, Bennett calling the state of the race very worrisome. SEN. MICHAEL BENNET (D-CO):  Donald Trump is on track, I think, to win this election and maybe win it by a landslide. And the White House in the time since that disastrous debate, I think, has done nothing to really demonstrate that they have a plan to win this election. TAUSCHE (voice-over):  An adviser to the president said few in Biden's inner circle are concerned enough to pierce Biden's firm position. Only family could do that, and only if there's hard data. The adviser telling CNN of his wife and sister, Jill and Valerie won't let him go down in flames. Since the debate, CNN's poll of polls shows Trump leading Biden by five points. The first time this year, the candidates are separated by a margin of more than three points. And some donors planning events in Chicago and Florida say they're now up in the air. But for Biden, it's full steam ahead for now.",

There are a lot ofpeople who believe that if there came a time for the leaders in Congress to go to President Biden and say that it's really -- that he ought to not run for re-election, she would be one of the most important voices. And why her comments were interesting is because the White House and the president himself and the letter to lawmakers earlier this week said, look, this discussion is over. It's time to stop talking about the debate. I'm running for re-election, and that's the end of it. When you have Nancy Pelosi and other senior members of Congress saying, well, no, it isn't over. That is a real clash. It's not only shows the level of concern there now is about the possibility of the president winning November's election against Donald Trump. And you heard Senator Bennet talk about the possibility of a landslide for Trump, these are splits which if Biden does run, he does manage to cling on to his nomination, they're going to be used by Trump to say that even his own Democratic Party colleagues think he's too old to be president in the second term.

The president has scheduled an interview for Monday evening, the first night of the Republican convention on NBC. If, for example, there was a massive gaffe in that interview that doesn't go very well, that would only create more momentum against him. So, I did think that it was going to end this week, but now, perhaps we could see this going on. And that's one reason why Biden wants to get past this. He wants to get back to the general election because time is running short. After the Republican Convention, there's going to be about a month before the Democratic Convention. And practically, if we get through another week or two, there really isn't that much time for Democrats to somehow come together and pick another nominee.",

Well, actually, in the last few years, European allies have really drastically stepped-up defense, defense spending. 10 years ago, at the Wales Summit, only three allies spent the 2 percent of GDP that they needed to on defense. Now, 23 of them do. So, that's a huge increase. Allies committed today to increase their industrial capacity, which you mentioned, which is a really important part of this. We've seen what a protracted war in Ukraine looks like, NATO allies now need to make sure their own industrial bases are a fit for purpose, both to support Ukraine now and into the future, and to bolster their own defenses (INAUDIBLE).",

Tech giant Amazon announcing that all of its electricityused by the firm across its operations last year was matched with renewable energy sources. The company hitting this key climate goal seven years ahead of schedule, thanks in part to billions of dollars invested in over 500 wind and solar projects. Amazon also saying it has more than 24,000 electric powered delivery vehicles on the roads across the globe as we speak. All this is important because Amazon's units like cloud computing, fulfillment centers, and package delivery operations are extremely energy intensive, not to mention, of course, the demand for data centers and the computing power required for technologies like generative A.I. Now, not everyone, though, at the firm impressed by the company's latest data, a group, Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, argues that the firm's renewable investments aren't directly cleaning up Amazon's operations. Joining us now is Kara Hurst, Amazon's chief sustainability officer. And I'm glad to have you with us because you can explain what's going on, Kara. What does this actually mean? The word matching, I think, stands out. How much of what you've achieved, and congratulations, is about cleaning up your direct operations versus perhaps investing in offsets credits or clean energy that's provided perhaps to a grid?",

This is something -- in 2019 we committed to the Climate Pledge, which of course is our goal to power -- really look at our net zero operations trying to get to zero by 2040. And then, looking at renewable energy, we had set the goal to achieve 100 percent by 2030 and now, announcing that we're there seven years early. So, we have over 500 projects, as you mentioned, globally across 27 countries. And really, we've been investing in these projects, 300 of which are actually on our own buildings across the world.

So, we're looking at sustainable concrete. We're looking at building more efficiently. We're looking at steel.
