Tonight, the skies are still lit up in parts of Israel as the Israeli military carries out a fierce response in Gaza. It is in retaliation, they say, for the unprecedented coordinated terrorist offensive carried out by Hamas on Saturday that has continued for the last 48 hours. Israel says at least 900 people have been killed by Hamas. Palestinian officials say over 500 people have been killed in Gaza.It is not just the death toll, though, that is harrowing. The terror group says they are holding more than 100 Israelis hostage. Israel has not confirmed the exact number. Hamas now threatening they will start executing hostages if attacks on Gaza are launched without warning. We now know from two sources that the Qatari government has been in talks with Hamas about those hostages and U.S. officials are coordinating with the Qataris. We're still awaiting remarks from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. We have been expecting that any minute. We will bring that to you obviously live. Earlier today, you may have seen Clarissa Ward taking cover from rocket attacks. I want to show a little bit of what happened to her and her team earlier. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Clarissa, explain what happened in that place and also what you have been seeing throughout the day because Israeli defense spokesperson said that Israel is in control now or has control over their sovereign territory, though there still may be pockets of Hamas terrorists waiting to attack on Israeli soil and more trying to come across still, but they believe that large-scale attacks have stopped.

      "sentences": "From what we've seen throughout the day, it has not slowed down at all. Not in the area where we were this morning, not here in Ashkelon. And it's important to remember, it's difficult for the IDF. They can run around with these rocket launchers, set them off from any given location, and then quickly move on to the next place, which makes it incredibly difficult to respond or retaliate effectively. We heard one Israeli media station telling people that they should collect enough food to potentially spend the next few days inside.And this is all happening with the kind of looming specter of some kind of an announcement, potentially from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, about some possibly ground invasion, is what a lot of people are speculating one might be looking at. Certainly, we've seen a great deal of amour and personnel, Israeli military moving towards the border area earlier on today. We were at another area where we saw a large staging ground for tanks. So clearly something is afoot, and no one knows exactly what. And of course this ever-present fear of what this would mean for those hostages, particularly in the light of this latest threat from Hamas, that they would begin potentially executing and broadcasting that execution of civilian hostages, really kind of making it even a murkier picture as to how Israel can try to thread the needle of doing what it says it needs to do in Gaza, while at the same time trying to protect the lives of those who may be still held there. And just on the peace, you mentioned as well, Anderson, about the number of hostages and how we really don't have a good sense. The IDF has now come out and says that they've notified 30 families, or the families of at least 30 hostages. That doesn't mean there aren't more, but it certainly means there are at least 30 families who will not be sleeping well tonight, Anderson. Oh, you can just see behind me there. That's Gaza in that direction there.",

It all says sort of blended together, but 60 hours plus since this surprise attack occurred. Has the posture you're seeing among Israeli forces on the ground where you are, is it different in the last 12 hours than it was, you know, 24, 48 hours ago? I mean, is there a sense that the chance of there being actual Hamas terrorists hiding on the ground somewhere in Sderot around there, is that, has that reduced significantly? ROBERTSONWe've seen areas of clusters of 20 or more tanks. We weren't seeing that 24 hours ago. We're seeing many more troops out on patrol, really experienced Israeli Defense Force troops, the older troops, not the younger recruits, the older troops in the open jeeps with the guns pointing out at the ready with their night vision goggles on at the ready, really experienced Israeli Defense Forces out on patrol, multiple groups of them on patrol. So, we are seeing close to the border here with Gaza, a heavier and more ready deployment. But the sense also as well is that there's more and more and more of it coming in. We've literally seen this coming past us here. What I can see on the military vehicles is equipment that's going to be offloaded at some of the sites we can expect to be set up around here, the local headquarters, the artillery sites that get dug in around here with the howitzers. We've seen some of the heavy mechanized artillery guns. They look like tanks. They're much bigger. That looks like the lights in this neighborhood have just gone off. It's not clear why, but that's the nature of the situation at the moment. The paraphernalia, the military paraphernalia, if you will, that is increasing and we're just seeing more and more and more of it come in, Anderson.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, first of all, it's Itay. That's the correct pronunciation. And Anderson, thank you for having me and allowing me to amplify my voice on this platform. The call Saturday morning was, of course, a very short call. He was under bombardment coming in, basically saying that they are under attack. And that was the last we heard of him. What we do know is that he was active and was seen two hours afterwards. But beyond that point, no one has seen him.So, we have received official from the IDF claiming that his official status is missing in action. What does that mean? It means that nobody is able to identify him since a couple of hours in Saturday morning. No one has seen him in the hospital. He's not been identified and nobody has seen him in a log, you know, deceased. So, the only thing that the IDF knows to say is that we don't know where he is. And I think after 60 hours of being in Israel, I think it's a fair assumption to say he might not be in Israel as we speak. And as a US citizen growing up in New York City, my children are also US citizens and they are Israeli citizens as well. And here's the challenge, I think, of someone like myself. How do we view ourselves and who do we want to actively take part in helping us finding our son?",

We are trying to put the pieces together of the big puzzle, what we do not know happened with Itay over the last 60 hours, talking to different people that are in hospitals that might have seen him, that should have seen him, that are close to other people that might have seen him. There is also the unit itself that are trying to put the pieces together themselves. Hand in hand, to try to put the pieces together, they still have to do a lot of fighting.And I think, at least today, the priority is first to fight back and to do what is needed and then take care of the injured, of finding those that are missing. It's unfortunate, and going back to the United States, the resources that the United States has in its possession is second to none. And if the United States makes a decision that it understands that, yes, these are citizens that are Israelis, but also Americans, and if they are first Americans, then they should be doing much more in order to find these citizens that are missing.",

As you mentioned, a U.S. aircraft carrier has been deployed to the region. Scores of fighter jets have also moved to the area. And this is, of course, in part deterrence. And also, in part just wanting to avoid a situation where the conflict ends up spilling beyond Israel's borders.That is a huge priority for the administration right now. But, Anderson, as you mentioned, we've heard the president personally pledge more aid to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. And there is very much this complicating factor on Capitol Hill. Where we are in a situation without a permanent speaker of the House. And really without a resolution in hand. Lawmakers and U.S. officials that we have been speaking to over the last 48 hours or so. They are basically saying this is a unique situation. We've not been in this position before. So, they are really going to have to figure out how a potential future aid package to Israel.
