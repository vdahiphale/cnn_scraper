We'll have the very latest for you.Plus, we're learning more about the five people killed in a Colorado nightclub. And two men are now hailing -- hailed as heroes. And China doubles down on zero-COVID. But at what cost? We'll take a closer look live from Beijing. First, we begin with a massive upset of the World Cup. Saudi Arabia just slammed the favored Argentina team 2-1. It didn't start out that way. Argentina dominated the first half, leading one nil at the break. Lionel Messi made history as the first Argentina to score -- Argentina to score in four World Cups. However, the Saudi squad came back, sending nearly all 880 fans into a frenzy. FIFA ranks Saudi Arabia as 51st in the world. Let's get to Doha, where Amanda Davies is standing by in shock, I'm sure. Surely, even you're shocked by this one.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max. I have to tell you, it was absolutely brilliant sitting here watching at the stadium. But in the Souq here in Doha, Souq Waqif, and you could literally hear the shockwaves, the reverberations echo all the way through the buildings behind us. I have to say, there were some fairly excited journalists sitting in the studio next to us, absolutely not expecting, but certainly celebrating this result.It is without doubt one of the biggest shocks in World Cup history, because the discrepancy between these two teams really cannot be underestimated. This is an Argentinian side who were on a 36 match, unbeaten run, setting all the way back to June 2019, and they were widely touted as one of the favorites to win this competition, not only because of their record, but of course, they are Argentina's -- Lionel Messi's Argentina. And this is the event which is widely expected to be his last World Cup. It's the one major piece of silverware he hasn't won. He, of course, reached the final, was beaten in the final with Argentina by Germany in Brazil in 2014. And things have been moving in the right direction. They got the monkey off their back, finally winning the Copper America, beating their great rivals, Brazil, last time out. And so hopes have been really, really high. But you have to give so much credit to this Saudi Arabian team. They battled hard, they defended hard, but they also played some really good football. So many people had written them off their opening match at the last World Cup in Russia. They were thumped five nil by Russia. That is what we are talking about in terms of the development of this team over the last few years. They do have a coach Herve Renard who knows how to play tournament football. He led Morocco in the last World Cup in 2018. He's also guided two different sides to victory at the Copper America. And you suspect from the large number of Saudi fans here, there really is going to be a party here in Doha tonight. And if you just take a step back and look at this from the political perspective, bearing in mind, we're sitting in Qatar. There was the Saudi blockade here until January 2021. There was no travel or crossing of people over these borders until that point. So a really, really special moment that is definitely being celebrated by the Saudis. But commiserations all round for Argentina.",

Government officials now say Monday's earthquake has left at least 268 people dead and more than 1,000 injured. The governor of West Java says the majority of deaths were children in school when their buildings collapsed. Rescuers are digging through rubble looking for anyone who might have survived. But the weather could make those efforts even more treacherous. Forecasters warn heavy rain could trigger landslides in the region. Let's get to CNN's Paula Hancocks.

Meanwhile, Ukrainians endured more blackouts on Monday. The head of Ukraine's biggest energy supplier warns unplanned outages could continue until the end of March. A senior Russian senator has a message for the west supplying weapons to Ukraine and a desire for peace are, quote, mutually exclusive.

      "sentences": "Well, I think the Russian senator's message is very clear is that he believes, or he's trying to convey, Max, that he believes that the west is actually the side that is fueling this conflict. He says that western nations are the ones that are essentially keeping Ukraine in the fight here with those weapons deliveries that they've been doing.At the same time, of course, calling for negotiations, calling for peace to happen. But he obviously said that this was mutually exclusive. So this is definitely the clear message that Konstantin Kosachev was trying to send. He is actually a very well-known senator here in Russia who's very public, who's very unspoken as well. And, you know, it is quite an interesting message, though, because, of course, it comes on the heels of the fact that the Russians themselves have said that they've mobilized well over 300,000 men, many of which are already or have already been sent to Ukraine, many others of which will be sent to Ukraine in the future. And Vladimir Putin said that it's actually more than that and that other people are volunteering as well. Russia, of course, also continues to pour military equipment into Ukraine as well. And at the same time, you hear the Russian senator there saying that he believes that Western nations are the ones that need to stop providing military gear to the Ukrainians because it's something that would be an impediment to any sort of negotiations taking place. It's unclear whether or not something of that, of course, is in the cards. And then you had what you spoke about there before is you have the fact that the Russian military does still appear to be shelling a lot of places in Ukraine. The place near Melitopol that you were just talking about is called Nikopol. That is indeed right across from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Of course, one, that's of great concern, not just to the International Atomic Energy Agency and the international community, but where both the Russian and the Ukrainian side have said that a major incident in that place is something that is -- that could happen or that there's a big danger of something like that happen if the fighting and the shelling continues. So certainly, it seems as though, on the one hand, you have a very prominent Russian senator speaking about the west having to standdown on weapons deliveries to Ukraine. At the same time, you do see a lot of fighting going on, not just down there in the south of Ukraine, but, of course, as we've heard from the Ukrainian military, in many other parts of that country as well, Max.",

      "sentences": "Is China's zero-COVID policy working? There's increasing evidence of the strict measures are taking a toll across China, both a terrible human and economic cost. But despite that, the government has doubled down. This is the last we heard from the President on it in a substantial way. This was last month.Xi Jinping saying, \"We prioritize the people and their lives above all else, and tenaciously pursued dynamic zero-COVID policy in launching all out people's war against the virus.\" A very determined stance, but what's the reality? This is the picture for COVID across Asia over the last seven days, up more than 50 percent in China, when in many other parts of Asia, they're actually on their way down. Let's also consider, the vaccination rate is very high in China. As you can see, 90 percent fully vaccinated. But a lot of experts pointing to the fact that they haven't relied on any foreign vaccines, particularly mRNA vaccines, and they say this may be playing a role here. Let's bring in CNN's Selina Wang. She is live in Beijing this hour. We've come to you so many times in recent months to try to describe what it's like to live in China under these conditions, but what's it like right now after, you know, so much pressure over such a sustained period of time?",

      "sentences": "Well, Max, I think the key way to describe life in China right now, not just here in Beijing, but in cities across China where they're ramping up these COVID restrictions, is uncertainty. Because at any moment, you don't know if you are building your compound, your neighborhood is going to go in a lockdown, if all the stores around you are going to shut, and if you could be sent to a mass quarantine facility because you're identified as a closed contact or a coffee case.So here in Beijing, they have urged residents of their largest district, Chaoyang, which has millions of people, they are urging them to stay at home. They're shutting down major public venues, and they've also increased the requirement for a COVID test in order to enter any public venue. So before it was every 72 hours, now that's been increased to every 48 hours. So I spent a lot of my time waiting in these long lines for that mandatory PCR test. And since close to the start of the pandemic, your daily life is also dictated by the color of the health code on your phone. So you've got to scan that code in order to enter any public venue. And if that code is green, then you're allowed to go in. This allows the government to contact, trace, and to surveil and track virtually all 1.4 billion people in China. So we're seeing these restrictions ramp up here in Beijing and other major cities, in the southern metropolis -- metropolises as well, in Guangzhou and Chongqing. And it varies from more full, harsh lockdowns to more selective targeted lockdowns that we're seeing, like here in Beijing. But very much, there's anxiety and uncertainty about what the next day will bring. It's impossible to do any planning in a situation like this, Max.",

We are seeing a repetition of these horrific stories of tragedy and suffering because of the draconian draconian execution of these lockdowns. For instance, when communities and buildings are sealed off, people are not allowed in and out.So that means when people, people need emergency help, that it means that the emergency ambulance that they can't get to the hospital in time. So there have been so many reported cases of deaths because they can't get that critical care needed in lockdown, not to mention the difficulty that people face trying to get daily essentials, trying to get enough food. So there was a recent case of a three year old boy in Lanzhou, China, and there's video of his father desperately trying to revive his young son, but he's not able to get him to the hospital in time because of the COVID checkpoints, the COVID lockdowns and the boy later dies. That case, Max, actually triggered protests in Lanzhou. We've seen other very disturbing cases of people jumping from their windows to their death, facing mental health issues and lockdowns. Just numerous, countless cases of tragedy. And what's documented online before it's quickly censored by Chinese social media is just the tip of the iceberg of the difficulties that people are facing. And this frustration is only mounting because now we are in three years of these type of draconian lockdowns.",
