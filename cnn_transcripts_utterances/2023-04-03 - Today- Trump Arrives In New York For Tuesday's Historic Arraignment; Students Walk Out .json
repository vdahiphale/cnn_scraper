The New York City Mayor and the NYPD Commissioner will make a public safety announcement the next hour.And Donald Trump is the first former president to face criminal -- and a criminal indictment. All of this is connected to his alleged role in a hush money payment scheme and cover up involving adult film star, Stormy Daniels. As of this moment, the actual grand jury indictment is under seal. CNN has asked the judge to release it. Trump's legal team says they plan to challenge every potential issue in that document. CNN's Kara Scannell is outside the court in New York City for us. Kara, you know, officials in New York are set to make a public announcement that we're just hearing, the Commissioner and the Mayor. What are you learning?",

Now sources tell Brynn Gingras that there are no credible threats against the courthouse or in the area and there's no threat of disruptors, but they will give the public a briefing of what to expect.Now behind the scenes, there's a lot that's also happening. There's restrictions on the 15th floor and the courthouse behind me over my shoulder. That is where the former president will be arranged -- come in self-surrender midday. And they were speeding up this process. He may or may not have a mugshot taken. There are questions about that. He's likely to be fingerprinted. And then he will walk down a public hallway where other defendants, everyone from drug dealers to his former chief financial officer and go into the courtroom and face the judge. That's when the judge will ask him to enter a plea and Trump's attorneys say that he will plead not guilty. From there, Trump is expected to head back to the airport and then back to Mar-a-Lago where he said he will address the nation at 8:15, Sara?",

And I was actually just told by a source that he is likely to meet with his lawyers while he is in Trump Tower. He will spend the night there before heading to the courthouse on Tuesday. Now, as you noted, and as Kara noted, he will come back almost immediately after that arraignment to deliver remarks. We will be there at Mar-a-Lago at his resort. And I am told by sources, this will be the former president opportunity to really take control of the narrative. Of course, we have heard him from the last several weeks calling this a political witch hunt a hoax.

And you see 23 percent say a minor role. Some think no role, and there's also an element of people still they really are not sure.CNN's Jeff Zeleny joins us now for much more on this.

Of course, you cannot divorce politics from any of this, because we are talking about the former president here who of course, is a current candidate for the White House. But when you look at the findings of our new poll, take a look at this, 60 percent of Americans, some six and 10 of Americans support the overall indictment here. And 40 percent are against it.That's largely driven by sort of some common views from Republicans, of course, they're opposed Democrats support. But Independents largely follow this rule. So that is so interesting, that 60 percent support. And we should be clear, we do not know exactly what is in the indictment. This is just based on the broad confines of a familiar storyline of a hush money payment that we've been talking about for more than six years now. So six in 10 Americans support that. But there is so much more interesting findings in our poll this morning, that really speaks to the dynamic of the politics going into this, Kate.",

What do you think about the strength of democracy, and 31 percent of Americans say that it strengthens it, 31 percent say it weakens, 23 percent it has no effect at all.So divided, Americans clearly divided among party lines, in familiar lines on this. But this is a historic proceeding, no question. So we cannot -- not take stock of all of that. But there is no doubt as we go forward here. Democracy is at the core of this. And the -- he obviously has other cases pending in Georgia and in federal court as well. So this is something that will be a through line of all this conversation today, Kate.",

The defense lawyers are going to say, but we're in New York State court right now, New York State law is what applies.

However, there are special laws here in New York State that say, you can what we call toll the statute of limitations, meaning put it on hold.First of all, while someone's living continuously in another state, the argument would be Trump was living continuously at the White House, and then at Mar-a-Lago.

First of all, he is a former prosecutor, used to actually work at the Manhattan DA's office, nothing wrong about that, nothing unusual about that many, many judges are former prosecutors. He's been on the bench since 2006. So he's experienced, he really gets rave reviews from both sides of the aisle. Prosecutors, defense lawyers say he's a totally straight shooter.Now, the reason he is on this case, it's not just a coincidence that the same judge who handled the Trump Org PACs trial last year and the Allen Weisselberg case, also got this case. There's 50 some judges, it would be a remarkable coincidence. It appears that what prosecutors did is file this case as a related case, meaning, OK, this case relates to this prior case, therefore, we believe the same judge should be put on it. If that is what was done here and it appears that it was, watch for defense lawyers to challenge that. They're going to say their job shopping, essentially. And this case should not go to that same judge who had this prior case. This case should go back into the wheel for random assignment. So look for that as well.",
