And I -- and clearly, that is in part why it's been forced pressure from the international community, but pressure also from Hamas about negotiations with the hostages not to launch a ground incursion at this time. The pressure point really seems to be coming down to a point right now because one of the key things has been fuel along with humanitarian aid to get into Gaza. And as recently as last night, the spokesman for Prime Minister Netanyahu, Mark Ruggerfeld(ph) said, look, no fuel going in because we believe Hamas is going to use it for military means. Today, we heard from the head of the IDF, General Halevi saying, look, we can consider fuel, but only if it's used specifically to help the health of civilians, not at all for it to go to -- to go to Hamas.

Then it's quite easy to see how that's going to hamper the decision. But in terms of the troops being ready and positioned, nothing actually is changing on the ground in that context. And the airstrikes have continued today. The health -- although health officials in Gaza say 700 people killed, the more than 500 targeted strikes by the IDF in the past 24 hours or so, they say, against Hamas leadership.

It's averaging around 20 trucks, three days of 20 trucks over the border with preciousfood, water systems, equipment and medicine and health supplies. But that is a drop in the ocean. We need to be getting at least 100 trucks over every day. Prior to the conflict, just to put it in context, there were 400 trucks of supplies going in and out of Gaza. How do we do this? I mean, some parts of Gaza, we are distributing supplies. The supplies gone in are being distributed, rest assured. But we had prepositioned stocks in parts of Gaza prior to the conflict. Some of those are inaccessible because it is too dangerous to get there. What will we do? What we're doing, now, operating under a humanitarian imperative, where every child must not be a target. Every child must be safe. We are doing our best to get access to those children and to bring them the supplies they so desperately need. But without a humanitarian cease-fire, we cannot hope to even reach all those children who need us now.",

This is the first time in modern history that there is such human suffering and the world is not even calling for a cease-fire. So the silence is deafening. And to many in our region, it makes the Western world complicit through their support and through the cover that they give Israel, that it's just - - it's right to defend itself. Many in the Arab world are looking at the Western world not just tolerating this but aiding and abetting it. And this is just horrendous and deeply, deeply disappointing to all of us.
