      "sentences": "The Pentagon won't be specific on how soon this advanced U.S. anti-ballistic missile system will arrive in Israel, but Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did tell his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Gallant, that it would be there in quote, the coming days. The THAAD system, as it's called, Terminal High Altitude Aerial Defense System, is one of the most advanced U.S. systems for intercepting ballistic missiles, short, medium, and long range. It shoots them down in their final dive towards their target, so about 100 or slightly more miles out, but it can detect them more than 10 times as far based on its radar.And crucially, it can work with not only the Navy destroyers that are operating in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and intercepted ballistic missiles of their own on October 1st and April 13th, but it can also work with Israel's own complex and layered air defense system. There is the shorter Iron Dome, the medium range David Sling, and then the long range Arrow. So the THAAD system, when it's deployed, when it's set up in Israel with 100 U.S. troops, about 100 or so operating it, it will add not only a quality system, but crucially, it will add quantity, simply more interceptor missiles that are capable of intercepting an Iranian barrage. And that, of course, is what the U.S. is watching for here. Israel has vowed that it would respond to that Iranian barrage of more than 180 ballistic missiles on October 1st. Iran has in turn said that it too would retaliate for any attack. So it's into this situation that the U.S. has deployed this advanced anti-ballistic missile system to Israel, preparing for the possibility of an Iranian attack. It also adds more defenses in Israel should Hezbollah continue to launch rockets, missiles, perhaps even drones. So again, it adds a quality system to Israel's layered defense, and it also shows the US commitment to Israel's defense. And that message of support for Israel and a message of deterrence to Iran and its proxies, that's just as important as the military capability itself. Orrin Liebermann, CNN at the Pentagon.

And there still will be some very cold rain and a little bit of snow across parts of Quebec over the next couple of hours.Other than that, very, very chilly air across the upper Midwest. Western Plains, we will see temperatures below 32 for a few hours, and in some spots in the north for many hours. That will certainly put a damper on your tomatoes, but it will also take the pollen out of the air from all of the ragweed that's out there. Once you get your big first frost, that begins to die off and it's all done. Nashville, by Thursday morning, temperatures in the middle 30s. Mount Juliet, you could be colder than that. Even the highs in Atlanta will not be above 60, 65. There you go. Almost 68 today, but that's it. That's it for the rest of the year. And then here, we went on 84 degrees on Saturday in Atlanta, and by tomorrow morning, it will be 43, a difference of 41. And yet down to the south, where the water is still very warm, we have a 60 percent chance of a storm developing over the next five or so days that could move very close to either Hispaniola or maybe Puerto Rico. Don't know yet. Models don't love it just yet, but we'll see. Hurricane Center says, yes, there is more than a 50-50 chance of something happening there, and then some 20 percent chance of rain coming in here, some of the heavier rain showers coming into probably Belize, Honduras, and the like. But taking a look at the storm out in the middle of the Atlantic, where does it go? Models are pretty good agreement this far out. Still staying south here of many of the threats up the East Coast, but certainly any of these islands are going to have to watch for some very heavy rain, gusty winds, and that potential tropical development.
