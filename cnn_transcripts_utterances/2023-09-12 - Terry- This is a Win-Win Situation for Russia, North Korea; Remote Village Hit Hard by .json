The North Korean Leaders heavily armed trained now in Russia according to state media. Still no confirmed time for the meeting with President Vladimir Putin as the world of course watches on the latest on that trip coming up. And catastrophic flooding more than 2000 people have lost their lives in Libya after a powerful storm and heavy rainfall. The fear is that number could end up significantly higher. A live report on that just ahead too. And the ongoing search for survivors rescuers continue to battle terrain and the heat following Friday's devastating earthquake in Morocco All the details on those rescue efforts coming up too. and in the meantime, here's the global stock market picture on Wall Street stock futures pushing lower as investors await Wednesday's U.S. inflation data the consumer price index are not the only ones Of course, Federal Reserve policymakers will also be watching that number closely. Perhaps they shouldn't watch so closely. However, in the words of former World Bank President David Malpass, the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is broken. He says we're missing the true drivers of inflation, which is government policy and regulation. And the focus should be on actually cutting rates to grow the economy and fixing some of the other things. We'll discuss some of his solutions later on in the show. And dialing in Apple set to unveil its latest iPhone at its annual event in Cupertino in just a few hours' time while Google is going on trial in DC charged with violating antitrust laws in its massive search business. We'll have all the details on that too, and what some of the consequences for Google might be if they lose that case. Lots to get to, as always, but we do begin in Russia and these images from Russian state media show the North Korean Leader's train in the far east of Russia. U.S. officials have long warned the talks between Kim and Putin could focus on weapons sales to Moscow after months of war in Ukraine.

So the three countries are working together to, you know, with trilateral exercises and information sharing and Intel sharing and so on. China is an interesting question how China will act on this, because China is not, I'm sure they're not going to welcome this news.

They're being asked to decide whether the court has the power to overturn government acts that it considers unreasonable for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu removing that power is a key part of overhauling the judicial system. Now, Israelis have been protesting for months over the issue. And critics say Netanyahu is trying to steal power from the courts, and is weakening Israel's democracy in the process.

      "sentences": "Yes, the hearing in the Supreme Court has been going on now for several hours since 9 am. This could be theonly day of the hearing or could continue for just about one more day But it's not expected to be a very lengthy trial of sorts. And what they're debating really in this hearing is the Supreme Court's own power. And this is also sort of a constitutional argument because the law that was passed back in July. It took away the court's ability to declare government actions as unreasonable saying that they cannot continue. This law amended a basic law. Now Israel doesn't have a constitution, the basic laws are the closest thing to a constitution so the reason that this was so historic that the Supreme Court has never before nullified a basic law. Another interesting aspect of this is that the Attorney General is not arguing, excuse me, the Attorney General is not representing the government here. And that's because the Attorney General, she believes that this law should be nullified, she does not believe that this law could stand. So the government is being represented by private counsel. Now, the main argument behind the petitions to take to nullify this law is that it harms the authority of the judicial scheme. It harms the authority of the judicial branch and deals with severe blow to the essence and existence of Israel as a democratic state. And the petitioners are also arguing that the way that this law was pushed through the Israeli parliament was inappropriate essentially. Now the government is saying this is Supreme Court does not have the power to take away or to change basic laws and saying that that power rests in the hands of the people in the hands of the Israeli parliament. Now, what's been interesting is to hear the judge's response to hear the judge's commentary, it's always difficult to try to ascertain how the judges rule just because of their comments during a trial. But you're bringing up some interesting points. They're saying OK, if the Supreme Court does not have the power that it rests in the power of the people and the power of the parliament, what happens if the government decides that there should not be elections for 10 years? What will be the check on that sort of power? And what's also really interesting is another comment from one of the justices saying, and I'll quote here, democracy dies in a series of small steps. Now, the crux of what the Supreme Court is trying to decide is how to ensure the government acts as the -- what they call reasonably if the judges are prevented from using this standard in the rulings because Julia here in Israel in the parliamentary system, essentially the only check on the government on the executive on the parliament, is the Supreme Court. And so the question is, if the Supreme Court is not able to use one of their tools in the bucket to declare government actions unreasonable to prevent the government from taking any sort of action, where will that checks and balance lies? And that's why you hear that question about them saying, OK, if the parliament passes the law saying there can't be elections for 10 years, where will be that checks on the power because the people won't have that election again. Now, there will not be a decision on this in you know, in the near future, they have a deadline by January 12th. But that could be setting Israel up for essentially a constitutional crisis, because there is still even a question about whether this government will abide by a Supreme Court ruling nullifying this law. So there could be a major judicial and constitutional clash, Julia.",

So the point here is to recognize that if you just keep hiking rates, you're going to hurt production more than consumption. And that's going to only add to inflation. That's especially true because the government is one of the big parts of the economy, and they're indifferent to interest rates, you could go to 10 percent. And it wouldn't stop the government from spending. So shouldn't there be a more direct focus on the things going on in the economy that are undercutting the productive side of the economy.",

But actually, that's weak by historical standards, and it's propped up by, to your point government spending excess debt levels. And that does nothing to improve future growth or boost our productivity. And actually, the Federal Reserve is an enabler of that by buying up lots of government debt.",

So you wonder about, do they really think there's thatmuch connection between their rates and inflation? And in the meantime, they were holding down the yield curve really intervening heavily in markets. That these are not small numbers, they ended up with a peak of $9 trillion of bonds. So it massively adjusted the world towards activities that are funded by people issuing bonds, that means big governments, big corporations, and that slowed the world growth. So we have this decade, already more than a decade of slow average growth. And so there has to be a thinking that we have to break to a much faster growth plane from the U.S. And then that can help the whole world lift off of the crisis that it's in. It's in a growth crisis, that is really hurting people around the world. So I think we have to try new tools.",

But the final point, because I knowpeople reading this article, as I did, will be thinking about this too the three steps that I mentioned and we can show them once again. You say the Fed could elicit an immediate improvement in inflation expectations and in growth by sort of signaling in terms of policy that would lead to rate cuts a stable dollar and smaller Central Bank, or government bond holdings by the Central Bank it all sounds great in theory. But in practice, David, how do you do that without inciting some form of panic to your point? We're a decade in now at least, it's what we've come to expect, what investors have come to expect?",

Commercial Banks wouldn't have to be lending so much to the Fed, you know, the Feds paying top dollar for giant amounts of money that they borrow out of banks and money market funds, that would be returned gradually to those entities for making loans, business loans, commercial and investment loans that are, I'm sorry, commercial and industrial loans that are so important to small businesses. And so that businesses look ahead. So they would immediately get the point and say, aha, we're going into a growth phase that includes lower interest rates. And so I'm going to make investments that pay off quickly, and it helps the rest of the world in the same way.",

But what I found in six years at the U.S. Treasury and then at theWorld Bank, was that the forces that be, in the world don't really want to change the system. One of the things going on is, as the international institutions put more money into countries, it almost all goes to the creditors. So from the standpoint of world moneymakers, they really like the current system where they make loans, they earn interest. And then if the loans go bad, they get bailed out by a multilateral system. The problem is the people of the countries are left in bad straits, because they have to be the conduit. The farmers have to work extra hard, in order to pay extra money, in order to pay for the debt that was taken on years before. Let me take a moment to express condolences to people in Morocco, but also around the world. You know, in Libya, they're having flooding 2000 people dead that they know of already. And it's feared to go more, but the victims of 9/11 were in yesterday's thoughts and minds in the in the U.S. of the Maui fires, and of the Afghanistan evacuation that still is causing trauma and difficulties for millions and millions of people. And so I think we have to think about the very difficult lives that are being led in much of the developing world, in part because that their governments don't have good policies to allow businesses to actually operate MIT women to be in the workforce, children and girls to be educated. And so those are, I think, pressing global points and made worse now by the interest rate increases that are coming across the world. That was inevitable, but they're left with floating rate debt, and no way to restructure it. Zambia still doesn't have an MOU.",

David, how do we break that? Whether it's the United States, whether it's the private sector, whether it's China, as the biggest creditors in the world? How do we bring them to the table and say, actually, this is one world and whether it's climate mitigation or social stability, rather than wars, breaking out.

And they there is talkabout one world but I have the impression that what people want to do is make lofty promises, but not actually spend money or make the changes that are needed in order to get the adjustments going on. On the debt one, I advocated in Japan at the two meetings of the G7 in Niigata, in Hiroshima, that the G7 ask the IMF and the World Bank to really make progress on debt. They didn't do it. It's part of the G 20 process. It's moving very, very slowly, in fact, not moving. And so I think this is a problem of the world kind of wanting to look at someone else and say they should solve this problem when it has to really be self-selected by important by countries that can really have an impact and then for them to focus on it and get to a solution.",
