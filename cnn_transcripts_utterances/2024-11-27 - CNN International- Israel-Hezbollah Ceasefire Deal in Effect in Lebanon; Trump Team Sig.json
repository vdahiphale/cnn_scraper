      "sentences": "Well, this is the scene entire in Lebanon, where a ceasefire is holding between Lebanon and Hezbollah, atleast for now. It is 04:00 p.m. there. It is 06:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Becky Anderson, you're watching \"Connect the World\". It's good to have you on board. Also coming up. Ukrainian troops, outgunned and outnumbered, are trying to stop Russian advances in the south using drones. Donald Trump's tariffs may be targeted at Canada and Mexico, but how would they impact the American car industry? More on that is coming up. And heading home for the holidays. Tens of millions of Americans are on the move ahead of Thanksgiving. The stock market in New York will open about 30 minutes from now. The picture doesn't look too bright, as you can see from the indications from the futures markets. All very mixed, trade tariff jitters putting pressure on car stocks. On Tuesday, we will return to New York for the opening of those markets in half an hour's time, at 09:30. Well, the Israel Hezbollah ceasefire is in force, but tensions are high and Israeli troops remain deployed in positions in southern Lebanon warning residents displaced by the fighting in Israel not to return home. Well, the U.S. backed truce went into effect 12 hours ago after Israel's security cabinet voted 10 to 1 to approve it. It ends for now, at least fighting set off by the war in Gaza that has killed thousands in Lebanon and dozens in Israel. Some in Beirut, waved Hezbollah flags in celebration, while cars with displaced residents clogged roads heading south despite those warnings to wait. The deal calls for a 60 day pause in hostilities, the aim being to create conditions for a permanent peace. Well over that time period, Israel will withdraw from southern Lebanon and Hezbollah fighters are to retreat 40 kilometers from the border. The Lebanese army and U.N. peacekeeping forces will be tasked with enforcing the truce. Whether or not it will hold, is unclear. Already Israeli troops opened fire and what they say were vehicles approaching a restricted area. Well, Israel's Prime Minister says his military will respond forcefully if Hezbollah violates the agreement and attempts to rearm. U.S. President Joe Biden vowed Hezbollah will no longer threaten Israel's security as he announced the ceasefire on Tuesday. On CNN today, the president's national security adviser talked about the expectations in the weeks and months ahead. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Implementation is going to be key, and that means ensuring that Hezbollah, the terrorist group, cannot rebuild its terror infrastructure in southern Lebanon, and that the Lebanese Armed Forces do their job in filling in the security vacuum in southern Lebanon, rather than Hezbollah. The United States, along with France and other countries, are committed to ensuring this deal is implemented effectively. And we're going to take steps until the time comes when we can all breathe easy and say, yes, this is actually in effect. It is going to stick. It is going to work, but day in, day out, we are going to make sure that we're doing everything to see to it that the terms of this agreement are enforced. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That said it was clear that the United States was important in getting the details into this deal that got it over the line. But to me, it looks more like the conditions on the ground, the incentives for each of the parties changed and got towards this deal. Israel has said its forces are tired. They need a break. Hezbollah has been completely decimated. They need a break. So that changed. It wasn't something that the U.S. did that then changed the dynamics of this. So, the White House, when it's talking about. Now, we want to jump from this to try and get a ceasefire in Gaza. It's clearly not going to be as simple as that. We have the looming arrival of Donald Trump in seven weeks. It seems just as likely that, as Nic was saying, Israel may push on in other theaters than rather than look necessary to tone this down right away, because it's pretty clear that Trump doesn't want massive disruption taking place in the Middle East when he takes office. So, while the White House is talking about legacy hunting, the president even mentioned this normalization deal between the Saudis and Israel that he thought was possible in the next seven weeks.

So, they fully understand that Hezbollah hastaken a position that delinks them from the support of Hamas. So that's a psychological blow. And absolutely, in a situation where they already feel incredibly isolated. This will only heighten that sense of isolation, but they're coping with it in their way of the elements that remain continue to fight back against Israeli forces. The other thing that Hamas is saying is that they will work with efforts towards a ceasefire, the United States. Joe Biden, last night, President Joe Biden said that he would work with Turkey, bringing in a new mediator, or heightening the relevance and the role of Turkey as a mediator with Hamas respecting the fact that it does appear that some Hamas leaders are spending more time in Turkey than they were. Not that there are many of them left now, Qatar as well. He said the United States will work within Israel. Qatar sort of recused itself from playing a significant role as a mediator. I think it feels very battered and bruised and abused from the role that it's been playing. It does seem to be a stretch from where we're at. And I think, you know, most people would assess the situation here right now that it's in the mind of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, if he really wants to move here. You know, takes two to tango. And I think that the same negotiators would tell you the same is true for negotiation. If Hamas is going to move some, it would seem that Prime Minister Netanyahu is going to have to move some. And I don't think we're seeing movement from either side at the moment, Becky.",

White House to formally start the transition of power ahead of January the 20th that will allow Trump's team to get briefings and meet with outgoing officials.

It is very easy to get through the airport. This is the absolute perfect combination for a holiday weekend. The weather is good. The cancelations are low. Most importantly, the security line time is low, Becky. 10 minutes at TSA pre here at the United terminal, terminal one here at O'Hare. 5 minutes for economy, 5 minutes for premier access. So, when you consider that this is the biggest holiday weekend of travel, not just, you know, like compared to other holidays, but in recent memory, this is going to be a record travel year. Again, you'd said 18 million people or more are expected to travel. That represents, nationally, a 6 percent increase from 2023. Here at Chicago area airports, they're expecting an 11.4 percent increase compared with 2023. And that means, Becky, that there were going to be at least a million and a half people coming through O'Hare and Midway the two Chicago area airports over this holiday weekend. They're thinking Sunday is going to be the busiest day. 254,000 people pouring through O'Hare, around 58,000 pouring through Midway on those two days. So, it is going to be very, very busy.

To an update now from North Korea that could have a huge impact on the war in Ukraine. New research suggests that Pyongyang is expanding a weapons plant that makes missiles that are used by Russia. Researchers at the Middlebury Institute of International Affairs or Studies says the plant makes both KN- 23 and what are known as KN-24 missiles, the former of which Russia has used around 60 times this year.

Let's see crew from Macy's along with Father Christmas andthe elves ringing in the trading day in New York. Welcome back. I'm Becky Anderson in Abu Dhabi, where the time is half past 6. It is half past 9 in New York, of course. You are watching \"Connect the World\". Well, at the top of the show, we were looking at a very mixed picture for the opening on Wall Street. Indications from the futures market showed a little bit of worry from investors, perhaps, about tariff rises and immigration crackdowns under President- elect Donald Trump. Let's take a closer look at that now that is reflected in what are the first few seconds of the trading day. Trump promising to slap a new 25 percent across the board tariff on all goods from both Mexico and Canada, and that would have huge economic repercussions. For example, last year, the U.S. imported $130 billion worth of vehicles from Mexico. Many car manufacturers moved production there. U.S. car manufacturers move production there to get around tariffs on China. Now there are concerns. Trump's plans could mean consumers end up paying a whole lot more. Vanessa Yurkevich is on the story for us. Look, we know that much of what we hear from Trump now, with two months to go. May just be positioning, negotiation rhetoric, but we do know he calls himself tariff man, and tariffs are in play as far as he can -- he is concerned. So, at this point, given what we have heard, what is it exactly that he is proposing and why? And can you explain why it is that car manufacturers who move their production south of times are now getting hit in the markets. What are the concerns here?",

      "sentences": "Yeah, there's a lot going on, but let's just start with what President-elect Trump isproposing. He's proposing 25 percent tariffs on all imports from Canada and Mexico, an additional 10 percent on imports coming from China. And that is so critical for the auto industry, because here in the U.S., we have the big three automakers, Ford, Stellantis and General Motors. But there's no such thing as an all-American car anymore. So much of what goes into these vehicles are coming from parts made in Canada and Mexico. And also, we're importing fully assembled cars from Mexico into the United States. And that's why additional tariffs on China, we still get some parts from there, but tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada would really raise the price of vehicles. Right now, the average price of a vehicle here in the United States is $47,000 if these tariffs go into effect, it would be much more. Those are just a list of some of the cars that are made and assembled in Mexico, and also some of the parts that are used for cars, there you see the price right there. That price is going to go up. But ultimately, the question is, so why do we, here in the U.S., import so many parts and cars from Mexico in particular? Well, labor is much cheaper, and it is, we don't have to pay any tariffs. So, then people might say, OK, well, if there are tariffs in place, if this does go into effect, why don't we just make it here in the U.S.? Well, we simply do not have the capacity. Labor is much more expensive here in the U.S. Right now, we're trying to stand up 16 semiconductor facilities here in the United States, but that's a long way out three to five years. And ultimately, we're not hearing right now from these big three U.S. automakers. They're not commenting on these tariffs. I know that they're watching them very closely, but as you mentioned, the markets are responding in some way. Yesterday, majority all of those automaker stocks right there closing down GM down 9 percent. Investors essentially saying, oh-oh, what is this going to mean for these companies? And what is it going to mean for car prices for consumers? And remember, Becky, if new cars become more expensive, used cars also become more expensive, because all of the demand shifts to the used car market, and ultimately, that is starting a whole new round of inflation for Americans.",
