You -- what matters in the Trump point of view is establishing that he is going to go back and do it -- and re-establish a strong economy, address immigration, address the crime issue. He's going to hit hard on the issues he feels strongly about.It's a two-way race and you've got -- the last three elections, you've had some of the most unpopular presidential candidates in the history of political polling -- Hillary and Trump, Trump and Biden, now Trump and Biden potentially again -- and it's the lesser of two evils. And so, you've got a very weak president that is running against the same guy that he ran against before. But if you look at where the numbers are right now, a year after (ph) the election, if the election were held today, Trump would win. But I did -- as you may know, I did Mitt Romney's polling a year after (ph) election, Mitt Romney would have been president. But as you said in the beginning, it's a long ways away from Election Day and there's a lot of -- a lot that's going to go on. The economy could turn around some. It's a toss-up election right now. But it's anybody's game. It's going to be a hard-fought campaign.",

But it does feed directly into kind of a central thesis of the Biden team, which is the democracy is on the ballot, right?It worked in 2022, more so than any of the talking heads appreciated in the lead up to it. And in a most recent Biden campaign memo, it said every single day Donald Trump and the extreme MAGA Republican Party are telling us the quiet part out loud. If they take power, they will do everything they can to dismantle American democracy and continue stripping Americans of their hard-fought and fundamental freedoms. (Inaudible) this is a contrast that they are happy to have in this campaign. Do you think that's effective?",

What we actually see is that when Trump is in the news, not just on Fox or on Truth Social, but actually in the mainstream news and getting a lot of attention from the cable networks around things that he does, his numbers get worse.So for example, in 2022 and -- 2021 and 2022, when we had all of the issues of the documents in Mar-a-Lago, you saw not just Trump do worse in the polls, but Republicans around the country do worse. And then when that recedes, things kind of get back to a little bit of a -- more of an equilibrium if you will. Trump simply is not the -- even though we think about him every day, of I do and Neil does than you do, for most people, they are not thinking about him. And when he's back in the mainstream, when he's on TV, when he is in people's faces, they are reminded not just of the fundamental threats to democracy, but chaos, vulgarity, aggressiveness, hostility, meanness. This is not something that people actually want. Furthermore, I think where he has gone which is a different place (inaudible), whether it's talking about upending the civil service or being a dictator on day one, so he have a (inaudible) world, we know in 2022, as you mentioned, that democracy was on the ballot. There was not a lot of advertising about it. In fact, people were critical of Joe Biden when he gave a speech about democracy right before the 2022 election. Well, it turned out when you ask people who voted Democratic in 2022, why they did, the two top issues were abortion and democracy, and those things are also intertwined. I see no reason why that's not going to be a part of what this conversation is about next November, just like it was in 2022.",

But also, President Biden weighs in on polls every once in awhile. He might be a little biased given how some of them haven't been great for him over the course of the last several months, but he made a point at a fundraiser a couple weeks ago.He said it doesn't mean a lot right now, in my view, either way on polls. Those of you who know the business, it's awful hard. You have to call -- you got to make about 20 calls to get one person to answer the cell phone, seriously. He said something akin to this several times. From a pure, like, how this works in practice for you, Ann? What do you trust when you're looking at numbers?",

But in part, because what really matters is what's in the state (ph) congressional district level, those polls are actually what matter.And so, a lot of the public polling at the state and local level, at the congressional level, are even poorer quality than national polls. So I tend to not pay a lot of attention to public polling and a lot more attention to the polling that are done for campaigns, which are sort of rigorous gold standard. They have actually been, notwithstanding some hiccups in 2020, pretty accurate over the last six years. Yeah, it's a very good point.
