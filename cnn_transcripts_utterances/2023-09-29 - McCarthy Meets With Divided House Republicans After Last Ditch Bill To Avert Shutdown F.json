Now in a moment, you'll meet some of the men and women who will be left without paychecks if it does, but still have the same bills to pay. First, though, the man largely responsible for it, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. It's not so much what he's done that's led to all this, it is what he's been unable to do. Speaker McCarthy for weeks now has not been able to get the right wing of his narrow majority to agree on stopgap funding to keep the government running nor has he been willing to work with Democrats instead or even grab onto a lifeline and take up a temporary spending measure with broad bipartisan support in the Senate. Instead, today, he brought a bill to the floor that was soundly rejected with 21 Republicans, many of them hardliners joining Democrats in defeating it. At a press conference shortly before the vote, Speaker McCarthy was asked why he was pushing legislation that was dead on arrival. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-IL): Well, Anderson, it's a sad situation that we're in because we have a GOP majority with a speaker that cannot get his own party to do the simple work of funding a continuing resolution. And the thing is, Anderson, we have plenty of votes to avert a shutdown, with a clean continuing resolution that keeps the government funded until the Republicans can get their act together on appropriations bills. So this is not a situation that has to happen. If it happens that we have a shutdown, it looks increasingly likely, it is a Republican shutdown and it has tremendous consequences for people across the country, from people not being able to get the assistance they need to make sure that their security is working properly, cafeteria workers not being able to get their paychecks. It has tremendous consequences, and it is all because, Anderson, the Republicans have been trying to pass this extreme agenda, a nationwide abortion ban, severe cuts to Social Security. They can't get it through, so now, they are holding the government funding hostage and the American people hostage.",

Under those circumstances, I think his emotion coming out, talking about would be dictators is understandable. And as far as the treason charge is concern, that's usually defined as giving aid and comfort to an enemy. What General Milley had done is he gave aid and comfort to the American people. In doing so, he protected us against any other country acting on the assumption that things were going downhill very rapidly in this country. And I can tell you from my own experience that most countries draw profiles of the leaders, civilian and military in every other country. They want to know who they're dealing with under any circumstance. And I'd be willing to bet that is no different in China or any other country. That you would go through their profile and you'd see the words unstable, mercurial, explosive, impulsive, unreliable, no respect for law, and possibly sociopathic. I believe you would find all of those words in the profiles in other countries draw of our former president. So under those circumstances, for him fearing that another country might see action being taken or thought to be taken by us, he did us a favor by calling out and talking to his counterpart, saying, it's OK.

And Pat Moynihan, you celebrated the life of Dianne Feinstein, whom I knew from the time she was mayor in San Francisco, but she was a lioness of the Senate.There was another one called Pat Moynihan, and Moynihan wrote that we are defining deviancy down. We are taking aberrant behavior, and we're taking this country down. It's aberrant for a former commander in chief to basically attack the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and call for a death penalty. It's aberrant behavior from people in the Congress calling for the former -- for the chairman of the Joint Chiefs to be hung, and we are tolerating it, allowing it, and normalizing it, and say, it's just him talking. No, it comes from the top and it sends a signal down to the average person. It's OK to think in those terms. It's OK to take military or physical action to use firearms and other means of destruction to go after high ranking officials, as you pointed out, have devoted their lives to the safety of the insecurity of this country, whereas the former president had bone spurs, as I recall, and evaded going into the service because of that certificate that he had. So it's aberrant behavior on the part that is filtering down into every aspect of our society. And I think as was recently said by President Joe Biden, Democracy is in real danger. We are facing a world in which there's an existential level event that can take place in a moment's notice. And so we want people in positions of power to act according to reason, rationale, credibility, and consistency.
