I'm Michael Smerconish in Philadelphia.The San Jose State women's volleyball team is going to play the Colorado State Rams for the Mountain West Conference championship title today. And why is this specific college game of so many this weekend making headlines? Because women's volleyball has found itself at the center of the transgender athlete debate. You'll remember that last week I talked about Nancy Mace's introduction of a rule to limit bathroom access on Capitol Hill aimed at representative-elect Sarah McBride. That of course, followed the Trump campaign's effective use of a commercial claiming Kamala Harris is for they them while Donald Trump is for you. The Harris campaign had no reply. I argued the response should have been clear and included that when it comes to athletics, the goal should be one of inclusion, but not at the expense of fairness. And that brings us to this week. San Jose is playing in the championship today because Boise State forfeited their match shortly after winning their game on Wednesday against Utah State. You can see Boise teammates celebrating their victory here. That elation hours long and then came forfeit. Why? Over reports of a transgender player on the San Jose State team. That move sent San Jose State straight to the title game today. It's unclear to me the level of dominance of the San Jose volleyball player seen here. Spiking the ball. We all, of course, remember the case of Lia Thomas, the trans swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania. In that case, according to Swimming World magazine, Thomas soared from the mid-500s ranking in men's competition to one of the top ranked swimmers in women's competition. I said then and still believe that's not fair. The same questions about fairness and competitive balance seem to apply here, Boise State saying in a statement, quote, \"The decision to not continue to play in the 2024 Mountain West Volleyball Championship tournament was not an easy one. They should not have to forego this opportunity while waiting for a more thoughtful and better system that serves all athletes. It's not the first time that a team has forfeited playing San Jose State. The team received a total of six forfeit victories throughout the season due to withdrawals from Mountain West opponents. Let's note these two things. No one made these teams forfeit. They're removing themselves from a level of competition that they've worked all season towards. And second, the commissioner of their conference ruled that the player in question on San Jose State's team meets the current eligibility standards to compete. But this controversy goes deeper than just the opposing teams. It goes within the Spartan team. One of the players, Brooke Slusser, filed a lawsuit to prevent her own teammate from competing in the conference tournament. She defended the move in the \"New York Times,\" saying, quote, \"We just don't think it's fair that a man is allowed to play. She called it a hard decision to file the lawsuit because she didn't want to,\" quote, \"put my team through more than they're already going through.\" On Monday, a federal judge in Denver ruled that the player was allowed to compete, and a federal appeals court upheld the decision the following day. President Trump stepped into the conversation on Fox News saying that he wants to ban transgender athletes from competing in women's sports. He used San Jose State as an example. He referenced this play from a few weeks ago in which a San Jose State player spiked the ball and was met with a dig from the San Diego State player. You can see her getting up and continuing to play. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES: They had a volleyball match. Did you see that?",

SIA LI'ILI'I, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM AMBASSADOR: It was a definitely hard decision that we had to not take lightly due to the fears and the - just the things that our teammates had brought up with fair play, opportunity, safety. So from there it was a conversation of, well, we're going to take a vote. Sixteen out of the 17 girls on our team decided that this is something they didn't want to participate in and they thought it was bigger than us, which it is.

You may have heard me say a moment ago that it's unclear to me the level of dominance of this particular player, but Sally Jenkins wrote in the Washington Post, something I'm going to read aloud and put on the screen for our viewers. She said, \"she may not be that talented. An in-depth ESPN look at her performance suggests that her power is exaggerated. The lawsuit contends that she can spike a ball at 80 mph, but an ESPN camera calibration analysis found that was wholly unsupported.Using software to examine five of her spikes from different games, they clocked estimated speeds between 51 and 64 miles per hour with an average speed of 50.6. She's not even in the top 150 in the NCAA in hitting percent.\" How would you describe your assessment of the level of dominance of the player that this is all about? LI'ILI'I: Honestly, I don't think that this should be centered on an individual. I think that all people should be able to live as they choose and be respected, but at the same time, we can't ignore biological differences that underlie women's sports. Men are bigger, faster and stronger than the average female. So, it's never have been about one individual athlete, always about the future of women's sports. As someone who has younger siblings, little cousins, nieces who are in sports, it's about them in the future because I want them to have the opportunity to play Division 1 sports and be in the position I am. But if man is allowed to be on a team, what's stopping a coach from recruiting a team full of men, giving no opportunity or chance for women to have success?",

Yesterday I asked the question of what we're discussing in terms of what should be the approach. It came down, you can see, perhaps, should college sports teams that feel disadvantaged by an opponent's inclusion of transgender athletes compete or forfeit matches in protest? It was 50.15 percent who said compete, 49.85 percent who said forfeit. I don't think we've ever had a closer result than that.What would you say to the roughly half who said you should still compete, notwithstanding the concerns that you have? LI'ILI'I: I think that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and should be treated with respect. But at the same time, I would like respect in knowing that we're the ones in this position and that we're faced with this hard situation that I believe no one should be put through. The emotional damage and the hard decisions that we're forced to make because we're putting -- this put into this position isn't right and it's not fair. It's not what any of us signed up for.

Current Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra told the \"Washington Post\" that obesity is damaging our country's health and economy.

KENNEDY JR., TRUMP'S PICK FOR HHS SECRETARY: There's a bill right now before Congress that will make it available to everybody who's overweight, which is 74 percent of the American population.

However, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Donald Trump's pick to head CMS, has voiced support for weight loss drugs. Ozempic costs about $1,000 per month if not covered by insurance. The proposed coverage would apply only to people who are obese. Those who are overweight but not obese would have to have another condition such as diabetes in order to qualify for coverage.I want to know what you think. Go to my website at smerconish.com, this is today's poll question, should Medicare and Medicaid cover weight loss drugs for individuals diagnosed with obesity? Joining me now is Ohio Republican Congressman Brad Wenstrup. He's a physician, Iraq war veteran, served as medical policy advisor for the chief of the Army Reserve and co-wrote a recent Newsweek op-ed called \"Congress Must Address America's Obesity Crisis.\" Congressman, good to see you. Respond to the RFK Jr. complaint which is to say this will mask the underlying or treatment of the underlying condition, which is we have unhealthy food choices and unhealthy lifestyles. REP. BRAD WENSTRUP (R-OH): Well, I think we do have unhealthy food choices and some unhealthy lifestyles, but merely putting out three good meals a day, I can promise you most people with obesity and those that treat diabetes and those that have diabetes know that they won't get better overnight because this requires a team of specialists. This is multifaceted in many ways. You know, I'm one of the co-chairs of our Doctors Caucus and we have been working towards the idea that we want America to be the healthiest nation on the planet, make America healthy again, whatever you want to call it. But is the return on investment of what we're doing? And by that I mean, are we making America healthier? [09:20:15] And it's a personal thing. Every patient is different. And so not everyone who's obese necessarily needs this shot, if you will. It is one of the treatment options that we do want to have available to practitioners. And keep in mind in our bills, we don't talk about a particular brand. We talk about FDA approved drugs for this particular purpose that should be prescribed by a doctor. They can't just get it anywhere. But also, it's a holistic approach because we also include access to dietitians, nutritionists. And you know, when you talk about exercise, hey, I once taught a course for the military where we talked about sleep, activity and nutrition, right? Well, that's fine with the military.",

Put on the -- yes, put the full screen up there. This is what I hope to be able to get the Congressman back to raise. And it's the question of, can we afford it? The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency, last month concluded that expanding coverage to anti-obesity drugs would cost Medicare an additional 35 billion between 2026 and 2034, a figure higher than what the Biden administration estimates. The CBO reached that estimate by considering two factors, the cost of the drugs, 38.8 billion and the savings from improved health conditions, which is 3.4 billion. Is Congressman Wenstrup back with us now? He's back. Great. Hey, Congressman. I don't know if you heard what I just read. It had to do with CBO projections. But here's the very simple question.

It's a holistic approach with a doctor working with you on having coverage for nutritionists, dietitians, behavioral health.But you also have to look at the return on investment, because if we are able to greatly diminish heart attacks, cancer, strokes, orthopedic conditions, diabetes, all of these conditions that are related to obesity and diabetes, we can do so much more. So there's a huge return on investment that cannot be ignored. But the Congressional Budget Office has a hard time. We have to be able to take a look at and understand that what we're trying to achieve is the healthy human life. We often look at cost, but we don't put a value to the healthy human life where if we can get people healthier, that they can go to work, that they can enjoy the freedom that they have in America to go on and be part of society that they may struggle with right now. There's so much more to be gained and we can't ignore that component. Our goal is are we making America and Americans healthier through this process? But again, this is a holistic approach. It just we never wanted it to be, especially as doctors, we never wanted it to shot and everything's fine. There's a lot of components that need to be addressed.",

The biting cold felt by Ukrainians as Russia pounded the country's power grid plunging a million homes into darkness with rolling blackouts across major swaths of Ukraine. This comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin threatens to hit Ukraine with a new nuclear-capable ballistic missile.Last week, he fired the Oreshnik, a medium-range ballistic missile, at Ukraine's Dnipro region. According to U.S. and western officials, the ballistic missile carried multiple warheads which may be the first time such a weapon has been used in war. Putin said that strike was in response to President Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles supplied by the U.S. for attacks inside Russia. Allowing the Ukrainians to use long-range missiles known as the Army Tactical Missile Systems, the ATACMS, is a major change in U.S. policy, and it comes only months before President Trump takes office. And he has promised to limit further support for Ukraine. In fact, Trump just named retired General Keith Kellogg as his choice to serve as special envoy to Russia and Ukraine. He was a national security adviser in the first Trump administration and laid out his peace plan for the war months ago. We have new players, new weapons, new policy. Will they help navigate the diplomatic road to peace or lead to a larger escalation? Here to break it down for us is Annie Jacobsen.

The way it almost always happens is if prosecutors are serious about their case they will ask Congress to hold off, to stand down. And we've seen that happen in other contexts.This idea that Merrick Garland had to wait for Congress is ridiculous. I mean, DOJ has way better, way more powerful investigative tools. The entire FBI some criminal subpoena power. If Merrick Garland was serious about digging into this, he could have done it from day one. And it's worth noting, Michael, at Merrick Garlands' confirmation hearing, he was asked repeatedly, will you look into January 6th? Will you investigate at all levels? Not just the ground that Merrick Garland said, yes, I will. Well, all he did for the next 20 months was focus on the ground level until he finally got around to belatedly appointing Jack Smith.",
