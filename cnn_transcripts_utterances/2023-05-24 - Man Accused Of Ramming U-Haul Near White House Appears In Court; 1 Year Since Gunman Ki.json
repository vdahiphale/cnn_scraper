They also say he had a Nazi flag, expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler. CNN's Brian Todd joins us live outside the federal courthouse in Washington.

We expect to get an update from our producer who's in the courtroom very shortly.But what we expected would be happening right now in the courtroom was that he would be read the charge against him. Right now, one federal charge against him and that is depredation of property of the United States in excess of $1,000. But we're told there could be additional charges filed. Also what we could hear from in this hearing is whether he has an attorney. What the attorney has to say about all of this. As you mentioned in your lead-in here, there have been some very disturbing things that he said to a Secret Service agent who interviewed him and filed some court documents yesterday in this case. Basically, indicating that this defendant said he supported Nazi ideology, that he supported the Nazi idea of eugenics, that he said Hitler was a strong leader, and that he said he would kill the president and harm anyone who got in his way. This is what he told an interviewing Secret Service agent on Monday evening after he emerged from that truck with a Nazi flag, of course after he rammed that truck into a security barrier about 200 yards from the White House. So we hope to get some more information on kind of his disposition. We have been told by law enforcement authorities, Jim, that authorities are considering the idea of how much mental health may be playing a role in this incident. Maybe we'll learn about that during this hearing. CNN did speak to two of his classmates from high school back in Chesterfield, Missouri, who said he was a very quiet guy in high school, that he never got in any trouble. But again, he just graduated from high school last year. And we talked to experts on extremism. A lot of people become radicalized online. Their parents, at that age -- he's 19 years old -- parents don't necessarily know about it. That was the case with the Buffalo shooter, we were told. So again, we'll maybe find out more information on that from this hearing.",

We are live outside Robb Elementary School next on CNN NEWS CENTRAL.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [13:37:39] KEILAR: One year ago today, a teenaged gunman walked into an elementary school and unleashed evil. Nineteen schoolchildren and two teachers slaughtered in Uvalde, Texas. And a botched police response followed by a lack of transparency and accountability has only added to the heartbreak and agony. Last hour, across the state, Texans held a moment of silence at 11:30 Central time, marking the moment that the shooting began. Statewide, flags are also flying at half-staff. And this afternoon, President Biden will speak, calling on Congress to confront the nation's gun violence epidemic. CNN's Shimon Prokupecz is in Uvalde. And, Shimon, you've spent so much time there over this past year. How's the community holding up today? SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN SENIOR CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: You know, certainly, you can feel the sadness. You can kind of feel the loneliness, the emptiness of what is around us at this moment. You know, behind us is the school. We're seeing community members, parents bringing their kids, laying flowers. We've seen some of the family members of victims come here and lay flowers. So it's a somber day, of course. We'll see more activity later tonight when there's a candlelight vigil. But this is a day that, for parents here, they were scared. They were afraid for this day. They didn't know how things were going to go because this community is still so divided, Brianna. There are still so many questions about what happened here, the fact that there's not been any transparency. Many of the families still asking for answers to the questions they have about exactly what happened here. And the other thing is family members had the opportunity recently to go inside that building and see where their kids died, took their last breaths. And from what I'm told from these family members, it was such a sad moment for them. But they appreciated that moment to finally getting to where their kids spent their last moments. So there's still a lot of grief, still a lot of anger here as they really try to move forward. But there are things, Brianna, that are just preventing that from happening.",

They are happy that they can know more information about exactly what happened to their kids. Because law enforcement and specifically the district attorney here is not providing any information. She's not answered any questions from the media about the investigation. Instead, kind of, Brianna, what she's done is she's attacked our reporting. Just the other day, when we did our story about the video and allowing the family members to see that video, she released a statement sort of attacking us, saying that we were sensationalist journalists and that we were retraumatizing these families. When, in fact, that was not the case. The family members wanted to see this because they're trying to get answers to certain things about what happened here. And the district attorney here has prevented that from happening. She's claiming there's this investigation, but she's not really explaining to them exactly what's going on. So that is a frustration here for the family members certainly. But, hopefully, at some point, she will be able to release some information for them. They cannot see that closure until they get more information.",

Colombian officials say search teams have discovered new traces of thefour children who went missing last week following a plane crash in the Amazon. They report finding a pair of tennis shoes about 550 yards from the site of the crash along with a dirty diaper, the cover of a baby bottle and the frame of a mobile phone. The new discoveries are closer to the wreckage site than a set of footprints that were uncovered last week. Plus, a new study claims taking multivitamins could help improve memory in older adults. The research published in the \"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\" found that taking a multivitamin each day for three years slowed cognitive aging and improved memory in adults over 60 compared to those who took a placebo. And nearly two dozen alleged tomb raiders accused of running an international art trafficking ring are now in custody. Italy's art theft police squad say that it recovered more than 3,500 pieces of ancient art, 3,500 taken by grave robbers in southern Italy. Officials say some of these artifacts were taken from previously unexplored archaeological digs. Jim?",

His attorneys did release a statement to CNN that said, quote, \"Alex has been cooperating with the U.S. attorney's office and federal agencies in their investigation in a broad range of activities. We anticipate that the charges brought today will be quickly resolved without trial.\" Now, look, they did not elaborate beyond that. But of course, Alex Murdaugh is currently serving two life sentences in a state prison for the murders of his wife and son. And so, it is worth pointing out, he is currently in state prison. And it's possible that they could be looking at -- seeking a relocation of some sort to a federal installation. I will point out that we received a statement from an attorney representing many of those victims in the indictments.
