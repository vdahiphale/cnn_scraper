They're discussing phone records.Todd Blanche has said to the jury, Blanche has a way to evaluate witnesses credibility as the oath they take to tell the truth is something Todd Blanche has repeatedly said to this jury while Michael Cohen was on the stand in the testimony that week. Blanche says if there's anything that we learned in this trial, is that Michael Cohen does not take that seriously, period. Back here with Paula Reid and Kaitlan Collins. He's zeroing -- again, he's just trying to chip away Michael Cohen's credibility raising questions now about Michael Cohen claiming that there was a phone exchange with Melania Trump that Todd Blanche is saying there's nothing on Michael Cohen's phone records indicate there was such a call. Blanche says he's repeatedly lied under oath. He's lied to his families, he's lied to his wife. He is literally like an MVP of liars. Todd Blanche says.",

      "sentences": "It's their key point, this is the most important thing they need to get across to jurors, to doubt the version of events that Michael Cohen conveyed on the stand.Why it's taken Todd Blanche this long to get to that key line? Well, that's something that in hindsight, it may turn out to have been a mistake to take such a winding path to get to this key point. But this is something we've heard the Trump team say throughout this trial. It is supported by a mountain of evidence that Michael Cohen is a liar and continue that pattern of lying even during the course of this trial. So, getting at least one juror to doubt Michael Cohen's account of events, when that's really all they need here and Blanche, finally, finally getting there. KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN HOST: The question also, though, is how the jury interprets it, given it was Donald Trump who hired Michael Cohen, employed him for all those years at the Trump Organization and kept him close and invited him to the White House. Blanche says Cohen is also a thief. That was a moment that even the prosecution, I think would acknowledge was not a strong moment for them, because it was something that they had already covered. Ground they had already covered that Michael Cohen exaggerated how much he was owed by that polling firm that he paid to boost Trump's numbers in a poll. He says he literally stolen his way out the door, sold tens of thousands of dollars through the Trump Organization. Michael Cohen did not try to downplay that plan when Todd Blanche said, so, you stole from the Trump Organization. He said yes, he didn't try to change the words, he did acknowledge it. We'll see how the jury interprets it. Obviously, he was someone that Trump kept in his close circle for all this time. The prosecution obviously will have their chance as Michael -- as Todd Blanche is clearly getting to the end of his argument here, to try to say it's not just resting on Michael Cohen's word, you can see the documents for yourselves. You can see the call logs between Michael Cohen and Donald Trump for yourself. And you can hear the testimony of White House aides that, yes, Michael Cohen was at the White House and secured an Oval Office meeting with Donald Trump.",

They're accurate and President Trump did not have any intent to defraud. There is no evidence of that. Reason number two, the vouchers and checks, no evidence that Trump knew the invoices were set, we're going to have 10 of these and they're trickling out like molasses but the reason number three, there is absolutely no evidence of any intent to defraud, intent to defraud. There's no smoking gun where Donald Trump is saying, let's do it this way so that we can hide this from the American people.

And also that, you know, so much of this doesn't just rely on Michael Cohen's testimony, but also the documents here. That's why Trump was so upset that they had to go first.
