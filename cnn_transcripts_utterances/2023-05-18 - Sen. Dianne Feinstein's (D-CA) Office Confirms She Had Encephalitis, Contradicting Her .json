We'll learning that Senator Dianne Feinstein has been sicker than we thought. We knew she had shingles. But we're learning that she also had encephalitis, meaning brain inflammation. The 89-year-old senator has been away from work for months. All of this raises questions about how old is too old to serve in Congress. Our panel will share their thoughts on that special number. Plus, the case of the ex-Buffalo bill player, Matt Araiza, a rookie who was cut from the team after ugly accusations went public. But now, prosecutors have declined to press criminal charges against him. Was his career ended prematurely? And battling book bans, the lawsuit by parents and authors against a Florida school district that's been removing books from shelves. Freedom of speech versus parents' rights, which one will win? But let's begin with Dianne Feinstein and questions about her fitness for office. The senator was out of work for a month fighting a bout of shingles. But today, we learned she suffered from encephalitis, inflammation of the brain, something she denied to CNN earlier today. She described it as a really bad flu. Her staff also confirmed today that she's suffering from a rare neurological disorder called Ramsey Hunt Syndrome, which causes facial paralysis. The pictures of her back at work show a more frail senator than we're used to seeing, and her Senate colleagues are sidestepping questions about her health, her age and her fitness to serve.

I don't think that, you know, it's not a stretch to say that doesn't serve the people of California well, and I think there's some political considerations around the reluctance to name an appointment, she would have to resign, because it might have an impact on the primary.

I think young people have a lot of both particular insight and particular energy when it comes to thinking about how to innovate and regulate some of the most urgent issues that are facing us. And I think one of the motivating issues is because that we're all seeing the images that are coming out of Feinstein's return, I saw an exchange between reporters at the L.A. Times who were asking her about her return, and she seemed to indicate she hadn't even thought she'd been gone.

So, when we talk about the cycle of addiction, there's a direct connection between the addictions we're seeing on our streets today and what happened some years ago, in the 1990s, when companies created very dangerous and addictive prescription opioids. They manufactured this crisis of undiagnosed pain. They marketed these products as safe. They were lying. There were millions of Americans, an entire generation that got addicted to prescription opioids. They abused them, and then they shifted to street drugs, like heroin and fentanyl.In the trial we admitted evidence that 70 to 80 percent of the heroin users on our streets began their addictions with prescription opioids. And that's exactly what Walgreen's was pushing. Also in the trial, it came out that Walgreens had over 1.2 million prescriptions just in our city alone that should have been red flagged under the law, but they looked the other way to chase their profits, and as a result, addicted members of our community, our brothers and sisters, our fathers and mothers to this, and that is what is causing the suffering on our streets, the addicts on our streets who are consuming heroin and fentanyl today.",

It's just one of the most challenging situations I think any woman can go through.I saw this on my college campus when we were, you know, trying to change our process for reporting sexual assault and I spoke with so many classmates who were going through the process.

It's just not a decision anybody takes lightly. And that was really one of the things that was running through my head, as I saw the decision not to go forward with the criminal charges.
