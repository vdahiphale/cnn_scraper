What I get into there is a leadership retreat that happened at Harris headquarters last week before the debate, where they talked about how, still, they do not see a one clear sure path to 270 electoral votes. Obviously, that would win her the election. That doesn't mean that they don't see ways that it can happen. They see a lot of ways that it can happen. But still, this race is very tight, and they think that and Harris is running close. Some people think that if the election were held today that Donald Trump would still win. Obviously, that was pre-debate. Post-debate, what they tell me is that's still basically where they see this. There's a lot of work that they have to do to keep this going, keep the energy and excitement high. And that's part of why you see Harris talking about things the way that she did yesterday in North Carolina. Let's take a listen to that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Obviously, it could be anything when it comes to Donald Trump.Now, what we expect to hear from him is a re-litigation of what we've really heard for the past 48 hours, Donald Trump has tried to reset the tone, reset the narrative around the debate, as you said, putting his own spin on it. Universally, Republican operatives, every single ally that I spoke to said that Donald Trump lost the debate. They were disappointed, but Donald Trump himself, he has continued to maintain that he won. And now he is trying to sell that to at least his base, which is what you showed there yesterday. That was in front of a crowd in Arizona, people who were already supporting Donald Trump. He got the cheers. He got the laugh lines that he wanted. So, today, the big question is whether or not he actually takes questions from us on that debate performance and also on a critical issue that we've all been talking about. And Republicans have been speaking out against was just traveling with Laura Loomer. Now, one of the other things that he continues to hammer on is this fear mongering around immigration.

A lot of it, John, is pent up frustration from 2008, when a lot of the members gave up concessions for a contract.And since then, there's been no full negotiation on a contract. They've just done contract extensions. And so they really felt like this was their moment to get everything that they wanted, and they didn't. And from Boeing's perspective, they say they want to get back to the negotiating table. But, John, Boeing really hasn't been doing so well financially these days. They're about $33 billion in operating losses and haven't turned a profit since 2008. So, the union's leadership and membership may want more. But how much can Boeing give? We simply don't know.",
