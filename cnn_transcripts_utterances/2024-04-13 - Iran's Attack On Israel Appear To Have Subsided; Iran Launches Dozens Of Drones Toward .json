Israel is about to take its first daytime look at the impact of a massive missile and drone barrage by Iran. This is what it looked like a few hours ago.The IDF says Iran fired more than 200 missiles and drones on Israel overnight, with the vast majority of them shot down by both Israeli and U.S. defenses before reaching its airspace. Tehran called that a response to an Israeli strike on Iran's embassy in Damascus earlier this month. Hours ago, an Israeli officials said the war cabinet received an authorization to decide now how it will respond. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has spoken on the phone just in the last hour with U.S. President Joe Biden. And Washington has asked Israel for a heads up about any possible response. Israel says a seven year-old-girl was injured by shrapnel from an interceptor missile. But there are no injuries directly from the Iranian attacks. The IDF released this statement earlier this evening. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM. DANIEL HAGARI, ISRAEL CHIEF MILITARY SPOKESPERSON: Tonight, Iran launched a large scale of coordinated attack on Israel. The regime in Iran fired a massive swarm over 200 killer drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles towards the State of Israel. Together with our allies and partners across the region, we are operating in this very moment to defend Israel from Iran's attack. So far, we've intercepted a vast majority of incoming missiles by Israeli systems. So far, we have intercepted and are continuing to intercept dozens of attack drones as well as cruise missiles and ballistic missiles outside of Israel's border. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the sense that the fighter jets there were several before that they were circling quite low at times. And the reports that we're getting from around the country do seem to indicate despite what we heard from Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari there, indicating that there were still interceptions going on.I think he is about to give another update briefing and we may get the IDF assessment of where the current attack stands, because a few hours ago, he was still saying that there were intercepts going on. But of course where it does remain potentially more active. That is along the northern border where we know in the last hour or so the IDF says there's been a barrage of 55 missiles fired by Hezbollah from southern Lebanon, a proxy of Iran into the Golan Heights area in the north of Israel. So there really is a potential for attention and missiles along that border as we go through the morning hours, even if Iran has actually paused or finished its first wave of attack, but it did last for quite a period of time and was very intense at times as well.

But we're not hearing that officially from the Jordanian government.In fact, it's very interesting looking at the Jordanian newspapers, Jordan Times this morning, and there's barely any mention of the strikes at all. They mentioned the airspace in Jordan being closed. And that would be an apparent effort to play down it appears what's played out in the skies over Jordan last night because many Jordanians, many Palestinians who live in Jordan would be very sensitive about their country directly supporting the defense of Israel. Now, the Saudis as we know have played a significant role in downing and detecting missiles that the Houthi is have fired over the past few months into Israel. And I think it would be expected because of the location of U.S. missile defense systems inside of Saudi Arabia, that Saudi will have played a role in if not taking down some of those missiles fired at Israel, certainly being part of the sort of radar array and intelligence and pinpointing some of the missiles fired. And we don't have that from the Saudi government is, in fact, it's interesting, the statement put out by that -- by their foreign ministry in the past couple of hours, talks about the need for calm on both sides, both Iran and Israel. But that is typical of how -- of how Saudi Arabia tries to play this diplomatically, down the middle of the field, if you will, Jim.",

Good to have you on tonight. And I wonder if you can help us game out what Iran's intent was here because the U.S., Israel, other partners succeeded in taking out the vast majority of these missiles without deaths on the ground on Israeli territory or significant damage. But this was an extremely large barrage of missiles and drones, one of these missiles apparently taken out in space by the high altitude aero defense system of Israel, was Iran's intent to kill on Israeli soil? AARON DAVID MILLER, FOMRER U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT MIDDLE EAST NEGOTIATOR: You know, I think the Iranians looked for a way to navigate a fine line between making their response qualitatively and quantitatively different than anything they've done in the past, they certainly have done that. This is a historic turning point in the Iranian-Israeli conflict. But at the same time, perhaps, perhaps, because when you launch 200 missiles, I mean, maybe Israeli technology will work, maybe it won't.",

They understand the magnitude of what these Iranians have done.And I think their own calculation is they cannot afford to have a new normal, which is every time they go after an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps member in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, that Iran feels it can essentially respond to that with a barrage of missiles at Israel. SCIUTTO: I understand that. But the trouble with each response being disproportionate to the last and we heard the U.S. -- the White House view is that Iran is response to that strike in Damascus, this barrage of missiles and drones is just proportionate if Israel does the same thing.

Now we know that according to another U.S. official that fighter jets were part of intercepting those drones. We don't know what types of fighter jets, the U.S. has F-15s, F-16s, potentially other fighters in the area as well. We also don't know if it was exclusively fighter jets to intercept of the drones. It's possible at least right now that there were also ground based aerial defense systems that also took part in intercepting and engaging this massive swarm or ways of drones that had been launched. As for the ballistic missiles, those were intercepted by at least one of the two destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea, the U.S. had position those to help in the defense of Israel and intercept anything that was headed that way. There are two destroyers there at this point, according to a number of officials, the USS Arley, Burke, as well as the USS Carney, so at least one of those engaged at least three ballistic missiles that were launched towards Israel. I believe, and I'd have to triple check this. But if you look back over the course of the six months, we have seen intercepted by U.S. Navy assets, but most of those were in the Red Sea. This may be the first time we're seeing intercepts from the eastern Mediterranean Sea. But there you see the U.S. and Israeli cooperation, this sort of layered multitier defense to do as much as possible to intercept drones and missiles before they ever got to Israel. And of course, at that point, if they got through it, it was Israel's aerial defenses that would kick in.",

So there's that. But I think in the context of where we stand this morning, if you will, with a decision that will be taken by Prime Minister Netanyahu and his war cabinet about how to respond to a decision and conversation that they say that they will have -- with partners, and certainly inform partners, if they move ahead with it. And I think in the context of what President Biden has decided to do, following his conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, which is call a meeting of G7 leaders later today, all of these points to the fact that the United States will bring its allies and partners into the equation to try to continue to keep security in the region by not having an escalation. That's certainly in the interests of all these partners. But I think it gets also to your question also gets the psyche for Israelis and part of that is the threat from Hamas part of it. So this new threat from Iran, that is now something yet another party that can reach inside of Israel, and inflict potential damage and harm inside Israel is something that people haven't had to deal with before. So this will also be part of the equation. But another part of that equation for the Israeli public has been this growing rift between the United States President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, which leads to the concern, how much can Israel depend on the United States as it has done in the past? Ironclad. There was that ironclad support in the defense of Israel tonight, but in offensive measures, that prescribes what Israel can do that President Biden's clear intent, and that's a concern on the minds of many Israelis.",
