CNN's Tom Foreman takes a look at how the deadly New Year's attack unfolded, and why the preparations in place, the way they had things set up, were unable to prevent it.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The city of New Orleans has known for years that the huge crowds on Bourbon Street are a potential target for terrorists. Why is that such an attraction? Well, it's an attraction in its own right, but it's also just a short distance away from Jackson Square, one of the big attractions there from Preservation Jazz Hall, just a short distance away, from Canal Street, this huge artery running through the middle of the city, and from the Superdome as well, which also is not that far away. That's why there are always big crowds here. They've always known this was a potential terrorist target.So, why were they unable to protect it? Partially because the city was in the middle of a program to replace these steel bollards to stop cars from being able to go down the road. They wanted to have a better working system in place before the Super Bowl coming up. The problem is, while they're in the process of replacing, there are going to be questions about whether what they were doing to stop anyone getting down here was enough. Was it enough to simply have a police car blocking the end of the road there? If you watch the video of this truck driving in, which just goes right around it, clearly it was not enough. In fact, the truck only stopped when it seemed to hit some kind of a lifting crane down the way there. So, there are going to be serious questions about that, and there have to be, because now the Sugar Bowl is back on, Mardi Gras is going to start shortly, Jazz Fest, the Super Bowl coming up in a little more than a month. [09:35:05] Millions of people are going to come to New Orleans. And like the millions before, they will go to Bourbon Street. And absolutely people in that community are asking, how do we know? What is the plan? Explain to us specifically what you'll do to protect those people. Maybe it'll take some time to work that out, but people are going to want to know that. And, fair enough, they deserve an answer. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I mean, I don't know that I'll be able to forget that.TODD (voice over): The kind of horror that many cities have experienced in recent years when attackers turn vehicles into weapons. Just a few days before this Christmas, a car slams into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing at least five people, injuring more than 200. The suspect, a doctor originally from Saudi Arabia who'd expressed anti-Muslim far right views. Like Magdeburg and New Orleans, other cities have experienced horrific vehicle attacks during holidays. November 2021, a suspect with a long criminal history drives an SUV through the annual Christmas parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, killing six, injuring more than 60. Berlin, December 2016, a tractor trailer rams into a crowd at a bustling Christmas market, killing at least 12 people, injuring dozens of others. The suspect, a rejected asylum seeker, was later killed in a shootout with police in Italy. And the deadliest vehicle attack ever. July 14, 2016, Bastille Day in Nice, France. A Tunisian-born French resident drives a 20-ton truck nearly a mile through a crowded seaside promenade. Eighty-six people killed, more than 200 others wounded. ISIS claimed responsibility. Why do these vehicle attacks often seem more deadly than other tactics?",

You just rent a vehicle, buy a vehicle, and use it as a weapon.Secondly, just like school shooters, look at Columbine or other famous school shootings, and kind of obsess about them. And terrorists examine other terrorists and they say, well, what worked? Clearly, vehicle rammings have worked. TODD (voice over): October 2017, an Islamic extremist from Uzbekistan jumps a curb in a rental truck in Manhattan, drives down a bicycle path along the west side highway and kills eight people. Authorities found a note near the truck claiming the attack was in the name of ISIS. A couple of months earlier, a domestic extremist, a white nationalist, slammed his vehicle into a crowd of counter-protesters at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one woman and injuring almost 20 others. Analyst Peter Bergen says vehicle attacks with their bloodcurdling optics have a distinct psychological impact.",

Some of the coldest air of the season so far.Today we still have a lot of that cold bottled up to the north in the usual places, the northern plains, the Great Lakes, interior New England. It's not really until later in the weekend that some of that cold really starts to spill south. And this storm is going to be the trigger for it. It develops on Saturday, and then by Sunday really blows up with a lot of moisture. We've got a cold rain for most of the southeast. Could be some heavy snow and then a stripe of maybe some significant icing. That ice could be stretching from the Ozarks to the Tennessee and the Ohio Valleys. That could be significant, causing dangerous travel, problems with trees and power lines. Again, some of that snow could be heavy. So, we're watching that winter portion of this very closely. You get some of the snow and the ice because we do have some cold air that it tries to tap into. But behind that storm it's going to pull in even more cold air and that outbreak of arctic air comes in as we go into the workweek and that's just round one of several rounds as we go through the next couple of days and weeks in January. We'll find temperatures 15 to 25 degrees below average by Monday, from Kansas City to Nashville, starting to spread eastward by Tuesday and Wednesday, Atlanta with temperatures pretty chilly, 15 to 20 degrees below average, Nashville, Saint Louis, Cincinnati. We're looking at more than 70 percent of the lower 48 with temperatures well below freezing. We'll find these temperatures again just really cold, and it gets even colder by the middle of January.
