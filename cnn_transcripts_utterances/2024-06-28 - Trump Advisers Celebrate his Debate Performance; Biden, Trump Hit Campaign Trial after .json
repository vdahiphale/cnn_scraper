He lied about January 6th. He lied about immigration, a whole host of -- host of other issues that our team has been fact checking. But on the optics front, they think he was very strong. Now I also just to give you a sense of what his schedule like is today, I told you he's going to be having a rally in Virginia. When I talked to Trump's campaign advisors, they said that they are feeling very buoyed that they think he is going into this rally today in a great place you can anticipate him to take a victory lap. And the importance of this rally and the state is that look Virginia is a state Donald Trump had lost in the past two presidential elections, but his team has been privately and publicly arguing that they think it is winnable for Trump in November, and they feel that -- they feel more confident in that goal after the debate last night, Becky",

I'm told by an advisor to President Biden that not only does he not plan to drop out of the race at this point, but he remains committed to a second debate in September. The Biden campaign argues that there's no basis for him to drop out, and that voters share different views than pundits. And that they will side more with the substance of the arguments rather than the performance aspects though, as you note, it cannot be denied that Donald Trump onstage was far more animated than President Biden's performance, which even his aides and advisers acknowledge was lackluster and was below their own expectations. Even so President Biden has been course correcting in the immediate wake of the debate. He went to a watch party and visited with supporters.

To be sure that is one of the major frustrations that the Biden campaign is taking away from the debate that President Biden was thrust into a defensive role when in fact checking, although given Trump's history of his public remarks and his alternative versions of events, perhaps they should have expected to be in that role. Now the challenge for the president is what happens today this event in Raleigh, North Carolina, presenting a fresh face to voters presenting those ideas, that substance where he's really trying to draw the contrast with Donald Trump and perhaps there's going to be an effort to make that contrast starker and clearer after last night's debate, Becky.",

No one gets there -- no one there isn't a big pot of money. And the United States didn't put 100 percent in or nearly 100 percent, as Donald Trump said it was like 71 percent. At the time, NATO has increased its spending, but clearly his messages is going to come back and it's going to be more of the same what he had to say about President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. We can't keep spending the money this way. He made it sound like Zelenskyy comes and gets whatever he wants. There are a lot of falsehoods in there. So that, you know what we're going to take away from this is that Donald Trump, if he wins, again, is going to attack NATO the same way he did before is going to enable Putin potentially. It's certainly indicated to Putin, that the war would end at the end of the year before he even became president, which indicates to Putin that he can double down despite the economic woes that Russia faces double down, make all the gains you can this year, and that maybe President Biden by about President Trump by them, will be making a deal with you, in terms of which we're not clear on. It's just playing against the interests of NATO. And he's talking about raising tariffs on trade with the European Union. It's against Europe in so many ways. So that will be coming back. And I would just flip back to what we were saying about the Middle East, when Donald Trump said that Israel should be allowed to finish. What did he mean by that? Did he mean finish in Gaza? Or did he mean finish dealing with Hezbollah in the north, because there are concerns there? Certainly, we know that Prime Minister Netanyahu has been essentially trying to play into the end zone of the of the Biden presidency. And if the analysis here is correct, that has now begun. That is lame duck now. Then Prime Minister Netanyahu has got this where he wants it and endorsement. And does that make a war in Lebanon, more likely because of what we heard last night? You know, it's the dangers of opening the possibilities without looking at the end result of the implications of the statement and that was Donald Trump's initial presidency.",

The second reason is one of the ones that you mentioned is that there is actually a pretty broad spectrum of candidates that are up for the vote this time. You'll recall, when we were here on the ground, actually, in the last presidential election, when Ebrahim Raisi was voted into office that the moderate side really didn't have very much in the way of any sort of viable candidates. Well, that's different this time you have those four candidates who are still in the race, you mentioned that three of them are conservative. I would say two of those conservatives can be considered front runners. One of them is of course, Mohammad Ghalibaf, who is currently the speaker of Iranian parliament, also the Former Mayor of Tehran. And then you have Saeed Jalili, whom we all know very well from our international reporting, as having been Iran's Former Chief Nuclear Negotiator. Both Mr. Ghalibaf and Mr. Jalili have said that they want to continue the policies of Ebrahim Raisi and his administration, which of course, meant a very tough line towards Israel. Of course, now, we know that Israel and Iran have been on the brink of war in the past couple of months, and, of course, a tough line towards the United States as well. So that alone could have big repercussions in the greater Middle Eastern region. And then you have Mr. Masoud Pezeshkian, who's called for better relations with countries here in the region, but in general, for diplomatic offensive, if you will. And we do see that he has been having some momentum among voters, we have of course been on the ground here. I can show you where we are right now. You can see people are signing up right now handing in their documents, and then be able to vote. Of course, as we know, you've been you've seen this process firsthand. So many times, Becky, people handing in their ID cards, then getting the ballot papers and then going back there to the ballot box to hand that in. Some of the people that we've been speaking to do believe that the moderates this time have a little more momentum than maybe we have seen in the last couple of elections, that does seem to be drawing people to come here and vote as well. You can see behind me that here right now, there's a bit of a line going on. It is still fairly early, though, of course, Becky.",

It would make some sense for him to do so, except there are no clear procedures for doing so. He has nearly 100 percent of the delegates at the Democratic National Convention, and they are committed to him on the first ballot, they're committed. So he would have to agree himself, he would have to step down. And the only conceivable way that I can see that it might happen is if Former Presidents, Obama and Clinton and Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other big shots in the Democratic Party had to come to Jesus meeting in the White House with the both Biden's with the First Lady as well as the president. There's no indication that will happen. And Joe Biden has worked hard to get into the White House, and I doubt he's going to give it up.",

And we have been taking a look at international reaction to what happened last night on the stage. In France Le Monde's newspaper saying Biden was quote, drowning during the clash. And other publication describing the sitting president is old and worn out. The Italian papers with a similar tone one claiming Democrats are now in severe panic, another paper saying Donald Trump was energetic but did not score points. We'll bring back Mina Al-Oraibi Editor-in-Chief of The National. I think it is really important at this stage, and some might think it's too early to do this, but I think it is. So we're going to do it. We could very well be looking at Donald Trump Administration -- come November, we could be looking at another Biden Administration come November. Although if you watch the debate last night, that looks more and more unlikely. Or we could conceivably be looking at Joe Biden stepping away and -- other Democrat stepping into his shoes and possibly win. What does all that mean, for example, this region, Mina? AL-ORAIBI: Well, last night's debate was so thin on policy that it's hard to extract from that. And always as we know these elections are so domestically focused, however, as you said, Donald Trump is known to the region, Joe Biden is known to the region. And there is a sense that another president chill term for Joe Biden just means more of the same, or basically the U.S. is missing an action. Now they will argue they're here. They're present. But frankly, and we've seen this since the Gaza war from October and the Hamas attack and October 7th till now. He was really hasn't been able to do much except really support Israel, but not be able to convince Israel of the need to get to a political move. And so the question becomes, if it's Joe Biden Administration, how weak the U.S. generally will be, and then you've got Donald Trump, that Donald Trump that came in the previous elections. It's different from today, because he came in for this region. The people that were known in his administration were largely the military figures. You have people like -- and others come in, and so they have those ties. The next Donald Trump Administration will not look like that. And then third, if there is a new, as you said, contender that comes from the Democrats, that will be a new lease of life for the Democrats. You know, I keep thinking how is the NATO Summit going to happen in just a few days where people have to go and face Joe Biden, after he has been, you know, really torn apart by this debate. And so for this region is thinking about, we don't want a weak U.S. President, but actually, how consequential is the U.S. going to be?",

I mean, you hear a lot of leadership around this region, wanting to do business with a stronger U.S., wanting the U.S. to be present in this region, supporting this region. But it feels like you know, that they're struggling to get, you know, to get anybody to pick up the phone, when they call Washington is this again to seal a phrase? AL-ORAIBI: Yeah, there, I think that's a really important point to make. But it's not that this region is turning back on the U.S. The U.S. still is seen as hugely technologically advanced, the U.S. dollar is hugely important and so forth. So I don't think we should belittle the consequence of America. Its American politics and particularly Washington that's raising these questions, today and I have to do this because you know, I always bring in Iraq today marks 20 years since America handed back sovereignty to the Iraqi government. We've seen since 20 years what's happened since that question of the determined there was sovereignty in Iraq when it comes on and off. They've been so many questions about Joe Biden's Middle East policy, especially because he was so big on Iraq. And so after 20 years, hopefully there's enough reflection Washington, the belief as though that the elections are sticking up all the air to really have reflection on where the U.S. stands in the region.",
