SANCHEZIn recent years, members of the Proud Boys and other organizations have been spotted wearing those letters on their clothing and their tactical vests. Keep in mind, this comes amid a staggering jump in domestic terror-related investigations. The Government Accountability Office says that number of investigations has grown 357 percent over the last decade. I want to bring in an expert now to discuss. CNN National Security Analyst, Juliette Kayyem, joins us now. So, Juliette, RWDS, where did that originate and what does it tell you that this shooter had that insignia on his chest?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, the fact he had the insignia means that he at least was a proponent of this idea. So, let me explain because it's a complicated network of ideas.The first is RWDS is actually a group, that there have been known groups who define themselves as Right Wing Death Squads. They are, of course, violent. There have been cases or at least reporting of members of the military being planning events using RWDS as sort of an affiliated group. There is one case involving attempts to go after the DNC of this loosely defined group. Okay, so that's - they're not as - they weren't as strong as the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers, but they existed. The second is, of course, it's a violent ideology. As you were saying, it's the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, they sort of embrace this idea of RWDS or what's called the full RWDS, which you can imagine what that means. It is just violence to kill those who don't believe with them. A famous and now defunct sub-Reddit site called \"The Donald\" proposed and adopted the RWDS insignia. Third, I just have to say it's also legacy. There's a lot of talk about race and ethnicity in this case, given the shooter. It has ties to Latin American and South American dictatorship. This group really likes Pinochet, the Chilean dictator who is known for his extermination and his disappearance of political affiliates. So, this is not, this is a - this group, this idea exists not for political discourse, but to kill. And that is why this should be viewed as a politically motivated crime.",

      "sentences": "No. No. So, this is a very complicated aspect of right-wing extremism. We would assume that everyone's white in some Caucasian sense, but Hispanic and people with Hispanic sounding names ethnically identify.See, Hispanic is an ethnicity. It's not a race. And so, a lot of Hispanics might identify as being or sometimes identify as being white. This is true of the leadership of Proud Boys, a Cuban, African, American as well as some of the leading right-wing sort of podcasters like Nick Fuentes. The second is that within the Hispanic community, and it's something that they're dealing with, there can be anti-black racism and other ways in which they will more identify with the white community against, say, the African American community, or even other Hispanics. So, we shouldn't think, because someone has a certain last name, they can't possibly be a right-wing. That is actually just not true. The leadership, the podcasters, the - what I call the hate stew, is not all white in this country.",

In fact, he tells us that some of those who were killed were among his friends.He tells me what he saw. He was standing right across the street here out this corner when he saw George Alvarez driving in that Range Rover, barreling through this intersection, making his way towards that bus stop where the men were sitting down on the corner, plowing directly into them. Now, the video that we're about to show you is exclusive to CNN. It shows the aftermath of that crash. And according to Romero (ph), Alvarez tried to run from the scene. And that's something that is corroborated and has been corroborated by police. That group of men that you're seeing there trying to subdue Alvarez, keep him from running away. Interestingly enough, I talked to the Brownsville Police Department this morning and they tell me that the district attorney is considering potential charges against those men who are seen assaulting Alvarez on the video. It's a fact that has really caught people here in the community off guard, frustrating them, because Alvarez is charged with eight counts of manslaughter and 10 counts of aggravated assault. Police have still not yet ruled out whether or not this was intentional. That's part of their investigation, as is whether or not he was potentially impaired or intoxicated. They're also considering that this could potentially just be a horrible accident and that the car malfunctioned. Of course, what's really underscoring the anxiety in this community here and leading many to believe that this may have been intentional was this happened - this incident happened just days before Title 42 is set to expire. And there's many here in this community who are really worried what that means to the migration pattern coming to these small towns across the U.S.-Mexico border. Brianna?",

It really doesn't get any bigger than this because an actual default would be an absolute nightmare and virtually all Americans would feel the impact.Now, it's hard to say precisely what would happen because it's never happened before. But investors and economists are being forced to kind of game out the unthinkable. The White House published an analysis where they look to see what would happen to the economy under a near default, a short default and a protracted default. And they found that the economy would lose jobs under all three scenarios. But the protracted default would wipe out more than eight million jobs, GDP would plunge, the stock market would get cut in half. It would just be a disaster. And the problem for investors is that U.S. debt has long been seen as really one of the safest securities on the planet. Treasuries are a cornerstone of modern finance. So if you take that away, things could get real messy real fast. Now, all of this has sparked some speculation about what kind of break the glass plans might be tucked away in Washington in case this turns into an emergency. And one of those ideas that's often floated is that President Biden could continue to pay - could continue to issue debt by invoking the 14th Amendment, to declare the debt ceiling unconstitutional. But Treasury officials, they are pushing back on this idea because it would probably end up in a messy court battle. Listen to what Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had to say about the 14th Amendment this weekend. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
