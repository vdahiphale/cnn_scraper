Kind of foggy in New York City, here on this Tuesday morning of this Thanksgiving holiday week. Good morning, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt. It's wonderful to have you with us. Let the trade wars begin. Donald Trump making good on a campaign promise to increase tariffs on America's biggest trading partners. In a Truth Social post, the president-elect announcing that, on day one of his second administration, he plans to institute a 25 percent tax on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico. The move, he said, is retaliation for the movement of drugs and undocumented immigrants across America's borders. Trump followed up that post with another promising to raise existing tariffs on Chinese goods a further 10 percent, blaming China for their role in the fentanyl trade. In a statement to CNN, the Chinese embassy responded, saying, quote, \"No one will win a trade war or a tariff war.\" Tariffs are effectively a tax on imported goods, and experts warn that they result in higher prices for goods that Americans buy every day. Shortly before the election, the CEOs of Colombia and AutoZone said this: quote, \"We'll just raise the prices. It's going to be very, very difficult to keep products affordable for Americans.\" And, quote, \"If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer.\" And this just last week from the CFO of America's largest retailer, Walmart.
