We had known that Trump had made this phone call, but what this is revealing is the actual details and words of that phone call. And we're seeing this pressure that Trump and also Ronna McDaniel put on these canvassers to not sign the certification. This was after sort of their flip-flop of their votes. They said that they had voted nay to the certification. Then they got some flak from the fellow canvassers. They said they felt pressured, so they changed their vote to yes, and that's when that phone call happened. What Trump apparently said on this phone call, one of the things he said, it's -- they heard four minutes' worth -- one of the things he said, he said: \"Everyone knows Detroit is crooked as hell.\" And what Donald Trump was referring to was his constant claims that the vote count, false claims, I might add, that the vote count in Detroit was somehow rigged or fraudulent. That was never proven, but he continued to talk about that repeatedly, and that's what he's referring to there. The emergence of this audio, it is important. It happened several years ago now, but we are in the midst of the special counsel case, trial here in D.C., and the -- trying to change the vote in Michigan is one of the factors, one of the crucial elements of Jack Smith's case.

So, really, it seems that Ronna McDaniel and Donald Trump were successful in convincing them not to sign the certification. She said, look, if you can help it, if you cannot go back in there, not sign it, we will help you get attorneys. Donald Trump agreed with that on the phone call. Ronna McDaniel has issued a statement about this. She's saying this: \"What I said publicly and repeated at the time, as referenced in my letter on November 21, 2020, is that there was ample evidence that warranted an audit.\" So she's continuing to press that she believed that the election results should have been looked into, using that as her defense for what we're hearing from her on the phone call here.",

Let's bring in former U.S. attorney Harry Litman. Harry, all of this sounds eerily reminiscent. What do you think about this new recording and how significant that could be for prosecutors, folks like the special counsel, Jack Smith? What do you think? HARRY LITMAN, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  Yes, I think that's exactly right. It really is of a piece, as you said, Jim, with the infamous phone call to Raffensperger. One key difference, these two canvassers -- one has since died -- played ball. They came back the next day, tried to rescind their votes, never did sign, and then said publicly this call from the president of the United States, they didn't quite remember what was said. They think he was just congratulating them on their good work. So it really is, here, one where he was successful, but it didn't keep them from certifying the election. It is -- it feeds totally into Jack Smith's case, which already concerns Michigan. This call is not in there, but we have to expect they have it. In addition, it's a state crime, almost certainly, because Michigan law prohibits bribery, getting a public official to try not to do their duty by offering something of value. Here, that would be a lawyer, because they knew, everyone knew it would be needed. So this is hot water all around.",

The -- Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the ambassador, said that the U.S. didn't ultimately vote for it because of the lack of condemnation of Hamas and its attack on October 7, saying that she will never understand why certain members of that council didn't support that. But she did welcome the fact that this resolution will appoint a senior U.N. official to help coordinate and facilitate the entry of aid into Gaza. Israeli officials, for their part, aren't altogether condemning this resolution, but they are saying that they will continue this war against Hamas until all hostages are returned and until Hamas is eradicated from the Gaza Strip. There is an effort to scale up the flow of aid into Gaza. Today, I was at the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel into Gaza, where, for the first week, after a lot of U.S. pressure, Israel has been allowing the entry of U.N. trucks directly into Gaza from Israel after they undergo those security checks. But there is still a very big disconnect, both in terms of the number of trucks that are getting in and the enormous need in Gaza for much, much more aid, and also in terms of Israeli officials recognizing the reality and the facts of what is happening in Gaza. Today, I spoke with Colonel Moshe Tetro, who is the senior Israeli military officer in charge of coordinating the delivery of that aid in Gaza. And with a straight face, he looked at me and he said that there is no food shortage in Gaza. That is not the case, according to accounts on the ground, according to the United Nations, the World Food Program, which said that at least half of Gazans are currently experiencing severe or extreme hunger. And so there is certainly a big disconnect on the ground in terms of what Israeli officials are seeing, and, again, the need still very, very large for Gazans who are continuing to suffer.",

      "sentences": "So, you hear Israel compare its airstrikes in Gaza to the U.S. coalition targeting of ISIS.But, actually, this concentration of bombs that Israel has dropped per square mile in Gaza, at least the first month of this war, hasn't been seen since Vietnam. That is how one former U.S. defense intelligence analyst describes it. And new analysis by CNN and A.I. company Synthetaic suggests that Israel dropped hundreds of massive bombs on Gaza. You look at satellite imagery here revealing more than 500 impact craters that exceed 40 feet in diameter. And that is important, because it's consistent with a 2,000-pound bomb. Keep in mind, these are four times heavier than the largest bombs the U.S. dropped on ISIS in Mosul, Iraq, during that pivotal battle to remove that extremist group from that country. Weapons and warfare experts blame the extensive use of heavy munitions like these 2,000- pound bombs for the soaring death toll of Palestinians that we have seen in Gaza. And this is very important. It is not just the point of impact of this crater here that's most concerning. It is actually this, the potential kill zone from a crater that can extend up to 1,200 feet, which is an area equivalent of more -- to more than 75 football fields, that area equivalent to more than 75 football fields. And so you have the U.S. and other Western allies pressuring Israel over the scale of the disproportionate devastation in Gaza, President Biden even recently accusing Israel of indiscriminate bombing. Israeli officials argue that its heavy munitions are necessary to eliminating Hamas, whose fighters, of course, killed brutally more than 1,200 people and took more than 240 hostages in Israel on October 7. Officials also claim that they're going to extraordinary lengths to minimize civilian casualties. And yet we see the death toll in Gaza. And that tells another story. The Hamas-controlled Ministry of Health says that about 20,000 people have been killed since October 7. And these are not perfect numbers, it is very true. They count a hospital attack from a misfired Islamic Jihad rocket as Israeli, when it clearly was not. But they are widely accepted to grossly reflect the casualties. And most of the dead are women and children, according to these figures. Just last week, the U.S. intelligence sources, some of them telling CNN that 40 to 45 percent of the 29,000 air-to-surface munitions that Israel dropped on Gaza were so-called dumb bombs. That means they're unguided bombs, and that means that they pose a significantly greater threat to civilians, especially in densely populated Gaza. And because of the sheer number of bombs dropped, some of these 2,000- pound bombs are likely dumb bombs. Now, Israel has a large arsenal of the big dumb bombs, known as Mark 84s. And according to two people who are familiar with the matter, the U.S. has provided Israel with more than 5,400 of those Mark 84s since October 7. The 2,000-pound bombs feature prominently in attacks on the perimeter of Gaza City, the epicenter of the Israeli military operation in October and much of November and one such strike you see here. This was the one on the Jabalia refugee camp. And then in another instance, you can see a large crater consistent with one of those bombs. It was seen on a coastal highway that runs through a major Palestinian refugee camp known as Beach Camp. In a neighborhood just north of that camp, 14 craters indicating 2,000-pound bombs appear in just one square kilometer. And in one area near Beach Camp, seven schools were within the lethal fragmentation zone of at least five craters, seven schools. Let's talk more now about this with CNN military analyst retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton, who's going to walk us through some of this. And, actually, you were very helpful as well in helping us understand some of what we have seen in this. Israeli officials have consistently compared, as I was mentioning, the war that they are waging against Hamas with the war that U.S. and coalition forces and Iraqi forces waged against ISIS. The statistics don't exactly line up here. And I know, look, at a certain point, we're arguing about degrees of awfulness. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Right.",

So, when you look at the kind of fusing that's involved with the Mark 84, when you look at the types of things that are part of that process in terms of targeting and in terms of putting this bomb together, most of the tunnels that you're dealing with in Gaza are between 100 and 160 feet deep, at least in some of their deeper areas. So if it's a 160-foot-deep tunnel, this is not going to do anything for it. You have to hit the entrance shafts. You have to hit the areas where they get air, where they might have a power connection source, either entrance or exit areas.

And so that's what these kinds of bombs are designed to do. The fact that the Israelis have them doesn't mean that they're using them in this case.
