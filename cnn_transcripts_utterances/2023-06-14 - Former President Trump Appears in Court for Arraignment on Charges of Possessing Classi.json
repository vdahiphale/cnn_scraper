There were many, many security people around Donald Trump. There were some members of the public able to witness this, but not many. Just a handful. And then the press, 20 or so, maybe 30 members of the press that were able to be in that room as well to witness the proceedings.And whenever Trump was there, he seemed to be not in a great mood, honestly. He was slumped over for some of the proceedings. He is a really tall man. He is taller than both of his lawyers. But when he was seated, he often was -- sat down lower than both of the lawyers on either of his sides. There were other times where he had his arms crossed, just listening to the judge. He looked at the prosecutor a few times, but not really. I don't believe there was any eye contact that Trump ever made with Jack Smith, the special counsel, in that room. But this proceeding, it was procedural but it really marked an important start to that case. The former president of the United States being placed on under arrest for these charges. And the beginnings of the proceedings that will head towards a trial. There was a judge that was doing this yesterday, a judge named Jonathan Goodman. He's a magistrate here in the Southern District of Florida. At the end of the proceeding, he said this is the end for me. It will go to others in this case, and that is indeed what will happen next. Donald Trump's codefendant who was in the courtroom tomorrow, he is expected to be entering a plea of not guilty just like Trump did yesterday but at a later date once he gets a lawyer in Florida to help him with his case. That will be before a different judge. And then it's in the hands of Judge Aileen Cannon, the federal district judge, the lifetime appointee by Donald Trump himself.

And then when the proceedings began, I was able to physically go inside the courtroom itself, which there is no leaving. There is no talking to anyone. There is no electronics there. But the rest of our team, these high school students, Evan Perez, and then two of our additional reporters on the justice team, Tierney Sneed and Hannah Rabinowitz, they were in that room strategizing. Like \"Settlers of Catan,\" they were trying to figure out how to get access to two working pay phones in that jury room to call the news out.And so they designated one of the high school students to receive notes from them and call the only local number, one of the only local numbers they had because the phones only reached Miami numbers, to call into an editor who was able to then relay the news to the network, get news out as what was happening in the courtroom regularly as they were watching.

Second of all, though, this idea that the Espionage Act is only meant for traitors and spies is just not true. Of course, there are provisions of the Espionage Act that target traitors and spies, but there's also the provision under which Trump and many people before him have been charged. It's known as 793-E, and it makes a crime to willfully retain national defense information and refuse to deliver it to the United States. Nothing in that provision requires you to be a spy, to do any classic espionage, to even deliver the information to anyone.And as an example, you can go back and look at another indictment, the 2017 indictment of a former NSA contractor named Harold Martin. He was accused of taking a whole bunch of classified information and just keeping it in his car and his house. He was never accused in court of giving it to anyone, of being a spy. He was essentially portrayed as a kind of hoarder. He ended up pleading guilty. So not a spy. This provision was applied, and he was convicted and sentenced.",

Listen to this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Threatening me with 400 years in prison for possessing my own presidential papers, which just about every other president has done, is one of the most outrageous and vicious legal theories ever put forward in an American court of law.

It says that all official records from a presidency are the property of the federal government, the National Archives, the moment that president leaves office. As one expert put it to me, the fact that former President Trump violated the Presidential Records Act does not prevent him from being charged for also allegedly violating another law.There are two other problems of fact in that quote we just played. Number one, he is not actually being threatened with 400 years in prison. Federal sentencing does not work by adding up the maximum possible sentence for each crime. So that's not realistic. And second of all, it's just not true that just about every other president has done what he has done. No other president in the Presidential Records Act era, so starting with President Ronald Reagan, has done anything like take a trove of sensitive classified documents and refuse to give them back to the federal government when asked repeatedly to do so.

Or will the public believe that if again, as she did in the appointment of the special master, she is going too far to support the Trump defense? Essentially ignoring precedent doing things that are unsupported by law. Will she have credibility? And if the answer is no, then maybe she should recuse herself.",

Those events are now more than two years in the rearview mirror, the January 6 committee that I served on, we investigated that, and we're in many respects way out ahead of the Justice Department in our interviewing of witnesses, in our gathering of documents, that should not have been the case.So, I don't know that you can judge based on the pace of investigation. The Mar-a-Lago case is very discreet, it has a very discreet set of facts, it was more capable, investigating more rapidly. And they got to the point where they could make a decision, I would hope and expect they'll make a decision on these other cases with do speed as well.",

But this is really an effort at the end of the day to distract from Donald Trump's legal problems, to gratify Donald Trump by going after someone they feel was his most effective adversary.
