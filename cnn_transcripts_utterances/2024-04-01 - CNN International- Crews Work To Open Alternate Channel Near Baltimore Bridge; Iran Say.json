We begin in Baltimore where crews have begun the process of removing debris from the water from the catastrophic bridge collapse in Baltimore, Maryland. Over the weekend, demolition crews began cutting a portion of the bridge taken down by the 213 million-pound cargo ship Dali. That work as part of an effort to open a temporary channel that would allow ships in the water to pass as officials tried to get reopen access to the port of Baltimore for construction crew members who were thrown from the bridge remain missing as conditions in the water still too dangerous for divers. Today, the White House announced President Biden will visit the site on Friday. CNN's Pete Muntean is back on the scene for us today. Pete, I wonder, do we know how soon a passage for ships might open there?",

It seems like this temporary alternate channel being opened up by the state of Maryland and the Coast Guard, and the Army Corps of Engineers could open up a lot sooner than they will be able to clear the Patapsco River and the debris scattered across it and the MV Dali, which is still pinned in place here.But you can see some of the larger heavy-lift cranes that are now in place behind me. The U.N. Navy just gave us an update and they say that three heavy-lift cranes are now on site here in Baltimore harbor, the Chesapeake, that is the big 1,000 ton lift capacity crane, along with another crime called the Oyster Bay. Another one called the Ferrell. They have a fraction of the lifting capacity that the Chesapeake does. But the operation now is really focused on cut and chunk and then move, when you consider the fact that there's about 3,000 to 4,000 tons of debris that are now scattered in the way here of the port of Baltimore. And those cranes only have about 1,000 or maybe a few hundred your pen lifting capacity. They have to break it up into smaller bite-sized chunks, then move it so that you can clear out the way here. Remember, the MV Dali is pinned in place here. There is debris across its bow. And so after they able to open up this temporary alternate lane, then they will be able to move the Dali and then when the real work begins, that is one they will really start in earnest to clear the debris that is completely blocking off the port of Baltimore here and the churning of this port that directly impacts about 8,000 to 15,000 jobs. So this is really central, not only did the economy in Baltimore, but also the economy in Maryland, a place where a lot of cars are exported, a lot of commodities like salt and sugar come into the port of Baltimore. This is huge. There was a global impact here, and so there was a lot of activity and now a lot of trepidation about when this will actually be able to be reopened. Although we could find out here in the next few minutes from Governor Wes Moore, who is expected to update the media just a little bit more about what the timeline is. Officials have been really, really gun shy about being able to say specifically, when this could actually be reopened. They don't want to make platitude nor false promises about when this could really ultimately get moving again but a lot more activity here than we have seen in days past, and we're still finding out more about when this could reopen, although no definitive timeline yet.",

As we wait for that press conference from the Maryland Governor Wes Moore updating on the situation there.We're also covering stories overseas, including the U.S.-Israel holding virtual talks today on Israel still planned incursion into Rafah in Gaza. The Biden administration is still working to persuade Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of alternative ways which the U.S. believes Israel can dismantle Hamas in the southern Gaza City of Rafah without launching a ground offensive, where some 1 million Palestinians are currently sheltering. Here's how White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre reviewed or previewed, rather, that conversation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: If they are going to move forward with a military operations, we have to have this conversation, we have to understand how they're going to move forward. We and I'll say one more thing when Jake Sullivan was here at the podium not too long ago, he believed and he said there are alternative -- alternative ways of doing this, alternative ways of going after Hamas.

      "sentences": "Well, the short answer, Jim, is that we just don't know yet because these conversations happen this morning. There is scheduled to last for about two hours, or understanding row officials, they lasted a little bit over that period of time. But as you said, the prime minister of Israel and the president of the United States have been directly at odds with one another when it comes to an operation in Rafah with Netanyahu saying that it is necessary to carry out a ground invasion there in order to destroy Hamas and the Biden administration believing that there are more specific attacks that can be taken, precision strikes that can be taken in Rafah that would achieve the same outcome.And U.S. officials have also pointed out to Israel that their reputation is also on the line here as the world is watching, you know, what happens with the Israel-Hamas war and the numbers of civilians that have been killed, they fear, of course, that an all out assault on Rafah ground operation there would really jeopardize the lives of innocent civilians who live there, 1.5 million of them approximately. So what we're watching to see is we talked two sources after this meeting today is if they were to people to have any sort of productive conversation given just how different the two sides are going into this meeting today. This meeting was supposed to happen last week, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hold it down because of the U.S. move when it came to that U.N. Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire and an immediate one at that. And so the fact that it was rescheduled today, of course, is forward movement. It was virtual, however. And so, U.S. officials are also looking to potentially have these conversations in person. We'll have to see if that actually falls out as well.",

That petered out pretty quickly because the Iranians in their haste to shoot down everything that they thought was coming towards Tehran, shutdown a passenger jet.But so, they will reach out and they will hit. You know, the calculation that Israel has been making so far and thinking back to Christmas day, strike in Damascus, they killed a very senior IRGC advisor talking into experts in Israel and one of the experts I was speaking to at the time was former head of defense intelligence and plotted and planned operations for Israel inside Syria before that had gone on an unannounced and unclaimed afterwards. He told me that Israel felt that it was walking up to a red line, not crossing a red line because it believed that this these targets, were not sufficient to draw Iran into a massive war, because the cost would be too high for Iran. But right now, look, Israel's under huge pressure domestically to open up and allow people back to its northern border, or 100,000 people are outside of their homes away from the northern border. That's because the tension with Hezbollah as a proxy of Iran, as you've very well- known, Jim. And so, a strike like this against Iran potentially has the impact of Hezbollah escalating. And there are certain factions and political side, military side in Israel would like nothing better than for Hezbollah to escalate so that they can escalate against Hezbollah because they believe that Hezbollah is a long, an ongoing threat for Israel.",

That individual had an AR-15 rifle and a nail gun. He was confronted by agents, fled picked up by state troopers in a rural area later, and then died in a shootout. His postings, and that individual was Ricky Shiffer, a 42-year-old man. His postings indicated anger since the search of Donald Trumps home at Mar-a-Lago and that he was ready to take on the FBI and that people should be gearing up for war. So, that came spilling out right away. I'm told from people who have looked at the social media involving the individual taken into custody today, there's nothing like that apparent. But, of course, they've just started to dig into that as have we. SCIUTTO: No question. And there's a reason why installations like this have security, like we're seeing there.

I remind you that on Friday, he posted a video of Biden -- it was an image of Biden tied up with his hands and feet in the back of a pickup truck. When asked about why he posted that, his campaign said that it was something he saw when he was in Long Island and just posted the video despite the fact that it is obviously dangerous and dark imagery there.This is something that Donald Trump has long done. This is something that his team also does. If you ask them ever for a statement, they almost always respond with this kind of vitriol and this kind of rhetoric. Donald Trump's strategy when it comes to these various legal cases has been the same, which is to discredit the prosecutors, to discredit the judges. And what we saw over the weekend saw that he was lashing out, particularly at is impending trial in New York, the judge there and the daughter of the judge there. Now, in addition to the fact that Trump has a gag order on him in that case placed by the judge, the district attorney went back last week to ask, is that gag order applied to the judges daughter as well, and we still don't have an answer on that, the district attorney saying that it should apply in this case. But again, Jim, we have seen this time and time again, we have seen this for years really since 2015, but obviously now with these legal issues, it has escalated in a very different way. There is nothing in terms of Donald Trumps team for them to interpret or for them to defend, because this is exactly how Donald Trump has chosen to defend himself in these various legal battles.",

And they're both considered essential on the pathway back to the White House. Donald Trump is going to be here in green bay, Wisconsin where we are holding a rally it does seem like there's going to be very good attendance. One thing that's interesting about the state of Wisconsin is it was such a narrow margin that Donald Trump lost by, in 2020 and his team really feels like they can turn this around.I talked to one campaign adviser who said they have not put any money into the state yet, but all of the information that they're seeing is showing him virtually tied with President Joe Biden here now I didn't, as we know, has visited this state multiple times and he has sent surrogates here. Donald Trump has not been here since 2020 to Biden's team also is flooding the airwaves here. We've seen that. Donald Trump has not put any money toward ad campaigns at this point, but yet they are still feeling somewhat confident. Now whether or not confidence is backed up or is misplaced, we're just going to have to wait and find out. But I will tell you, I've talked to a number of voters here in one voter in particular who was really interesting, who said that they voted for Trump in 2016, was tired of him in 2020, didn't vote for anyone, but that they and several of their friends, were going to go back to voting for Donald Trump in 2016. We, of course, will be on this to see if this is a pattern when talking to voters or if this is just a small microcosm. But, of course, every bit of information counts when we know this phrase is going to be so incredibly close.",
