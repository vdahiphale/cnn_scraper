I'm Paula Newton in New York.Just ahead, venom and vengeance. Donald Trump delivers his closing arguments with a speech full of dark rhetoric, fear-mongering, and outright lies. In the Middle East, a new round of ceasefire talks now underway as the toll in Gaza continues to climb. And the looming political crisis in Georgia. The president announcing the country's recent election results and calling for protests in the streets of Tbilisi. So Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have eight days left to convince Americans they're the right choice to lead the U.S. for the next four years. CNN's latest national polling average shows little to no daylight. You can see it there between the two candidates. So it'll be a busy week, of course, on the campaign trail as both Harris and Trump barnstorm across the handful of battleground states that experts have been telling us will decide the election. On Sunday, Trump went back to his hometown of New York City for a massive rally at Madison Square Garden and he was joined by more than a dozen of his most loyal supporters who set a dark tone and a slew of insults in nativist language.

This is on the heels of Donald Trump now referring to the United States as a trash can, meaning that immigrants are coming here. So what is the trash? Immigrants.

It's specifically with mostly younger Black and Latino men. And I think, you know, we can very easily look at this and say that biases against women in leadership positions is driving this. We know that in general there's about a 13 point bias or 13 percent of Americans say they are angry or afraid of the idea of a woman in the White House. And with Kamala Harris being a woman of color, I'm always worried looking at the polls that they're not going to be accurate as they weren't for Clinton.

Those high-level negotiations have now begun. That is for the first time in more than two months. Top negotiators from the U.S., Israel, and Qatar will be working to reach a deal, as U.S. officials argue for renewed momentum following Israel's killing of Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar.Egypt, which has long played a role as a key mediator in those talks, is proposing an initial two-day ceasefire. For now, there remains no end in sight in the war in Gaza. On Sunday, Israel's military claimed it targeted Hamas in an airstrike on a school near Gaza City. Gaza's civil defense says several people were killed in a place where hundreds of displaced people were sheltering. This as the conflict in Lebanon also rages on. CNN's Jim Sciutto reports now from Jerusalem. JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST:  We had multiple reminders today that the war in the region is a war on multiple fronts, and arguably each of those fronts is getting hotter, or at least not cooling down. Today, Israeli authorities are describing a truck that hit a bus stop just north of Tel Aviv as a terror attack that killed one person, injured more than 30 others, one in a series of terror attacks we've seen in recent weeks here in Israel. There was also a stabbing attack targeting soldiers today. In addition to that, the IDF announced today the deaths of six Israeli soldiers, one of them from ongoing fighting in Gaza, five others from fighting in southern Lebanon, two other fronts of course of this war. And then sources tell me today that as part of the Israel strike on Iran overnight on Friday and into early Saturday morning, a strike that involved some 100 Israeli warplanes, that some of those warplanes breached Iranian airspace during that attack. Not all of those warplanes, but some of them. And that shows a significant Israeli capability to strike far away at Iran, hundreds of miles away, an operation that requires refueling in the air for many of these fighters, but also in the course of it to take out Iranian air defenses and in this case, breach Iranian airspace. So you have all those fronts, in Lebanon, in Gaza, between directly Israel and Iran, and of course a front you might call it here inside Israel, ongoing terror attacks in this country, and in each case, them getting more dangerous, not less so. And of course these are developments we continue to follow. Jim Sciutto, CNN, Jerusalem.",

In fact, to use his words, this defeat is something that needs to be taken seriously and solemnly, he says this is the party receive very harsh judgment from the people of Japan.With that said, he does have issues he wants to attack and power through and how to do that without a coalition, he is going to have to he and his colleagues are going to have to meet with leaders of other political factions within the Diet, that's the Japanese legislature, to try to win support. There are really two big issues that they are going to have to deal with. One is the Japanese economy. The yen still continues to be weak, inflation is high and the economic outlook is still very uncertain. So there's going to have to be work done on that front of which he is going to have to try to get some kind of consensus. And then, two, the government also has to do a cleanup act of sorts after a political scandal in which some lawmakers were accused of taking kickbacks and not properly disclosing their true income so there are those two issues that he desperately wants to tackle. That's in addition to maintaining a strong relationship with the United States. The Japan American relationship important. One, because America, the United States provides military -- has a military agreement fort for Japan and second of all, through treaties. And then second of all, in recent months, in the last year or so, we've really have seen the relationship between Japan and South Korea strengthen. The United States certainly has encouraged that, especially amid some of the political uncertainty from where I am here in China. So those are his mandates for the future. Whether or not he is going to be able to win the support from -- from lawmakers and supporters outside that coalition is going to be the broader challenge. Paula, I should point that at this point, it seems that this decision by the voters is being met with acceptable response. Japan's Nikkei is up about 2 percent and as you know, as someone who follows the markets like me, arise about 2 percent is significant, it is telling so perhaps this is the reboot that so many people had felt was necessary perhaps is actually happening.",

But that's not going to happen with the broken leadership in Washington, D.C. Let me give you a statistic, Jake, because here is what the leadership of people like Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi and, yes, Mike Pence, over 30 years in this country has led to. A person with a bachelor's degree lives seven years longer than a person without a bachelor's degree. There are a lot of people who have gotten rich and powerful off -- off of American decline. Some of them have had R's next to their name. Some of them have had D's next to their name. And the first person who I believe is really putting the interest of the American people first is Donald J. Trump. So, yes, we're going to be the president and the vice president for all people. The only way to do that is to reject the failed consensus. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Hey, there. Yeah, \"The Washington Post\" PR nightmare does not seem to be going away anytime soon. This all started on Friday when \"The Post\" publisher William Lewis announced that the paper it would not endorse a presidential candidate this year or in the future.Now, this stemmed from a decision by the post billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, who said he did not want to publish the drafted endorsement of Kamala Harris, that the editorial writers had already prepared. Bezos did not read the editorial, did not want to know what was in it. You decided the paper should not be endorsing anyone. This may be a very innocent desire to strive for neutrality and independence, but to announce this just a few days really, on the eve of a presidential election, raised a lot of eyebrows both inside and outside \"The Post\". Thousands of subscribers have canceled their subscriptions in the past, a couple of days as a result and a \"Post\" editor at large and a colonist have both resigned in protest. Other editorial board members and columnist have signed onto a letter criticizing the decision and the criticism really is all about the following. It's about the concern that Bezos might be trying to cave to Trump and curry favor with the former and possibly future president. Scholars who study authoritarianism described this as anticipatory obedience. The idea that people in power will try to obey in advance, trying to predict what an authoritarian leader might want, and then go ahead and give in ahead of time. That is exactly what some \"Post\" columnist and even some hosts reporters are worried has happened in this case. But we've not heard from Bezos directly. My attempts to gain comment from Bezos have gone unanswered. Instead, we've heard from the publisher, as I mentioned, Will Lewis, he's been the face of the decision. In a new statement on Sunday, he refuted a claim that there was a quid pro quo between Bezos and Trump. Here's what Lewis said, quote: The decision the end presidential endorsements was made entirely internally and neither campaign nor candidate was given a heads-up or consulted in any way at any level. That's important information, but it doesn't dispel the larger concern that I'm seeing from \"Post\" readers. If you look on \"The Washington Post\" website, you'll see lots of comments from readers who are worried that Bezos might be giving into Trump, even before Election Day, even before we know the results of the election. That's the concern that's going to basically hang over \"The Post\" for the foreseeable future. And as I said, this nightmare is not going away anytime soon. The editorial page editor is supposed to meet with his staff on Monday afternoon for what will likely be a very tense meeting. Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
