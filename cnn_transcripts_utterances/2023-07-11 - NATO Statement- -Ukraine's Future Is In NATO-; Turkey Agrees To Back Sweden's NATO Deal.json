Now we have seen Turkey obviously move forward on the question of NATO and Sweden, but what we are watching to see now is what happens with this F-16's effort. And we know this has been a major focal point for the Turks. And what we are hearing from U.S. officials right now, is they are watching for tomorrow is a meeting between the prime minister of Greece, who is one of the original allies that has been at odds with Turkey, and the Turkish president who are going to essentially come to some sort of agreement, we understand it from U.S. officials, that are going to assuage the concerns of Senator Menendez who currently has a hold on the F-16s from the U.S. to Turkey -- Jake.",

So, as soon as they are in NATO, that triggers Article Five and that pulls in not only U.S. troops but all NATO member troops into the war with Russia, with a nuclear power.But number two, I'm not in favor of expanding NATO any further beyond Finland and Sweden, who, by the way, both contribute more than 2 percent to their national defense, until the rest of NATO gets its act together. I mean, right now, we are sitting at nine out of the 32, including the two new members, only nine out of the 32, Jake, contribute 2 percent of their GDP, which they all pledged to do a decade ago. So, look, at the end of the day, we cannot continue -- the U.S. taxpayer cannot continue to subsidize European defense. They are having their cake and eating it too.

It drives down the price of oil. It's cleaner gas than Russian gas. Let's starve Putin of the resources that he has, rather than allowing China -- keeping the price high, allowing China to purchase Russian oil and gas, and then exhausting our own stockpiles to fight at the other end of it. So I think what President Trump is getting to, a lot of people are saying, what does success look like? A blank check, as long as it takes, is not a strategic.

Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon, thanks.Let's talk more about this with CNN senior political analyst Nia- Malika Henderson, along with Kaitlan Collins, anchor of CNN's brand new 9:00 p.m. program, \"THE SOURCE WITH KAITLAN COLLINS\". Kaitlan, we'll start with you. You made a lot of news last night, your interview with Senator Tuberville. He told you he's not going to stop the military confirmation hold up because the Senate could take up each of more than 200 nominations separately. But, as Oren just noted, that could take months. And Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jack Reed specifically says the process to do that would take 688 hours, 84 eight-hour legislative days. So that's not really a serious counter proposal.",

That's what it means, that's the definition. That's not a Democratic definition, that's the definition. But after that, Senator Tuberville finally told our Manu Raju, off camera, that white supremacists are racist. Now, Nia-Malika, this is a 68-year-old white man who's lived almost his entire life in the South. Do you find it credible, that he actually is having difficulty with the definition of this? Or, is there something perhaps more nefarious going on? NIA-MALIKA HENDERSON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST:  Listen, you know, when I saw this interview last night with Kaitlan Collins, it really reminded me of something Donald Trump did, when he sort of feigned ignorance around the Proud Boys, feigned ignorance around David Duke. Supposedly, he didn't have any idea who David Duke was, or what he stood for. This is when he was running for president. So, what I think Tommy Tuberville is up to, is sort of trying to mainstream white nationalist ideology, mainstream the term white nationalism. So, in that interview, it sort of confusing because on the, one hand he says listen, racism is bad. White nationalism, if you want to call it that, that's not great. So, but I think that's what he's up to. And listen, this is part of a long tradition, I think particularly among white Southerners of a certain age, a sort of downplaying racism in the South, downplaying racism in America, downplaying a racist themselves, and so there he is. He seems to suggest that white nationalist are just sort of ordinary white Americans, who love their country. So, listen, again, I don't think it's by accident that he is doing. It I think it's something that really has led to, for instance, Nick Fuentes being a headliner at a college Republican convention. Nick Fuentes dining with Donald Trump, this kind of mainstreaming of white nationalism ideology, it's something obviously that I think we see increasingly among conservatives, among the alt-right. And I think that's what he's up to, even as he walks it back. It's almost too late, because he's been at this kind of mainstreaming, and watering down this term for many, many months.",

You know, I was actually looking into Tuberville's past comments, when we were getting prepared to interview him last night, and obviously, he was before he was a U.S. senator, he was a football coach. He was on Ole Miss in the '90s. And there was a story about how he played a pretty significant role, according to people who were there at the time, and getting the student body, when they came to games, to stop waving around the Confederate flag, as they were doing in the '90s. He was talked about how it hurt recruiting efforts, how Black families were coming on recruiting visits to the school. And that was affecting it, he said.And, he kind of made a comment last night, also to me saying, as he was saying I don't believe in racism, I don't like racism, while also not, you know, denouncing white nationalists, and saying they don't belong in the U.S. military. He made a comment saying, that he has spent more time amount minorities than almost anyone else on Capitol Hill, referencing his days as a football coach. Obviously, there are many people, lawmakers on Capitol Hill, who would take issue with that, Jake, for obvious reasons. I just think it's notable to go from a moment like that in the '90s, where he's going and asking the students to do this, to then defending those comments.

It was really hard to sit there and watch Jimmie Dunne get trotted in to spew the Saudi talking points about how this is all for the good of the game of golf, it's good for world peace, is what he fell short of saying. And it was remarkable that he also said that some men did something on that day. That's how he described 9/11. And he fails to understand, the role that the kingdom played in facilitating the attacks against this country. He said, they are Saudi nationals over in Saudi Arabia, that we don't want them to think Americans hate them. Well, Mr. Dunne, we don't hate Saudi Arabian nationals. What we are trying to do is hold the kingdom, the Saudi government, the same House of Saul that was in power in 2001, is still in power today. And we need to hold him accountable for September 11th.
