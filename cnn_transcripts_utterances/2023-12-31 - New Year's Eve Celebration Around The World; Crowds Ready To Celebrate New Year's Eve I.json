Just think about it, I say to you, hey, I've got a great idea, we're going to shove a ball at the top of a pole and we'll all watch it come back down again. And that's essentially what we're doing tonight. They've shoved the ball to the top of the pole with the thousands of crystals and LEDs and it will take a minute to come back down again. We'll all cheer, there will be huge amounts of confetti and then we'll do New York, New York, New York, New York, and then we all go home.",

We knew that it was going to be special because although, of course, this is a great tradition and you were talking about American traditions, here the tradition is either for the French to sit at the table and eat foie gras and oysters or to come out to the Champs Elysee and watch the fireworks display and the first time we were able to have one since COVID, and that was pretty spectacular.And tonight, the French did put on an extraordinary show because, of course, they intend for 2024 to be the year of France. We've got the Paris Olympics coming up in the summer. We've got the re-opening of Notre Dame cathedral as well in 2024. And so, they really wanted to give the world a taste of the kind of show that only the French can put on, and so you saw an awful lot of that tonight, and acrobatic displays and there were deejays playing and all along the Arc du Triomphe behind me, projections showing climbers fencing, just a taste of summer, the summer games that the French capital will be hosting this year. So, an extraordinary show that was put on tonight. It was a very little loud because beyond the fireworks displays itself, there are a million people down there on the Champs Elysee. For a little while it went quiet as they listened to the fireworks. But there's been a lot of chanting, a lot of singing, a lot of chaos down there as we said, as well, but really a fantastic night here in Paris as the French capital looks ahead to what they hope, as I said will be an extraordinary 2024 -- Paula. REID: Well, Melissa, if that is a preview of what to expect from France and the Olympics, we are certainly in for a treat. Thank you so much for keeping us up-to-date in the City of Lights and happy New Year.",

As you can see this beautiful crowd behind me they've been here for hours and hours and we've been here for many hours today and people just don't stop coming. The shows have begun. There's pop divas on stage right now. The big name is Gloria Groove (ph). She's a singer and she's on right now and that's probably why I'm yelling here. But it's still about four hours until midnight. At the stroke of midnight, Paula, there will be a 12-minute long fireworks show. They will be set off from ten different boats on the bay in the ocean and this crowd is going to have the first look of it -- at it. There will be an orchestra set up on the stage where we're at, but right now, the party just rolled on. So 2023 was a big year for Brazil. We started with political turmoil. Brazil had its own invasion of the capitol, nothing of that -- nothing like that matters right now. People are here to party and to bring in the New Year, as you can see. I'm wearing white as is tradition in Brazil where white to ring in the New Year brings peace and harmony for 2024. Another really fun thing that we'll be seeing is a crown. I have my colorful crown to wear and I'm very exciting about that and I'm waiting for the countdown in Copacabana beach. Back to you, Paula.",
