The U.S. also reportedly reversing course and OK Abrams tank deliveries to Kyiv as well. We're going to have team coverage just ahead. Plus, cloudy forecast Microsoft beating earnings expectations but also warning of a cloud computing slowdown, sales growth slowing as well. We'll discuss what all of this means for big tech coming up and Microsoft's uncertain outlook weighing on the NASDAQ it is set to fall for a second straight session. Dow and S&amp;P futures are lower as well and Europe is lower as you can see pretty much red arrows across the board. This as debate grows over where stocks go from here after a strong 2023 start. A JP Morgan strategist says that U.S. stocks could drop 10 percent or more in the months ahead. We will hear from Andrew Slimmon of Morgan Stanley Investment Management too has a bit more optimistic take we'll talk to him about that earnings sure to play a crucial role in the market's direction going forward. Shares of the aerospace giant Boeing set to fall more than 2 percent about 2.5 percent right now after missing on both the top and bottom lines. IBM and Tesla report their Q4 results later today. We'll have more on the markets later in the program but first the latest on the Ukraine war after months of international squabbling. Germany has agreed to beef up Ukraine's Military capabilities by sending in tanks. And two sources tell CNN that the United States is also ready to make a similar move. Germany's Defense Minister said that 14 Leopard 2 tanks will arrive Ukraine in about three months. Chancellor Olaf Scholz telling lawmakers at the decision followed intensive talks with allies.

I do think throughout this conflict, we have seen times in which the Allies willsay, look, that's absolutely not on the table, something like tanks, something like wrong long range missiles, some certain types of air defense systems. And then the reality on the ground changes that, then the calculus on the ground makes that red line, if you will, those things that are off the table suddenly brings them to the table. And Ukraine has been used to doing this throughout the conflict we've almost had a year now. And what happens is over and over again Ukraine's Military. President Zelenskyy, they assess what they need on the frontlines, they come back to their partners, and they plead and they ask, and they build a wish list. So yes, you're going to hear from President Zelenskyy today, thank you. But he's also going to say, it's not enough. I need more tanks. If you do the math, it's a few dozen tanks, potentially, that over the course of a few months might end up on those frontlines. President Zelenskyy says he needs 300 tanks. We're nowhere near that number. He says those 300 tanks could replace some 3000 Soviet era tanks. And the other calculus here absolutely, is that Ukraine feels that it is defending NATO, that it is defending democratic ideals that it is on the front line of Russian aggression. And in some ways that shift has been made as well by European partners who in the past, were concerned, and we're constantly making this calculus. Balancing act between supporting Ukraine, giving it the weapons it needs, but at the same time, not trying to widen or deepen that conflict clearly that calculus being made over the last over the course of the last few days in D.C. and Berlin. And the message here is clear. Ukraine needs more, and we will give it more.",

      "sentences": "Well Rahel, interestingly the White House actually just announced that the President will be givingremarks at noon today about continued U.S. support to Ukraine. And as we reported yesterday, we have been expecting an announcement by the administration this week about its decision to commit as many as 30 Abrams tanks to Ukraine, a complete 180. I should note from where the administration was just last week, when they were briefing reporters very consistently about the fact that they believe that the Abrams tanks are not necessarily what Ukraine needs at this moment. And that is because they were saying that these are very difficult and complex systems to maintain, to operate. And that the Ukrainians would require quite a bit of training to use them before they actually became operational on the ground there. But now we're learning that after a number of conversations, very intense diplomatic discussions between U.S. and German officials over the last several days. There has been somewhat of a breakthrough in this diplomatic standoff, because if you'll recall, Germany had said that they would not send their leper tanks to Ukraine, if the United States did not also send its Abrams tanks. So over the last several days, the U.S. has been trying to convince Germany to send their Leopard tanks. And now it appears that they have decided that even despite all of those logistical issues, the very real possibility that these tanks will break down on the field in Ukraine, because they are very complex and very difficult to maintain. That they will take the step of committing these tanks, because they feel as though it is just a very necessary tool in the Ukrainians arsenal at this moment to defend against a potential Russian offensive in the spring and of course launch their own counter offensive, because as Salma laid out very well earlier, this is a very slow grinding kind of infantry war, that with Western tanks. The Ukrainians will be able to kind of take the fight directly to the Russians and hopefully break through their defensive lines there, Rahel.",

There are a number of logistical issues that the U.S. has to test to grapple with in terms of actually getting them on the ground there before the U.S. can actually before the Ukrainians I should say, can actually operate them. And importantly, the Ukrainians will have to undergo significant training before they're able to use these tanks effectively, because tank warfare, as we've been told, by many military officials, is a very different style of fighting. These are systems that are very, very large, over 70 tons. And they're extremely complicated; they also break down very easily. So we're told that the U.S. is going to be sending along with these tanks, recovery vehicles that essentially tow these systems out of the battlefield if they need to be repaired, thereby allowing the Ukrainians to put them back into action. But this is all going to be a very heavy lift, and it could be as many as three months, if not more likely more before we see them actually in battle, Rahel.",

Straight to theeconomy, a bit earnings season is in full swing, swing not quite a homerun though for Microsoft.

And it was really toward the very end of the quarter when the CFO started talking to analysts and said that deceleration could continue into the first quarter and moving forward. That's when overnight in premarket trading, the stock started to decline here. The company recently announced 10,000 layoffs; of course, we have seen that technology has been the leading edge of layoffs. But I would point out that these are companies that have grown and profited handsomely, during the COVID crisis. And now you use the word normalizing. I think that's exactly right, starting to normalize, what demand is going to look like heading into next year. There was a lot of discussion, the bull and bear camp having a big discussion this morning about the intelligent cloud business, which includes that as your cloud computing unit, and that did well, right? So watching that space, and even if they're slowing, they're going forward is still as a solid part of the business. But revenue deceleration is what the big concern is moving forward here. So that's what we're watching the stock down 15 percent over the past year or so, big debate, bull bear debate today about what those earnings mean, but again, the slowest sales growth since 2016, that's notable.",

What the question in this lawsuit really is, can he be held accountable for the losses that shareholders experienced after this tweet, Musk is arguing a couple of things. He's saying that his tweet doesn't necessarily cause the share price to go up or down. There's no causal relationship between his tweet and Tesla share price. The other thing that he's saying is that he did have funding lined up for this deal. You know, he's saying that he had conversations with the Saudi private wealth, public wealth fund, that they had sort of a handshake deal to take Tesla private. But typically, public companies, if they're going to go private, they go through a really significant process. You know, there's more than sort of a handshake deal here.

I mean, I think that people on Twitter may have gotten tired of it being the Elon Musk show every day. It's a little boring when you log on and it's the same conversation. It's Elon causing chaos on Twitter every single day. I think the other thing that's at play here is that tonight is the Tesla earnings report, as you said earlier. And it's a crucial report for this company; the stock is down more than 50 percent this year. There were disappointing sales earnings sales reports earlier this month.

And at issue really are accusations by Hindenburg Research. It's an American based short selling firm that has gained prominence for targeting companies that its founder feels are overvalued or had suspect financials. In a published report, it claims Adani sprawling conglomerate of stock manipulation and accounting fraud over the course of decades. The group also questions the valuations of Adani's firms adding their substantial debt puts the entire group on \"A precarious financial footing\". As you can imagine, this is generating response the Adani group's chief financial officer said Hindenburg did not make any attempt to contact us or verify the factual matrix, adding that the allegations made by the short seller are stale, baseless and discredited.

It's interesting, this deal. Now, this is very popular to sell your back catalogue. But it is interesting, I think considering his age. That's really the big difference here. It's kind of more common for aging rock stars to sell their back catalogue for a number of reasons. First of all, they've had years of earning royalties and that's a great lump sum for your retirement. And for the people that buy those rights. Well, all of their best work is generally behind them, and they got decades worth of work as well. So, let's bring you the latest deals that we've seen just over the last two years really, Stevie Nicks $100 million. That was for 80 percent of her back catalogue to primary way, we've got Justin Bieber, Bob Dylan $200 million as well. For 60 years' worth of music that one was to Sony Music. David Berry, his estate recently sold his back catalogue for 250. And Bruce Springsteen absolutely wins the $550 million to Sony Music for 50 years' worth of work. Now, clearly, Justin Bieber thinks he can get more out of a lump sum now that he can invest with whichever way he wants, then getting royalties over many years over many decades. And of course, perhaps his biggest hit is yet to come. That's the real difference between him and those other artists. It does, I think, raise the question of whether we have hit the sort of peak level of music rights valuations; it feels maybe like this area has got a little bit frothy over the last couple of years.",

I have all that done more on Marketplace Europe. Not since 2020 as Davos hosted the World Economic Forum in its usual January slot, yet three years on, and Europe is risking its second recession in a decade. The real problem, of course, is there's a cocktail of crises that is swirling and mixing and not in a good way. Of course, there's the war in Ukraine. And that's having an effect on energy prices rocketing higher, even though they've come down, they're still causing problems. And then finally, interest rates to deal with the rising inflation rates have had to be ratcheted up far faster than anyone thought.
