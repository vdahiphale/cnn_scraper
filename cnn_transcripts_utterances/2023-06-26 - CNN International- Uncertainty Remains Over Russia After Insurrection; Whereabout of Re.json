On the streets of a major Russian city, Rostov-on-Don in the south, residents cheered Wagner fighters as they withdrew. Many Russians see them as heroes not as the traitors the Kremlin paints them. And Wagner's leader Yevgeny Prigozhin has become a celebrity too. Watch his supporters hail down his car just to shake hands. The Kremlin says he's now moving to Belarus next door, but it's unclear that this is the last you'll see of him. What is definite though, is a sense of relief, at least here in the Russian capital.",

He's visiting western group of troops apparently in this video. Counterprogramming, I think partly to the criticism that has been leveled against him for being out of touch with troops in Belarus. Coming from Yevgeny Prigozhin. And I think it's interesting that he has done this given that we've seen Prigozhin himself so often on the front lines. This sort of tough guy demeanor and now we see Shoigu. And he hasn't done this very often. I think just a handful of times since the start of the conflict we've actually seen him visit the zone of their special military operations. So it's significant now. Also, while we see the Ukrainian counteroffensive progress, this may be an effort to restore some kind of morale among Russian troops after the events of the weekend which may well have shaken it -- Max.",

And that he would be back in touch when he had better communication. We don't know, as we say, whether he's actually accepted that exile in Belarus.What is interesting though I think is the attitude in Russia towards the Wagner Group itself. No one has actually fully disavowed that group. Both Putin and Mishustin over the weekend called the Wagner fighters who helped in the liberation of Bakhmut, as they call it, and called them heroes. There was the head of the defense committee in the Duma in an interview on Sunday said, why would we disband Wagner, they're the most combat-ready part of the Russian forces. This, he said, would be the ultimate gift to NATO and the Ukrainians if we do that. So, they are apparently working on a law to define the status of Wagner. But it doesn't seem at the moment like there is an upside in Russia to defend it. FOSTER: And Wagner, you know, thinks he operates outside the law, doesn't he? So, will they just sign up to the Russian military or will they stay loyal to Prigozhin?",

The spokesperson saying that, you know, those who wanted to, could do it. This concern those who weren't part of the march. So it's a little unclear. It doesn't seem like they're going to be forced. And meanwhile, Prigozhin in Belarus, which is the place, of course, where they launched part of the initial invasion, it doesn't seem like that is a sort of distant exile from the so-called special military operation.",

He did speak with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying that the U.S. has unwavering support towards Ukraine and its people. The president also spending much of the time over the weekend at Camp David talking to Western allies from Canada, from the U.K., from France, from Germany, making the case here that all countries really are watching and waiting to see the situation unfold in Russia. Now there is no doubt Russian President Vladimir Putin has had a reign for 23 years, through four American presidents. But the Biden administration this week, President Biden faces a new challenge for President Biden. They are not trying to be publicly seen being involved in this in any way at all. Do not want to be blamed or accused of trying to tip the scales. But there is no doubt a weaker Vladimir Putin raises concerns and worries here in the U.S. and indeed in other Western capitals about the potential danger for that. So President Biden not scheduled to speak about this as the week begins, but he will have an event on Monday morning here at the White House. This is certainly now a new foreign policy challenge. And certainly a question here on the president's agenda, as he begins a new week. Jeff Zeleny, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Where he? What on earth was President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus -- which is supposed to be a Russian puppet state -- doing? Apparently playing center stage in the resolution of this. And most of all, how badly weakened is Putin? This is a huge dent inhis already tattered reputation for competence and effectiveness. I doubt if anyone can say that he really played this well.

He's denouncing these people as traitors and saying they're an existential threat to the Russian state. And then a few hours later, the guy's being pardoned and his supporters, they're not going to be prosecuted. And he's off to making a new life in another country. That shows that when Putin's called it, he doesn't fight like a rat which is one of his big things, that he saw a rat in St. Petersburg in the old Soviet days and it was in a corner when it was really in a desperate situation, he just bit and fought, you know, fought its way out. And that's always been his thing, don't put me in the corner because I'll fight -- I'll fight really hard.And this actually shows that he negotiates. And that's not great for that strongman image. So I think what's really going to happen now is all the people around Putin are going to think the boss isn't going to be here forever, based on what's just happened. What plans do I need to keep my staff in my power and maybe get some staff and power from other people? So I think one should really see this is an episode in the \"Sopranos\" or some other sort of mafia movie rather than being subject to the sort of normal political analysis that we might usually deploy in this sort of case.",

And I'd be very surprised if he runs again and gets another full-term as president. Because his authority rests on the perception of effectiveness and competence. And that's been really trashed both by the war in Ukraine and all the bad decisions surrounding that and by his handling of the crisis.

But a day after that abrupt end to the insurrection threatening Vladimir Putin's grip on power, Russia's greatest ally China broke its silence issuing support for the Kremlin. It's closely watched this, you know, gravest challenge to Putin's rule in 23 years unfold.The Chinese foreign ministry then issued a strong statement late last night which read: This is Russia's internal affair. As Russia's friendly neighbor and comprehensive strategic partner coordination for the new era, China supports Russia in maintaining national stability and achieving development and prosperity. And we just heard from MOFA in China reiterating that exact same statement. Now it follows that unexpected visit by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko to Beijing who met with the China's Foreign Minister Qin Gang, among other Chinese officials, yesterday. Where they exchanged views on Sino-Russian relations and international and regional issues of common concern. And that was what was fed to the media and we saw that, you know, photo of the pair smiling, walking side-by-side. Russia claims, Max, that this was part of a scheduled consultation. The Chinese, however, did not announce the meeting beforehand. Now Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin have developed a very close personal rapport in recent years over their shared ambition to challenge the U.S.-led global order. And in February of last year, the two leaders declared a friendship with no limits, shortly before Putin launched his war on Ukraine. China has refused, as you know, to condemn the invasion of Ukraine. And it's providing much needed diplomatic and economic support for Russia. It also portrayed itself at times as a peace broker. But some analysts believe that China is closely monitoring the fallout of this purported mutiny. A political scientist at the Australian National University says the Wagner insurrection contradicts the narrative of Putin as a strong leader who enjoys full support of his people and is here for the long haul as China's global partner of choice. If Putin's rule is unstable, then supporting him is bad business -- Max.",
