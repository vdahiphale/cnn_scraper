Thank you so much.We've got Senior Political reporter with The Washington Post Aaron Blake with us this morning joining us from inside. Aaron, good morning to you. Let's start here with the weather and the importance of that variable here. Who has the diehards? Who has these supporters who will go out in the ice and the snow and the wind and participate in the caucuses? AARON BLAKE, SENIOR POLITICAL REPORTER, \"THE WASHINGTON PSOT\": You know, it's a really good question. I think it's a situation that certainly is going to reward somebody with a good ground game, somebody who's really invested in Iowa. That would seem to be more, Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis. Nikki Haley, of course, is focused more on New Hampshire. As far as passion, you know, you would think that Donald Trump's supporters are among the most passionate and involved in this primary process. But there's also, you know, some unknowns here. We've seen a lot of polls where a lot of Trump supporters, people who haven't necessarily gone to caucuses before or voted before. They are infrequent voters in a lot of cases. And those are the kinds of people who you wouldn't necessarily want to count on in a situation such as this going out to your first caucus, when it's negative 20 windchill and potentially after a blizzard. So there's a whole lot of unknowns here. And it just creates a situation that we haven't really seen since the Iowa caucus first went to the front of the line back in 1972.",

Nikki Haley has at least distanced herself from Trump at certain junctures more than DeSantis has, after January 6, arguably in the debate this week. And so she's basically kind of setting up a situation where it's her and then it's Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis.

Right now it's snowing across portions of Chicago, Northern Indiana and Michigan stretching all the way into the Northeast.You also still have some pretty heavy rain across places like Boston, as well as Hartford, Connecticut. The snow also farther out to the West areas of Nebraska, Kansas, even Denver right now getting some snow showers there. When you look at all of these winter weather alerts, again, you've got some type of alert across some portion of the states stretching from Oregon, all the way over to Maine from several of those multiple different systems. It's not just snow, however, we're also looking at incredibly cold temperatures. Look at all of these wind chill alerts. Here again, you're talking over 80 million people under some type of wind chill alert. The concern here is that some of those wind chills are going to get down to about 40 or 50 degrees below zero. So you're talking incredibly cold temperatures. One thing to notice how widespread it is, 75 percent of the population in the lower 48 is going to have temperatures below freezing, nearly a quarter of that population will have those temperatures below zero. Look at some of these. You can already see the coal they're setting in across the high plains. Right now the current temperature is minus 20 in Bismarck with a feels like a 48. In Minneapolis, we're starting to see those temperatures drop and for a lot of these places those temperatures are just going to keep going down including Des Moines. But look at this. The concern for Iowa is really going to be Monday for the caucuses. This is the Monday evening temperature. This is not the windchill. This is the temperature. So in Des Moines, Monday evening, is all of those people are congregating. [06:10:00] You're looking at a temperature of minus 10. Now you factor in those incredibly strong wind gusts that feels like temperature for any of your exposed skin is going to be around 20 to 30 degrees below zero for pretty much the entire state. Now for a lot of people wondering, OK, how does that compare to other years because it is January we get it. Look at this, it's going to be the coldest by a longshot, you're looking at the temperature that day, the high to be minus four. That's not even remotely close to any of the previous caucuses that have taken place. One thing to note, Victor and Amara, too, is that you're looking for a lot of these areas. This is the warmest winter to date. So for a lot of people this is going to come as quite a shock.",

This time targeting radar facilities used by the Houthi is a much smaller set of strikes than what we saw one night previously, where the U.S. led a coalition of countries that targeted nearly 30 Houthi sites across the country with more than 150 precision guided missiles.Those included radar sites, command and control nodes as well as storage and launch facilities for anti-ship ballistic missiles, anti- ship cruise missiles, as well as drones. Those are the sorts of weapons the Houthis have used to target international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, one of the most critical international waterways in the world. Following that series of strikes we saw according to the Pentagon, the Houthi has launched an anti-ship ballistic missile into the Gulf of Aden. It didn't hit anything. But following that strike following that launch from the Houthis, the U.S. carried out this further strike again, targeting a radar facility, so a much smaller set and a much more specific set of strikes. It's unclear at this point, if that was specifically in response to the ballistic missile fired, or if this was simply a follow on to the previous evening strike. A senior Pentagon official had said the U.S. was still conducting a battle damage assessment. So it's certainly possible. The U.S. saw what -- had been able to destroy and realize there was another target that needed to be hit or destroyed here. The U.S. again trying to send with these other countries a message of deterrence to the Houthis. And a warning President Joe Biden saying on Friday that if the Houthi attacks on shipping continued, so too with the U.S. strikes on Houthi facilities. Still, the strikes have tried to be limited in scope, making it clear they're not going after all Houthi infrastructure, just their ability to target international shipping lanes. The question, could they conduct a sort of massive barrage like we saw them do earlier in the week. Senior Pentagon official says he believes from what he has seen that the Houthis would be unable to conduct a barrage of that magnitude based on the U.S. in coalition strikes. Victor and Amara.

And that's how they're seeing this, whether we see it like that or not, of course, is a completely different issue. We don't see it that way.

It's very significant in light of the fact obviously that what happens is whenever a person says anything who happens to be a criminally accused, he should be treated no differently.

It means a person's mental state, it means a person's state of mind. Remember that when you're dealing with criminal cases you're trying to establish intent. You can only establish intent through, you know, surrounding circumstances and through things that present evidence. There's no more compelling evidence, Amara, as to someone's intent as to what they say. And so to the extent that there were public comments that were made in connection with this case, it's fair game to be used. And that's as it should be, right. A person does not have to speak. He had a right, Mr. Trump, not to speak, not to address the case he did. So guess what anything and everything you say can and will be held against you in a court of law. You've heard that before.

Number two, are you entitled to a trial? You are. And number three, once that trial happens, what's the verdict? So cases are based on the facts and the evidence, not so much other things outside the courtroom. Is it a good look, should this be the case? Are there other issues surrounding it? Yes. It's not as clean as it should or needs to be. But at the end of the day, it's about what happens in the court.

That's one issue.That's what his attorneys handled. He, however, there's the second imperative, and that is, there's a presidential election. And so, he wants to continue to propound the narrative that this is unfair, the attorney general shouldn't have brought the case, the judge has been unfair to him, air his grievances, and that's what that occurred, that's why I believe he did that. Ultimately, though, I think it antagonizes the court. I think the court will base its decision upon what they heard, and as you noted -- or there was already a determination as to fraud, the judge now has to decide issues concerning the statements and whether they were misleading, insurance fraud on the case, different business records and the acceptability of them. I think based on those evidence and those facts, I think the judge is likely to rule against Mr. Trump, and also likely to determine that he can no longer do business in New York state.",

The Federal Emergency Management Agency has granted nearly $12 million in funding to Atlanta since 2022 to offset costs associated with migrant arrivals. Maricopa County where the city of Phoenix is located, allocated $5 million last may in funding for nonprofit agencies serving refugees.The cost of sheltering asylum seekers in Pima County, Arizona, has been more than 65 million since 2020. Denver spent over 33 million between December 2022 and the same month last year to shelter more than 32,000 asylum seekers. And the city is projecting a cost of $180 million for 2024 if arrivals continue at the current rate. That's a whopping 15 percent of its current budget according to a city spokesperson. And more migrants are now on their way to some of these cities, including Marseille Hildado (ph), a 33-year-old domestic worker from Colombia who says she risked everything in hopes of giving her only daughter a better life. (on camera): What these migrants share in common is uncertainty. What options do they have now that they have made it to the United States? Many don't even know if they will be able to have dinner tonight. What they know, they say, is that they don't want to go back to where they came from. (voice-over): We witnessed an emotional reunion, a family of Cubans who hadn't seen each other for five years. Two sisters who risked everything for the American dream. She told us they were kidnapped in Mexico. Her family had to pay ransom only to be robbed again shortly after being released. Now, they have nothing but the support of their family. Her motivation, her 7-year-old son, her only child, she's hoping to bring to America once her asylum request, she hopes, is approved. Rafael Romo, CNN, on the U.S. southern border. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

This funding would allow them to hire more asylum officers to expedite the process of filing asylum claims that these migrants are filing, and also like hire more law enforcement at the border. Now, Republicans have responded saying that Biden has not done enough on his end, has not -- has failed to implement executive actions to try to mitigate the flow of migrants unlawfully crossing the border. But this has remained a contentious point between Republicans and the White House. And Biden will have to address this going into the election year. Victor?",
