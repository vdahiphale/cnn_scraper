His visit focused on a renewed push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, after the death of Yahya Sinwar. Speaking after meetings in Berlin, the president said, \"We think there is a road to peace there. It's going to be harder. It's going to be difficult, but we're all on the same page.\" He added that there's a possibility for a ceasefire in Lebanon, but it's going to be harder for Gaza, he says.

Now, Biden has made it very clear that he wants to spend the remaining time that he has in the Oval Office really trying to end this conflict and bring a release to these hostages on both sides. But there is a lot of political implications here, especially for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running on the Democratic ticket. She has been met with constant protests from Pro-Palestinian protesters, while she's hit the campaign trail, and some voters, especially in Michigan, have really been trying to advocate and push her to try to distance herself from how Biden is approaching this conflict.

Some of the most iconic names will be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at a star-studded ceremony in Cleveland.Let's talk honorees: Ozzy Osbourne, Dionne Warwick, Mary J. Blige, Cher, A Tribe Called Quest. Ahead of tonight's honors, a new exhibit at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland showcases the honoree stage outfits, some personal items. Joining us now is Shelby Morrison. She's the V.P. of curatorial operations at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Good morning to you. It is -- it's great to see these people go in, because I'm a fan of some of them. But the idea that Dionne Warwick is in the same class as A Tribe Called Quest, she is been eligible for decades. Cher, Peter Frampton, none of these are on their first year of eligibility. Why the delay for some of these obvious inductees? SHELBY MORRISON, V.P. OF CURATORIAL OPERATIONS, ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME: Hi, Victor. Thanks for having me. Good morning. The induction process is unpredictable, and there are so many artists that are deserving, it just takes a little bit for us to catch up and get everyone in. But you are right, you know, to see Dionne Warwick and this whole class get in, it's really special. And, you know, there's a lot of fan favorites this year, from Cher and Dave Matthews Band and Foreigner. A Tribe Called Quest. It's, it's going to be an amazing -- an amazing event.",

And it's really fun for them to get together and celebrate.For example, when Prince performed for George Harrison's induction, we didn't know he was going to get up there and do that magical -- one of the most impactful guitar solos that -- that's ever been recorded. So, there is going to be surprises, for sure, and it is a star-studded lineup.",

And, you know, because of society at the time in the 40s and 50s, you know, they were marginalized, and you know, we still see that today.But one thing about the spirit of rock and roll is that we are changing that, and things are lifting up, and these people are being recognized for all their contributions, specifically women and BIPOC artists.",

Both teams already came back from 15-point deficits to win the game in this series, Game Four though, it was tied throughout. You had 14 lead changes and 13 ties. No team led by more than six points.Liberty were down 390 seconds ago. Jonquel Jones gets the bucket down low, plus the foul. She hit the free throw to tie it up. The Liberty then had three chances with under a minute to go to take the lead, but Breanna Stewart misses twice. And on the Lynx's next possession, Courtney Williams is going to miss, but Bridget Carleton grabs the rebound, gets fouled by Sabrina Ionescu. Carleton makes both free throws. Could we get more Sabrina magic this time to win the title? No. A shot at the buzzer, no good. Lynx win, 82 to 80 to force a winner take all of Game Five on Sunday.

SCHOLES: All right. The Yankees, meanwhile, went away from the first World Series since 2009. Game Four, another nail biter in Cleveland. Giancarlo Stanton just continuing to be one of the best postseason hitters ever. He homered again. This was his fourth of the postseason. That put the Yankees up 6-2 in the sixth. Fast forward to bottom of the eighth. Now, two outs. Guardians down a run. David Fry has a dribbler, but Mark Leiter Jr. makes a bad throw. Cleveland ties it at six on an error. But the Yankees got lucky themselves in the ninth, Brayan Rocchio, drops this ball trying to make a play. New York ends up scoring two in the inning. They would win by the final of eight to six. Now, over in the NLCS, the Mets staying alive with a big win over the Dodgers in Game Five, Pete Alonso set the tone from the get go, the three run home run in the first. The Mets, they then put up five in the third after getting no runs off Jack clarity in game one of this series. The Mets getting eight off of him in just three innings last night. And get this, Mets didn't strike out once. Just the 11th team ever to do that in the post season. New York won that one 12 to six. The Dodgers do have another chance to close that series out back at home tomorrow in Game Six. The Yankees are going to try to punch their ticket tonight. That's at 8:00 Eastern on our sister channel, TBS. You can also stream that one on Max. But I tell you what, it barring a big comeback, Amara. Looks like the Yankees are going to get in the World Series. We could have either Yankees-Dodgers, Yankees-Mets, both of the awesome to baseball.",
