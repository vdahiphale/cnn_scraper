Many of America's top retailers rolling back diversity equity inclusion initiatives in the weeks after the November election and ushering in a new anti-woke era. More now from CNN's Brian Todd. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voiceover):  America's largest retailer and largest private employer takes a major step on a huge social issue. Walmart says it's rolling back some of its diversity equity and inclusion programs, also known as DEI. The company says it's ending racial equity training programs for employees, reevaluating programs that assist minority-owned suppliers, and is winding down its Center for Racial Equity, a nonprofit Walmart had set up to address racism in society.",

That's -- most of that is -- they said would be able to be paid off within one or two billing cycles. A few did say that they would plan to stretch it out longer than that. So debt is part of how people will stretch their cash flow over the next couple of months to pay back the credit card bills that they'll incur.We also, of course, see the increasing importance of buy now-pay later loans that are so common in the retail industry now to help people stretch their dollars further. And those often don't have interest associated with the payments.

That's where consumers also rated those items as pretty high on the affordability scale in some of our survey work.So what we find is that people still want to spend money this holiday season because they want to preserve those traditions.

San Jose State had received a total of six forfeit victories this season. Four other teams canceling their games against SJSU. On Monday, a federal judge in Colorado ruled that the player was allowed to compete -- a decision upheld by an appeals court the next day. Neither the player in question nor San Jose State have commented publicly on the player's gender. And we here at CNN aren't naming the player since she's declined to comment through a university official. That is it though from me for now.
