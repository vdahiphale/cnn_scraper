It must be so heartbreaking for the people who call this home, especially with the damage right before the holidays.And you know, as meteorologists who has covered many of these natural disasters and events, you know, it never ceases to amaze me the pure power of what the wind can do. Look at this complete SUV, fully flipped on its side. Walking around this area, we're in the Union Villa Apartment Complex. This is in Union Parish. It's just north and west of Monroe, Louisiana. And you can see just some of the damaged roofs behind me, some of the shrapnel on the ground. We saw children's toys earlier that were strewn across the area. Very typical of what we would expect to see with a powerful tornado that came through here last night at about 8:30. But I really think that this puts it into perspective for our viewers at home. This is just absolutely incredible. This is about 70 or 80 feet of pure iron, and it is strewn across the parking lot here. And it has literally been lofted in the sky from the mobile home park that was destroyed about 100 yards over my right. And I want to take you there because I was able to walk around this vicinity a few minutes ago, get some first-hand accounts of what happened. But I want you to see what people are grappling with this morning as they wake up to the destruction that was left behind by this tornado. It really shows you that these people are going to have months, if not years of recovery ahead of them. The apartment complexes -- or rather the mobile homes were ripped off their foundations completely. We spoke to an eyewitness who didn't want to go on camera but told us that he came across individuals staggering, disoriented, coming out of the woods next to the mobile home park, and their home had literally been lifted or lofted into the forest along with them. So, they rode out this terrifying experience. I mean, if I can just give kind of a guess at how heavy this is, this is - this is several, several tons of pure iron. So that really gives you an idea of what people are dealing with. The police here are still calling this an active search and rescue scene. There are canines coming to the scene. Obviously, this is typical with tornado and hurricane damage as well, after the fact, to see if there are indeed any survivors. Although they do not believe that there are people here, they need to still check and assess the ground here. [09:05:04] Back to you.",

There are the storms to the southeast of Jackson. Two tornado warnings going on right now, one just to the west of Mount Olive in Mississippi and one just to -- between Forest and Lake, right along the I-20 corridor. All of this is going to slide to the east with very heavy rainfall and flash flood warnings in effect now for parts of Louisiana. Let me push this ahead. Where does this go? Well, by 2:00, you're going to get some big storms, Baton Rouge, all the way down toward New Orleans as well. And then we move toward, our Nick Valencia is station here, down toward Biloxi, Mississippi. Also storms in Atlanta by tonight. Many of those will not rotate, but there will be a lot of lightning with some of these storms. And then it moves to the east, and then it moves to the northeast. Farther north than that we start to see where the snow. The snow is still coming down. It is still blowing 30 or 40 miles per hour in places. Visibility in Fargo is a mile and a half. Grand Forks, just a half a mile. There's Duluth, at a quarter mile visibility, heavy snow, heavy wind. There's your blizzard warning, still in effect, back out to the west. But here's something new. We haven't been focusing on this because we've been focused on the severe weather. There will be snow and ice in the northeast. Ice storm warning in effect.

We expect the Senate will take it up before they leave town tomorrow at some point.After that, we expect that we will get some kind of bill legislation in the next few days. Again, it's going to take a little bit of time. And there could be some hiccups in that process. But after that, lawmakers are feeling very optimistic that they will be able to get this full year spending deal, make sure that they get some of their Democratic priorities in this bill before they lose one lever of Congress, the House of Representatives, to Republicans. There's a lot of optimism that they're going to be able to get this all done before the Christmas holiday.
