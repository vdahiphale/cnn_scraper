That is the highest rate in more than a decade. That is despite the bans we've talked so much about put in place in more than a dozen Republican-led states after the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe versus Wade.CNN's Jacqueline Howard has been looking at this report. She's joining us right now. What more are you learning from the data in this report?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, I think the takeaway here is that these numbers tell a story. We've seen this rise in abortions because there are states that still offer abortion care and in those states, they've seen an increase in abortions. We know that 14 states, so far, have banned abortion. But in neighboring states -- in states that still offer care, advocacy groups, clinics, abortion funds have all worked to maintain and increase access, and that's what we're witnessing.So like you said, last year, in total, there were more than a million abortions performed here in the U.S. That number represents a 10 percent increase from 2020. And if you look only at states that still offer abortion care, there was a 25 percent increase in abortions. So those are the states where we're seeing this increase play out. And many of those states, like Illinois, New Mexico -- they saw the most increases. They are seeing patients that are maybe traveling to get abortion care and that's why we're seeing this trend. We also know telemedicine -- telehealth has played a role as well. So it's fascinating to see this counterbalance, so to speak, in response to some of the restrictions that have come out against abortion.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, Sara, I'll start with the good news first. Negotiators have come to an agreement on the DHS funding bill. This is a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security and it had been one of the last hangups as they were trying to move forward with negotiating this package of six spending bills.Over the weekend, the White House and Republicans had to scramble together a last-minute discussion to try to find a path forward. That now has been found. Here is the issue. They still have to write this legislation and they still have to do what is known as a readout, meaning everyone is checking it for anything that slipped in at the last minute. That all takes considerable amounts of time. And there are a couple of factors at play here. One is House Republican rules require that members have 72 hours -- a three-day rule is what it's known as -- to review legislative text. That means if the text comes out today, the soonest that they could likely vote on this would be Thursday or Friday. Then you're in a situation where the Senate still has to pass it. And in the United States Senate, any one member can slow the process down. They can slow-walk this. So it's very possible that they could fall into a shutdown into the weekend as they try to find some path forward. It's also possible that Senate throughs (PH) could agree to move this bill package very swiftly. So there's still a lot that we don't know. But the good news is they do have an agreement on that very difficult DHS bill that they had been trying to negotiate over the course of the last several weeks. But whether or not they can get this done by the Friday midnight deadline still remains to be seen -- Sara.",

We've all learned that lesson now over years. He can say almost anything and it doesn't fundamentally change his numbers of support, at least with his base support and with some of the voters that are newly attracted to him. It's almost immune from his sort of hysterical rhetoric on all kinds of issues, this being one of them. But lastly, I think Donald Trump could actually make a legitimate meritorious argument that he's the stronger candidate when it comes to foreign affairs relative to Israel. He has a strong record with the Abraham Accords, his support for Israel, and a number of things he did while he was president. So if he wants to present himself as the most pro-Israel candidate in this race he can credibly do that. he doesn't need to introduce, sort of, hyperbolic or hysterical rhetoric.",

You heard that and you thought what? PAWLENTY:  Well, I know Gov. Ventura. I get along with him well. We have a nice relationship outside of politics. But on politics, what I thought was well, there's sort of two conspiracy theorists coming together. So in that regard, it's sort of an aligned ticket if he goes that route, although I guess the more recent reporting is he's leaning toward somebody else. I think RFK more broadly -- setting aside Gov. Ventura -- while he's going to impact the election in terms of who he drains votes from, in my view, is a conspiracy theorist and is a little weird.

And she was actually indicted last year on state charges for trying, allegedly, to seize voting machines to prove those voter fraud claims. In her criminal case in Michigan, there actually is an active warrant out for her arrest because she failed to appear at two recent hearings in Michigan. But she did make an appearance yesterday in a D.C. courtroom -- right here in D.C. -- for a separate defamation case. That's because she is the attorney of the former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, who is being sued by Dominion Voting Systems for similarly promoting false claims about the 2020 election. It was a routine scheduled check-in -- status conference on that case and Ms. Lambert was there. But things got very interesting because she tussled with the judge and the Dominion attorneys for the better part of an hour. But when the hearing ended, the judge told everyone to leave the courtroom, myself included. We all stepped out. And then we saw two U.S. Marshals step in and we never saw Ms. Lambert leave that courtroom.
