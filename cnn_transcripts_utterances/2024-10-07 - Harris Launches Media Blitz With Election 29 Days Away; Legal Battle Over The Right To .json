This week, the Harris campaign is noticeably ramping up her media appearances with just 29 days to go until Election Day.Tonight, Harris and her running mate, Governor Tim Walz, appearing on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" for a taped interview and followed by several interviews here over the next couple of days. And then, according to new findings from The Breakthrough -- it's a polling project that tracks how the public is following election news -- the vice president's media flurry comes at a critical time. The latest data shows that the share of Americans hearing anything at all about Harris has dropped each week since her debate with former President Trump.",

      "sentences": "Now this is really fascinating. The tone Americans use in describing what they've heard about the vice president has reached the lowest point of her campaign.And the word \"lie\" was the fourth-most mentioned word that some Americans associate with Harris after \"border,\" \"polls\" and \"campaign.\" Responses calling Trump \"a liar\" are also steadily near the top of his list. About 8 percent in the latest data use the word \"lie\" or \"liar\" in relation to Trump. That figure has frequently been in the high single digits. Let's discuss with Meghan Hays, a former Biden White House director of message planning, and Erin Perrine, a Republican strategist for Axiom Strategies. Thank you both for being with us. Meghan, first to you. I'm wondering what you make of that 6 percent associating Harris with the word \"lie\" or \"liar?\" MEGHAN HAYS, FORMER BIDEN WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF MESSAGE PLANNING: Yes. I mean, I think that this is just what happens in the course of the campaign. The negativity on both sides starts to ramp up, especially towards the end when they're out there more so. I don't put too much stock in it. I think that the vice president is doing what she needs to be doing, meeting voters where they are with its local media, with its recent media blitz. I do think she could be probably doing a set more, or in doing some more local interviews but I'll leave that to the campaign. But I don't put much stock in the words that people are associating with each. I think this is normally their bases being polled here and really coming through.",

Not everyone is able to go to an event in the battleground states. So you need to reach these people on radio. You need to reach them on podcasts. You need to reach them on FOX, on CNN, on NBC.

He's the founding CEO for the Concussion Legacy Foundation.Chris, could you explain what we're seeing during that hit, portion by portion of his physical response? CHRIS NOWINSKI, NEUROSCIENTIST &amp; FOUNDING CEO, CONCUSSION LEGACY FOUNDATION: Yes, Boris, the more I watched this video, the more I'm troubled about what happened. Because, as Josh Allen was going down, you see he's raising his left arm to protect his head, which is a very natural movement when you're falling like that. And then after his head bounces so high off the ground, that arm goes limp and you see his wrist catch against the ground, which can break your wrist. It's something that any athlete, if they we're aware, would avoid. So I really do think he was unconscious there for a moment after that hit. So the idea that he went back in, you know, there's a lot of levels of why this is a problem. If -- even if they missed the fact he was briefly unconscious, the fact that he wouldn't stand up for a minute should be a red flag that to send somebody off into the locker room to be fully evaluated. And then you start to think, well, maybe Josh Allen jumped back in after 3.5 minutes, he didn't even realize he was knocked out because it was so brief. And when you're knocked out, you don't know it. And so ethically, the idea that he was trying to be a hero and no one told them, hey, dude, you we're knocked out, your teammates had to roll you over, really makes you wonder, you know, what happened here.
