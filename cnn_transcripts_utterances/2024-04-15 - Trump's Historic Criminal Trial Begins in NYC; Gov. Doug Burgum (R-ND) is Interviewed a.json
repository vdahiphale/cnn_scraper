He is accused of falsifying documents to conceal a sex scandal involving an adult film star. This is a day that Donald Trump has tried to push off again and again and get canceled all together. Delay being a key part of Trump's strategy in all of his legal battles. And now he is trying to use this New York trial to delay the federal case he's facing in Florida even further.

That is a really important deadline in this classified documents case in Florida because it's when Donald Trump's team is told by the judge they must start asking for classified records to be used in their case. So, they're going to have to go document by document scrupulously through those records with the judge to see if they can use them. And Trump's team says, he just can't do it while he's in trial in New York. They say, \"the May 9th deadlines will require lengthy classified submissions and extensive time in a SCIF,\" so a secured facility in Florida, \"to prepare and discuss those submissions, which is time President Trump and his attorneys simply do not have during the trial that is about to begin in New York.\" So, they're asking for this upcoming deadline that is very important to their case in the hush money case to be moved until three weeks after the end of the dock - of the hush money case in New York. They don't want to do anything really of substance in that Florida case until well after this case in New York ends. The Justice Department that's prosecuting them in Florida, prosecuting Trump and his two co-defendants, they say, this is procrastination and this must stop. He has had months for Donald Trump and his legal team to do this work. They have had all the documents they've needed for a long time. They knew these deadlines were coming.

BERMAN: All right, as we are standing by to watch Donald Trump leave Trump Tower, with us now the governor of North Dakota and former Republican presidential candidate, Doug Burgum. Governor, thank you so much for being with us. In the recent \"New York Times\"/Sienna poll, 58 percent of respondents said that they believe the New York criminal charges against Donald Trump are at least somewhat serious. So, how do you think voters should react if Trump is convicted of falsifying records to cover up a relationship with an adult film actress? GOV. DOUG BURGUM (R-ND): Well, good morning, John. I think when being out on the trail and being around America and talking to Americans, they see right through this. They understand that Donald Trump can't get a fair trial in New York. They know this is a sham trial. They know that former -- the feds passed on this particular case. The former prosecutor passed on it. And, in many ways, it's a very boring case. It's about a business filing and its being - trying to, you know, brought up its -- this dramatic, historic, unprecedented thing. But what's unprecedented, what's historic is the fact the lawfare that's going on where this two-tiered justice system is trying to take something that's basically a boring business filing case and turn it into the trial of the century. And Americans can see right through it. Americans, right now, they're concerned about inflation, about the open border.",

And if we can pass that this week, it will really help. The best way to help Israel and to help Ukraine is to pass the supplemental this week. And I've called on Speaker Johnson to do that.
