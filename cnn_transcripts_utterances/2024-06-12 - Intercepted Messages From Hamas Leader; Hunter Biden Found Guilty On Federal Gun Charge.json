One issue for Israel could be amendments demanded by Hamas, which one source says involves a timeline for a permanent ceasefire and the complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.Hamas says its response opens the door to an agreement, but that remains to be seen. Earlier, Israel appeared poised to formally sign up for the ceasefire plan while still maintaining the freedom to keep fighting. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the Middle East on a diplomatic push to secure a deal. On Tuesday, he said, Hamas is the one obstacle standing in the way of a ceasefire. U.S. intelligence suggests that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar believes his group has the upper hand in negotiations with Israel. US officials say Sinwar \"believes he's winning.\" It's a discouraging assessment for negotiators trying to pursue a deal to end the fighting in Gaza.

Yahya Sinwar, the military leader of Hamas.Sinwar helped mastermind the horrific October 7th attacks and is suspected to be hiding out in the tunnels under Gaza. Exactly where is unknown. A fresh report out today from the Wall Street Journal details messages between Sinwar and Hamas officials participating in the ceasefire talks in Doha. The exchanges show that the terrorist leader thinks he may have the upper hand in the current negotiations. \"We have the Israelis right where we want them.\" Sinwar allegedly said in recent messages. These stunning messages, which CNN cannot independently verify, reveal his frame of mind as this war drives into its ninth month with the Palestinian death toll climbing, Sinwar wrote, \"these are necessary sacrifices\" and this is why U.S. officials believe Sinwar has had little incentive to broker a deal. Not only will Israel refuse to stop fighting, but the pressure will continue to mount on Israel daily, which Sinwar believes is to his benefit. The Israeli military responded to these messages saying, \"Hamas, leaders don't care about Gazans. How many times do they have to say it for themselves before the world believes them?\" And as Blinken continues to push for a deal that could eventually end the war, he took aim at Sinwar.

The Russian defense ministry says the strike group, including a nuclear-powered submarine, the Kazan, armed with modern caliber cruise missiles is practicing the use of high precision weapons. But it's really about Putin flexing his muscles on the international stage. Led by the flagship of Russia's Northern Fleet, the Admiral Gorshkov, which Russia's Defense Ministry says is normally equipped with latest zircon hypersonic missiles. This is meant to deliver a powerful message to Washington. Russian state television has been celebrating the naval deployment placing some of Russia's most powerful vessels in Cuban waters. The American media has been discussing the event. Reports the Russian news anchor claiming the Pentagon has no idea where our submarine is positioned. In fact, U.S. officials are downplaying any threat that Moscow has been signaling displeasure that Washington recently green lighting Ukrainian attacks on Russian territory with U.S.-supplied weapons. Speaking ahead of the Cuban naval visit, Vladimir Putin warned of a possible Russian response.

It's quite clear.Common Sense indicates it too that Putin would rather have somebody who is not very fond of NATO, who would walk away from their allies and whose claims to be able to end the war in a day, which, of course, means essentially telling the Russians, yes, you can -- you can have what you've -- what you've taken and trying to convince the Ukrainians just to live with it. So, there's no doubt that Putin wants to try to have -- and prefers to have Trump as the president, and wants to try to influence that situation as much as he can. So, what he's doing is he's providing talking points basically, to the Republican Party in the United States and to a campaigning Donald Trump who wants to be able to say, look, if you're tired of Russian warships off of your own coast, if you're tired of Russian warships so close to Florida, then vote for me, Donald Trump, because I can take care of everything. Don't worry about it. It'll all be fine. Putin knows that that's what Trump is going to do.

And in a statement to CNN, Chiquita confirmed its intention to appeal. For the last 20 years, said the company maintained that it had been a victim of extortion by the AUC. But a U.S. justice previously found that Chiquita paid the AUC over 100 times between 1997 and 2004, for $1.7 million in total.Monday's verdicts rule that the money was instrumental in propping up the AUC and that Chiquita was liable for the human rights abuse committed by the group. The cases heard in Florida are only a small portion of the total number of plaintiffs against the company and a team of attorneys that brought successfully forward these cases, intend to follow with further and further suits against Chiquita.

Farage wasn't hit and police caught the man after a brief chase.

It did have its defenders too though, and lots of people have gone to visit it as it hung in a gallery in London, including some protesters who used the opportunity to de-face it. They put -- or they pasted a cartoon over the front of it. This was a protest against The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. King Charles is patron of that animal welfare group.And the protesters claim that the RSPCA are covering up cruelty on farms, something the RSPCA denies, though they will look into any allegations they say. The painting luckily wasn't harmed. It was covered in Perspex. No comment from Buckingham Palace. I suspect or get the feeling that they don't want to give this story any more publicity than it is already getting. Max Foster, CNN, London.",
