And with this countdown, there's coming new warnings from Republicans themselves about the Republican frontrunner and what a second Donald Trump presidency could mean.Former Reagan official Robert Kagan calls a possible Trump second term a, quote, clear path to dictatorship in the United States. David Frum, former speechwriter for George W. Bush, saying it will, quote, instantly plunge the country into a constitutional crisis. Let's get over to CNN's Kristen Holmes. She has more on this. Kristen, this weekend, Donald Trump maybe heard this and tried to flip the script on all of this. What did he say?",

So, one of Joe Biden's biggest arguments against Donald Trump is that a second Trump term would be bad for democracy.As we have obviously reported, Trump is facing charges for trying to overturn the 2020 election, our democratic processes. He has constantly questioned the legitimacy of elections, which are our democratic institutions. And at one point, he even called for the termination of the Constitution. But now he is trying to flip the script, saying that it's actually Joe Biden who is bad for democracy, and using an argument we have heard him make before, essentially saying that the four indictments against him are Joe Biden's way of using the Department of Justice, essentially to attack a political opponent, that opponent being Donald Trump. Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  Joe Biden is the destroyer of American democracy, and it's him and his people. So, if Joe Biden wants to make this race a question of which candidate will defend our democracy and protect our freedoms, and I say to Crooked Joe, and he is crooked, the most corrupt president we've ever had, we will win that fight and we're going to win it very big.

So, it's something to really pay attention to, even if it seems as though he is just trying to say, as John said at the top, no, you are the problem, not me.But the other part of this to focus on is just the fact of what a Trump 2025 agenda and term would look like. And we talk a lot about these checks and balances. And what most of those articles that you mentioned talk about is the fact that Donald Trump is looking for ways around the normal checks and balances system. Many of them have grown weaker since he was in office and something that he is trying to do if he was to win a second term.",

And Democrats know that this program is increasingly popular. It's actually more popular now than it was in previous years. So, now they're running ads, essentially saying that Trump is a threat to your health care, again, something that they want to focus on. When I'm talking to Republicans, they have no idea why it is that Donald Trump is doubling down on this. He mentioned it this weekend. He's continued to post on social media about it. [10:05:00] But he has yet to offer a plan. And I will note that back when he was in office, he continually said he would come up with a plan that would replace Obamacare, yet he left in 2020 never having done so, Kate.",

But let's take a closer look now at what one of his strongest GOP challengers for the nomination, Nikki Haley.The man, the myth the legend, CNN Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten, is joining me now. All right, first of all, how far behind is Nikki Haley and is there some sort of historical example as to what might be her path to a win?",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, look, let's be very real. Donald Trump is well ahead of Nikki Haley at this point, though Nikki Haley does have some momentum. So, this is the prior poll, this is the latest poll. Iowa, New Hampshire, national.If we look nationally, look how far Donald Trump was ahead in the last NBC poll. He was up by 45 points. But, again, that's smaller than the margin he was in the prior poll when he was up 52 over Nikki Haley. But here's a key nugget to keep in mind. Look at Iowa, New Hampshire. Remember, primaries are sequential contests. So, if we look at Iowa, the first in the nation, Donald Trump still has a commanding lead over Nikki Haley there, but it's 27 points compared to 45 nationally. Look in New Hampshire, it was 27, now it's 22 points. So, the idea is you win, or you do better in Iowa than expected for Nikki Haley, then maybe you win in New Hampshire and then you take off nationally. And there is one historical analogy I would sort of point to. This is the 1984 Democrats. Look, Walter Mondale led at this point. He went on to win the nomination. But it was a much smaller win than a national popular vote than it was at this point. At this point, it was 39 points. He only won it by two. How did Gary Hart do it? He finished stronger in Iowa than expected. You could see Mondale's margin here was smaller than the poll lead at this point. And that catapulted Gary Hart in the state of New Hampshire. He was down by 42 points at this point. He actually won the state by nine. So, look, it's a long --",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, I think a key thing to keep in mind is non-Haley voters, their mind is made up in the GOP primary, just 44 percent of non-Haley voters said their mind is made up in Iowa. In New Hampshire, it's just 57 percent. So, there's still a lot of voters out there who's kind of swimming around saying, who should I support? So, this is a potential pool for Nikki Haley.Here's the other thing to keep in mind. What comes after New Hampshire? It's South Carolina, which, of course, is a third of the nation contest where Nikki Haley was the former governor. Look, she's down significantly at this point. But, again, it's a smaller lead for Trump than it is nationally. It's about 29 points. But this, I think, is key to keep in mind. View very favorably, this tends to be correlated with votes in the primary. And you can see Trump's lead on this metric. He still holds a lead, but it is smaller. It is smaller than his lead in the primary choice. It's only 14 points. If Nikki Haley does something in Iowa, catapults herself in New Hampshire, then comes in the South Carolina, I wouldn't be surprised to see that margin shrink more. Again, tough path, but there is a path that you can look to historically. The '84 Dems, if a slight few things went differently, maybe Gary Hart was the nominee in '84.

The New York Times writes that Trump is always exhibited authoritarian impulses. But this time, basically, he's got the policy to back it up.

It's one that has been proven politically successful for Democrats in the years that Republicans have been trying to upend it as recently as the 2018 midterms when Democrats won control of the House.I would just note, John, you've seen an uptick in sort of the democracy arguments from the Biden-Harris campaign team, I would say, even since the summer. There was a lot of caution of not wanting to meddle in some of these cases that are ongoing. But they've put that to the side to really talk about the issue directly, especially as Donald Trump makes it front and center.

He's got these endorsements in Iowa, and yet, and yet, David, there continues to be chaos within his campaign apparatus. It's the super PAC that's backing him. What's going on here? CHALIANIt used to be -- super PACs would just raise a lot of money and go on television with ads. The entire ground organization was built by his super PAC. And, remember, legally, the DeSantis campaign and DeSantis himself can't coordinate on strategy with the super PAC.
