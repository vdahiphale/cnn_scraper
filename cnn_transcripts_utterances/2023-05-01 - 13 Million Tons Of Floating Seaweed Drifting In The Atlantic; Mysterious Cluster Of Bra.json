Specifically, they're expecting the east coast.And remember, last month we talked about this but now we're actually starting to see it come in in those record numbers that scientists predicted -- so much so that take a look over here. The beach rakers on this beach in Key West have already arrived and have already done on run-through on what's hitting the Florida coast right now. Let's go for a walk so I can kind of show you how all of this stuff just piles up and, again, gets pretty smelly because it decays out here. And as we mentioned, this is what one scientist told me is just the tip of the iceberg -- more expected. Because when this is out there it is not only right now a 5,000-mile-long body of seaweed, it is still growing while it's out there. So it is increasing in the amount that will be headed this way, as you mentioned, expected to peak in bloom right around that June-July time which, of course, is summer when a lot of tourists come out here and are expecting a great vacation. We actually caught up with one couple already here hoping to celebrate a 60th birthday and -- well, let's just say the vacation not going as planned. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

In 2022, last year, the number of brain abscesses in kids tripled in Nevada, rising from an average of four to five a year to 18. The good news is that none of the patients died. But doctors from other parts of the country say they may also be seeing a similar rise in cases. Joining us now is the doctor who noticed this pattern in southern Nevada, Dr. Taryn Bragg. She's an associate professor at the University of Utah and pediatric neurosurgeon at Intermountain Health at Sunrise Children's Hospital in Nevada. And Doctor, we're so grateful for your time this morning and the fact that you were the one who noticed this and actually alerted public health authorities. What did you see? What were you seeing and what did you tell them? DR. TARYN BRAGG, PEDIATRIC NEUROSURGEON, INTERMOUNTAIN HEALTH AT SUNRISE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL IN NEVADA, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF UTAH (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, yes, good morning. I started noticing in late March a significant rise in patients presenting to the emergency room with high fevers and altered mental status and weakness.

This move comes after New York Democrats in the midterms were hit hard on violent crime and faced calls for the state to change the bail reform laws.

That's that COVID-era policy that allowed the border authorities to quickly expel certain migrants.Gonzales' comments come as Chicago's outgoing Mayor Lori Lightfoot, who you just heard from, is now urging Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to stop sending busloads of migrants to her city of Chicago. Lightfoot, yesterday, wrote in a letter to him saying, quote, \"Your lack of consideration or coordination in an attempt to cause chaos and score political points has resulted in a critical tipping point in our ability to receive individuals and families in a safe, orderly, and dignified way.\" Mayor Lightfoot is back here at the table with us. Also joining our conversation on immigration and other key issues, CNN senior political commentator and former Republican congressman from Illinois, Adam Kinzinger. Thank you both. Two questions for you on this letter. One, have you heard anything? LIGHTFOOT:  No, we have not heard anything back and frankly, I didn't expect to hear anything back. But I felt like it was important to once again try to engage the governor but also let him know what his policies and practices are doing in cities like Chicago. We are completely tapped out, we have no more space and no more resources, and frankly, we're already in a surge. We've been seeing over the last week two to three -- 200-plus people coming to Chicago every single day. We call them walk-ins because they're not coming on buses, but they are coming on planes from San Antonio. And we're very concerned because they don't seem like they're getting screened at the border. We've seen people coming with serious medical issues.",

Who have serious medical conditions that can't be dealt with by the paramedics that we have on site. They've got to be rushed to the hospital. Women who are in such an advanced stage of labor that they literally get off the bus and give birth within one of our facilities. That doesn't make any sense. So if we don't put the humanity of these migrants front and center -- I understand and I'm solely compassionate to the fact that the borders are, themselves, really overwhelmed but you don't solve that problem by simply sticking people on buses to a city that they didn't ask to come to for an uncertain future and now, where we are literally full.",

And 80 percent of Americans say that's a good solution.The problem is Republicans hold onto border security; Democrats hold onto the issue of those that are here illegally, and nothing gets done. I have worked the border as a member of the National Guard and I'll tell you the human trafficking issue on the border is very serious. We'd find people -- we'd find bodies in the desert in Arizona. We'd find young girls that had been raped by coyotes bringing them over. This is a -- this is a human issue. And I agree with the mayor on you cannot just start shipping people around the country to make political points. Yes, Texas and Arizona have a huge problem and they need extra resources to deal with it. But you don't deal with it by further dividing this country on the issue of immigration and that's what, frankly, people like Gov. Abbott are trying to do.",
