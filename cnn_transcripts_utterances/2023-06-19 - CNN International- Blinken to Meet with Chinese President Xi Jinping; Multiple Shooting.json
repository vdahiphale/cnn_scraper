They essentially believe that Russian authorities are trying to make his group, his opposition group and his opposition work, to link that to extremism in some way. They're trying to accuse him of assassination attempts. They call these, of course, absolutely trumped-up charges that are politically motivated.

CNN's Ariane de Vogue looks at what to expect on those and other high-profile cases.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ARIANE DE VOGUE, CNN U.S. SUPREME COURT REPORTER: All eyes are on this conservative Supreme Court to see just how fast and how far the conservatives want to go to move the court to the right. One big case they're considering considers affirmative action and asks the question whether colleges and universities can continue to take race into consideration as a factor with in admissions plans. Has to do with plans out of Harvard and the University of North Carolina. The schools say they want to be able to consider race in order to make sure that their campuses are diverse. They say their campuses are often a pipeline to society. And it's a better academy environment to have a diverse academic experience. On the other hand, challengers say that it violates equal protection. They say it mounts to racial discrimination and it shouldn't be allowed. The Supreme Court in this case will consider whether to overturn decades old precedent. There's another case having to do with President Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. The plan was put in place to give relief to millions of borrowers in the wake of COVID. Some of them would get up to $20,000 of relief. But here, Republican-led states said that the Biden administration didn't have the authority basically to erase billions of dollars of debt. They said in that case, it would have to be Congress that stepped in. And in oral arguments, the conservative justices seemed very skeptical of the Biden administration's position in the case. And there's a really important case that's important to the LBGTQ community. It involves a website designer. She wants to expand her business to make websites that celebrate weddings. But she does not want to create them for same-sex marriages. In here the LBGTQ community comes in and says that if she wins, then businesses would have a license to discriminate. But on the other side, she says the website designer, she looks at this through a lens of free speech. She says that the government can't force her to create a custom product with a message that goes against her religious beliefs. Ariane de Vogue, CNN, Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
