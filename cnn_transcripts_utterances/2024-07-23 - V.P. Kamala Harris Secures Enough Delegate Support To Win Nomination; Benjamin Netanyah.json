      "sentences": "Hanging over those negotiations as well as over the Israeli prime minister's trip to Washington this week is one key question. Does Netanyahu actually want a ceasefire deal?If you listen to the conventional wisdom in Israeli media politics even on the streets of Tel Aviv, the answer to that question would be no, that the Israeli prime minister actually has much more to gain by prolonging this war than by ending it. You know, this war has allowed him to stave off elections that he would likely lose at this moment. His right-wing governing coalition partners have also threatened to collapse his government if he agrees to a deal that stops the fighting. There's also evidence that the Israeli prime minister has been throwing up 11th hour obstacles to a potential deal, reneging on at least one key Israeli concession and also throwing up a new demand regarding Israeli control of that Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt. But the Israeli prime minister is also coming under enormous pressure right here in Israel, as well as in the United States. And he's going to face that pressure directly from President Biden and other top U.S. officials. The question is, will that pressure actually be effective coming from Biden, who is now effectively a lame duck president? But at the same time, Netanyahu is now sitting down with a man who is squarely focused on his legacy, untethered from the constraints of electoral politics. So, that will be a fascinating dynamic to watch. But then there's also this other possibility, which is that Netanyahu will actually be looking to someone else, perhaps, for an answer on which way he should lean regarding striking a ceasefire deal or not, and that man could be former President Donald Trump. Netanyahu is an avid and very keen watcher of U.S. politics, who will certainly be keeping a close eye on the polls and on Donald Trump's chances to become president. But it should be noted that their relationship despite Trump's steadfast support for Israel during his presidency, it is far from perfect. It has suffered a lot of turbulence actually over the last couple of years. And as of now, the Israeli Prime Minister while he will certainly meet with Trump's allies in Washington, there's no meetings scheduled yet for him with Donald Trump.",

More than 600 took part in a survey done by \"CNN As Equals\" and the global NGO Plan International about how their gender affects their experiences online. Many said they regularly suffer harm on social media platforms or in other online spaces, from discrimination, hate speech, bullying, or unwanted sexual images or videos. And overwhelmingly, they say the companies which own those platforms must do more to keep them safe.CNN's Kristie Lu Stout joins me now, live from Hong Kong with more on this. So Kristie, what does this study reveal about the dangers girls in Asia and around the world are facing online, right now? KRISTIE LU STOUT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Yeah, Rosemary, this study reveals that online only sexual abuse is happening not just in the west, it's happening on a global scale with girls as young as 13 being targeted. This is according to this new exclusive study by \"CNN As Equals\" and Plan International. They surveyed more than 600 young women and girls from the age of 13 to 24 across South America, across Africa, across here in Asia, across some nine different countries, including here in Asia, Nepal, and the Philippines. Now, let's bring up some of the key findings for you. According to this study, 75 percent of those surveyed have faced harm online with more than one in ten experiencing it daily or almost daily. Again these are girls, some as young as 13 and almost half of them say that they have seen or received unwanted sexual images or videos, and a quarter have faced discrimination or hate speech online. As a result, one-third of the women and girls surveyed say that they feel anxious, they feel stressed, and depressed. So Rosemary, this is a revealing and distressing report. Back to you.",

And they say that the burden should not be on the girls and the women, but on the platforms. In fact, one participant and her name is Reyna, she is from the Philippines. She shares this -- she says this. Let's bring it up for you.\"Those who provide digital literacy lessons should be the companies that make the apps. They are responsible for what can happen to us or what we can encounter.\" Now, experts say that the world's top social platforms, they may be doing programs addressing this, but they got to do more. We know that earlier this year, Meta, this is the company that oversees Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp -- they announced new restrictions for teenage users and Meta say it is working with experts. In fact, it's working with Plan International to better safeguard women and young girls. We heard from Cindy Southworth of Meta. She is the Head of Women's Safety there and she tells us that what they are doing \"builds on years of developing tools, features, and policies to help keep them safe.\" We did reach out to TikTok. TikTok did not provide direct comment, but a spokesperson shared that it prevents users under 18 from seeing sexually suggestive content. It also makes under-16 accounts private with DMs not available, but experts warn that this type of online harm and abuse is just spiraling, it's getting worse. And these platforms, no matter how powerful they are, they are just failing to stay ahead of this problem. Rosemary, we do want to direct our viewers out there. They can learn more, find out more about this full study as cnn.com/asequals. Rosemary?",

For the very first time, an Olympic opening ceremony is going to happen not inside a stadium, but actually through the main city (ph) on its main (ph) artery on the Seine River itself.BELL (voice-over): Despite a terror threat in France that's still at its highest level, some 320,000 people are expected to line the banks of the river over six kilometers to watch, the biggest crowd ever to attend such an event in person. GEN. ERIC CHASBEOUF, OLYMPIC GAMES MILITARY FORCES: We'll have more than 10,000 soldiers, more than 35,000 policemen. It will be completely secure. BELL (voice-over): Street patrols leave regularly from the largest military camp erected in France since the end of World War II. And beyond the terror threat, there are also fears linked to crime, social unrest, and cyber attacks. NICOLAS NORMAN, PARIS DEPUTY MAYOR FOR SECURITY (through translator): There are lots of exercises, crises, simulations, sometimes quite extraordinary events where everyone during an entire day tries to anticipate and then to manage them. And so today, we're ready and we're calm. BELL (voice-over): The Olympic flame arrived in Paris to welcoming crowds, but nothing compared to what is to come. Officials say that some 10 million to 15 million people are expected, far too many for human eyes only to watch. So AI has been brought in to help monitor CCTV. MATTHIAS HOULLIER, CO-FOUNDER, WINTICS: They need to detect abnormal situations, like, for example, when there is intrusion of people on railways, when there is unattended item that could be suspicious package, et cetera. We detect them and then the operator gets notified in real time, so that he can decide what should be done. BELL (voice-over): An unprecedented security operation made up of police, military, foreign forces, and even AI startups that officials hope has made Paris ready for anything.
