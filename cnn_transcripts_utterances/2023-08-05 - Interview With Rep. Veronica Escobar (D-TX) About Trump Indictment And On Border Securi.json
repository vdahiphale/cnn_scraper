      "sentences": "You are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin this hour with the latest escalation in the battle between former President Donald Trump and Special Counsel Jack Smith. A short time ago, the federal judge overseeing Trump's election fraud case responded to a court filing from Smith last night. Smith is now seeking a protective order after Trump posted this yesterday evening, saying, quote, \"If you go after me, I'm coming after you.\" Smith is pointing to that message and asking the judge in the case to set limits on Trump and his legal team when it comes to publicly discussing sensitive evidence, and the judge has now given the Trump team until 5:00 p.m. this Monday to respond. Just this afternoon, lawyers for the former president asked a judge for more time to weigh in on what restrictions should be imposed. And joining us now to discuss this is Democratic Congresswoman Veronica Escobar of Texas. Congresswoman, thanks for joining. So let's get right to it. When you saw these words that Trump wrote in that threatening post, what did you think of that? What was your concern there? REP. VERONICA ESCOBAR (D-TX): Well, good afternoon, Jim. It was as predicted. I mean, I knew he would not be able to help himself. He is a very dangerous person, and he is always, whenever he perceives himself as a victim, he fights back, and he does that by threatening people. And frequently his supporters respond to that. But this is a very serious case. And his actions are weighty and serious and I do hope that the judge really takes a close look at Trump's history in this regard. ACOSTA: Well, and that leads me to this question. I mean, should the judge in this case consider warning Trump that he could go to jail if he continues to make these kinds of threats?",

But it is really important that people be protected throughout this process.We saw on January 6th people lost their lives. There was serious damage.

I mean, it is incredibly gruesome and ghoulish. That should have been the alarm sounded to Greg Abbott to remove those buoys, but of course they just doubled down.

But I will tell you there is a wisdom to what the Department of Justice is doing.As much as I want to see absolutely immediate action, the Department of Justice, the lawsuit that they are bringing against the state of Texas, if the federal government prevails, and it is my hope that the federal government prevails, then that will essentially prohibit Greg Abbott from doing this again on federal property. So I can see that through the lawsuit there is sort of a more permanent resolution. You know, I would like to lean in on a more immediate resolution, but I'd want resolution nonetheless.",

And so we've been seeing these attacks nightly, frankly. They often cause deaths, unclear precisely if there was a loss of life from the attacks we've heard of today, but for Ukrainian civilians, part of the daily horrors frankly they experience since Russia invaded, by choice, nearly 18 months ago -- Jim.",

We appreciate it.Joining us for more on the military tactics in the Black Sea is CNN military analyst, retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. There's some new video obtained by CNN and we're watching it right here. Pretty extraordinary video here that shows one of these Ukrainian sea drones. Forgive my ignorance here, I didn't realize that they had sea drones or what sea drones were. What are we seeing here? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: So basically what we're seeing here, Jim, is a missile that is -- well, a drone that is acting kind of like a missile, that is going toward a ship. And you can see the ship right there as it's, you know, being approached by the drone. The drone is hitting it right on the side, basically in one of the more vulnerable points of the ship. So what this can do is really a lot of severe damage. It can actually take out a large portion of the ship. It can possibly sink it, depending on the amount of explosives. Now, in this particular case they tell us that it was around 500, I think kilograms, of TNT. So this is, you know, pretty massive explosion is possible with something like this. And I think what you're seeing is really something that allows us to, you know, realize that the type of warfare that we're dealing with here is an asymmetric kind of warfare, and that's very different. Ukraine has no real practical navy at this particular point in time, except for these drones.",

On Friday outside of the Fulton County courthouse, a heavier than normal police presence in the shadows of freshly erected police barricades. Starting Monday morning, streets around the courthouse will be closed. And now with Trump already facing three other indictments, the big question here is will Fulton County be yet another place where the former president is arrested and charged?

And what we had after that, according to U.S. officials and experts who track it, is the companies started selling the ingredients to get around sort of a workaround.And so now they're openly advertising these ingredients on their website saying, we ship to Mexico, no problem, we take crypto. And so there's been this explosion, as you say, in payments increase in 450 percent over the last year to these chemical companies. The cartels in Mexico are often using middlemen so to try to obscure it. So maybe someone in Guatemala buys it and they send the materials to Mexico. And the Feds and the U.S. are trying to catch up. It's a race to try to save lives here, and they're investing in technology. I talked to the DEA who told me that they have identified senior members of the cartels who are crypto specialists and specialize in money laundering, and they're actively watching them. On the DHS side, we talked to one person who leads the office in Arizona, and they have been affected by this person. They have lost someone, a family member, to fentanyl overdose. So it's a very personal issue for a lot of Americans, as you know. And here we have federal agents trying to catch up, and CNN got a really close look at how they're doing that very much a work in progress. We were able to talk to Scott Brown. He is an agent in Arizona that I mentioned. Not every seizure is going to get you to Chapo Guzman. That's, of course, a reference to the imprisoned famous drug lord.",
