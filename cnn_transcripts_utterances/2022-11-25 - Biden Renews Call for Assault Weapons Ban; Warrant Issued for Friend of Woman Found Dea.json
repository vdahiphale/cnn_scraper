You'll remember that President Biden, during these midterm campaigns, he repeatedly urged voters to elect more Democrats to Congress to be able to pass this assault weapons ban. The reality is that, while Democrats are going to be losing the House of Representatives, even now with that majority in the House, the Senate, they just don't have the 60 votes to get over the filibuster to be able to pass that ban on assault weapons. There's no question that the president is sincere in his desire to want to get this done, but the White House also sees some political value in talking about this and consistently calling for this ban on assault weapons. They see it as something that is broadly popular with the American public and also something that, of course, is a galvanizing issue for Democrats and the Democratic base.",

They're going to be finding things that really mean something for the people they love. But economists I'm talking to say they don't think it's going to hold back spending. Shopping is expected to actually still increase this year. Spending expected to increase 8 percent over last year, to total about 940 to $960 billion this year. I don't think inflation is going to be the grinch that kind of steals the holiday.
