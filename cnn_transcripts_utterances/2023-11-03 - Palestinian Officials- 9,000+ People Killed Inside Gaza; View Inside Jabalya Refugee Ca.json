The IDF has said the targets were Hamas leaders, as well as the militant group's tunnel built under the Jabalya camp. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz has the very latest details. But first, a warning: the images of her report are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The victims of Jabalya, victimized yet again. Some of the survivors of Israel's bombardment took shelter here, a U.N. school, only to be cut down. Desperate moments after an Israeli strike nearby shown on social media. This is one of four schools in Gaza impacted by strikes in a 24-hour period, the U.N. said, in total, housing some 20,000 displaced people, many of them, frightened young children. \"What did we do?\" this boy cries. \"We did nothing wrong.\" The living conditions in these shelters are unbearable. But families come here for safety. That, too, is gone. \"Bring me my son. Bring me my son,\" this father screams. It's unclear if his child is dead or alive. Three straight days of airstrikes in Jabalya have brought horror and bloodshed. CNN has reached out to the IDF for comment on the latest attacks. Israel says it is targeting Hamas infrastructure in this densely populated residential area and says it killed a senior Hamas commander with its strike on Tuesday. But with scores of civilians believed killed, the U.N. Human Rights Council warns what you see here are disproportionate attacks that could amount to a war crime. Gazans don't understand why the world can't stop this. \"We keep pulling out bodies: small children, women. It is a catastrophe,\" this man says. \"If the countries of the world had any shame, we wouldn't be in this situation.\" And more suffering is all but certain. Israeli troops are inching closer. And as ground forces, backed by near constant air raids, move towards central Gaza, the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians hang in the balance. The IDF has warned all residents in the North of the strip to leave, an order deemed inhumane and impossible by the United Nations. So many remain in the crossfire. \"Where is the world?\" this woman screams. \"Our children are being torn up before our eyes.\" And with the death toll mounting, pressure is growing on the U.S. and Israel to stem the violence.

And for Israeli ground troops, who are now said to have surrounded Gaza City, new public video from Hamas reveals the dangers they could be facing.CNN's Ed Lavandera has details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Hamas propaganda video shows its fighters emerge from underground tunnels in what appears to be the Northern outskirts of the most populated areas of Gaza. Hiding in the terrain, the Hamas soldiers fire away at Israeli units advancing into Gaza. One video shows a Hamas soldier stalking an Israeli tank, running up next to it, and placing an explosive device on the machinery, then running away. Seconds later, the device detonates. The Hamas fighter then disappears into the ground through a trap door. A political leader of Hamas spoke this week about the tunnel's vital role in the Hamas military strategy. (SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) \"We have built the tunnels,\" he says, \"because we have no other way of protecting ourselves from being targeted and killed. These tunnels,\" he says, \"are meant to protect us from the airplanes. We are fighting from inside the tunnels.\" While Israel has released thousands of airstrikes across Gaza since October 7th, Hamas is also trying to show off its air strike capabilities. It released this video of a munitions strike dropped from a drone over Israeli soldiers. It's not clear how many casualties it inflicted on the Israel defense force. Several soldiers could be seen running away from the site. The Israel defense forces released this Hamas propaganda video, which captures the elaborate maze of tunnels, which stretch for dozens of miles underneath Gaza. The militant organization uses the tunnels to store weapons, and to launch airstrikes toward Israel. Veteran Israeli journalist Shlomi Eldar has reported on Hamas for decades.

We give Egypt and Israel billions of dollars every, year I'm sure there is some leverage that could have been exercised to get them out.But I won't talk about that right now. I will say on your first point it was very frustrating for us, because you know, we care very much about Barbara and Ramona. We're responsible for them. And, you know, they are -- they were in a very difficult situation, not only with a lack of food and clean water as Barb mentioned, and a place to sleep. But also, you know, there were constant explosions and bombings around them. And in addition to that, there were thousands of people who were desperate to get into the U.N. compound, and to find at least some sense of security being around foreigners, that maybe they were safe, as there are no other safe places in Gaza. So we were quite concerned, and we're very fortunate they did get out.",

The final vote tally was 12 Democrats voted in support of the bill,and two Republicans voted against it. So really, an example here of how partisan even a non-partisan issue has become here in Washington. And the reason why Democrats were against this bill is because of the new speaker, Mike Johnson, and the way he decided to put this bill together. First of all, he decided to exclude Ukraine money. That's something that has been a priority for the White House, but it has become divisive in the House Republican conference. And second of all, Johnson decided to include partisan cuts to the IRS as part of this package. He wanted to pay for this measure. He didn't want just a straightforward emergency supplemental, which is really unusual. Typically, those types of bills are not conditioned upon anything. So that is one of the reasons why the White House has issued a veto threat for this bill. It is going nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate. And one Democrat, Jared Moskowitz, who did vote in support of that bill in the House, even he was unhappy with how it all came together. REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): I'm willing to give anybody the benefit of the doubt when they come into a leadership position. This was it. This was his first full week, first big vote, national security issues to the American people, a national security issue for Israel, a No. 1 ally. And he played politics for it so that he could send out a political mailer.",
