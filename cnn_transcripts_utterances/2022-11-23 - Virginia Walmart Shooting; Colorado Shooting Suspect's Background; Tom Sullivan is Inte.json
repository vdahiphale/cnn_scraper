A very busy morning and, in many ways, a sad one.Breaking overnight, at least six people have died, several others injured, after a gunman opened fire inside a break room at a Walmart in Chesapeake, Virginia. Police say the gunman was a current employee who they believe also took his own life. We're going to take you to the scene there in just a moment. Plus, hours from now, the suspect in the Colorado night club shooting will appear in court for the first time. Anderson Lee Aldrich is facing possible murder and hate crime charges. We'll have more on the suspect's tumultuous upbringing just ahead. Also this, two explosions rocked Jerusalem overnight. At least one teenager is dead. More than a dozen others are injured. Officials now investigating this as a terror attack. We will be live in Jerusalem. First, I do want to go to CNN correspondent Brian Todd, who is on the scene in Chesapeake, Virginia. Brian, a shooting in America. What more do we know this morning?",

      "sentences": "Right, Jim.A short time ago we heard from the police chief of Chesapeake, Mark Solesky, who filled in a couple of gaps in this case. But we still have some information that we're chasing at this hour. But what we can tell you is a bit of a timeline for when this attack unfolded, where it unfolded. According to the chief, the first 911 calls came in at 10:12 p.m. Eastern Time last night. Officers arrived within two minutes. They got there at 10:14 p.m. They entered the building at 10:16 p.m. And then they rendered the building safe at 11:20 p.m. So, between the first 911 calls and the time the officers entered the building, it was a total of four minutes. The shooter, according to the police chief, was an employee. We have sourced information that says that this occurred in a break room where the employee walked in, there were people gathered, and he opened fire. He later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. We don't know exactly where, in the store or maybe outside it, that employee might have taken his own life. What we also were told by the police chief was, there is no clear motive for the attack at this time. And, again, they're just trying to piece together some information. They are not giving the identity of the suspect because his next of kin have not been notified yet. And they don't know -- they were asked pointedly they -- how long he was active in the store, you know, shooting at people. They don't have that information. We asked about weapons several times. They did say he used a pistol. We don't -- they say they do not know of any other weapons that he might have used. I can tell you that for several hours in this building behind me, you can see some of the law enforcement vehicles there, the evidence processing vans and other things behind me for several hours after the shooting occurred police and FBI agents were combing through the building, looking for whether anyone was hiding, whether there were any other people injured who needed attention. But they were able to render the building safe at 11:20 p.m. Eastern Time. Again, you know, this is a massive Walmart store. It was just before closing time that this attack occurred. Closing time was 11:00 p.m. according to Walmart's website. So, this was, you know, late in the shift last night when this occurred. Jim, this is just some of the - some of the gaps we're trying to fill at this hour, though, is possible motive. Of course, the suspect's name and whether there were any conflicts at the store leading up to this.",

Now, one person was killed in this attack. A 16-year-old identified as a duel Canadian Israeli citizen, and at least 14 others were injured. And Israeli police are calling this a coordinated, complex terrorist attack. They say that in both instances a bag of some sort was placed at the bus stops and likely detonated remotely. The likes of which these attacks we have not seen in this region for several years. For many people here, this is bringing back memories of the second intifada when there were seemingly regularly suicide attacks, bombing at bus stations, at restaurants and the like. Well, this has been a very deadly and violent year for both Israelis and Palestinians. So far the attacks targeting Israelis have been seeming to be random lone wolf attacks. Things like stabbing attacks, shootings, rammings. This, Israeli police show - say shows coordinated organization and planning ahead of time.

And that's partly because of that avian flu outbreak you mentioned.But, look, we're talking about price hikes on potatoes, and cranberry sauce, and pie crusts. The list goes on and on. And there's a real impact of families. We just heard from a retired couple that was coming out of the grocery store that was feeling that sticker shock because they realized how much heavier Thanksgiving is going to weigh on their budget this year. This is just one more inflation strain that so many families, they've been dealing with higher prices for months and months now, dealing with grocery costs in general, heating costs now heading into the winter, electricity and gasoline. And, look, I've spoken with hundreds of people here in recent months, I should say, Jim, talking about how they're adjusting their budget. And one of the major thing people are doing is changing their diet. That may mean eating less meat or going to restaurants less often. And now it's changing the way they're shopping for Thanksgiving. We heard from a couple that was coming out of the grocery stores saying that, you know, after seeing the prices this year, the change they're making, they're going to be buying less food, they're going to be buying fewer side dishes. And so for a lot of families, Jim, you may see a less full table tomorrow. As long as it's surrounded by family members, it will still mean a lot.
