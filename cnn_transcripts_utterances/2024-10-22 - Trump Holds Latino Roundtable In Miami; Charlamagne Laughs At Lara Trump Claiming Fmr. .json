They've used it through multiple whether you want to start a business, whether you are working in the trades, whether you're looking at the cost of housing and making sure that we can buy a home, because that shows stability. She's really seen it across the spectrum, and that really shows the difference between a leader who wants to talk at people and a leader that wants to listen. And they literally got information from door knocking, from round tables, from experts all around the country to put this together. And so, I think it's a great proposal. I think it's going to go a long way, especially as you have a group of undecided Latino men voters who are going to be on the internet searching what Donald Trump has to say about you, vis a vis, you know, poisoning the blood of this nation, versus someone like Kamala Harris, who actually has a plan to help you and help your family.",

Today a strike very close to a hospital across the street with shrapnel actually hit -- striking that hospital itself.And this was in an area that was not listed as an evacuation zone by the Israeli military. Eighteen people were killed including four children who one eye witness said had been playing in a courtyard just moments before this strike occurred and this eye witness described seeing these bodies of these children torn to pieces. We also saw a two -- a -- a multi-storey buildings that were flattened in an Israeli strike in Southern Beirut. That strike -- there was an evacuation warning but it came just a half hour before those bombs actually hit those buildings. The Israeli military clearly is pursuing a strategy of not only just degrading Hezbollah military but also very much trying to shake the bonds that Hezbollah has with the Shia community in Lebanon. And also just with Lebanese society at large, trying to bring Lebanese societal and political pressure to bear on Hezbollah in the hopes that that leads Hezbollah to more concessions in this ceasefire negotiations. We know that Amos Hochstein, President Biden's special envoy on this issue has been in Beirut pressing for a tougher enforcement conditions for Resolution 1701 which was the resolution implemented after the 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel, remains to be seen if those steps or things that Hezbollah will agree to.

Sanjay, do you have any advice that might help our viewers which in -- and also your -- your friendly neighborhood anchorman, Jake Tapper, here sneeze less. I'm sneezing a lot.DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes. Well, you know, I mean there's -- there's lots of options for this. But I -- I will tell you first of all, it is interesting if you think it's getting a little bit worse, it probably is. It -- it's interesting as the weather has sort of warmed, I think the headline is that frost, the -- the initial frost that we have every year has been delayed and that's led to a lot more ragweed in particular but other pollens as well. The plants just have longer to basically grow and -- and spread that pollen. The allergy season starts earlier. It ends later. And take -- take a look at this map, Jake. This is really interesting because these are places where you're seeing an increase in the length overall of fall allergy season. Which has always been a thing but it's usually a defined period. It's now really starting to extend. In Reno for example, it's almost three months longer now. At some point the entire year will essentially be allergy season if things continue the way that they are. The prediction is within the next 75 years, by the end of the century roughly there's going to be about 200 percent more pollen in the air.

Lucian has spent more than a decade documenting the harsh realities of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.And a key focus of his is the devastating consequences of burn pits. Those are the open-air waste disposal sites that exposed U.S. military personnel stationed outside of the United States to toxic fumes leading to severe long term health issues and in some cases, death. His latest project, \"Continue the Mission,\" follows the heart- wrenching story of Danielle Robinson, the widow of sergeant first class, Heath Robinson. Heath died as a result of health complications from exposure to burn pits. Danielle took up his fight to protect others like him. Her determination paid off in August 2022. President Biden signed the sergeant first class, Heath Robinson, honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxins or PACT Act into law. It represents the most significant expansion of benefits and services for toxicity exposed veterans in more than 30 years.
