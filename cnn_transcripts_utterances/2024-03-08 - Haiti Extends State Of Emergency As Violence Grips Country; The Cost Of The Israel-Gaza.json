Its -- it is the gangs and they are preventing aid organizations, NGOs, World Food Programme from bringing in badly needed aid.I talked to one diplomat. I know from her time here in Havanna, who was in Port-au-Prince, and she said she's running low on drinking waters, having to boil water. And so even people who were able to stock up food ahead of time, have an emergency fund of food, they are the lucky people. But they are running low. These gangs have had a profitable history over the years of kidnapping people and they're essentially holding an entire country hostage, insisting, one, that Ariel Henry step down as prime minister. And then they do not want an international force, this thousand-plus force of soldiers from Kenya to come and restore order because that threatens their livelihood, their many illegal businesses, including drug trafficking. So very clearly here, the gangs have the upper hand and time is running out.",

The plane was headed to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur but suddenly fell off the radar.Although pieces of debris have turned up, neither the plane itself nor any of the victims have ever been found. Today, family members who lost loved ones protested outside the Malaysian embassy in Beijing. They're demanding the Chinese government reopen the search. And it could potentially happen. Malaysian authorities say they are ready to discuss a possible new attempt. CNN aviation analyst, Miles O'Brien, is here. Miles, let's start with the very basics. Ten years later, a series of investigations have taken place. What information do we have about what happened to M.H.370? MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST: Well, Boris, the shreds of information we had have been kind of hacked out of data, in a way. The aircraft lost its transponder and did not communicate abruptly shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur. And it was presumed, once it disappeared from radar screens, to have likely fallen from beneath that point. But there was no wreckage there. It was subsequently determined, you may recall, that there was a satellite device on board, Inmarsat satellite device, which allowed it to communicate with the home office as it were. And while it wasn't actively engaged in communication, it was saying -- pinging, saying, I'm here. And that satellite analysis led to this stark conclusion that this aircraft took an abrupt turn, flew a rather circuitous route around the islands and then headed straight to the south, to the southern Indian Ocean. Beyond that, we don't know that much. We've had a lot -- there's been a lot of mathematical analysis of those radio pings to try to determine where on the face of the globe that aircraft might be. But it's not a very exact science. And it's a very big ocean.",

Miles, do you hold out hope that we'll ever get an official answer, perhaps with the help of new technology or another layer of investigation that has not yet been reached?O'BRIEN: Yes, we've got to keep hope alive, don't we on behalf -- just for the benefit of these families, if nothing else. But for -- the larger aviation community needs to know the answer, too. If the aircraft is ever found, the black boxes, the cockpit voice recorder, and the flight data recorder might be able to at least eliminate some scenarios. It may not ultimately determine why an individual might have done this, but it could exclude the possibility that there was some sort of mechanical failure or other factor involved here. You know, 10 years underwater at depth that will be some test of the technology of these so-called black boxes. But if -- if the searchers could ever locate the wreckage and see it, understand how it might have broken apart or not, and what is in those boxes, that could finally get us to a point where we can say something more definitively.",

      "sentences": "We've seen sort of false starts when it comes to a new expansive search for the plane. Malaysian authorities recently indicated they could be open to a new surge. What would you say is the likelihood that we see one?O'BRIEN: I think -- I think one is brewing here. I think there's a lot of pressure right now to re-engage. There is new technology. After all, 10 years have passed here. And I got to tell you, if you'd asked me 10 years in a day ago whether a triple seven could go missing like this, I would have said you're crazy, Boris. And so here we are 10 years later, a 777 is still missing. The technology for finding things underwater has progressed dramatically. This company, which would like to do one of these \"no- find, no-fee\" searches, but still needs permission to do that, is ready to try this new fleet of autonomous underwater vehicles to attempt to find the wreckage. And there is a theory out there by an aerospace analyst and physicist, Richard Godfrey, which comes up with an interesting scenario based on disturbance patterns in ham radio signals, which leads him to believe that the previous searches had been in the wrong place. Obviously, they'd been in the wrong place. But they've been way off. And that there is a location about 1,200 miles due west of Perth, Australia, where he believes this new data might lead to a finding. So if nothing else, they've got at a run that one down, I think.",
