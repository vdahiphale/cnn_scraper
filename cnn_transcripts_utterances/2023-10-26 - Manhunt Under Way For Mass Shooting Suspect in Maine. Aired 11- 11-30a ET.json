Our hearts go out to everyone who has impacted as a result of this senseless violence. The FBI is working hand in hand with our law enforcement partners. Our evidence response team is here processing these very extensive scenes. We are providing investigative and tactical support, as well as our victim specialists are working with those affected by this tragedy. As this very active investigation continues to unfold, we are asking the public to stay vigilant and come forward with any information that you might have that you feel is helpful to our investigators. My pledge is that the FBI will carry out this investigative case with rigor. We will work day and night alongside our law enforcement partners to get the answers to the questions this community deserves.

What can we do for the state of Maine? So we are now prepared to try to take a few questions.

But, second -- and this would be the top priority -- is the manhunt, where they have devoted the largest number of people and resources, because it appears that, from hitting the two locations -- and when the commissioner was asked specifically why those places, he said, well, that goes to motive, which suggests -- it doesn't state implicitly, but it suggests that he picked those two places for a reason, that there was some connection either between him and those places or those people.",

But the details are lacking. And that's probably by design, for one of two reasons. One, either they just don't have the information or they're following up on investigative leads, and they don't want to reveal what their approach and methodology is going to be to address this. But when you're addressing the public, you need to reassure them, right? And I think the number one thing that community is looking for right now are, are people safe? We heard limited reassurance that the community is safe, but we do know that there's a large-scale mobilization of law enforcement, both state, federal, and local, that are addressing this situation. But I think that people want to hear, what specific actions are being taken? What is the area of operation even broadly that they're looking at? Do they think that the suspect is in the community or did they flee? Commissioner Miller pointed out a really good point here, which is, based upon multiple shootings over time and distance and the fact that the shooter was able to evade police, shows that there is a more sophisticated level of planning that went into this attack, and, more importantly, how the suspect is evading police. We need to understand, what are those resources that are being applied by law enforcement right now to address this suspect, who is now on the run for well over 12 hours?",

And we know that there's a shelter-in-place for Lewiston, Lisbon, and Bowdoin. Bowdoin is where the suspect is from.
