Coming to you live from New York, it is Tuesday, May 16th. I'm Zain Asher, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, Thailand's opposition parties are in talks to form a new government after huge election wins this weekend. The populist party says it is letting the Move Forward Party lead that effort. It's a crushing blow to Thailand's military-backed establishment. The incumbent prime minister spoke earlier. He thanked his supporters and said he will stay on until a new government is formed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GEN. PRAYUTH CHAN-OCHA, THAI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): Today, we all know that we have had an election that's been held according to the democratic process. I would like to thank the people for coming out to vote. I would like to congratulate every political party that received votes from the people. From now on, the formation of the new government will be in process. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so in light of that, what you've been having over the last several days since the President met with those congressional leaders last week, is staff sitting down to try and define the contours of negotiations, to try and figure out where there are potential areas of agreement and some areas of agreement certainly have emerged. And that is, in particular, as it relates to the White House recognizing that they are going to need to agree to some spending cuts, potentially caps on spending. There are also some agreements on clawing back some of those unused COVID funds. But there are still some contentious points. One of those is on this issue of work requirements for some of these social benefit programs, and the President, keeping the door open to working with Republicans on some of those but also drawing a line it appears on anything that would have -- that would touch on Medicaid, which would impact health insurance coverage for individuals. So there is a lot to get done in a very short period of time and that is also why we just heard the White House's national security spokesman, John Kirby say that the president is leaving tomorrow for Japan for this G7 Summit. But where he is potentially canceling is the second leg of his trip to Papua New Guinea and to Australia. John Kirby told me that they are considering canceling that second leg of the trip. I asked what the message is that that sends, especially at a time when the US is trying to really carve out a space leading in the Indo Pacific and he said that it shows that the president is someone who's concerned about this potential for default and that he is ensuring that the US will meet its obligations. That is ultimately the message that he is leaving with the world. But we will see if indeed that second portion of the trip is canceled. They have yet to confirm that officially -- Zain.",

The open letter was signed by nearly 150 CEOs from a wide variety of companies. It is addressed to the President and top lawmakers from both parties.

One is the fact that our financial system is undergoing some stresses and strains. There is an old line that when the Fed slams on the brakes, somebody goes through the windshield, and you've had three banks go through the windshield in the past six weeks or so. And so the financial system is under some pressure from these rising interest rates, and something, a debt default would simply exacerbate that. And then secondly, as you did note, the economy is doing reasonably well. We're still growing, we had a somewhat positive first quarter GDP number, it wasn't off the charts great, but it was always positive. We still have many employers trying to fill jobs and finding it hard to find enough workers. You still have consumer spending money with reasonable bank accounts. But all of that is against the backdrop of these rising interest rates, of house prices that are either flat or falling, and of consumers that are starting to go through some of their savings and savings rate is quite low at the moment.

And as rates went up, the value of the bonds that banks were sitting on, they went down, and that caused massive losses at Silicon Valley Bank. Now, Becker pointed out that, you know, the message from the Fed during 2020 and much of 2021 was that rates would probably stay low, and that inflation was transitory. Of course, we knew that there was a risk that inflation was not going to be transitory, and it wasn't, and that rates would have to go up and they did.

And so lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, they asked the executives whether or not they plan to return this money and no one committed to doing that. And really, this added some momentum behind Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren's bipartisan bill that she has with Republican Josh Hawley, which would actually give regulators new powers to claw back compensation from bank executives at banks that have failed. Elizabeth Warren said that her bill would try to sort of take away some of the incentive for bank CEOs to, you know, blow up their banks and risk the entire economy. We'll see if today's hearing is enough to get that bipartisan bill and any other new regulation through Congress -- Zain.",

They are not going to figure this out over the course of three or four hours. There are so many issues. They touched on a lot of them today. Of course, the big one is jobs. How is AI going to replace a lot of people's jobs? Sam Altman said he is confident that it will replace a lot of jobs. But it will improve the quality of some jobs. And it will create new jobs, very much describing this at a technological revolution, saying just as previous technological revolutions have replaced jobs and created new ones, some will. This Also talk about how we have seen the deepfakes, fake audio; how this might be used in elections here in the U.S. and around the world. They also spoke about the national security threat of this, how AI can be used, whether it is disinformation campaigns or elsewhere. Another thing that came up was the music industry. We have seen recording artists are having their voices faked. People are able to create their voices and create new songs that make it sound like these artists have released songs. There are questions there about copyright and compensation. So many issues to break down there. But what Sam Altman said today was, look, this is technology that is very powerful. He did not underplay how this could, potentially, be dangerous, as well. So it was a pretty informative hearing. But it barely scratches the surface of what needs to or what could be done.",
