The students are gathering to honor two young people who are gone too soon.22-year-old Laken Hope Riley, who attended a nearby school, was killed last week. Her body was found near a lake after she went for a jog on campus. Student Wyatt Banks is also being remembered. He died one day earlier on campus. CNN's Ryan Young is at UGA in Athens, Georgia.

You can see some of the students who've spilled out after this has sort of wrapped up. There wasn't a dry eye. People were crying consistently for about a half hour, remembering their friends. Obviously, this has shattered a lot of the peace that they had when it comes to this university. People say they can't imagine running some of these trails that they used to run, feeling as free as they did.And you can understand the pain they're kind of going through. A lot of these young people have said off camera that this is the first time they've ever had a loss like this one. And to have two back to back like this really has a lot of them just sort of questioning what's going on. And there was a lot of talk about faith during this memorial, sort of. And so you can see the students who are pouring out. In fact, as far as the eye could see, you could see students lined up, mostly standing in silence. They played music. When you talk about Laken Riley, some of her other nursing students from her school showed up here all in their blue coats standing. You got to remember, she was an honor roll student. There's still so many questions about this case in terms of the fact that she went for a jog and then all of a sudden she's tried to call 9-1-1. And at that point, she was being attacked. Listen to her sorority president talk about her life just a moment ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We're praying for you and thinking of you and we will be here for you always. Campus is really heavy right now. We're all heartbroken. I want to use this time to tell you about Laken and all she was to Alpha Chi. It is so obvious to me why it feels so dark right now, and that is because we lost one of the brightest lights that there's ever been. This campus and our sisterhood will never be the same without Laken Reilly. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Apparently she loved sweet treats and loved going for that run.There's also this idea of service and the fact that she wanted to serve her community and make this place a better world. And that's why she wanted to be a nurse. So you felt that impact, especially with all these people who want to be health care workers who are lining up around this service, who also still want to help people on a day to day basis. And when it comes to the questions about what happened on that trail, that's what so many people are sort of concerned about. The fact that she was killed by blunt force trauma. We do know the police chief said they did not know each other. And this was a crime of opportunity. That's not satisfying a lot of people because obviously they want to know more. We know a camera network was in place to sort of help police make that arrest. Jose Ibarra, who's 26, we know he's a non-citizen. So students on top of that want more security here on campus. But right now they're holding hands. They're crying. They're trying to come together because obviously this is something that many of them will never forget for the rest of their lives. This is the largest university in the state of Georgia. It's the premier university here. So you can understand so many eyes across the state are on this. We know resources have been pouring in to make sure this is investigated thoroughly. But still, at the same time, there's a family outreach here where people are concerned not only about her family, but her sisters and the fellow nurses who all kind of walked out here together holding hands at the end of this moving memorial service -- Boris.",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, that city of 22 million people lives on top of an ancient lakebed, high-altitude lakebed, that underground is the aquifer that provides about 60 percent of the water to Mexico.  They have been pumping that aquifer so relentlessly. The city is sinking at about a foot and a half a year, adding to the infrastructure headaches that's happening. The other 40 percent of their water is piped, often uphill, andofficials say they lose about 40 percent to leaky infrastructure there as well. You add all of those sort of generational infrastructure problems on top of a climate crisis now, in which the water cycle has run amok, and here we are. They say there will be no day zero like they had in Cape Town, South Africa in 2018. That city relying pretty much on one source of water, on desalination. There are multiple sources in Mexico City here, but now it's the haves or the have-nots, like the woman you see on your screen. Folks who are forced, they're breaking the law by dipping water down, buckets down, to pull out of underground water systems there as well, but they have no other choice. They can't afford the $100, $200 water truck that comes by periodically. The wealthier neighborhoods in Mexico City are not feeling this as much. As for the officials, CONAGUA, the National Water Service, refused our request for comments. They did say on their website they have a three- year project, that they're updating their systems, digging more wells. The president of Mexico in recent years has even called for the big breweries, Mexican breweries so popular in the United States and other places, to move further south, away from the very arid north, into places like Mexico City, but now they have their own water crisis there as well. They say any warnings of a day zero in Mexico City are, quote, fake news. Local politicians are saying sort of ginned up by the opposition in an election year. But water experts that we talked to are really concerned that at the current status quo, they could reach a point of dire water emergency in that massive North American city.",

Because in a concrete and asphalt city like that, the aquifer is not getting recharged. That may have to change a little bit.

They show how he promoted a far more aggressive strategy than he later told investigators.And now we were able to link this anonymous account. It was called a \"badger pundit\" to Chesebro. Based on various details, we found that matched his biography and his lawyers then later admitted to CNN that Chesebro was behind it. And I want to walk people through some of the contradictions here. Here is a really important one. Chesebro told Michigan investigators that he only wanted electors as a contingency so that if Trump won these court cases, winning a state, then that state would still have Trump electors that were available on January 6th when Congress certifies the vote. So here's what he told investigators about that. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
