Not so many answers from the White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who repeatedly returned to a couple of notions saying that the President's team did the right thing here in discovering the documents and ultimately disclosing that immediately to the National Archives.And then she just repeatedly pointed back to the statement that the President made just yesterday. Here's a little bit of Karine Jean- Pierre trying to answer those questions today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: This is an ongoing process. You heard from the President, he spoke about this in detail yesterday, in front of -- on a world stage, in front of many of you who were there, in front of many of your colleagues. He laid out what he knew. He said that he seriously -- he takes this seriously when it comes to classified documents, when it comes to information that is classified. He was surprised to learn about the records had been there. And again, he believes that the lawyers did the right thing. And they immediately turned them over to the Archives. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But in terms of why those documents were there in the first place in this office, not where those classified documents are supposed to be, she did not provide any answers on that. She also wouldn't answer why it took so long to disclose the fact that these documents had been discovered and found.It emerged, of course, this week through news reports. And then the White House Counsel's Office ultimately explaining the process that happens here where they discovered these documents on November 2, alerted the National Archives, and handed over those documents. The White House did say in the same way that President Biden said yesterday that once this process plays out, that might be a time of for further details and further explanation. But we don't know when that will happen. We do know that the Department of Justice has been reviewing this situation, the U.S. Attorney base in Chicago. We also seem to know more about these classified documents than President Biden himself might even. He has not been -- he suggested that he's been asked -- he's been told not to ask what is in these documents. But we've reported, of course, that there -- these are 10 classified documents with classified briefing materials on countries such as Iran, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Ultimately here this is the story of the White House being very cautious as they watched this judicial review taking place and very concerned, of course, as well about the prospects, the possibility of a special counsel being appointed in this matter. We know that when special counsels are appointed to investigate at White House's, it rarely goes well ultimately for the President's currently sitting in the Oval Office.",

He's the author of, \"Compromised: Counterintelligence and the Threat of Donald J. Trump.\" Peter, great to see you. Obviously, different details between President Trump and President Biden but still the same problem, which is classified documents not being where they're supposed to be, and being mishandled. How concerning is this to you?",

      "sentences": "Well, I think it's certainly concerning. There are some similarities and there's some differences. I mean, look, anytime classified information is not stored appropriately, it presents a great deal of risk to all the different sources of information that the intelligence community might be running, whether that's human sources, signals, intercept capability, satellite capabilities, the sort of thing that provide vital information to the -- support the national security of the United States.It's supposed to be protected in a certain way. It shouldn't have been in the location that it was with President Biden. Now, the fact of the matter is, as sensitive as this information is almost on a daily basis, somewhere in the U.S. government, classified information is mishandled. [15:35:11] And where that becomes important is the reasons why it was mishandled. Is this something where somebody simply negligent, they didn't know that something was taken, they accidentally let something -- left something behind. They got it shuffled up in a mix of classified and unclassified papers, those sorts of things typically are handled in an administrative way. And again, they're unfortunately very, very common. Now, that's entirely different from a scenario where you have somebody, obviously, if they're trying to give that to a foreign power, but also if they know that they have this classified information. They know they shouldn't have it. They're taking methods to -- or taking steps to hide that from the authorities trying to obscure the fact that they have it. And that sort of intent and behavior behind this mishandling of classified information is really what's important to understand.",

President Biden is saying I'm not involved in whether or not he's been told not to be involved. He's letting the Department of the Justice and the FBI manage this independent of any sort of pressure from the White House.Two, this on the U.S. Attorney out of Chicago, who was a Trump appointee, to sort of oversee the look. Now, it is too early to tell. We don't know what the FBI and DOJ have found. But everything that has been made public so far, the fact that the Biden attorneys approach the Archives of this information, and it appears they've been very cooperative. And it appears that it's been limited to only 10 documents, that there's no indication of a foreign power leads me to believe that there won't be a special counsel appointed. But again, we don't know what we don't know at this point. But I would expect within the coming probably weeks to have some sort of answer about where this is going to go.",
