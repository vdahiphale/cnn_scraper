The violins listen to the cellos, and the cellos hear trumpets. Imagine if the world worked more like an orchestra. We would have a better world for sure. I was born in Caracas, Venezuela. I fell in love with music from my first class when I was 10. I went to the university studying conducting there, and I was working around Venezuela and around the world to teach orchestras and programs, and that`s how I came to Sweden. I came in 2015, and there was arriving so many refugees and asylum seekers. They were like completely lost. Music changed my life. I knew that. I know that. So in this moment, I know one solution. OK, one, two, and three, and four. Three and four. Dream Orchestra is open for anyone who wants to learn an instrument, especially families who are arriving to Sweden. All down, can we try it? Down. We teach different instruments at the same time, and we have from the very small kids to adults, and it`s an orchestra where the main language is music. Kids, parents, youth, more than 20 languages and more than 25 nationalities, and kids who are born here, we all need to learn from each other. My life is Dream Orchestra. I feel thankful to have them in my life, that we can play music together and help each other. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
