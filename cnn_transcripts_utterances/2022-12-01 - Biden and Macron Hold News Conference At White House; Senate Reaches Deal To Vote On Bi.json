So, as you saw, President Emmanuel Macron stood by President Biden in more ways than just wandering that joint news conference. I mean, they basically ended they're talking about their resolve, and I guess joined values in terms of the war in Ukraine.",

Let's now go to some of our correspondents we have with us. CNN's chief White House correspondent Phil Mattingly was there in the room but let's start with CNN's national security correspondent Kylie Atwood. And, Kylie, specifically on the war in Ukraine, Macron has been a very important partner with the U.S. in making sure that the Ukrainians have the support that they need to fight off this invasion.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's right. And the two leaders, President Biden and President Macron are really in lockstep when it comes to the need to continue support for Ukraine with President Macron pledging to provide more military and more economic assistance to Ukraine, President Biden, of course, doing that as well. And it's notable, however, that the two have approached President Putin in different ways, with Biden saying just there that he has no immediate plans to speak with President Putin. He would only do so if there was an indication that Putin wanted to discuss a way out of this war. And so far, there has been no such indication.Then, of course, you have Macron who has been in touch with Putin, but specifically on issues related to security in Ukraine when it comes to that nuclear plant in Zaporizhzhia specifically. He plans to continue doing that, but both of these leaders being very clear that they are not going to push Ukraine to make any concessions when it comes to any negotiation that would potentially lead them to lose anything when it comes to their sovereignty. I also think it's important to note out that President Biden was asked about those concerns -- those French concerns surrounding subsidies that are -- that were in the Inflation Reduction Act for American green companies. And what he said was that listen, he's not going to apologize for that major piece of legislation. But when you pass a big piece of legislation like that, in his words, there can be glitches. And so, there are things that the two countries can do to work together. He said it was never the U.S.'s intention to leave France out because they are such a close partner. So, it's very clear that they're trying to work through that, which has been a major issue for President Macron. And he has made no bones about it. He's been very open about the need to work on that issue so that France is undermined by that new legislation here in the United States.",

      "sentences": "I mean, I think you've had a good window into at least the most critical issues that they were discussing in that closed-door meeting. There is no question that when it comes to the most urgent consequential issues, Ukraine is certainly at the top of the list, both given what's happening on the ground and its general threat to Europe, both on a security side of things, but also on an energy side as well.I think Kylie hit a really critical issue, though, that President Macron made exceedingly clear in advance of that bilateral sit-down, was it A., a focal point for him and his top advisors, but B. was something that absolutely needed to be addressed in a relationship that is as close as both of the leaders have portrayed it as in the last several months. And that was on the issue of these subsidies, these kinds of protectionist subsidies, at least in terms of how the Europeans have viewed them. And I think what was interesting is that both Macron and President Biden made clear that there was a level of satisfaction with how that discussion went. There were no specific deadlines about when a resolution would come together, there was not necessarily tangible policy shifts that were put on the table, but given how stringent President Macron was in the lead-up to the meeting about the concerns how explicit he was about his frustrations, his willingness to say that he was fairly satisfied with how the conversation went was critical. And so, too was President Biden making clear that the by American -- the subsidy provisions that were in this -- Kylie kind of hit the nail on the head and pointing out the idea that there were glitches, making clear that they believe that there are pathways to address these very real concerns on an economic side of things. So, I really think those were two central discussions inside the meeting. You heard the leaders, guys, at the top of the press conference, they went through a litany of about 50 things and both acknowledged that we could have gotten much longer in terms of where the actual bilateral cooperation stands right now, but those are the most critical issues. And I think when it comes to Ukraine in particular, there have been differing approaches. On a 30,000-foot level, there is no question there is alignment. There's no question that goals are the same. [14:05:04] Approaches have been different, sometimes in subtle ways and sometimes in more explicit ways. I think there was very clear alignment on some of those divergences when it came to President Macron making explicitly clear that there would be no peace agreement or negotiations moving forward without Ukraine making clear they were the ones driving. There'll be nothing agreed to or nothing put on the table without Ukraine driving that idea itself. And then President Biden opening the door to speaking with President Putin, even though he's made clear there's no plans on it. There's certainly no schedule for that in the near term, but should President Putin come to the table and say there were discussions that he wanted to have President Biden said he was willing to do what President Macron is doing and that is to keep a line of communication open with President Putin. Obviously, there's no sense that that's coming anytime soon, but the president at least put it on the table, guys.",

      "sentences": "Well, look, I think it's really interesting because if you remember, President Trump had President Macron at the White House's first State Dinner. So, you know, it's a very interesting situation. In this case, back then Macron tried to -- try to convince Trump not to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, if you remember. Trump went ahead and did it. And now we're in deep, you know international problems between the U.S. and Iran. This time, Biden and Trump -- and Macron have to talk about the other big issues, which are, obviously, the transatlantic cooperation on Ukraine, and then the actual transatlantic cooperation between the United States and Europe, and even further on China.So, on Ukraine, President Macron has all along, tried to present himself as the open link if you like to President Putin while obviously condemning while standing shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the NATO allies and being very strong on that, there has always been a sense from him that somehow there might be an ability to bring the both sides to the table. That is not happening right now. I spoke to President Zelenskyy not so long ago, in the midst of all this Ukrainian suffering and the Russian missile attacks on the city. And he basically said people can try to push us wherever they want. We are not negotiating until Russian troops leave our territory. So, what they want is a lot more weapons and defensive weapons. And if this meeting leads to a lot more of that, then that'll be important. I, yesterday, spoke to the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. He was at a NATO meeting in Bucharest, and he said the same, we're trying to do as much as possible to help Ukraine. This is the key and fundamental issue that Europe and the United States have on their plate right now. I just spoke to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. And she chooses -- watching very closely, she says that the NATO, U.S., all its partners, including Israel must keep giving even more high-level defensive weapons to Ukraine. They need Iron Dome. They need -- you know all the anti-air defense systems that they can possibly get. Because democracy, the rule of law, human rights depends on Ukraine winning and Putin losing. So, that's the very clear moment. And then, of course, as you know, President Macron complained that the Biden administration was showing an aggressive protectionist approach to trade. And I think they've had to talk about that, as you heard from the press conference and others. And so, those are the issues on the table.",

That is significant because it needs -- required the support of all 100 senators to agree simply to schedule a vote. And that deal has been logged in. Meaning we are going to get to the final passage of this deal to avert a rail strike this afternoon. And assuming that gets 60 votes that will be approved, it'll be sent to Joe Biden's desk. Now, there is a process for this to happen. First, there will be an amendment by Republican Senator Dan Sullivan to actually delay the December 9th deadline where a strike would -- could occur if no deal is reached between the railways and the workers. That -- they're trying to delay that to December 9 deadline for two months. That is expected to fail also fall short of 60 votes.Then there's the issue of paid sick leave. This is what's been causing the hang-up for some time because the agreement between the rail workers and the union -- and the industry is silent on the issue of paid sick leave. Democrats and progressives like Bernie Sanders are demanding seven days of paid sick leave for workers. There's going to be an amendment to change the bill to include that paid sick leave. That is also expected to fail, fall short of the 60 votes needed. And then assuming those fail, they will move on to the final passage of the measure of the underlying agreement, sending it to Joe Biden's desk. Now, there is also a debate within not just the Republican Conference but also the Democratic caucus about whether to add paid sick leave. Moderates like Joe Manchin told me today they don't -- he doesn't believe that Congress should be dictating the terms of an agreement. While progressives like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, differ. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, (D-MA): On the one hand, we don't want to shut down the economy. On the other, we don't want to say to rail workers, if you have a heart attack or you break your leg, you either show up to work or you're going to lose your job. SEN. JOE MANCHIN, (D-WV): I'm very much concerned about us jumping into that when you have eight unions have agreed to the package that they negotiated with the Department of Labor and with the president. I'm very reluctant on the other for us to jump in and set a precedent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There may be a handful of Republicans who do vote for it. Josh Hawley of Missouri, a Republican, told me today he will vote for the issue of paid sick leave. But the question too will be how many Republicans ultimately vote for the underlying agreement.We do expect Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell to vote for this. He has been indicating this bill needs to pass to avert a rail strike next week. That would break from the House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, who voted against the plan yesterday and said saying it was surely the administration dealing with this issue, not Congress. But nevertheless, there is the expectation here that because of such dire consequences if Congress doesn't act, the Senate will get the votes, will pass this after a series of days of marathon negotiations. A very bumpy road but it looks like on track for passage, and just a matter of a couple of hours here, guys.",

And the median price is $3.31. And the most common is $2.99. So, that is good news. That's an extra $160 per family at the higher levels.

We -- you know, there's probably going to be bad days, but what we are seeing is what we all want to see which is a resilient economy where people keep working, where they keep spending, where they're strong, and at the same time, we start seeing that moderation of prices inflation.

And the Moscow police department for their investigation is saying that this was overall a targeted attack. I have been told that they are collecting evidence from the scene that is pertinent to this investigation that they cannot tell the public because it would compromise the investigation. But they are getting confidence about what progress that they're making. They're receiving tips. They are building a picture that allows them to believe that this was indeed targeted.
