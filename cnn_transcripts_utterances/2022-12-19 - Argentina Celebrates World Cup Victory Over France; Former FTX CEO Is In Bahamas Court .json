The Tesla and SpaceX founder tweeted earlier, should I step down as the Head of Twitter? You promised to honor the result, however unscientific the poll might be the answer, yes. More than 17 million votes were cast and 57 percent of respondents want Musk to step down.

DARCY: I think they want to see Elon Musk focus on Tesla. I mean, Tesla shares are down nearly 30 percent since Elon Musk bought Twitter, which is quite remarkable. Obviously, the economy in the market hasn't been so hot lately, but 30 percent is not something to bat your eyes at. And I think the issue with them is that for one, he's spending all his energy at Twitter. And they would like him, I think, focused on Tesla. And the other thing too, is that he's really doing some brand damage to the Tesla brand, which is really closely aligned with Elon's personal brand. And I think Elon's personal brand used to be this kind of edgy billionaire rocket scientist kind of guy who made electric cars, right. Now it's becoming more of a right wing troll on Twitter. And they're seeing this other side of Elon. So I think that's not really helping the company image as well. And so again, I think what you would want if you're a Tesla investor is Elon to get off of Twitter to stop sleeping on the couch at Twitter and to focus his energy on Tesla and let someone else lead the social media company on a day-by-day basis. KINKADE: Exactly moves the couch to Tesla. All right, we'll catch up with you again soon. Oliver Darcy thanks so much. DARCY: Thank you.",

And a source tells us that he is expected to drop his challenge to the extradition and hopefully move on to the U.S. quickly to face these charges. But my colleague who's been inside the courtroom, Patrick Altman is reporting that the lawyers for the Bahamian government and Bankman-Fried have been clashing inside, Bankman-Fried's lawyer saying he doesn't know why they're there. He has not been able to speak with his client. So after some of this back and forth, the judge has decided to take a recess to allow the local counsel for Bankman-Fried to meet with him so he can discuss what's going on and what their position is. You know, Bankman- Fried has attorneys in the U.S., he is local counsel in the Bahamas and he has been detained since last Tuesday in a Bahamian prison. So there was clearly some miscommunication here between them which they've taken a break to now try to sort out. But this has this is a big change when Bankman-Fried was in court last Tuesday after he was arrested the previous night. His lawyer said that they would fight extradition to the U.S. He was denied bail and he was not expected to appear back in court until February. But he's clearly had a change. He has spent nearly a week in a Bahamian prison, known as Fox Hill. It has a notorious rubber reputation. The U.S. State Department has issued reports where it says that there is poor nutrition that the cells are often filled with insects, rodents and that there's little access to medical care. So that may have been something that factored into his decision to no longer fight extradition. So once this court hearing resumes, we'll see where it goes from there. But the plan at least heading into today is that he's going to waive extradition and then would likely return to the U.S. fairly quickly to face these charges, Lynda.",

POLGLASE (voice over): She says the Iranian authorities had obtained these chats despite not yet having Negin's phone. She believes they hacked her account and she now faces six years in jail. While in prison, the Iranian authorities reactivated Negin's telegram account. She says it was to see who tried to contact her and reveal the network of activists she was in touch with. And the same tactic may have been used with Nika's telegram account. As weeks after her death, two of her friends noticed her account was back online. It disappeared shortly after. Nika's family is still reeling from her death. One close family member told CNN authorities are still refusing to return her phone. The Iranian authorities have not responded to CNN's request for comment. While Meta said they couldn't share specifics on Nika's account, but they confirmed they did not originally disable it. Telegram told CNN in every case they had investigated the device had been confiscated. Or the user had unwittingly made such access possible by not setting a two-step verification password or using a malicious app impersonating telegram. Still, questions remain as to whether Meta telegram and other tech companies are doing all they can to protect their users as the world wakes up to the increasingly tech savvy ways regimes such as Iran are using to monitor and hunt down activists.

So the numbers we're talking about here are vast and telegram as well. It's an encrypted platform. It's been used a lot by activists to organize this movement, galvanized support behind the protesters. So the platforms we're talking about in this investigation are very prevalent. They're very popular, in fact. And I think it's important to note that the fact that these are encrypted, the fact users believe these are secure platforms for them to be talking for them to be organizing these protests, makes any kind of evidence any indication the Iranian government is able to access them incredibly concerning. Now, it's worth noting telegram did offer us some advice when we approached them for this investigation. They said that often when accounts had been compromised, when they investigated the cases, they found that it was because users did not have two step verification on. Now what that means is you need to receive a code but also a password. And it's the two together that keep your account safe when you activate it. But the fact that these kinds of measures are in place, the fact that these need to be taken into account, while useful and very important for users to be taking into account. It does sort of raise the larger question as to how these tech companies can continue to protect their users, given how sophisticated the ways in which the Iranian government is now managing to access people's devices and even their social media accounts.",
