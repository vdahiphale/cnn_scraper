The lawyers say that 30 firms were approached and citing a broker who says the finding - that finding an insurer is \"a practical impossibility.\"Last autumn, the judge found that Trump and his organization was liable for fraud, conspiracy and issuing false business records.

Gov. Greg Abbott signed it into law amid a record surge in border crossings and a heated national debate on what to do about it. The Supreme Court's temporary freeze on the law will expire later this afternoon.So let's talk about this now with a Democrat who represents a Texas border district, Congressman Vicente Gonzalez. Congressman, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us. You - just to tell our viewers - supported the bipartisan border deal that Republicans killed in Congress. First off, regardless of who is at fault for that lack of action, Texas, as you know, has to deal with it. It is really ground zero for the border crisis. Are you surprised that your state would take matters into its own hands when Congress has been unable to come together and act? REP. VICENTE GONZALEZ (D-TX): Well, I'm surprised that the state of Texas is not working closer with Border Patrol and CBP and the federal government and trying to work in the same effort on our southern border. Clearly, there's a lot more that we can do on the southern border. I've been one of the most critical Democrats on the southern border for the last eight years, both under the Donald Trump administration and now under President Biden. So we had a great bill, a bipartisan bill, that would have helped alleviate a lot of the problems on our border. We would have had 1,100 new Border Patrol agents, 4,300 new asylum officers, over a hundred new immigration judges, which would have expedited the processing and removal of migrants and they were all killed. This proposition that would have helped - it's what Republicans have been crying for, for a very long time. And when we finally had a bill that was a bipartisan bill that could have fixed things, their daddy, President Trump, came in and told them to kill it and it got killed.",

First of all, it's unconstitutional, but it would set a very dangerous precedent to have states acting as lone wolves trying to create border immigration laws. So what I suggest to the Border Patrol and every other federal agency is let's work with states and all the states in securing our southern border, and let's create policy in Washington that stops migration from coming to our southern border and that's what we had.We had a proposal that would do just that and it was killed by the Republicans. And it's sad because I think this is an issue that is not a Democratic problem or a Republican problem. It's an American problem, and it requires bipartisan solutions.",

American citizens that feel that they need to carry their passports with them because they live in some rural area or someplace in the state where there's not a lot of Latinos, where they're concerned that people are going to - they're going to be profiled, they're going to be pulled over and harassed.

And I think Americans should be concerned. And I think Latinos should be very concerned and aware of what's coming out. Because this is - he says it, and then a large vast part of the Republican Party continues to parrot those remarks. And I think it puts Latino Americans at a real disadvantage and it puts targets on our back.

True, he was talking about China and the auto industry, and then he said, but that'll be the least of it. So it's easy to interpret that, that there will be more of a bloodbath elsewhere. So that's how I interpreted his remarks. And frankly, the other thing he said, too, that nobody's talking about, a hundred percent tariff on a product coming in from Mexico? I mean, talk about inflationary. That's just - it's just a ridiculous idea, but we don't even take the policy seriously anymore when he says anything.
