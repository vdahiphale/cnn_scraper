It's been one of the deadliest days yet and the war in Gaza as the pope calls for a ceasefire and the release of hostages. Thousands of migrants are joining a caravan headed towards the U.S. as local authorities warn they can't handle the surge. And Richard Quest speaks to the chef behind Half Baked Harvest about what foods to bring to the holiday celebration this Christmas.Well, as billions of people across the globe celebrate Christmas, it is turning out to be one of the deadliest days in the Israel Hamas war, at least 250 people were killed in central Gaza over the past 24 hours, according to the Hamas controlled health ministry. This comes as the Israeli Prime Minister warns that the violence is far from over. Benjamin Netanyahu once again vowed what he says will be a long fight that is not close to ending after returning from Gaza earlier. Meanwhile, one Palestinian man whose grandchildren were killed in an Israeli airstrike last month spoke to CNN about his frustration and anger with the daily death toll. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KHALED NABHAN, GAZA RESIDENT (through translator): This is utmost criminality. We're in festivities celebrating Jesus Christ, peace be upon him. People talk about human rights Mercy, the Security Council, the Red Cross and humanity. Where are these human rights? There are tens of dead bodies 50, 80 bodies? Why? (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's one question. Another question is what will Hamas agree to Israel had seemed to propose at least a week of cessation in fighting and return for some of these hostages? Hamas has turned that down.We talk about the Al Maghazi strike. Do we know the IDF says that they are investigating it right now? Do we know at this point, Will, who they were targeting? RIPLEY: Well, what Israel is saying is that all of these strikes in all of these specific areas are based on intelligence on the ground. They say they have an extensive intelligence network inside Gaza that lets them know where Hamas is operating. For example, let's take that tunnel complex that was destroyed just a few days ago, where the bodies of five Israeli hostages, three soldiers, two civilians were recovered. They received intelligence that this underground tunnel complex was housing command centers, weapons depots, bunkers, living quarters of senior Hamas leadership. And so they -- it was intelligence that brought them to that site, a site that was located very close to a mosque and a school and a community center, places where people were congregating, places where people were sheltering, they did receive notices that they needed to leave the area, but that that was eventually destroyed. And so Israel says its objectives are changing constantly based upon what their intelligence is telling them. But Hamas is constantly on the move as well. They do have what's believed to be an extensive underground network of tunnels. The Israeli military has destroyed some of them, but certainly not all of them there are more hidden under every corner of Gaza. And it is believed that that is, you know, many houses and neighborhoods might have weapons stashed in them in different places, and members of Hamas, who know these communities, know these streets, in and out certainly much better than the Israeli soldiers, even with their intelligence. They know where they can go in and get what they need, and then get back out many of them Israel says disguised as civilians. This is the reality of the battle that is being fought. It is incredibly dangerous. It is incredibly destructive. And it is incredibly tragic because there are so many people. Thousands of children, thousands of innocent people who've been killed. But again, back to the beginning of what I said to you, Bianna, the Israeli say this is a war. It's an unprecedented war, a war that they are determined to fight to the end.",

Adding this particular colony is one of the most remote with conditions known to be harsh and restricted contact with detainees. Navalny was sentenced back in August of this year to 19 years in prison after he was found guilty of extremism related charges. He'd already been serving sentences of 11 and a half years and a maximum security facility on fraud and other charges. It was believed to be held at a penal colony 150 miles east of Moscow until now. These are charges he and his legal representatives have consistently denied supporters believe his arrest and incarceration are a politically motivated attempt to stifle his criticism of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Navalny has of course pose one of the most serious threats to Putin's legitimacy during his role known for organizing anti-government street protests and using his blog and social media to expose alleged corruption in the Kremlin. His incarceration has drawn widespread international condemnation, the White House earlier this month reiterating its call for no volleys immediate release. Nada Bashir, CNN in London.

And he was pretty senior. And you could tell that in part by the fact that the President of Iran issued a statement vowing to avenge his death today. I think the biggest concern that comes out of this is that the United States and others have been trying to do everything they could to keep the northern border with Israel quiet while the war rages on in Gaza. And that, of course, means Hezbollah, which is another Iranian proxy for sort of least Iranian backed. And I think there's a lot of concern now that this could lead to an eruption there.

It's interesting that that Prime Minister Netanyahu went to Gaza today.But even more concerning is that we now are seeing Iran act on many different fronts. Right? There are the attacks in the Red Sea against shipping done by the Houthi who are Iranian backed. There's the issues going on in the -- from Lebanon and of course, look concerns about the West Bank with another Iranian backed group. And then Iran directly struck if you believe the Pentagon's account, a chemical tanker off of the coast of India that had some vague Israel links just a few days ago.

The IDF also, for the first time, it appears that has released a specific figure in terms of how many Hamas members or fighters have been killed thus far. And they put that figure close to 8,000.

All those shiny spots you see behind me are mylar blankets and border patrol agents have provided them, and it appears this new migrants search is going to go on for a while longer. There's a new caravan, the one that you were mentioning at the beginning that departed on Christmas Eve from the border city of Tapachula, Mexico at the border with Guatemala. We're talking about thousands of migrants who will be here at the U.S. southern border in the next few weeks. In addition to the ones that have already arrived here. We're in Eagle Pass, Texas, and right at the border with Mexico. This is a community of less than 30,000 people that has to deal with thousands of immigrants arriving every week.
