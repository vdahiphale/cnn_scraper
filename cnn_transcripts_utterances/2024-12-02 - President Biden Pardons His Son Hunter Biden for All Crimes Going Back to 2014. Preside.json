Well, he did it. And we're getting new reaction from Democrats and Republicans this morning. The outrage machine is in overdrive. This could easily have an impact on Donald Trump's nominations and pardons he might soon issue. Think January sixth. In a written statement, President Biden said, quote, \"Here's thetruth. I believe in the justice system. But as I've wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and led to a miscarriage of justice. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.\" Now, this not only means Hunter Biden will not be sentenced this month -- he was scheduled to be -- but he was also granted clemency for any other federal crime he might have committed during a 10-year period. That seems to be a relatively unprecedented move. CNN's Arlette Saenz is in Angola, where the president arrived shortly. So, Arlette, walk us through what you're hearing from White House insiders about why this decision was made now.",

      "sentences": "Well, John, President Biden issued this full and unconditional pardon of his son Hunter Biden, a stunning reversal after for months both Biden and senior officials had said that he would not make this move. Now, President Biden made this decision over the Thanksgiving holiday as he was spending time with the first lady and his son, Hunter, in Nantucket, Massachusetts. And I'm told that the president began informing his senior staff of his decision on Saturday evening.The president actually called a meeting with senior aides, some in person, but most by the phone, where he told them that he had made this decision, and also asked them to begin preparing a statement for release on Sunday. The senior team then huddled together again on Sunday morning to iron out the details of this stunning announcement. For President Biden, he is really approaching this from the view of a father, saying that he believes that his son has been unfairly treated in this process, but he's also expressed some concerns about the way that these charges were brought. He believes that a lot of it was politically motivated. And in a statement that was released last night, the president said, quote, \"There has been an effort to break Hunter, who has been five- and-a-half years sober even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter they've tried to break me, and there's no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.\" Now, this comes just a few months after President Biden, before and after Hunter's felony gun convictions, had said that he would not pardon his son. Take a listen to some of those moments from earlier this year. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But what's different about this one is it also says this is a full and unconditional pardon for all conduct going back to January 1st of 2014, which means Hunter Biden cannot be federally prosecuted for anything going back to 2014, and really before then, because before then is going to be precluded by the statute of limitations.And as you said before, the only historical precedent, the best historical precedent for this is the pardon of Richard Nixon by Gerald Ford, which has similar language that says, \"full and unconditional pardon.\" So Joe Biden has pushed to the absolute outer limits of the breadth of the pardon power here.",

Biden is not here. He called it a miscarriage of justice, that Hunter Biden was unfairly singled out, which is something that we have heard Donald Trump lean into before in targeting the Justice Department and the so-called deep state. Does Biden in this move here give Donald Trump new cover for whatever pardon action he decides to take in the future?",

Now we get to do the same thing, which is sort of an interesting twist of logic there. But without question.I mean, look, there has long been a fair debate, fair on both sides, about whether Hunter Biden is being treated overly leniently or overly zealously because of his status as Joe Biden's son. I think there are points to both sides of that. But what I think is not disputable is that this is a historic act of political nepotism. This is the granting of a pardon by the president to his son. Joe Biden even says, if you really parse his statement, he acknowledges that a substantial part of this is because Hunter Biden is his son. And that will land Joe Biden on a historic list that he probably doesn't want to be a part of, along with Bill Clinton, who pardoned his half-brother Roger Clinton, along with Donald Trump, who pardoned Charles Kushner who is the father of his own son-in-law, Jared Kushner. So I'm sure Joe Biden understands the historic implications of what he's done, and now he's earned his way onto that list.",

I respect the jury's verdict. Well, now he's gone back on that.I don't know how many people actually believed him. I certainly didn't. There's tape of me saying there's no way he's going to make good on this. He's absolutely going to pardon Hunter Biden. But as to whether this tarnishes the justice system, I don't think I would go that far. [08:10:00] I think this, like I said, will go down on the list of ignominious presidential pardons. But I don't think law students 50 or 100 years from now are going to look back at this as a horrific miscarriage of justice that undermines the foundation of our justice system.

That is even bigger than the previous big number we saw back on July 7th, which was about 3.01 million. So, we're about 70,000 people higher than where we were at the previous record.This really fits into the theme of a huge year for air travel. The TSA says the top ten days it has seen in all of its time, in all of its existence since 2002 have all happened in the year of 2004. Things will not be so smooth totally. Today, is about to be another big day for air travel. TSA anticipating about 2.8 million people screened at security checkpoints at airports nationwide and the FAA is warning of possible ground stops. Newark has been a particular pain point for the FAA because of air traffic controller staffing issues, and the FAA says as the day progresses, it may put into place a ground stop or a delay program for flights going into Newark to try and alleviate some of that pressure on the air traffic controllers there. The FAA also says there could be ground stops and delays for flights going into Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, SEATAC, because of low cloud ceilings there. Also, we could see problems as the day progresses in Naples, Florida, and in Palm Beach. Today is going to be a huge day for travel, no matter how you slice it. AAA actually extended its holiday travel forecast, its Thanksgiving Holiday travel forecast, which used to be five days; now, it is seven days and it includes Monday for the first time ever. AAA said about 80 million people will travel 50 miles or more, 70 million of them driving. So, the bottom line here is if you can get an early start, do it. The worst time to drive between about 8:00 AM on the East Coast now until about 6:00 PM. You can maybe wait till 7:00 PM or after AAA says, that's the best time to go. The big problem here is that not only is this a travel day over the Thanksgiving rush. The end of the Thanksgiving rush typically is hug when people come home but also, it's mixing with normal commuting traffic, people going back to work today, making it especially hard for people out there on the roads.",
