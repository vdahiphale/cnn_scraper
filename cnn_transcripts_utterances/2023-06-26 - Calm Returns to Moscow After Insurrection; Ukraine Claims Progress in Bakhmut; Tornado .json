Just ahead on \"CNN Newsroom,\" an uneasy calm settle over the streets of Moscow just days after an armed insurrection that ended as quickly as it started. Big questions remain about Putin's grip on power.The short-term revolt in Russia could have long-term effects on the country's war in Ukraine. How Kiev is looking to capitalize on the chaos? And after staying largely silent as the insurrection played out, Beijing voices its support for the Kremlin. Good to have you with us. Well, questions and uncertainty are hanging over Russia at this hour after an armed insurrection over the weekend rattled the country and its leader, exposing what some call cracks in Vladimir Putin's 23-year rule. The streets are quiet now, but anxiety gripped the city Saturday after Wagner Group mercenaries marched toward Moscow. A Minsk-brokered deal brought an abrupt end to the uprising and the whereabouts of Wagner Group head, Yevgeny Prigozhin, remains a mystery right now. Prigozhin's news service tells CNN he will answer questions when he has, quote, \"proper communication.\" One thing is clear, the insurrection marks the most serious threat we have seen to Putin's rule. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  This is just an added chapter to a very, very bad book that Putin has written for Russia. But what's so striking about it is it's internal. The fact that you have from within someone directly questioning Putin's authority, directly questioning the premises that upon which he launched this aggression against Ukraine. That in and of itself is something very, very powerful. It adds cracks. Where those go? When they get there? Too soon to say. But it clearly raises new questions that Putin has to deal with.

      "sentences": "Yeah, radio silence, Rosemary, from President Putin since he made that angry Saturday morning address promising inevitable punishment for those responsible. The rebellion punishment didn't, of course, materialize when the deal to send Prigozhin to Belarus and cancel all the charges against him was later announced by Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, not the president himself.Interesting also that state media aired a pre-insurrection interview with President Putin on Sunday, taped on Wednesday last week, where he essentially said that his day starts and ends with the special military operation, really trying to show that he is still in control of the situation. Not -- no public statements either from the military top brass, General Gerasimov, the head of the armed forces and the operation in Ukraine, and Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister, the so-called evil leadership, as Prigozhin put it, the march for justice, as he called it, was designed to stop. However, this morning, the Russian Ministry of Defense has put out video saying that Sergei Shoigu, the defense minister, did visit the zone of the special military operation, the western group of troops there. They did not, however, say when, and we cannot, of course, verify this video, but perhaps he is, you know, essentially trying to play Prigozhin at his own game. Prigozhin is seen many times on the front line, and he has criticized, of course, the Russian military leadership for being out of touch. As for Prigozhin himself, as Matthew pointed out, he has said that he would be back in touch with the media when he has proper communication. There is no indication as of yet that he has actually accepted that exile in Belarus.",

Both President Putin and Dmitry Peskov, his spokesman, essentially called the Wagner fighters responsible for what they called the liberation of Bakhmut. Soledar called them heroes.And the head of the state of Duma Committee for Defense gave an interview to a Russian newspaper paper on Sunday where he said, look, why would we disband this group? They are the most combat-ready part of the Russian forces. He said to disarm and disperse them, you couldn't think of a better gift for NATO and the Ukrainians. I think it's also significant that Prigozhin is apparently being sent to Belarus, which is where Russia staged part of its initial invasion of Ukraine, continues to do a lot of military exercises. You know, it's planning to put nukes in Belarus. They could have sent him to somewhere much further away from the zone of the special military operation. But I think there are also questions for Prigozhin himself having led his fighters on this march towards Moscow only then to abort the mission. There may be questions for his leadership of this group going forward as well, Rosemary.",

While Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was on the rampage against his foes in Moscow, officials in Kiev were largely silent, following Napoleon's advice never to interrupt your enemy while he's making a mistake. Briefly, many Ukrainians entertained the hope that civil war or chaosin Russia would lead to an early end to the war. But Prigozhin said an about face dash to those hopes. Sunday, Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said in an interview, he was hoping for something more concrete, perhaps a civil war in Russia. He said he was still confident that will eventually happen. While attention was diverted away from the front, the fighting went on. Sunday, Ukrainian officials claimed their forces had ceased a kilometer, a kilometer stretch of trenches near Bakhmut. They said they had killed, wounded or captured an entire battalion, though they didn't give exact numbers. It was a limited tactical success. The much-anticipated counteroffensive has yet to hit its stride. I'm Ben Wedeman, CNN, reporting from Zaporizhzhia.",

      "sentences": "First of all, it's not necessarily true that Prigozhin will completely stick to the agreement, to the political deal, which was achieved actually because Wagner is not just Prigozhin. These are several dozens of highly motivated and organized people who are armed, at least as of now. And the fact that the defense minister of Russia is going to incorporate most of these people into their regular Russian army, doesn't mean that this plan will be fulfilled.So, secondly, yes, Putin can try to eliminate Prigozhin physically because this is actually normal tactics of Russian Federation. They have been doing that to people with much less -- who made much less damage to the regime, and they did that on the territories of E.U. and NATO member states, as we remember, within next -- within last, sorry, five to six years. So, Prigozhin is not necessarily will have some kind of political -- real security on the territory of the Belarus. But basically, the question which is still unanswered and maybe will be not answered in the nearest future is actually whether someone from around Putin's elite supported currently the Prigozhin rebellion. Because actually the Prigozhin who was always insisting that he had not enough arms, that he had not enough weapons, he started such a huge operation, most probably having at least latent support or promised future support from someone who still have leverage and who is within the system around Mr. Putin on a much higher level than Prigozhin was, because Prigozhin is not a part of the bureaucratic system. And in Russia, as in authoritarian state, only people who have posts, who have positions in institutional system, they have much (inaudible) than anyone else. If that is true, if some of the people were really backing latently Prigozhin, it means that the story really is not ended yet.",

One signal to the foreign countries and to the foreign audience, which I explained already, that regime is not that kind of that it can't be defeated. It can be defeated and should be defeated. And there will be no actually survival of the state as everyone's theory. But on the other hand, there is a clear signal to political elites around Putin. Before this rebellion, there was a general impression that even if the elites are not satisfied with how the war in Ukraine is going up, but the price to oppose Putin might be much higher for them personally and for their people than just to stick to the official position. As of now, they see many cracks in the system, lack of influence on the side of Putin personally, because basically if part of the elite supported Prigozhin or did the same to a more effective way, then Putin's regime would collapse. It was very clear after these 24 hours when Prigozhin was moving and system was not able to do anything. And the main mistake of, or the main problem of Prigozhin actually was that he relied on a military rebellion in Moscow. And of course, trying to do that, you have to be much more capable in terms of logistics than just to have 10,000-armed people moving to Moscow because they can move there and that's all.",

And Prigozhin is the guy who now is turned around and turned on Putin. And that actually means a lot. Remember that the Wagner troops, those mercenaries that Prigozhin leads were formed in 2014 to help with Russia's invasion and annexation of parts of an occupation of parts of eastern Ukraine and Crimea.Then actually, they went on to Syria, where Putin was trying to expand influence in the Middle East, and they helped with the battle there. Then in 2016, Prigozhin's internet research agency, that was the big troll farm that actually, you know, invaded American social media on behalf of Trump and spread all kinds of misinformation and attempted to deepen racial divides on Trump's behalf. It may well -- Putin may well, using that internet region research agency among other agencies have tipped the election in Trump's favor.

President since its creation in 1994. He brooks little opposition. Dubbed Europe's last dictator, Lukashenko has come to be defined by his fealty to his powerful neighbor Russia's President Vladimir Putin. Transforming Belraus into a near vassal state.
