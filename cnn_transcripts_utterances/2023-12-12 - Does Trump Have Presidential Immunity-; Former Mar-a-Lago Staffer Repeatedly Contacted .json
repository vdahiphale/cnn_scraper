He did not give a total price tag about how much money ultimately will be needed from the United States to help his country beat back Russian aggression, but still wanted this money urgently, as the White House says it needs to happen this month, or you can't -- Ukraine could be at the risk of collapsing in its war against Russia.

People on the front lines we meet furious, frankly, angry that the money that's kept them alive, that kept them able to defend Ukraine may suddenly disappear potentially, and the results that could mean for their lives, potentially under Russian occupation going forwards. This is a key moment for Ukraine. Just today, we know of shelling in Kherson, the town in the south where we were just recently in tents there, dead and injured too, cell phone service across the country knocked out, the Ukrainian Security Services pointing towards a Russian cyberattack potentially behind that. Yesterday, missile attacks again towards the capital, fears that Ukraine's infrastructure as winter is here is being targeted. The front lines, yes, static to some degree, minor Ukrainian progress near Kherson on the other side of the river there, an unlikely advance, but an important one potentially, if it sees some progress, but, importantly, Russia on the front foot in the east near Avdiivka, moving towards another town. I think it's important just to point out finally, the U.S. argument they don't want to get dragged into another war here, well, the other argument is, the money they give Ukraine helps Ukraine do the fighting and not end up with Russian nearer NATO borders, dragging the U.S. potentially into a wider conflict in Europe, John.",

If you remember, Speaker McCarthy -- or former Speaker McCarthy had announced an inquiry was opened several months ago. This is simply a vote to formalize it. But there were a handful of Republicans running in districts where Biden won back in 2020 who were skeptical about moving forward with this impeachment inquiry and now say they believe it is an essential move to ensuring that they get the information they need for part of this investigation. In fact, our colleagues talked earlier today to Don Bacon, and our Haley Talbot sent this report that Bacon argued that this is an essential step, but he did not think it was inevitable that the House would eventually vote on articles of impeachment against Joe Biden. That, of course, is extremely important and an important point to make, because he argues it should be up to voters to decide if the committees find high crimes and misdemeanors. The speaker also addressed this issue earlier. Here's his argument for why this impeachment inquiry is crucial now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE JOHNSON (R-LA):  The impeachment inquiry is necessary now, as -- with -- Emmer just explained, because we have come to this impasse where following the facts where they lead is hitting a stone wall. We have no choice. To fulfill our constitutional responsibility, we have to take the next step. We're not making a political decision. It's not. It's a legal decision. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, of course, impeachment is a political process. It's really not a legal process.The impeachment inquiry, Republicans -- House Republicans have made a compelling case to impeach Hunter Biden. The problem is, of course, Hunter Biden's not a federal official, and Republicans have not yet demonstrated any real connection between Hunter Biden's misdeeds with his president -- with father, and did his father benefit in any way financially? They have not made that case. And this impeachment inquiry, it's kind of like a missile launch. Once you launch it, you really can't call back the missile. So once you launch the inquiry, it's likely that they will move to an actual impeachment at some point. So, as a political matter, I'm not sure it's helping Republicans very much. I'm sure this is very difficult for the president both emotionally and psychologically. But -- and, of course, if you're Joe Biden, you probably don't want this to be discussed over the next several months, because -- because of what his son had done in his business dealings. You probably don't want that aired all the time. But, at the end of the day, Americans are more concerned about the issues that affect them. And I can say that I don't think Hunter Biden really is affecting their lives in any meaningful way. So, again, at the end of the day, Republicans are probably better off, I think, focusing on other things, but they have made this decision and they're going forward.",

I don't think it had much of an impact at all in the election in 2020 for them. Same thing here with Republicans. I would -- if I were in one of those swing districts, I would rather not have to defend the inquiry into Hunter Biden. I think that would be an enormous problem for them. But at the same time, I don't think this is going to be the issue that most voters will be casting their vote for. It's not going to help them, but it may not hurt them as much as some people think.

He had moved boxes. He had overheard conversations that became part of the charges against Donald Trump and two others. And this employee left his job a little bit after the FBI search, when it became apparent there was an ongoing criminal investigation, and then shortly after got a call from Trump himself to his personal cell phone, something that rarely happened, where Trump found his cell phone number through one of his contacts, called him and asked him why he was leaving Mar-a-Lago. Later on, they had a nice, pleasant conversation, I'm told, and then Trump got word back to him that he was a good guy. That was just a blip on the radar of this person as he's leaving his job at Mar-a- Lago. But he had a couple other conversations that stuck out to him that he remembered as unusual, people talking to him about why he wasn't using a Trump-paid lawyer for his legal representation in the classified documents investigation as people were approaching him to speak to investigators. Wouldn't he want to have tickets to an upcoming Trump-sponsored golf tournament there, Donald Trump very well would like to see him, and then also repeated reminders that he could return to his job at Mar-a- Lago if he wanted to.",

In this case, it would be nice if the court weighed in.Let me ask you about something that has to do with your work a little bit on the January 6 Committee. We have learned that special counsel Jack Smith, his team might have a witness, might present evidence of Donald Trump's Twitter use, digital experts who can explain what he was writing and how he was using Twitter and exactly when on January 6. Why might that be relevant? AGANGA-WILLIAMS:  I think one thing they want to do is put that phone in the former president's hands. We know generally that sometimes the president used his Twitter account and others in his orbit did. Why it's critical for January 6 is because, during the attack, he was tweeting out. He -- when he was asked by Mark Meadows and others to tell the crowd to stand down, he didn't. He went to his Twitter, and he tweeted out basically more inflammatory language indicating that Vice President Pence didn't have the courage to do what was needed. If -- if Jack Smith can put that phone in the former president's hands, he's going to be showing criminal intent, because he will be able to put together both that the former president is watching the attack on television, which the committee showed. He's being asked by all those around him to ask these folks to stand down, and he's refusing. And then he's then tweeting out more inflammatory information. And what that does perhaps is show the intent to obstruct, the intent to inflame. And that's one of the charges, obstruction of a congressional proceeding.",
