Let's get some perspective now from CNN Political Analyst, Seung Min Kim and CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem.Welcome to you both ladies. Seung, we'll start with you, President Biden, he acted pretty quickly and forcefully with this on identified object with a Chinese spy balloon last week. He was criticized by Republicans for allowing the balloon to fly across the United States for days before shooting it down. So the Pentagon says in this case, the object was flying low enough to interfere potentially with air traffic. So they had to act fast. Do you buy that?",

That's why they waited off the -- off until the waters of off the coast of South Carolina. But I think that there is a different element here. And there does seem to be a sense that the White House the administration kind of learn from the outcry of criticism from congressional members last week, because it wasn't just Republicans who say the administration's response was not OK. I mean, you recall John Tester, who is a Democrat, who represents Montana, Montana was a state with this, where the Chinese spy balloon was first spotted by members of the public by us. And he was very critical that he wasn't even kept in the loop as to what was going on. So, I think you saw for example, Senator Lisa Murkowsk of Alaska said she had been briefed by administration officials. So at least in terms of their communications with Congress, the White House really did seem to learn its lesson from last week.",

That was a really key factor in the risk calculation that the military made about the first -- or the balloon in terms of, was it a threat to commercial aviation, you simply cannot have things that would impact or possibly harm commercial aviation.So that seems to be the first criteria that they use at this was in sort of a crowded airspace. The second of course, is they did learn in terms of your -- you want to get it before it gets onto continental United States, we have to learn about how the first balloon got onto or above our domestic skies without much. I think I was it without much surveillance. And then third, this is -- it does not -- no one is saying it's a balloon. So we should not think like we're under threat from China or balloons are coming over us all the time. It's hard for people to imagine but there's a lot of stuff in the skies, in particular drone and private aviation, and private commercial satellites, all sorts of stuff that is just in our skies. It's a bit of a problem in terms of what we call, you know, space or aviation debris. We do not know what this is, it appears quite small, comparatively. And the military is quoted as saying that it came down as metal. In other words, it may not have had a balloon feature to it. So I think that this is a coincidence of timing, and that the Biden administration took something down that may not have been a threat or even state sponsor, but simply did not want to go through rightfully, what had happened before and had learned its lesson to take it out of the sky and ask questions later.",

And I think you've heard a really measured tone from the -- from the administration, you know, for months, for most so much of remote -- for all of President Biden's time in office, they really tried to play down the notion that we are in kind of this military conflict with China. They have always characterized this relationship between the U.S. and China as one of competition and not conflict. But that is really test -- being tested hereThey have said, you know, the White House officials that said they would take any sort of appropriate measures to respond. Beijing, of course, has said this was kind of just a weather balloon. It was not surveillance at all, and they've tried to play this down. But I also think it's quite a contrast to with what you're hearing from a lot of national Republican candidates, the same Republican candidates who are considering presidential bids against Joe Biden. I think you are hearing a lot of criticism that he acted -- he would -- that he was too slow to act, that he should have decisively taken action sooner when it was still over the continental U.S. Obviously, the White House has defended his decision, but I'm certainly it could continue to play out in the 24 campaign.",

They've been inching forward for months, taking heavy losses. Ukrainian forces desperate to deny Vladimir Putin a symbolic victory as the first anniversary of this war approaches. Across a wide area in the east, the Ukrainians detect a buildup in Russian troops and heavy weapons. That could be a prelude to a widely anticipated offensive. But Ukrainian officials have told CNN that in some areas, their own troops are critically short of munitions. And throughout the country, Russia launched its largest missile barrage in months, targeting Ukrainian civilian infrastructure, including this thermal plant in Dnipro. The city of Zaporizhzhia hit 17 times in one hour. Russian cruise missiles struck the power grid. The immense power of the strike, throwing a car under the roof of a house. They're not humans, says Yenhen, of the Russians. I don't know what they're thinking about when they're doing this, when they press the buttons and shell civilians.

These revelations come as we're learning new details about these officers including the sixth officer who was fired last week, Preston Hemphill. And in a decertification letter sent by the Memphis Police Department to the state commission that oversees policing standards in the state, they allege that Preston said that Nichols was fighting back during this arrest, that he was driving recklessly, and that he was trying to grab one of the officer's guns. None of these claims by Hemphill are corroborated by the video evidence and these revelations come after more details we learned earlier this week from the decertification letters of the five other officers who were fired. And police are saying that they went to great lengths to cover up their actions, great lengths to cover up what they did, by either hiding their body cameras or obscuring them or otherwise just misleading investigators.

And some of that can change. But I don't think there's one easy answer to this. Reform has to look different in a lot of different communities. But as I said, there are steps that chiefs can take, but it really boils down to collaboration at the local level. If you don't have that, you're just not going to be successful.",

Attached to that report should be the interviews or a statement of the pilots and other personnel involved in the incident. Then the NTSB has the power to ask you to do an interview. And if you don't, they have the power to subpoena. Once they subpoena year before a recorded administrative -- recorded interview before administrative law officer. So at this point, the interview will be recorded if it takes place. However, when you're doing an interview, which you feel for any government agency, in which you feel you might be placed in personal jeopardy, then you can have counsel present.
