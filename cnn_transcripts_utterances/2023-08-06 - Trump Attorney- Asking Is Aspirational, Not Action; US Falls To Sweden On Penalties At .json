Now, they're important because they potentially provide access for supplies to come from the military stronghold of Crimea, up to forces fighting in the western side of Zaporizhzhia, where the most intense prong of Ukraine counteroffensive currently is. Now the Russian officials suggest that part of these will be functioning again quite soon, and they are still able to use another route up from Crimea off towards the west, but it is this pinpoint nature of Ukraine targeting that's a problem for Moscow. Often these strikes, too, presage an uptick in Ukrainian activity. They want to destroy supply routes, just before they do something, to be sure that has the maximum chaotic impact upon the Russians, but another sign too of Ukraine's increased reach after days in which we've seen a supply of fuel oil tankers, amphibious assault ship, even a bridge from Crimea itself to the Russian mainland, all targeted in the last fortnight by Ukrainian drones.",

So when the minesweepers come in and move the mine, another one detonates, detonating them both.And we've spoken to de-mining squads, who sometimes say it takes them tens of meters every hour. They can at times, on their hands and knees, poking forwards with sticks to try and see if the ground in front of them is indeed clear. That is a key reason why the first part of this counteroffensive has indeed been so comparatively slow, despite some of the optimistic assessments how fast it might initially go, and it is something Ukrainians have to work fast to try and get around. They don't have enough mine-clearing vehicles, certainly, and it is something that they're finding increasingly slow in terms of their progress.",

In fact, it was just last week that we saw dozens and dozens of asylum seekers even have to sleep on the sidewalk just outside. Now we should mention that a few days later, New York City officials were able to find at least temporary housing for those, so we have not seen that play out again. However, we also heard from New York City Mayor Eric Adams say in the last couple of days, that those scenes, they could potentially repeat themselves because of the influx of asylum seekers that we continue to receive. It's also worth noting that this weekend marks one year since the first bus paid for by the Texas Governor Greg Abbott administration arrived here in New York City. But just some important context here, Fred, that accounts as of last -- as of about a week or so ago, are only about 10,600 asylum seekers. That is a fraction of the nearly 90,000 -- nearly 100,000 that arrived here. And so this is why as we are well a year into this migrant crisis, the mayor says that all options are still on the table, Fred, including housing asylum seekers in soft-sided facilities in New York City's iconic Central Park.
