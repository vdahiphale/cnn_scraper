This is a location and a part of the state that took enormous damage from Hurricane Idalia, now, Tropical Storm Idalia, which still does pose a serious threat elsewhere.You can see the damage it did here at this truck stop. The storm passed directly overhead here and it took that awning behind me and simply just tipped it over. And there was brick and metal that was holding it in place. It's now just shredded. This exploded brick in this twisted metal with the awning leaning completely on its side. You can take a look. This is actually what it looked like right where I'm standing earlier today as the worst of the wind hit. You can see the awning, there it is, and that's it tipping over. Here in Perry, it was a wind and a rain storm. Along the gulf coast though, it was all about the storm surge, a surge not seen in a lifetime. This is Alexis DeLeon, and yes where she was in the hometown she had recently returned to, swimming down the street was how she ended up getting around. Alexis will join us shortly. We're also going to speak to a resident of another hard-hit area, the barrier island of Cedar Key, a man who told us last night he was staying in part to help any neighbors who were hunkering down. And in a moment, the latest on where Idalia is right now, where it is going and who is at risk. First though, the scope of it all so far, from our Randi Kaye. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Keaton Beach, Florida in the bullseye of Idalia. Just look at what's left of this home in Keaton Beach, the roof is gone, but miraculously, the big screen TV is still attached to the bedroom wall. This structure was also badly damaged. At this home, the waves in high water overwhelm this porch nearly burying it. GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): There will be impacts far beyond the eyewall. KAYE (voice over): Impacts the Big Bend region of the state hasn't seen in more than a century, like 125-mile-an-hour winds. Heavy rains and a storm surge powerful enough to flood neighborhoods.",

So that was heartbreaking to see.Before I moved here, I used to stay in this very cottage, number one down here and it was hard to see because the owners here, they knew that this property floods, but it is just a real trial by fire. And if you look down there by the water, all along the ocean, there are chairs and microwaves and hair dryers. It's a pretty surreal experience. And when the wind was kicking in the middle of the night, and when the water was coming toward us from all three sides, it looked like a leviathan trying to reach out of the water to devour us whole. It was Biblical -- at the end of the day, there were no serious injuries and I was able to talk two of my elderly neighbors into leaving the island at the last possible moment. My neighbor's house across from me was submerged to the roofline, but we had no injuries were here. We'll rebuild. We'll do what Cedar Key does. All in all, I feel incredibly blessed.",

After flipping, it hit another car. Amazingly truly, the only injuries in both cars are minor. That is so eerie to see that car just upended. Again, we can't stress this point too much.

There is still wind 65 miles per hour blowing down the beaches and there is also now flooding into Charleston.The National Weather Service in Charleston saying it is now the eighth largest high tide ever, so -- and that's still going up, so those numbers could go down a lot. We could be top five or top four. We'll see. But it is the tornado threat that we know right now is the largest threat along the coast. Every time one of these cells from the Atlantic comes on shore, it may be spinning. I know there is a tornado on the ground just to the west of Wilmington, North Carolina about 30 minutes ago because we could see the debris on the radar spinning around there to the west of Wilmington. There had been more than that as well. Many, I would say at least four tornadoes now. Some of them waterspouts that came on shore of course, but that's still a tornado if it hit something, but a little bit of a gap here along the Myrtle Beach zone, but then on up here toward Wilmington, still more weather there and more storms will likely rotate in from the Atlantic. There is still flooding going on. There is still heavy rainfall, especially kind of on up toward the Piedmont. Well, I was watching the Kiawah Island, South Carolina camera. It is very rough. The ocean was rough that day, my friend an awful lot of whitewater out there, Kiawah Island, 450,000 people still without power. Notice how dark these counties are. That means more than 90 percent of all customers in those counties are without power. That is going to take some time to put back up. There is the rainfall here across the Carolinas, at least another four to six inches with the flooding possible tonight. And after dark, it is going to be hard to see that flooding. So really, really be careful. John, I'm going to back you up 120 hours to the forecast from the National Hurricane Center. They started out way down here near Cancun. I know this looks like a spaghetti plot with no color. But these are the forecasts from the National Hurricane Center. Believe it or not from 120 hours to what the present is, the spread was only 55 miles and in fact, the very first -- the very first forecast that was put out five days ago missed landfall by 10 miles -- 10. Now it was a Category 1 at their forecast and it turned into be a major hurricane and we know that the category is the hardest thing to forecast. But when you can get it five days away, 10 miles from where it actually hits, you've done your job.",

We're talking about at least three sailboats that broke free last night as this hurricane made its way north. We were talking about a storm surge at the time of anywhere between four feet to six feet. And so, we're told that one of these sailboats on the far end of the beach where we are right now, broke free of its line and when that happened, it took out a second and a third sailboat. That third sailboat ended up taking out a part of the dock.Now, we began the day over in Hillsborough County that is home to the Tampa Bay Area. That is where we saw some of the more significant flooding. Homes there saw anywhere between three inches to four inches of water come in overnight. The concern going into the storm, of course, was this storm surge, and that really did materialize. Now, as we made our way on to Pinellas County here in Gulfport, we came across yet another three feet to four feet of flooding out here. The good news, John, at this hour is that much of that water has receded. Much of the power out here has been restored. And those two mandatory evacuation orders for both of those counties have been lifted. In fact, the cleanup and the recovery effort out here is well underway. A number of businesses, restaurants, even a couple of bars are hoping to get things going over the next couple of days. John?",

I think it was only a foot from touching the roof in the inside of the marina on the first floor. So the marina itself, it survived a couple hurricanes where we've had water come inside the store. So, that isn't really a main concern on the damages. But our docks out front, we had some of the concrete pylons just collapse near, like, the kind of center part of the channel. And the docks put so much pressure on those concrete pylons collapse. And half of our docks kind of like broke apart and they're all bundled up in a giant ball.And so, that's a major damage we had. But then behind our marina, we had this big building that's our mechanic shop. And it's kind of -- it's like a tarp-type building. But it got tore up. It's all broken apart in pieces. We've got some pictures on Facebook of what it looks like now. It's just (inaudible) right now. It's a giant tarp/barn. So, we tried our best to strap it down, but the winds just store it up. So, we got a handful of rentals that took on a lot of water, a lot of furniture damage. One of our properties that we have that's kind of towards the mouth of the river that a lot of our employees stay at, it got really bad flooded. And the windows were blown out in it. The front door was completely blew out.
