Thanks so much for joining us.As somebody with experience, both very specifically in this case but also just generally, what are the things that you would run through in terms of what could go wrong in an expedition like this since we have so little we know about what happened here? DR. JOE MACINNIS, MEMBER OF THE FIRST EXPEDITION TO LOCATE TITANIC WRECKAGE:  Well, I don't know the sub. I don't know the OceanGate company, but for all of us who work in the deep ocean, there are three areas of focus, and they are fire, entanglement and through hull failure. And we take extraordinary steps to prevent them and to be ready in case they happen. So, fire is a possibility because of the number of electrical connections inside. And then there is entanglement, where you get caught up in something on the wreckage, for example. The debris field is very large in the Titanic and there's torn pieces of metal and tangles of industrial wires. So, that's a possibility that we all try to avoid. And the third is through hull failure where there's a breach in the hull. And we all know the story of 1963 where the USS Thresher was on a test dive (ph) and it went through its collapse depth and there was a massive implosion. So, these are the things that run through our minds and we really work hard to prevent in our systems and in our procedures.",

The reason it took him so long to be able to win the speaker gavel in the first place was because the kind of hard line right of the GOP conference was refusing to really step down after the midterms. This was a midterms that should have been really just empowering for them. We saw the country kind of universally reject those type of hard line messages, particularly in swing races. But that's not how they saw it. They saw it as another attempt with that slim majority for them to kind of bring Speak McCarthy closer to them. I mean, actually, I think we have seen impeachment efforts coming from this wing, people like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Congresswoman Boebert, since before the midterm election. The fact that it's even coming back up now, I think is actually a sign of Speaker McCarthy's relative strength and being able to manage this caucus.It's going to keep coming up, these divisions, because of that slim majority. But I think you're really going to see them trying to increase the pressure on Speaker McCarthy as the presidential race comes around, because they're seeing this as an opportunity to score kind of messaging points rather than actually kind of the serious effort of policymaking.",

The Republicans in the House typically tried to run sort of more normal campaigns on issues that were good for Republicans, like crime and inflation. You had candidates in a lot of these Senate races who were running basically trying to re-litigate the 2020 election, obsessed with Donald Trump and vindicating him, and they underperformed the House candidates. And so I think this sort of stuff where you're trying to do impeachments and that sort of thing, I don't think that's in the GOP's political bread and butter. And I think if you're someone like Mike Lawler, who's one of the Republican congressmen representing a Biden district in New York, you can't be happy about this sort of thing. But I think a majority of the conference has clearly been lining up with McCarthy on this stuff. I thought it was impressive on the debt ceiling deal, the he got 149 Republicans behind that bipartisan deal, because you had some of these agreements, like ten years ago with John Boehner and Paul Ryan, where you actually had less than a majority of the Republican conference having to depend mostly on Democrats to pass these things. Here, you got a large bipartisan majority. It seems like it's a clear majority of the conference is behind his strategy of trying not to end up in these sorts of things like the Biden impeachment, and they'll be able to use a procedural move to basically take this thing off the floor without actually making Republicans vote on whether to impeach Joe Biden.",

Marjorie Taylor Greene has been someone who's become sort of an ally to Speaker McCarthy in these type of efforts. I think that shows you that he's kind of gotten this caucus together by really leaning into his ability to get kind of favor on the Trump side.So, I mean, I think there's been some underestimation of Speaker McCarthy that has really kind of paid off for him here, but the task that he's up against remains so difficult, because as you keep going and as maybe Donald Trump becomes more of an imprinted figure when the Republican primary, it's going to become harder and harder to keep that wing of the GOP silent.",

And, basically, with the last agreement on the debt ceiling, he really rolled the far right part of his conference, which I think was surprised by the way that worked out. And then they basically said, well, okay, you had this deal, but now you have to pass spending bills that actually spend less money than that deal said.The problem is the House is going to spend those bills -- pass those bills. The Senate is going to throw them in the trash. The Senate is going to write appropriations bills that actually align with the deal that McCarthy made in the first place, and I expect he will then roll that right wing end of his conference again. There will be another likely bipartisan vote for the more detailed spending deal, and I think they will be caught by surprise again. But I think he showed that he has the bulk of his conference behind him to do these sorts of agreements, and if he was able to do it once, I don't see why he can't do it again.",
