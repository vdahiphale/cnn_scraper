CHUCK ROCHA, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR FOR BERNIE SANDERS'S PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS:  I don't think so, because she has only had this little bit of time to run for president. If she'd been running for president for a year and years, sure, because she'd had plenty of time to go meet with lots of people. But with a finite amount of time, we've talked about this campaign as an old gray- bearded political professional. There is only one thing in campaign you can never get back, and that is time.

It was also a Univision town hall where he talked about January 6 as being a day of love, which caused that moment when the voter sort of cocked his head to the side like, really, on that point.

So, whatever is left of the RNC is to basically dispute the election results or lawfare, as they call it, in this election.

But that has been outsourced to Elon Musk's Super PAC. And they have door hangers that I picked up in Michigan that's talking about Kamala Harris, which could work. But it's just different when it's coming from a Super PAC. Not that anybody is reading the byline, but that is you just can't do certain things as a Super PAC that you can do as a candidate on the door-to-door. I think that's a big difference in what we've seen. The other big difference is we were in an age of the coronavirus last time.
