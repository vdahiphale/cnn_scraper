They got enough votes to get that through and that was the beginning of what we saw, what was this week's worth of truces, effectively, which are now at a end. Let's be quite clear about this, the Americans abstained from that U.N. resolution on urgent and multiple resolutions. I know that was a resolution very much backed by the Arab Group, which is led by the UAE where I am here. But that was all they could get through. That was the wording at that point. Now with this, with this decision to invoke Article 99, let's be quite clear for our viewers what that is. It squarely speaks, doesn't it, to the five real powers, the permanent members at the United Nations Security Council, of which the United States is one. What sort of real pressure does this put the U.S. under at this point?",

      "sentences": "Well, look, I think it is another layer of pressure that the U.S. is already getting from theinternational community. Because as Ben said, the U.S. is understood to be by global powers the main influencer when it comes to Israel, the main power that can actually exert some kind of leverage over the Israelis. But again, there have been no red lines or restrictions placed on the Israelis to date. And so we will see if that U.N. invocation of Article 99 actually changes anything. However, it is unlikely, because the U.S. has continued to say that, while they want Israel of course to do more to protect civilians in Gaza, they have not placed any conditions on the kind of aid and the weaponry that they are sending to the Israelis, other than to say that they expect them to not use those weapons to target civilians. The United States continues to insist that Israel is not actually doing. They say the target that they aim at in Gaza are legitimate military targets. So the question now is whether the U.S. is going to succumb to pressure domestically from, of course, more progressive members of the Democratic Party, who are calling for more conditions on this aid that the U.S. is providing to the Israelis. And also, internationally from the Arab partners, as you said. But secretary of state Antony Blinken, who was asked about this on CNN last night, reiterated that Israel does have an obligation to protect civilians. Here is what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  They, nonetheless, have an obligation to do everything possible to protect civilians, to distinguish between terrorists and innocent men, women and children.

Israel says that Sinwar is one of the masterminds of October the 7th terror attack. The IDF says it has breached Hamas defense lines in Khan Yunis. it blurred the faces of its soldiers who targeted Hamas strongholds. And the IDF today released a photo of a group of senior Hamas officials, circling the ones that it claims to have killed during its military operation in Gaza.

It says that those are 11 menwho are part of the northern Gaza brigade, which the IDF says is the second biggest unit within Hamas. The 11 men sitting around a table having a meal, you can see fruit and juice and other things on that table. They say that, in this photo, the men were underground and that they were actually targeted at some point. It's not clear exactly when. When they were in a tunnel under civilian infrastructure, so you have the five circles around the men there. They are of various rank but essentially at the brigade or battalion commander level. In addition to those five, Israel also says that there were four other battalion commanders who were also taken out. So Israel's trying to make the point here that they are making inroads in terms of eliminating some of these more senior commanders. But in the bigger picture, Becky, these are mid level commanders. So they're not insignificant. They can be replaced and, of course, this will have an impact. But at the same time, they are mid level commanders. In terms of the broader force, Israel claims to have killed several thousand. They have not put an exact number on, it but several thousand Hamas militants out of the main force of some 25,000 to 30,000. So it is just a fraction of the overall force. So, Becky, they may have taken out some of these battalion and brigade commanders but at the same, time some of the most senior levels, senior members of Hamas, including Sinwar, who you mentioned, are still being hunted by Israel now two months into this war, Becky.",

Sinwar, as well as the top military commanders of the al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of Hamas, Mohammed Deif and Marwan Issa, they're still out there. It remains to be seen whether just finding and eliminating those senior members would bring an end to this war. Of course the stated goal by Israel is to eradicate Hamas.

Hezbollah, meanwhile, says that it targeted an Israeli kibbutz and the town in Israel close to the border.

As you pointed out, a 60-year-old Israeli man killed today on the Israeli side of the border. Hezbollah today announced that three of its fighters were killed. We don't know the circumstances of how or where or when that happened. They said that one of their fighters -- announced that he was killed yesterday. The Israeli military expressed regret for a Lebanese soldier who was killed yesterday. And though there is a lot of deadly weapons being fired back and forth across the border, it is very clear that neither Hezbollah nor the Israeli military have yet -- they have yet to use their most powerful weapons, the likes of which we would have seen in the much deadlier 2006 month-long war between these two adversaries. So what it does suggest is that both sides are holding back, to a certain degree. Hezbollah has indicated. It has suggested, that part of its main goal with this conflict right now is basically to tie down the Israeli military, to keep a certain amount of Israeli troops from being able to participate in the ongoing deadly offensive in Gaza with essentially a campaign of harassment along the Israeli border. But it is now going on two months. The Lebanese ministry of public health says that, according to their statistics, I believe around 96 people have been killed in this conflict -- 94, rather -- thus far in the Lebanese side of the border, with tens of thousands of people displaced. So if you are again one of these residents of one of these many villages along the border, hearing perhaps that you are part of a strategy to tie down the Israeli military and you didn't get a voice, a vote or a voice in this, is not very reassuring -- Becky.",
