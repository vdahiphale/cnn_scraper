They are, they say, as of Tuesday, in the heart of Khan Younis, the IDF, but also had apparently on Tuesday completed the encirclement of Jabalia, the Jabalia refugee camp in the north. So intensive battles on the ground and in the air are continuing, certainly since the end of the truce.We're on day six now (inaudible). We are in what appears to be a very intense phase of battles, but of course operating in the south of Gaza to this extent, and you saw from those satellite images in Jeremy's report, the clusters of armored vehicles. This is a significant operation in the south. This puts intense focus on the issue of civilian casualties. We now know almost 16,000 people in Gaza have been killed since the start of this military operation. And of course, the comments from Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus, the IDF spokesperson calling the ratio, which he hasn't apparently officially confirmed, but had seen of two civilians killed for every Hamas combatant, tremendously positive. He then later had to clarify that, say that he should have chosen his words more carefully after criticism from the United Nations, calling that tasteless. This, I think, underscores the delicateness of this moment. One, because Israel is gonna have even more of a challenge protecting civilians in the south of Gaza, where so many people have now evacuated from the north. They have been leafleting, sending out this QR code where people can see the specific areas they can evacuate from, but there are major challenges for civilians when there is very spotty cell coverage in doing that. But also in terms of public opinion, we know that in the U.S., many U.S. officials telling us that direct conversations are happening with Israel, urging them to do more to protect civilians. Now Prime Minister Netanyahu in his speech on Tuesday sticking to the line that we've heard from him saying that they are going to continue until absolute victory. But he did also, we're going to play a little bit more of what we heard from him. Talk about what could happen and what he called the day after Hamas. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NETANYAHU (through translator): Gaza must be demilitarized. And in order for Gaza to be demilitarized, there is only one force that can ensure this, and that force is the Israel Defense Forces. No international force can take responsibility for this.

We did have to scramble, as you say, to relocate to another less suitable warehouse. We missed out on doing two-way deliveries that day because of that advice and that movement and now we have a less operational warehouse from which to work. But I think this is just, you know, I think people should be under no illusion about the massive, massive scale of need and the incredibly difficult operating environment there is for humanitarian agencies today. You mentioned, Rosemary, that 50 trucks crossed yesterday. We've been saying for weeks now we need a minimum of 500 trucks. So in spite of this massively increasing need there's a 450-deficit number of trucks just yesterday. The whole week of the pause there are only 220 trucks going in per day. The whole week of the pause, we had a 2000 truck deficit. So things, we are spiraling further and further down.
