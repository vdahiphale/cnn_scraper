      "sentences": "And as we wait for those updates, we also have a new update here in New York, where it could be several weeks before we actually find out if a grand jury is even going to indict former President Trump in Manhattan. CNN has learned that the grand jury investigating those hush money payments that were made to Stormy Daniels is actually getting ready to go on a break for most of next month. The former president wrongly predicted that he would be arrested last week, obviously causing quite a stir. The Manhattan district attorney, who was conducted that investigation, Alvin Bragg, says, though, he believes the former president created a, quote, false expectation that that arrest was imminent.Meantime, back in Washington, Trump is fighting several large investigations, several defeats in the special counsel's investigation when it comes to January 6th. Right now he is trying to block some of his former aides from testifying, including, probably most notably, his White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Let's bring in CNN's senior legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, we want to break down both of these, so let's start with what is happening here in New York. You were just here. This is this grand jury that we've been talking about. It did seem for a period of time that this was imminent, but now the jury, is this a previously scheduled break? What is this exactly going to look like?",

      "sentences": "So, let's start with what we expect to happen today, next week, and then the break.It's not unusual for grand juries to hear evidence on several different cases. That's what we expect will happen today when the grand jury meets. They're going to hear evidence on cases but not the Trump hush money probe. Next week we also expect that the grand jury will meet on Monday and Wednesday, but we don't expect they will hear evidence on the Trump probe. But I want to be cautious here, Kaitlan, grand juries are conducted in secret. Things can change. So, we're being a little more cautious than some other outlets in terms of what will happen next week. It is not expected that they'll hear anything on the hush money case or move to vote on an indictment. But again, I caution that can change. But we do know that after next Wednesday, they do have a previously scheduled break for several weeks. This happens across several religious holidays and school breaks. So, it was scheduled previously, but that's not going to tamp down speculation about whether this break for nearly a month is the result of them wavering on their case. I mean there was a lot of expectation that they were nearing the end of their investigation. Of course, the former president, as you just noted, he set a false expectation that he would be arrested last Tuesday, even though his own team said there was no basis for that. So, at this point, we will continue to watch the grand jury. But based on our reporting, there's no suggestion they're wavering on their case.",

And we've learned that they're going to appeal one of these rulings that would have forced several of his aides, including Mark Meadows, who was basically the great white whale for January 6th investigators, to testify.Now, all of this is happening under seal, but we will continue to report it out because this has enormous consequences, not just for Mark Meadows but for other top White House officials in the former president's administration.",
