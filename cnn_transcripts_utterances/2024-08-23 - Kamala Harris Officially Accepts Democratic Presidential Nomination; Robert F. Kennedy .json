Kamala Harris officially accepts the Democratic presidential nomination with just 74 days to go until election day. Happening at any moment now, Robert F.

Officials in Gaza say a majority of the 40,000 people killed so far are women and children. Israel says it takes precautions to avoid those civilian casualties. But tactics it used in the 2006 war on Hezbollah in Lebanon may suggest otherwise. Ben Wedeman reports now from Beirut. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  This is Gaza today, and this was Beirut's southern suburbs known as Dahiya in 2006 following the 34-day war between Hezbollah and Israel. And from that ravaging of an entire densely-populated neighborhood where Hezbollah is based, came Israel's so-called Dahiya doctrine. A strategy of massive disproportionate use of force including targeting civilian populations and infrastructure. Until now, the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel has been largely limited to the south. Yet, after the Israeli strike in late July on Beirut that killed a senior Hezbollah military commander and the groups vowed to retaliate, war threatens to engulf the rest of the country. (on camera):  In the past few weeks, Israeli warplanes have frequently broken the sound barrier in the skies over Beirut. A grim warning to all Lebanese of what could come. (voice-over):  A warning voiced Wednesday by Israel's Defense Minister. \"Our center of gravity\", he said, \"is gradually shifting from the south to the north.\" The Dahiya doctrine for all intents and purposes is being put into practice in Gaza, where tens of thousands have been killed and much of the Strip reduced to ruins. Yet, after almost 11 months of war, Israel has yet to achieve its goal of destroying Hamas. Hezbollah represents a far greater challenge to the Israeli military than Hamas, says analyst Imad Salamey.",

The yacht went down on Monday after being hit by a tornado off the coast of Sicily, 22 people were on board when the storm hit, seven of them died. Here's CNN's Barbie Latza Nadeau with the latest. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BARBIE LATZA NADEAU, CNN REPORTER (on camera):  Specialized dive teams have now wrapped up their search and recovery operation five days after a tornado struck a luxury yacht here off the coast of Sicily, sinking into the bottom of the sea. The first victim that was brought up on Monday after the incident was that of the onboard chef, the final victim, 18-year-old Hannah Lynch, the daughter of Mike Lynch, whose family owned the yacht. Fifteen people survived the accident including a 1-year-old baby girl whose mother held her above the waves while they tried to reach a lifeboat. Also surviving, the captain of the ship, who has been the focus of an investigation. As we know right now, they have opened up a criminal investigation into the events surrounding the disaster to try to determine if there was criminal negligence that led to the death of these seven people. The focus has largely been on what the captain and the crew did before the disaster. There were other yachts nearby when the storm struck those which did not sink. We've also heard from the ship maker who said his yacht was unsinkable, and alleged that in fact, it only sunk because of human error. We'll understand over the weekend exactly where the criminal investigation is going, and if the captain will hold any responsibility. Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN, Porticello, Sicily. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "That's exactly right. And part of that is actually we just saw a recent Pennsylvania Court filing -- so this was achallenge that RFK Jr's team had issued to Pennsylvania's Court in order to get ballot access in the state, but he withdrew that today. His campaign saying it was in light of withdrawing that challenge, in light of his endorsement of former President Donald Trump. And as you mentioned, Paula, we had expected this. We had known that when RFK Jr. takes that stage momentarily in Phoenix, he is going to announce that he is suspending campaign. Many people I've talked to in Donald Trump's orbit believe that he would offer his endorsement. But they said it was fluid. They wanted to make sure of the timing. So, we're going to see that endorsement at some point today. Now, I do just want to walk you through why it's so important. So, RFK Jr. you know has long been a concern for both Donald Trump's campaign but also the campaign of Joe Biden and now of course Kamala Harris because he is still polling pretty well in many Battleground States. Certainly not as high as the two leading candidates for the Democratic nomination and the Republican nomination but enough to make a difference. And now, with him about to endorse Donald Trump, Trump's team is really hoping that they can siphon away a lot of that support, at least enough of that support to make a difference in some of these key Battleground States. I'm going to talk to you about Arizona for a moment where the speech is going to be because I think it's a great example. Currently, RFK Jr. is polling around six percent. Kamala Harris and president -- former President Donald Trump are very close in the mid the low to mid 40 percent of polling. So, clearly a big difference. But six percent, if Donald Trump can take some of that -- I can tell you that his advisers do not believe that he will take all of that support, but if they can take a good amount of that support in what they expect will be a very, very tight election it could help put Donald Trump over the edge. So, that's a big part of why they're hoping for this. And also, just for how we got here. I've been talking a lot with Donald Trump's team and actually the conversations around Trump's campaign and the camp of RFK Jr started really to ramp up in earnest in the weeks leading up to the Republican National Convention in July I'm told. There were a lot of questions over whether an endorsement would actually benefit the former president, but those close to Donald Trump began to believe that it would only be an asset after it became clear that Harris was going to succeed Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. Now, the key people really pushing for that in Trump's world was Donald Trump Jr., his eldest son, but also Tucker Carlson, someone who has a close relationship with RFK Jr., and then this man named Omeed Malik. He was a former donor to RFK Jr., now a donor for Donald Trump's campaign. I'm told that the three of them were crucial in some of these backchanneling talks about securing that endorsement, so a really big day for Donald Trump. And also a an important endorsement at the end of a week that has really been all about Kamala Harris and the Democrats. It's very clear that Donald Trump has been watching all of those high-profile speakers at the convention this week, particularly Harris's speech last night. He was responding to that in real time on True Social. He did some media interviews about it criticizing her. And so, this is a chance for him to really reclaim some of the limelight after so much attention had been on his opponent. Paula?",

So, there's a weirdness about him. But I would tell you, I think that if you're a pro-choice voter -- I was receiving mail regularly -- as a Republican receiving mail regularly telling me how pro-choice on abortion that RFK Jr. is. Obviously, trying to tell people if you're pro-choice, don't vote for Kamala Harris vote for RFK Jr. That's what they were doing. So, some Democrats who are supporting RFK Jr. may go back to Harris now for abortion or just other reasons. You know, if you're an antivaxxer, conspiracy-oriented Kennedy supporter, you might be a Donald Trump supporter. But on the margins, I suspect Trump might get a slight benefit, but I don't think it's a very big one.",

I do think that again as she has these conversations for instance in Pennsylvania to RFK voters and others, she really should drill down on what this administration has done for Pennsylvania, to working-class Americans. And I think that gets her that specific constituency. For instance, I think the tariffs on steel are something they don't talk about enough and should heavily talk about in a place like Pennsylvania. And so as we look at this RFK decision, the strategy for the Harris Campaign has to be really drilling down for that group on why freedom such as a woman's right to choose matters, why in terms of helping working-class voters like many of them, this administration has done that but they have to tell that story.

Kamala Harris, you know, whatever you know,shortcoming she presented or didn't present yesterday on policy, I think she made up for in the dignified presence that she presented to the American people. She sounded thoughtful and reasonable, you know, here's who I am, I'm prosecuting the case against Donald Trump. That was her message and I think she came across very well. But I think in these swing states, again, Harris is going to have to explain herself on economic policy better than she has so far. She's going to have to explain, you know, why she reversed herself on fracking. You know, a lot of people are going to be a bit skeptical about her on that issue. So, I think she's got some work to do. Like I said, she comes out with a lot of momentum. You know, she presents well. She's thoughtful. She's gracious. She's very different than Trump, you know, who's so volatile and makes so many erratic statements. So, that contrast was good. But a lot of these swing voters in these states are focused on pocketbook issues and I think so far, she has not really moved the needle on that question.",

Well, we've got another week left.

Last night's speech wasn't supposed to be a policy dissertation, it was an introduction in terms of this is who I am, this is why I'm here, this is how I want to help you. Now, she needs to pivot and go on the ground in all of those Battleground States and explain to people what she wants to do that will help their everyday lives. I think in terms of her media engagement, she does need to have something better than she has in place now. I think sort of the idea that the one-on- one interview as the main avenue of communicating your policy, I don't think that's necessary but she does have to have a better relationship with the press so that she can help educate their readers and their viewers.",

And I think if she had a real conversation maybe with someone like you or someone else, he would -- she should do that. But I think what she often finds herself in in gaggles around the White House is the back-and-forth Donald Trump said this, what's your response.
