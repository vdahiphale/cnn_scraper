Joining us now to talk about all of this, former Trump administration official Matt Mowers; Democratic strategist Christy Setzer; and Tara Palmeri. She's senior political correspondent at \"Puck.\" So Matt Mowers, obviously, Hakeem Jeffreys talking there about the fact that there was this massive border security bill that was agreed upon, negotiated by a very conservative senator, James Lankford. Donald Trump comes in, says, I don't want this, I don't want to fix this problem right now. This is easier if I have it as a political problem. The reality, though, is that, you know, every day that we're talking about this issue as a day that, honestly, Republicans have a leg up. If you look at who trusts -- who is trusted in the country on this issue, it's Republicans; it's not President Biden. What do you see here in terms of this decision and how this is actually playing out politically?",

We're going to step in and handle it. We have the right to do so. We're going to actually go forth and do it.You now have President Biden and his administration being forced to try to take a softened approach towards illegal immigration by suing Texas. Now, they may have constitutional grounds and Tenth Amendment grounds and the rest of it. They may have a whole bunch of processes and reasons for posing it. But politically, it's a problem for them. And you see this in poll after poll, after poll. You talked about the fact that voters are now saying they trust Donald Trump significantly more on the border. More and more voters, not only that, are actually ranking the border as the No. 1 issue. That's not just Republicans anymore. Republicans for a long time now said the border's the No. 1 issue. It's independents and Democrats. You also saw Joe Biden underperform in many border counties like Star County and Reeves County near the Texas border, in the Texas Democratic primary, getting less than 50 percent of the vote in those counties. He has a real problem on its hands with these.",

And now you have obviously a 6-3 conservative Supreme Court that's going to back you on this law that, effectively, is you know, Texas's \"show us your papers\" law. That's going to empower vigilantes. It's going to, you know, sort of do all these terrible things and have all these awful consequences in terms of allowing local law enforcement to arrest who they think looks illegal, basically. Where they have not been effective, I think, where Democrats have not been effective is in providing alternate messaging, which is to say that, you know, to the extent that Republicans have been successful in putting border security and the importance of it on the agenda, Democrats have pretty much embraced, you know, some of that position by saying, yes, yes, we agree that it's important.

This is a group of voters he really needs, if he wants to maintain the coalition that landed him in the White House in 2020.Let's play a little bit of what Joe Biden said about Donald Trump and Trump's -- he said that Trump basically despises immigrants. Listen to this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (via phone): Here's what he said about immigrants: \"Poisoning the blood of the country.\" He separated kids and parents at the border then caged the children. This guy despises Latinos. I understand Latino values, you know, they're like the kind -- we just celebrated St. Patrick's Day. I hope you're not offended by my saving this, but you know, the thing about the Irish that came here, they're about family, about faith, about decency.",

So I think this is a very strong messaging, like poisoning the blood of our society is a terrifying phrase, right? But at the same time, a lot of Latinos -- they're not monolithic. A lot of them have been in this country for many years. Many of them live in Texas, and they're second-, third-generation Latinos. And they don't really have a lot in common with the people that have just come over to the -- have crossed the border and come and live in this country. Or coming from even deeper in South America than Mexico. They're coming from El Salvador, Guatemala. They're even coming from third countries outside of South America. So I think that is part of the reason why you're seeing Hispanic communities becoming increasingly more Republican. I mean, they're winning -- Republicans are winning Hispanics over. Biden is losing right at this point. And they're traditionally a more conservative group of people. They don't love the tone-policing from the far left. They don't like to be called \"Latinx.\" They don't like, you know, a lot of the rhetoric you hear from the far left, which is actually a lot louder than Biden's rhetoric. I would argue Biden is pretty moderate on immigration. But again, like, they're playing catch-up. In the past year, maybe past six months, the Democrats have seen their polling shows, whoa, Democrats are saying immigration is No. 1 concern. We better do something about this. Let's support a bipartisan border bill. But like you said, it's baked in the brand of the Republican Party that they are just stronger on immigration and crime. And it's going to take years, not in the past six months to a year, to turn that around. And the Republicans have, even though they made a cynical political play to block the border because of Donald Trump, the border bill,  at the end of the day, they have images and videos of people crossing the border in hordes every single day. And this is kind of a last-minute attempt by Democrats, also realizing that they need to do something about the border for their political purposes. So I think it's a cynical political play by both sides, to be honest.",

Anthony Pro-Life, has been talking to him a lot about this. I know others have when senator Lindsey Graham is someone who consistently has been talking to Donald Trump about the abortion issue.But the thing that's really interesting is that when I talk to the Trump campaign and his advisers, they repeatedly always tell me, we are not planning for some big policy roll-out on this, especially because they didn't even do that during the primary. There were questions during the primary of whether Donald Trump needed to come out with some more firm policy on what he would do about abortion. And Donald Trump himself did not want to do that because of the political ramification -- ramifications of it. So it is interesting that all of a sudden, we're hearing about abortion again, now that we're in the general. And everyone on his campaign does not think that the politics of this is smart or the rhetoric is smart. And so what I've been told he's doing is he's kind of test met -- test messaging some of this language. And I do think he's being asked about it a lot. I do think there's a lot of attention on this, because it's such a key general election issue for Democrats and Joe Biden ahead of November. But behind the scenes, again, I'm consistently told by his campaign that this isn't necessarily anything that he's going to actually be putting out any real policy around at any time soon.",

Right now, the people that they have the evangelicals in their pocket, they have the MAGA far right. The people they don't have are suburban educated swing voters that care about this issue. Trump knows that. He's eyeing up his vice- presidential candidate based on their, you know, extremity on abortion policies -- policies essentially. And so I don't expect you're ever really going to get a firm answer from Donald Trump on abortion. You definitely get a firm answer from him, really on anything, I think, except his immigration policies and the wall.",

I think the -- he recognizes that this is a political loser. And it's interesting, because it depends on who he talks to. Behind the scenes, Donald Trump will tell some people, Yes, I agree. Like he often says, like, when does the baby feel pain? After that. He wants to be reasonable on some of this stuff. And he doesn't want to tie himself down, as Tara said, to a certain amount of weeks. But at the same time, he also recognizes that a big part of his base that -- and a lot of his donors who right now he's meeting with at Mar-a-Lago behind the scenes this week. He's trying to get as much money for his campaign that he needs. Also want him to be coming out and having some more firm language on this issue. So I don't know if -- I think it's hard to predict that this would happen anytime soon, like I said, because of the politics around it.
