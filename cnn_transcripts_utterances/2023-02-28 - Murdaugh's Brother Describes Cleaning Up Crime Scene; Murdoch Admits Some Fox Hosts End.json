They told the judge they were anticipating between three and four witnesses for their rebuttal.This morning, the defense came in very angry, to be honest, telling the judge that this just sort of keeps ballooning. Remember, this initially was supposed to be a three-week trial. We're now in week number six here and have yet to get to closing arguments, noting that they feel that the state is trying to retry its case as its rebuttal. Now, the judge said that's something they cannot do because the defense that -- if they do that, they want to have a sub-buttal, sub- buttal. They want to be able to then come back and call additional witnesses. And we're sort of looking at a potential of this back and forth here. The judge saying that they will try to limit the scope of what these witnesses testify to on the stand right now is the pathologist, Dr. Ellen Riemer, who originally testified about the wounds. And the way that Maggie and Paul Murdaugh were killed. Of course, there was a pathologist, one of the three witnesses the defense called yesterday who sort of refuted some of her testimony. So this is a rebuttal witness that we're seeing here. The defense close out yesterday after those two expert witnesses with the younger brother of Alex Murdaugh, John Marvin Murdaugh. He talked about what it was like after Paul and Maggie were killed, including interviews done with law enforcement, calling into question some of the state's narrative and timeline. But he also brought emotion, talking about what it was like for him the morning after the murders, when he was down at the kennels, after law enforcement left cleaning up. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN MURDAUGH, ALEX MURDAUGH'S BROTHER: Did it not being cleaned up, I saw blood, I saw brains, I saw pieces of skull. For some reason, I thought it was not something that I needed to do for Paul to clean it up. I felt like it was the right thing to do. I felt like I owed him and I started cleaning. And I can promise you, no mother or father or aunt or uncle should ever have to see and do what I did that day. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And so the defense actually is the one that wants the jury to go out and see the site, which is somewhat rare.Normally, the defense does not want a jury to go out to the site, because it's very powerful to be in a place where someone in a crime like this happened or a death like this happened. And so it's very rare to see the defense actually want this, but I think it will be powerful as the last image that the jury sees. I also think it sort of ties into their defense that there were possibly two shooters here, because of the space, they want the jury to be able to see how small the space was, and how their theory and what their pathologist testified to is actually plausible. And that's important, because the state has a duty to disprove this defense. They have a duty to disprove what the defense said about this being two shooters. And so that's going to be something that I think we'll see in the next couple days.",

You know, this was a last day when they're hearing evidence that there's two shooters, that the guns were so cumbersome that there had to be two people handling it.

In this case, you have Rupert Murdoch admitting that some of his top host, people like Sean Hannity, Maria Bartiromo, Jeanine Pirro, he admits that they endorsed false election conspiracy theories, theories that Rupert Murdoch privately, at the time, was privately telling people were damaging to the country. He used the word BS, I mean, very harsh language behind the scenes.But in front of the cameras, in front of Rupert Murdoch's on cameras, he allowed these hosts to go on air and peddle these falsehoods. And I think this really gets at the -- at the broader point about Fox that it's less about being a news network as much as just being a dishonest organization that will feed its viewers the content that keeps them glued to the screens. And after the election in 2020, you saw some of them rebel against the channel when they call the election for Biden. And Fox News, according to these documents, you can see it, got very nervous, and they really pulled back and decided to just give the viewers what they want.

When she fact checked Trump, we saw that Bill Sammon, who made the call, or was one of the people made the call on election night to call the election for -- or Arizona for Joe Biden, that Rupert Murdoch suggested that he should be fired. And, of course, he was eventually let go from the network. So the people who were reprimanded, it seems like were the people telling the truth over at Fox News, which is even more remarkable. And in terms of whether Fox viewers are hearing this, they're not. I mean, they have a show that purportedly covers news media in a fair way. And the host of that show, Howard Kurtz, went on air this past weekend, and said that he is not allowed -- that the network has made a decision that he is not allowed to cover this really explosive, scandalous media story for the network's viewers. So Fox viewers are not hearing a word about this on the channel.",

And so this is a potential attempt at revisionist history. And there's a concern that not only will the operations of the Capitol be put at risk, but also the idea that what we saw in January 6 should never happen again. We'll also be put at risk if it is downplayed and seen as not the tragedy and the violent attack on the democracy that it was. And so if we allow this to be downplayed or spun or sort of taken apart with conspiracy theories, then we potentially could see ourselves in this position once again in the future.",

And the lower the number, while the reverse is true, the more pessimistic we're all feeling. So when you look at present assessments, how people felt about things, currently the state of the labor market, that actually ticked up, but only because of the labor market jobs are plentiful, which makes sense, right? Unemployment is at a record low, you have to open jobs for every one person looking. But where things take a turn and really go south is what people expect about six months from now. The Conference Board is saying that the outlook appears considerably more pessimistic when looking ahead. Expectations for where jobs, incomes, and business conditions are headed over the next six months all fell sharply in February and actually remaining at recessionary levels for the last 11 of the past 12 months.
