It's a projection at this point, but we're getting the details confirmed as we speak. And it sent protesters, demonstrators out on the streets of Paris last night. A huge blow to President Emmanuel Macron. But of course, they've got a lot of support as well. So this is just part of the story.Initial estimates at least showing that the National Rally are leading with 34 percent of the vote, followed by the left wing New Popular Front coalition in second. They are 28 percent. Mr. Macron's centrist alliance came in third in the end, around 20 percent. The French leader who called the snap elections, it was a surprise for everyone, wasn't it, says a, quote, \"broad, clearly democratic and Republican rally\" is needed in the next round. We do go into the next round. So the story certainly isn't over yet. But the National Rally's parliament leader, Marine Le Pen, says democracy has spoken, adding the second round set for next Sunday will be decisive. Sounds obvious, but she's basically saying that to her supporters. They need to get out and vote. National Rally leader Jordan Bardella says the vote shows the French people want change and urge voters to remain mobilized. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JORDAN BARDELLA, PRESIDENT, NATIONAL RALLY PARTY (through translation):  The vote they will cast next Sunday is one of the most decisive in the history of the Fifth Republic. Clearly, in the view of the results, the presidential camp, still largely rejected today, is no longer in a position to win. And the kind score of the far left raises major concerns.

I think of, you know, one particular fundraiser just last September in New York when Joe Biden repeated the Charlottesville story that he's often told about deciding to run. He basically told the same story word-for-word just a few minutes apart. And then just at a recent rally in Detroit it was a late Sunday night, the White House transcription office had to correct the president's own words nine times. And so basically, what aides have told me is that he is just like he's solid between the hours of 10:00 to 4:00 but he often makes more mistakes he can ramble beyond those hours. And there's a reason why he doesn't have many public events before 10:00. There is a reason he doesn't have many public events on camera after 4:00. And it's for that reason the limitations of his age and how the White House is adapted around them. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "The Supreme Court is heading into its final day of decisions on Monday where the justices will rule on a case with significant implications for the 2024 election, whether Donald Trump can face trial on election subversion charges.The justices are set to issue their ruling on Trump's claims of absolute immunity from prosecution. A decision that Trump is not fully immune from prosecution could clear the way for the former president to stand trial this fall. But the decision could also lead to another round of litigation and appeals that would push any trial beyond the 2024 election. The case stems from special counsel Jack Smith's indictment of Trump last August over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Trump responded by claiming he was immune from prosecution because he was president. The trial judge in this case, Tanya Chutkan, and the Circuit Court of Appeals both rejected Trump's claims of immunity. But the Supreme Court chose to take up this case and they heard oral arguments in April. Several of the justices, including Chief Justice John Roberts, were skeptical of the circuit court decision that fully rejected Trump's immunity claims. They focus on whether there should be some immunity for a president's official duties compared to his private actions. This suggests that the justices could grant Trump some degree of immunity for his official actions, but not for those actions he took that went beyond his role as president. That could pave the way for the election subversion case against Trump to move forward. But how quickly any case actually goes to trial depends on whether the justices address Trump's conduct specifically in their ruling, or if they only set a standard for prosecution that the lower court would then have to apply to this case. If that happens, Trump could potentially start a whole new round of appeals, likely pushing any trial beyond the 2024 election in November. The special counsel asked the Supreme Court in December to take up this case and this appeal immediately. But the justices declined to do that, instead letting the case work its way through the appeals process. That's what led to April's hearing and the wait now for Monday's consequential Supreme Court decision, which is coming a little over four months before the 2024 election.

Beryl is an extremely dangerous Category 4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour or more than 200 kilometers per hour.
