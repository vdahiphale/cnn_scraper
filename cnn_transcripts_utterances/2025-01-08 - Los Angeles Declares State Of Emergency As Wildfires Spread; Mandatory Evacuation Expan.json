Dozens of drivers abandoned their cars on Tuesday as some chose to flee the flames on foot. One resident described what she witnessed. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

You heard a chief say, 10:00 p.m. tonight to 5:00 a.m. tomorrow will be peak winds, and having just quite literally an hour or so ago gone up the canyon and saw firsthand the impact of these swirling winds and the embers and the number of structures that are destroyed, not a few, many structures already destroyed. And the fact that people were still not evacuated, still did not heed the warning, we're just coming down the canyon is a reminder of how serious this moment is and how important it is you listen to these evacuation orders.

A lot of them told me that, you know, they packed up what they could, their parents wedding rings, their most important documents, put them in bags. There was one couple who talked to me about how they just abandoned their car on the road, because unfortunately, in that neighborhood, there's just one street that lets you out. There's one egress. So, there was a lot of gridlock there and people in a panic just left their cars there. And there was, you know, a lot of people. There were people just coming out of their cars on foot and I saw them pulling through cases, bringing their pets with them. Just a very -- I think one person said it almost doesn't even seem real or doesn't make sense, because if you look to one side, you have the Pacific Ocean right there and everything is hazy, of course, but we're talking about the iconic Pacific Coast Highway, the PCH. These are scenes that you see out of the Barbie movie. This is not all sunshine and pink dresses where we're talking about. Very, very hazy smoke, explosions, flames.

So, we definitely saw that there was legitimate notification on cell phones in the area.Of course, later tonight, as I was getting home, I saw that there were now evacuation orders for neighboring areas as well. So, you know, I think one of the -- one of the tactical issues of evacuating that neighborhood the Pacific Palisades is the difficulty in having the one street, getting people out, getting people downhill. And then once they are downhill, you only have the Pacific Coast Highway to get either north or south. And if there is a fire leaping across it, then you're pretty stuck.

But knowing that the winds were so severe, we all went home, packed up our cars, got our pets, medications, whatever, and took off. And the better news for us at that point was that Sunset Boulevard is the only major thoroughfare that runs through the entire town. And at the end where Steve Guttenberg was, sunset was closed due to fire. And where I was, I was able to go the opposite direction and actually very, very slowly get out of town. It is apocalyptic. There's never been anything like this all because of the severe winds. It's just -- and usually when you live in the Palisades, when you live in a little flat area in the village where I live, you have sort of a false sense of security because you're surrounded by canyons and mountains, and of course, the ocean on one side. And usually, all the problems have been in the canyons and the mountains, but this time, because of the wind, it blew the fire into every single neighborhood in the entire town, and there are a lot of houses lost in every neighborhood. You're not going to find a single neighborhood where people haven't lost their homes. And we had a photo of our block about two hours ago, and it looked like our block was going up in flames.

But when you think about Donald Trump's rationale, we need Greenland for national security reasons. That's the same argument Russia makes about Ukraine. It's the same one that China will soon be making probably about Taiwan.So if we encourage that attitude, we're basically encouraging people like Trump and the Chinese to do the things we don't want done, but we think we can do it because Donald Trump is the master negotiator. But, he also has already announced that he will be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.
