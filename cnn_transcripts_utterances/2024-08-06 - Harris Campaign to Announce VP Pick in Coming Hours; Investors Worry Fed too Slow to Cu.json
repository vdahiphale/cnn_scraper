But there are, of course, worries that markets will continue to be volatile in the coming months until really September when the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates.Now, the reason why we've seen Asia's stock markets and specifically the Japanese stock market, which, of course, was the hardest hit yesterday, recover so quickly is really twofold. The first is we received better-than-expected service sector data for the month of July from the United States. Now, that sees some concerns about the possibility of a recession in the world's largest economy. And the second reason is the yen looks as though it's beginning to stabilize, and the value of the yen has dipped a little bit. Yesterday, we saw the yen surge against the greenback. And this massive movement we've seen in the dollar-yen rate was really alarming to hedge funds and to investors, but it's largely attributed to the fact that the Bank of Japan raised interest rates for the second time in 14 years just last week. Interest rates are now at 0.25 percent, which doesn't sound that high. But the reason why Japan is raising interest rates, a break from what other countries around the world is doing, is because it looks to raise, again, interest rates and then prop up the value of the currency. Japan has seen the value of the yen drop against the greenback in the last year or so, and that's really raised the prices for some imports, for food and fuel, for example. And now Japan, again, looks to raise interest rates and then prop up the value of the currency, and it's done exactly that. But the sudden movements we saw on Monday really spooked investors and hedge funds, which is why we saw the really sudden selling spree. But as Japan looks to stabilize its currency, and again, the value of the yen has dipped a little bit, some of these nerves, some of those have eased a little bit, and they've been soothed. But, of course, we aren't out of the woods just yet. Experts are warning that the central banks around the world will be looking to see what the Federal Reserve will do in the coming months, again, in September -- Max.",

But I think that ultimately Iran has to walk the fine line of retaliating and being seen as sending a strong message and a strong response back to Israel without nevertheless being dragged into an all-out war, and therefore I think it's unlikely at this stage that the U.S. will be the main focal point of Iran's retaliation. It's more likely to be a concerted effort among Iran and its allied armed non-state groups in the region to inflict a collective response on Israel.",

Security Council resolutions, and providing unconditional military and political support, that has only emboldened Israel to take high-risk action. I think the broader regional position has been that of a defensive position. Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and other countries in the region have said that they would not allow any party, whether Iran or Israel, to use their airspaces to engage in conflict with one another. I think almost all of the countries in the region are trying to distance themselves and maintain a degree of neutrality. The regional position is that really the shortest way to de-escalation is through a ceasefire in Gaza, and that so long as the hostilities and the conflict continues and ensues in Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and maimed, I think is the shortest route and I think is a necessary condition towards achieving a lasting de-escalation and lowering of the tensions in the region.",
