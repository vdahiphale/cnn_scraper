I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, the race for the White House heads to the Paddle Ground State of Pennsylvania as both candidates are planning major events in the critical must-win state this weekend. Today, former President Donald Trump returns to the campaign trail with a rally this afternoon in Wilkes-Barre and Vice President Kamala Harris has a bus tour in the state planned for tomorrow. Today's rally marks Trump's second visit to Pennsylvania since surviving an assassination attempt in Butler one month ago. CNN's Danny Freeman is at the campaign event. So Danny, what can we expect to hear from the former president when he speaks in the next couple of hours?",

      "sentences": "Well, Fred, what can we expect here is really the magic question, and I'll get to that in just a second. But I want to show you the environment out here. Like you said, we're in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, in the all-important battleground state.Of course, this is not only the second time that the former president has been here since that assassination attempt on the other side of the state, but according to Philadelphia Inquirer, this is his seventh appearance in the state since the top of the year. And we've been seeing just a tremendous amount of support out here from some of his most loyal fans. While we were setting up for this live shot for you, Fred, these bikers for Trump came through, they were setting up and we've been seeing long lines to get into this particular event. This is really the hallmarks of the Trump rallies that we've grown accustomed to seeing out here, especially in this area of Pennsylvania. But again, back to your original point, Fred, and your original question, the big question that we all have is, will former President Trump be able to stay on message in this particular campaign event? Specifically, can he actually get some attacks and some lines out on Vice President Harris's economic plan? His allies and advisers, they've been working to make sure that he stays on the message throughout the course of the week. A few days ago, we saw that invent in Bedminster focused on inflation, but then there keep being distractions in this particular campaign cycle for the former president, including when he made comments saying that the Presidential Medal of Freedom is, quote, \"actually much better than the Medal of Honor.\" The Medal of Honor, of course, awarded to service members who have demonstrated extreme amounts of valor. Now, the last thing I'll say for you, Fred, is just explaining why we're here in northeastern Pennsylvania. Like you said, we're in Wilkes-Barre, we're in Luzerne County, and this is a county that actually went for Obama two times then flimped Trump in 2016 and Trump held on to this pivot county then in 2020. So if the former president and his campaign really want to win this crucial battleground state, they have to juice the numbers in these types of spots in Pennsylvania, specifically because a lot of his base, those white working class voters, they're right here in this area of Luzerne and next door in Lackawanna County. And that's where the former president's campaign feels they can get enough votes to hopefully topple Harris in some of those larger urban areas, say, like Philadelphia and Allegheny County, where Pittsburgh is.

STAMOSAnd unfortunately, election security has become a partisan matter since 2020 and I think that's one of the outcomes of that is what you're seeing here. As it's been reported by both Google and Microsoft, the Iranians are going after both political parties. But so far, only one party has been hit. And I think what you're seeing is the outcome of, unfortunately, one political party has believed that foreign interference is a hoax, and as a result, was not taking it as seriously the possibility, and was not protecting themselves as aggressively.",

They're attacking the State Department, the Commerce Department. We've had hack over hack over hack. Everybody has been warned.But unfortunately, since 2020, cybersecurity and in particular, election security, has become a partisan matter. So my hope is that this is a wakeup call that, once again, makes 20 -- makes cybersecurity a nonpartisan matter whoever the President is in January of 2025. That is the hope of -- of those of us who work in the cybersecurity industry, is that we can get back to this being a matter that Congress agrees. And whoever the President is, that this no longer is an area that becomes politicized, and no longer do we have political actors attacking those who try to protect elections.",

Here it is still a category one hurricane pulling away from Bermuda, but it's pretty fat and wide, so you're still getting some tropical storm force and hurricane force winds on the island.They already got a month's worth of rain in Bermuda, with that rainfall over six even getting close to seven inches in some locations, and their average for the entire month is five inches, so some flooding a concern in Bermuda. But again, continuing to pull away, and then it kind of makes this turn and kind of scrapes the coast. There are some of these Canadian islands up here by Monday and Tuesday as we go into the week. But again, you've got these winds that will continue to churn in the Atlantic as it works its way up towards Canada. So that is kicking up significant wave heights, rough swells up and down the East Coast. So even though the hurricane is distant from the East Coast, we've got this rip current risk that really lines itself from Miami all the way up through the Carolinas. Unfortunately, already had some drownings in the Carolinas, up through D.C. and then even up towards New York as well. The red flags mean, please don't get in the water. Remember, rip current takes you out to sea, so to get out of it, you want to swim parallel to the shore. That is the safest way to get out of rip current.",

It's a passive way of monitoring how much virus is out there, now that fewer people are testing and reporting the results of those tests. And right now, those viral wastewater levels are suggesting we are in the biggest summer peak of COVID since 2022. We had actually expected potentially to surpass 2022 levels. But the most recent update from the CDC shows we're just about the same and really approaching where we were in that summer wave.Of course, the winter waves are always a lot bigger, at least, as we've seen over the few years of this pandemic. Now, this is not evenly distributed. The highest levels of the virus in wastewater are in the West, you can see in particular states like California, are seeing particularly high levels of the COVID virus right now. We're also seeing upticks in indicators like emergency room visits, hospitalization rates and death rates, although these are coming off of the lowest levels we have seen through the pandemic, off of a low that we saw in May. Now what is causing this? Well, we see this in typically four to six month cycles of us losing immunity, either from infection or from vaccines and also new variants that are emerging. We are seeing that right now. Currently, the most prevalent variant that's in circulation is called KP.3.1.1. According to the CDC's most recent data, it's about 37 percent of cases that has tripled over the last month. So this is a more transmissible version of this virus. In terms of updated vaccines, we are expecting those to come this fall and perhaps even relatively soon, so folks who are concerned about COVID are anticipating those. We can also say, experts say masks are still helpful, testing, staying home when you're sick, and if you do get infected, using paxlovid, the antiviral drug, those are all recommended, particularly for people who are at high risk. So we are in this COVID wave. We are seeing less severe disease, so that's a good thing, but there is still a lot of COVID around.",

Lorincz told police that the situation escalated last June after she confronted the children about the noise and through the roller skates. Lorincz called 911, and was told to wait for police to arrive. She told the dispatcher, her door was closed. When Owens came to Lorincz's door to confront her, that's when Lorincz claims she feared for her life after she heard Owens, quote, banging on her door and say, quote, I'm going to kill you.Before police arrived, Lorincz had pulled the trigger. Now, a big part of this case revolved around whether Lorincz was justified under Florida's Stand Your Ground Laws. Generally, these laws allow someone facing an imminent threat to use lethal force in certain circumstances without fear of prosecution. Now, clearly the jury believed that that bar wasn't met.
