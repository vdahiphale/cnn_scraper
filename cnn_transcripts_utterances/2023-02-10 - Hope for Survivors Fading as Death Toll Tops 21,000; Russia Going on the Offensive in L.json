Many Democrats satisfied, many Republicans still rejecting the White House and Pentagon's positions. SEN.

When it did on January 28th, fighter jets were sent up to I.D. the balloon, but it was decided to let it fly on, on a Northern trajectory and collect intelligence on it. Suddenly, officials said, it took a strange turn South towards the lower 48 states, crossing into Idaho on January 31st and Eastwards across the country. After it was decided to not shoot the balloon down overland, U-2 spy planes were sent up to monitor it. The administration determining that the balloon was no longer sending information back to China, sources say, and the U.S. trying to block it from gathering more intelligence on sensitive U.S. military sites. This balloon, just a small part of a broader, years-long Chinese balloon program whose fleet the State Department says flew over more than 40 countries. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: The United States was not the only target of this broader program, which has violated the sovereignty of countries across the five continents.
