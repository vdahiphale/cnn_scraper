It had several different points that were somewhat positive.From the Ukrainian point of view they've been very neutral. There's been talk among Ukrainian officials that they would like Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and Xi to talk after this meeting. They're not turning anything off because remember, Ukraine and China still do have some trade ties. But from Washington's point of view this is about Xi trying to allow Putin to freeze things right where they are to keep the territory he's already seized. And the White House says if you let them do that then Russia will just pause and keep attacking another day. It will have learned nothing.",

      "sentences": "Well, Christine, this was the phone call -- first phone call that these two have actually had in months and I think what was really notable is what we didn't see in the readout, which is an invitation to Washington. There had been some reports certainly after Benjamin Netanyahu and his government were sworn into power at the beginning of this year that he would be heading to Washington rather quickly. But I think it's a reflection of not only the situation in Israel -- the internal situation over these judicial reforms and other issues related to the security situation on the ground here that Benjamin Netanyahu still has not received that invitation to Washington to visit somebody who he calls a great friend of Israel -- somebody that he's known for more than 40 years.But in terms of what they actually discussed, the White House readout specifically focused on concerns -- American concerns over this massive judicial reform that would change how Supreme Court judges are selected and would even potentially have the Israeli Parliament able to overturn Supreme Court decisions. That's why you're seeing hundreds of thousands of Israelis taking to the streets now for more than two months -- almost three months now -- and on a regular basis protesting this overhaul. But today, actually, for the first time, the government issued a change -- an amendment -- a softening a bit of these reforms and a potential delay. A softening to what the judicial selection committee would look like that would still give the parties in power a majority over how to pick the judges, but a smaller majority and some other changes to it. And they also announced they're going to delay the implementation of the other reforms until the end -- after the Passover holidays until the next Israeli Parliament session at the end of April. This is the first time after months of protests that we're seeing any sort of changes from the Israeli government -- any sort of reform to their reforms. But the opposition -- the protest leaders -- they have rejected these reforms, calling -- the protester leaders actually issued a statement saying this is not a softening but a declaration of war -- Christine.",

But it is the manner in which Emmanuel Macron has chosen to drive it through, pushing it through a very fast legislative timetable and then ultimately deciding -- the government on Thursday -- that he would force it through with this particularly controversial parliamentary device. That is what has led us to this particular vote of no-confidence that we will have later today in the French Parliament but it's been months in the making.This is a controversial reform that Emmanuel Macron had from his very first time in office, Christine, and said he was determined to push through. He tried and failed once before under pressure from the street. This time he said he was determined that 2023 would be the year that France would see the retirement age raised from 62 to 64. We've had weeks now of protests and strikes, Christine. The ninth nationwide strike is planned for Thursday with the unions fairly unanimously in a very unified way determined to act against this reform. This vote today may pass; it may not. We're not sure whether the parliamentary arithmetic is on the government's side or against it. It's mostly likely it will not pass. Either way, it is many more days and weeks, no doubt, of protests that we're likely to see as a result of this given the amount of popular anger there is out there amongst the wider public when you look at the poles -- not just against the reform itself but again, the manner in which the government has chosen to push this through.

Fairleigh Dickinson pulled off one of the biggest upsets in tournament history when they beat number-one Purdue on Friday to become just the second men's 16-seed to win a game at March Madness. Last night they could have become the first to reach the Sweet Sixteen and they did hang tough against Florida Atlantic. Cameron Tweedy hitting the circus shot to give the Knights the lead halfway through the second half. But Fairleigh Dickinson -- they just couldn't seem to muster that magic down the stretch. The Owls pulling off a 12-2 run. Johnell Davis dunking to seal the deal. A 78-70 win for FAU heading to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in program history.

From Harlem, Christine, but hasn't been home in three years so he could stay at school to work and improve his game and his studies.

Shares of rival UBS climbed 15 percent over the same period. UBS is now buying Credit Suisse in an emergency effort to stabilize the global banking system.The remarkable takeover and intervention by central banks has not soothed jitters around the world. Asian markets ended lower. Europe opening down led by weak bank stocks, although Paris and Frankfurt have now turned higher. On Wall Street, stock index futures at this hour are also barely mixed here searching for stability after a down week last week for the Dow, while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq closed up despite anxiety surrounding those bank stocks. On inflation watch, gas prices fell a penny overnight to $3.44 a gallon. Watching oil prices after a down week last week. And this is a critical week for investors. New and existing home sales data. A Fed interest rate decision. That is the most important item on this agenda. Jobless claims Thursday, durable goods -- a lot to give us information about the state of the economy. I want to bring in Lori Bettinger, president of BancAlliance and former director of the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP. OK, Lori, a lot has happened the last couple of weeks with UBS agreeing to buy Credit Suisse. The Fed, along with major central banks, announcing an effort to boost the flow of U.S. dollars. That was last night just before Asia markets opened. And the FDIC selling most of Signature Bank's deposit to a subsidiary of New York Community Bank. Where are we in the bank jitters? Are they behind us or we're still in the middle of it? LORI BETTINGER, PRESIDENT, BANCALLIANCE, FORMER DIRECTOR, TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM (via Skype):  I really hope that they are behind us. That said, I think we're going to have to get through the next days and weeks to know for sure. I mean, I think I probably had that same hope last Monday after all the interventions of the prior weekend. And I think we made it through the week, right, but continue to see a lot of uncertainty. For example, in Europe, you mentioned what happened with Credit Suisse and UBS buying it this weekend. So I feel like it's our second -- our second week in a row of having a lot of activity over the weekend and then really waiting to see how the market reacts on Monday when everything opens up again. But I do think the banking system in the U.S. is fundamentally in good shape. I think we have really strong community banks, regional banks. You know, the country's largest banks have certainly been stepping up to do what they can to stabilize the system.
