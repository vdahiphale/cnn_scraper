The so-called Protect All Students Act affects students in public and private schools from kindergarten all the way through college, and it takes effect in about 90 days.We're joined now by Adam Bird. He's a Republican state representative from Ohio who sponsored a House version of this bill. Sir, thank you so much for sharing part of your holiday weekend with us. First, I just want to know how many trans students are there in Ohio? How many people will be affected by this law? STATE REP. ADAM BIRD (R-OH):  Thanks for being. Thanks for having me on today. Boris. It's great to be with you. The answer to that question, I'm not sure that we know. I've never heard statistics brought to me about that. Certainly, this is a bill that wants to protect all students as it's entitled. And in Ohio, I think we want -- that's the message. We want to protect all of our young students.",

And so that's a great question because, during the committee process we did hear people come in and share their stories that they've had and, of course, the riveting testimony of Riley Gaines, who came to Ohio to testify about what she has experienced in a college locker room.And then, of course, there's the whole issue of cancel culture. And I believe that's real in Ohio and it's a real around the world. And, yes, there are some people that experience these kinds of things in a locker room or in a restroom, but they're afraid to say something about it because they don't want to be canceled.",

And so, yes, I think that it's important for us to be compassionate to those affected by this. But it's also important that we be real.

And so I think that there may be the practical offshoot of this legislation is that there will probably be more construction of single-use restrooms across Ohio and in K to 12 buildings and in colleges and universities. And so that issue will continue to be there.But then there's also the point, Boris, that in Ohio, we passed a bill that said that we were not going to allow chemical castration or gender mutilation surgery anymore for those under the age of 18. And so I think that that will become less of an issue over time.",

      "sentences": "Like everywhere. We're looking at those freezing cold temperatures getting as far south as the Gulf Coast. And the reason why we're going to have so much snow is because that cold air is coming over very warm lakes.This is the Lake Effect snow machine pumping through the weekend. You can see that snow coming off of all of the Great Lakes here. We're very concerned going into the weekend off of Lakes Erie and Ontario because a lot of that snow, that's where we could get some of that several feet. But if you're looking at some of the interstates, I-94, I-196 up near Grand Rapids could have some problems here. These snow bands tend to be very localized. The snow can be pretty heavy and visibility could be pretty poor. That would definitely be the case along I-90 from Cleveland over towards Erie and up towards Buffalo. There would be problems driving along the lake there with the lake affect snow bands. Again, that could be pretty heavy and drop that visibility. Look at all the winter alerts again that are covering here, the Great Lakes. And then we have lake effect snow warnings, in effect, east of Cleveland, south of Buffalo, and then near Watertown too in Upstate New York. Because what's happening is we have the winds coming in with this Arctic air over record warm lakes. So, we're able to pick up the moisture with that cold air and just dump all of the snow. Now, the weather surface is also warning that the snowfall rates could be so turbulent that thunder snow is likely. We could have an atmosphere that's like a thunderstorm with all of that snow because of just how turbulent it is. So the snow continues as we go into the week and, again, in the same spots off of the Great Lakes, those lake effects snow bands just keep going. And that's where we get feet of snow off of those lakes and the cold temperatures. Yes, I mean it's six degrees right now in Fargo, guys.",

Good to see you.Now to some of the other headlines we're watching this hour, some organic eggs sold at Costco are being recalled over concerns about salmonella. It affects 24-count packs of organic pasture-raised eggs sold under Costco's Kirkland signature brand. It only applies to cartons that include the code 327 and a used by date of January 5th. We understand they were sold at 25 Costco stores across five southern states. So, definitely check your fridge. Also, Australia now the first country to approve a social media ban for kids under 16. This new law means that social media platforms, like TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X, and Instagram could face fines up to 32 million for failing to prevent kids from holding accounts. Now, parents and children won't be fined for violating the ban, but companies must show that they've taken reasonable steps to enforce it. Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta called this measure rushed. And we're getting a first look inside the newly restored Notre Dame Cathedral.",
