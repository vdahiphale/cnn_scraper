Some of the families certainly not all of them, but some of them have released pictures from the reunions simply unbridled joy at the chance, first, obviously to see that their loved ones are out of Hamas captivity, but back in their arms being treated, being cared for. We got a similar statement from Schneider Medical Center. That's where the children were taken for treatment. The hospital there says they are in good condition. Similarly, some of the families there have chosen to put out pictures of the reunions. And it is that same joy, especially with the children of being with their families, again, being able to hold them, being able to celebrate with them. And that comes across clearly from these pictures that have been released. Both hospitals, of course, asking us to respect the privacy of the families, both in fact have set up specific wings for the freed hostages so they can be with their families and have time to recuperate here. It's not just medical and physical checks they'll have to go through, it is mental health checks. The hospitals have psychologists on standby, and at least for the children have tried to make it feel as little as possible, like a hospital trying to make it in that sense, seem almost like a luxury hotel, with games, with teddy bears, anything possible to try to remind them and show them that they're in a safe place at this point. Both hospitals effectively put out statements or came out with statements last night saying there wasn't a dry eye in the room. During the reunions when they were welcomed in, I suspect they'll have as long as long as they need for the recovery. Their hospitals getting ready for more intake of hostages later on tonight when another 14 are released. So we'll be standing by for that.",

And the Egyptian government official telling CNN that 340 trucks have gone from the Egyptian side into Gaza, though it is not clear if it has actually gone into Gaza, because there's two checkpoints here, one on the Egyptian side. And then when it gets to the Israeli side, there's another checkpoint before this is then dispatched to aid agencies that work across the southern Gaza Strip.So these 340 tracks this additional government official is telling CNN includes at least seven trucks of gas and aid that's going in. Yesterday, we saw a big number of trucks go in. But this if it is true, if it's confirmed, they all get into Gaza, then there'll be at least two and a half times more than we saw yesterday. The U.N. said 137 trucks went in this is we're talking about food. We're talking about medicine. A lot of people have been in this desperate situation. Before October 7, about 455 aid trucks were going into Gaza daily, that almost stopped entirely after the war began. It started into a trickle now, and this the release of more aid and food and fuel into Gaza as part of the conditions on this truce and this hostage prisoner swap. It is as the Israelis call it part of the framework for the release of the hostages. But this is still only day two of that. It is still a drop in the ocean, even if 340 trucks were to come in because the extent of the need here is unspeakable. 1.7 million people in Gaza are displaced. They do not have the basic essentials. They need gas to cook. And yet the quarter according to another Egyptian government official is about 200 trucks. It's about 130,000 tons of diesel fuel. It's about four gas trucks. So it's a small drop in the ocean considering the need here. But it's still something and that is why, Becky, you hear from a lot of aid organizations that say this four-day truce is not nearly enough. They need a longer period. They need more time to bring in as much as possible.",

I think that what we're watching what Becky reported on it makes me nervous, quite frankly, about the subsequent days because those are supposed to be on a daily basis of an exchange of kidnap Israelis for a certain amount of aid, a certain truce, maybe more releases on the Palestinian side.

But clearly Qatar in particular, our ally who's been negotiating this and being in closest touch Hamas.

That's nothing different between Israel and any other country that receives military assistance.But, you know, up till now, Israel hasn't even received the supplemental request that the President asked for the $14.3 billion. What they're doing is they're defending their territory. And what they're doing is they're attempting to try to ensure that Hamas doesn't regroup. They do have to take all necessary actions within international law, as our aid recipients do. And when they violate that there needs to be discussions about preconditions. Once you start putting that on the map, that is incredibly difficult to define as far as what dollars go to what specific outcome. These are for defense systems. And the dialogue on the United States and Israel bilaterally needs to make sure that Israel is adhering to international law and human rights concerns that we have, broadly speaking, I think that should do the job.",

But that does not necessarily mean that collective punishment in legislation needs to be written, no collective punishment. That's a known. That's a known and that needs to have monitoring and oversight. And I think that it's a broader picture. What Israel's defense is doing right now it's taking a pause. It's taking a pause because it needs to take a pause for all the reasons you've laid out. But Hamas is not laying down its weapons. You know, Hamas is not calling for a ceasefire, Hamas is regrouping and getting ready for the fight going forward. And so I think, for Israel, to be told that it needs to no longer defend itself.
