It culminates with the CNN debate on June 27th.Now, while the president was met with all the normal diplomatic pleasantries, he was also greeted by a new headline in the Wall Street Journal, an article filled with accounts mostly from Republicans, headlined, behind closed doors, Biden shows signs of slipping.

It's about shoring up alliances, some of which these allies have broken with President Biden over his handling of the situation in Gaza, some of which are trying to shore up funding to continue coming to Ukraine's defenses. And it's also about shoring up goodwill back home with many Americans frustrated with the protracted war in Ukraine and angry over the fate of civilians in Gaza. Biden is trying to project leadership on the world stage, as you mentioned, drawing a distinction with Donald Trump, his predecessor and now GOP opponent.And in the words of National Security Spokesman John Kirby, he believes we're at an inflection point in history. It's tied to the way geopolitics are changing the way challenges are being presented to us around the world, making it clear what you stand for and what you stand against matters. President Biden will, again, make the argument that Standing up to tyranny is important, and this week he will do that against the backdrop of Normandy, a pivotal turning point in World War II, where American and allied forces invaded Normandy and stormed the beaches and led to the liberation of France and of Europe. And he's going to be talking about the lives that were lost in that effort and drawing the parallels, drawing the through line in the words of the administration to where we are today and why freedom matters so much. He will be participating in the official Normandy ceremonies with other world leaders tomorrow, it should be noted that Biden is likely the last American president to have been alive during D-Day, and he is going to be laying a wreath at the World War I cemetery in Paris on Sunday before heading home.

The new policy giving the president and border officials the ability to effectively shut down the border almost immediately, and here's why. Border officials can begin turning away almost all migrants when the daily average of illegal crossings hits 2,500. Average daily arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico, people not crossing at ports of entry, were last below 2,500 in like January of 2021.The move by Biden is getting slammed by Republicans, saying it's too little too late, and Democrats are divided on this, some of them applauding the president and his move, others slamming the move as going way too far. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. AYANNA PRESSLEY (D-MA):  It is extremely disappointing that this White House would choose to double down on the previous administration's harmful and flawed immigration policies. REP. ELISSA SLOTKIN (D-MI):  It's not perfect, but I am supportive of the action that he took today. REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY):  He knows that probably the courts will reject it, as they did when President Trump did it, and that really throws the issue back to Congress. REP. TOM SUOZZI (D-NY):  The asylum is a very important part of America's history, but now the system is being abused. I think it was the right thing to do. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, President Biden's executive action on the border went into effect at midnight, really marking a significant shift in this administration's approach to border security policy. Now, it does come as the president has been facing some criticism from Republicans and members of his own party to this approach. But, essentially, what this plan is doing. It is preventing migrants who are crossing the country illegally from seeking asylum at the U.S. southern border when that certain daily threshold is met. That figure is 2,500 encounters. If you take a look at this past Monday, border authorities apprehended about 3,500, meaning that this went into effect right away.Now, administration officials say that this would be lifted when those average encounters reach around 1,500, but that could take some time, especially as officials are anticipating there could be a surge in migrants coming to the U.S. southern border in the summer months. Now, there are exceptions for unaccompanied children, victims of severe trafficking and other special circumstances, but migrants can still continue to make appointments through the CBP app to try to seek asylum in a legal way. Now, this will require cooperation from Mexico, President Biden, in the past 48 hours, jumping on the phone with both the current and incoming presidents of that country. But as you heard there has been pushback from members of President Biden's own parties, progressives who are saying that he is simply drawing from the Trump playbook. In fact, this executive action draws from an authority that former President Trump tried to use when he was in office, but it was ultimately struck down in court. Now, Biden tried to argue that he had no choice. He needed to act after Republicans had scuttled that bipartisan bill or bipartisan talks back earlier in this winter. But it does come as the administration is expecting there will be legal challenges down the road. They think this will stand in court. Of course, this is coming just before a few weeks away as this first debate with Trump at a time when immigration has become a top concern for many voters.",

You have warning stretching from Sacramento to Las Vegas and Phoenix through the end of the week. A lot of these warnings last until Friday because we're looking at record warm temperatures. About 100 records could fall both on daytime highs and overnight lows, again, as this is way above average even for this time of year.Vegas, typically, your average high is about 96 degrees. We could be looking at the earliest 110 degree temperature on record. Phoenix, the same about, 100 is your average for this time of year. Temperatures are climbing to about 115 degrees as we wrap up the week. Look at the departure from average. Again, we're 15 to 20 degrees above normal. You're looking at highs in the 90s, even as far east as Denver. That's a good 15 degrees above normal. So, we have some warnings out there for major or extreme impacts for heat sickness. Again, dangerous for early June, not quite acclimated to the heat, so you want to just check on kids, elderly and pets. Also adding insult to injury, temperatures at night really not falling all too much. A lot of places, they stay in the 80s. Now, for a place like Vegas, the last time they had a record cold low temperature was 25 years ago. 1999 was the last time Vegas soar a record cold low temperature. And that's the trend. This extreme heat season is starting sooner. Las Vegas has a fever of about 5.6 degrees since 1970 in the summer months. Well, what does that mean? Well, that means you have more warm summer days. Nearly 40 more days in the summer since 1970 are above average in Las Vegas. And that contributes to the extreme heat season again starting sooner and then lasting later. And like I mentioned, the overnight low is not really giving you any relief. We're looking at overnight lows only staying in the low and middle 80s in Las Vegas overnight. That means you don't get relief at night. It's hard to really recover from the daytime heat and that adds to a heat risk, same thing in Phoenix, only dropping to 85 degrees by Friday morning. The overnight lows have an even larger fever, a nearly ten-degree fever since 1970. Think about it this way. If our average body temperature is 98 degrees, that's like having our body temperature at 108 degrees, so just incredible there, John.",
