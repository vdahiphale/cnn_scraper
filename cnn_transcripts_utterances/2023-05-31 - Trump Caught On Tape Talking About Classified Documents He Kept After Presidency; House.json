We have Athena Jones, Miguel Marquez, Omar Jimenez, and Alayna Treene. We also have Katelyn Polantz joining us from Washington with all the news out of there.So, we start this hour with CNN's reporting on former President Trump acknowledging on audiotape that he still had a classified Pentagon document about a potential attack on Iran after he was president. Okay, so Katelyn, tell us what we know, tell us more about this audiotape, what is on it, and what does means for the investigation moving forward.",

I know a lot of the recent reporting has focused on the handling of documents down in Mar- a-Lago. Does that say anything about the nature of this investigation? If -- I don't know. I think before -- again, we were very focused on Mar-a-Lago. But clearly, the scope seems to be beyond just what was out that property.",

So, whenever we were pursuing the story, we actually had to really think about how it completely changed our understanding, at least.Maybe not the Justice Department's understanding of what they were pursuing, but it really does open up not just the map of where the Justice Department has to look to follow documents, that they have to look at what happened at Bedminster, look at what happened at Mar-a- Lago, where all of these documents were being taken, where they were at various times with Donald Trump. But they also are looking at a period of time that is much earlier than the time that much of the public reporting has focused on, right? So, much of this investigation we knew about because the Trump team sent back 15 boxes of documents in January of 2022. So, that's several months, like half a year after this meeting that's captured on audio takes place. They sent back boxes documents, there are classified documents in them, and then months later, that is when the Justice Department goes back to the Trump team and says, we need you to turn over any more classified documents that you have in your possession anywhere, and that's when things really heat up at Mar-a-Lago, specifically. There are these questions about boxes moved out of storage rooms. That leads to the FBI going into Mar-a-Lago under a court authorization to do that search. They're finding even more classified documents. And so, much of our conversation has been about 2022, what happened in Mar-a-Lago, because that is what has been visible to us. But really, the Justice Department has always very likely been trying to track what happened to these documents no matter where they went in Trump's possession after he left the presidency, whether that is Florida or not, and also what happened crucially as much in 2021 before there was even a criminal investigation as what is happening after the criminal investigation begins.",

They are the types of things that reporters like me work on for days or weeks. And a lot of it, I think of it often like solving a mystery. You hear little pieces of a story. And in fact, there were little hints of this in other publications and then also in our publication and among a lot of the reporters here. We have been hearing about reports that witnesses were being asked about Mark Milley. Couldn't really make sense of that initially. We were hearing -- we know that there was a New York Times report about other instances that people were being asked about related to Donald Trump showing documents and certain specific documents seeming of some sort of military nature. And so, it took a while for me to get to the point where I realized, oh, there could be an audiotape there. And then, you know, there were already many reporters on the story with the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation. Ultimately, Paula Reid, Kaitlan Collins, and I were able to really work together as a team to get this across the finish line.

Next week, on your show, Alisyn, this will not be a conversation anymore. We would've all done it and moved on. ATHENA JONES, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We talk about this being a national nightmare. It's a national nightmare. There is a recurring nightmare. It happens every few years with divided government.

They are lifting -- excuse me, keeping spending cuts in plates but adding a spending budgetary cap. A lot of preserving some of the cuts to domestic spending that Republicans wanted. The Biden student loan forgiveness plan that Republicans had wanted to gut remains intact. That is still in here. And a lot of these things cost a ton of money. There is also new work requirement for some social safety net programs. That was a big thing that Democrats are really upset about. And I have to say, what's in this bill is something that is definitely a compromise and something that both sides are unhappy with. We know from our conversations with Republicans and Democrats alike, a lot of them are unhappy with where this bill landed. Republicans think Democrats got too much.

The two sides, farther apart than they've ever been.And in the House, you know, it's a very tight majority. So, if McCarthy had to push this through, he needed Republicans and Democrats to get this through. He would never have had a bill that only Republicans would support because it was going to have President Biden's needing to sign off of it when it gets to his desk and also have Democrats in the democratic-controlled Senate pass it. So, that's really what the problem was. And I think, honestly, if you look at a lot of the people, the conservatives in the House who are railing against McCarthy and railing against this bill, they are the type of people that would've never wanted to sign off on any sort of bill that had President Biden's input and having his team work on it.

Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, and then Chris Christie at 2%. But here's a more interesting one. In that same poll, this same group of voters, Republican voters and likely Republican-leaning voters, were asked, who would you absolutely not support for the nomination? Chris Christie, 60%. So, that's not the poll you want to be at the top of and that's not to say that's where you will end.
