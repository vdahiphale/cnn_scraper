Just moments ago, a possible disruption in Israel strategy in Gaza. Leading minister in Israel's war cabinet, Benny Gantz announces that he is leaving his position. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BENNY GANTZ, MEMBER, ISRAELI WAR CABINET (through translator): We leave the government, the emergency government with heavy heart but complete heart. We stand together for the campaign for Israel, for generations in order to get real victory. We are going to go elections. And at the end of it, we'll have a government that will have the confidence of the people. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He joined Israel's emergency war cabinet in the days after the October 7th attacks.But Gantz had been a frequent critic of the prime minister, repeatedly calling on Netanyahu to agree to cease fire terms to bring hostages home. Gantz's departure comes days after Netanyahu -- Netanyahu rather, failed to meet Gantz's ultimatum, which was calling for a post-war plan in Gaza by June 8 yesterday. We're also learning new details about Saturday's rescue operation of four Israeli hostages from Hamas. There were significant casualties. The Gaza ministry of health says the raid led to the deadliest day in Gaza in the last six months, killing over 270 people and leaving hundreds more injured. Israel disputes that number, saying the casualties were under 100. CNN has a team of correspondents around the world covering all of these developments. Let's first go to CNN's Paula Hancocks live for us in Tel Aviv. Paula, so Benny Gantz, he had vowed to withdraw from the war cabinet, but has been facing pressure in recent days to remain in place. What more are you hearing about his decision-making?",

Who will be influencing those decisions now? Will the far-right elements of this coalition government have a stronger voice? So Gantz has decided he cannot be part of this emergency government anymore. He has pulled back and he is calling on Netanyahu to go ahead with new elections, something Netanyahu has resisted saying this is not the time, Fred.",

And of course -- of course, Benny Gantz had visited Washington in march. He met with Vice President Kamala Harris and national security adviser Jake Sullivan to talk about the day-after planning and the ongoing talks of revolving around the release of the hostages, as well as a ceasefire in Gaza. Now come -- going up to today, one of the questions that was top of mind was whether President Biden outlining that hostage release proposal would reverse his decision. If you recall, a couple of weeks ago, the president publicly stating what the deal was, the three phases that included the release of all hostages in exchange. Again, for that temporary ceasefire, potentially a permanent ceasefire and then the reconstruction of Gaza. But now we know that that did not -- Benny Gantz deciding to depart the government. Now, as you mentioned, President Biden is on his way back from France right now. He's expected to return to Wilmington later this evening, but up to now, the White House has not yet commented on this departure.",

I do have to think that it will have significant impact on the prime minister's legitimacy, both domestically and internationally as your correspondent said. The presence of Benny Gantz in the war cabinet had granted the cabinet that legitimacy, given it the sense of representing a national consensus. His departure makes that go away.

Itamar Ben-Gvir, Bezalel Smotrich, two right-wing ministers have declared their public opposition to it and have threatened to bolt the government and essentially bring it down if it is advanced.

On the other hand, he's had Benny Gantz sort of pulling him the other direction saying it's time to develop an end game to figure out what the day after is supposed to look like and bring this war to a close. He now has that counterbalance disappearing. And so he finds himself in a bit of a bind. He, I think will be drawn in a natural political sense to perhaps accommodate the right-wing members of his coalition.

And you mentioned Fred that Donald Trump's sentencing is currently scheduled to take place next month on July 11. That's just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July and so, I know that there's been some discussions still behind the scene from Donald Trump's team about whether or not they want to try to shift that day. But look, as we look ahead to his rally today here in Las Vegas, I know from my conversations with the Trump campaign that they really want to look beyond his trial. They want to leave his weeks' long trial in the past and start focusing again on his general election campaign. And that means talking about the issues they think will matter to voters, including immigration, crime, the economy, all issues his team tells me that will be very heavily focused on here and Nevada. But at the same time, I will say we just heard from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, of course, a fierce defender of Donald Trump's. She used her time on the stage before Donald Trump arrives to rail against his conviction. She called it BS -- she used the full term. I'm not going to curse here for you. But that received chance of BS from the crowd and she talked about how they will try to do something about it. And that really comes after days of hearing from Donald Trump and his allies of these this rhetoric around retribution and wanting to seek revenge on their political opponents. Donald Trump himself has insinuated that he may try to prosecute his political opponents if he's elected.
