We saw a much calm her night last night. 72 people detained across the country -- that's compared to hundreds on previous nights. In total there's been something like 3,500 people arrested or detained rather, in the weeks of rioting that's gone on here. And the week has had consequences for sure. One of the business associations here estimates that there is probably something like a billion euros in damages caused to the various businesses. These are small shops, its tobacco stores, it's banks that have been damaged in the rioting. And the local transit for Paris, the local transit authority, estimates that they have suffered 20 million euros in damage to the various assets that have been destroyed by the rioters. Now as you mentioned, were in front of the Elysee Palace here, where mayors -- 220 mayors from across France that have taken targeted by the various rioting that's going on, their cities have been targeted. They're going to gather this morning to meet with President Macron. He knows very well that these mayors may have more influence on the sort of the situation, sort of the evolution of the situation, than the police. Because they know some of these rioters themselves and they basically can approach the parents. And they can do things that might be able to help stop the rioting that's going on. But the consequences are definitely being felt. That same business association made an estimate that something like 20 to 25 percent of the reservations for hotels and various activities in Paris have been canceled as people grow wary of coming here -- Bianca.",

But really is going to get moving in earnest toward a trial beginning this week. Because on Thursday, that's when his co- defendant Walt Nauta is due back in court and Nauta will be pleading not guilty at that time. And he will also have a lawyer show up from Florida at that time. It's going to be a short and sweet and procedural hearing from what we know. But it does kick off a lot in that case where they can move towards arguments. They could move to discussing classified material. And we know that the Justice Department keeps wanting to talk to more witnesses around this. So there could be a lot of things happening in that case. Then in the January 6 investigation, there's a lot there. And prosecutors have been extremely aggressive in recent weeks, especially focused around the fake elector's probe. We saw them offer immunity to get grand jury testimony out of two fake electors in the state Nevada. We also know that there are two people that were organizing that fake collector effort on behalf of the Trump campaign. One who was subpoenaed to the grand jury. Another one who in recent weeks has agreed to be talking to prosecutors. And then they got to talk to Giuliani himself. Rudy Giuliani, the guy at the top of the Trump legal network in 2020. And so, how that all comes together, if there's a case coming soon. A lot of signs point to that. But there's a lot there that prosecutors are doing and then finally, of course, we're almost in the window. Just days away from when the Georgia grand jury in Fulton County is going to be able to look at whether they're going to be bringing an indictment.
