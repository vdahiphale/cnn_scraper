A nice gain, butit has given back much from earlier in the session, just over a hundred points and the markets. I mean, it's still a summer lag if you will. The events that we are covering tonight for you. Rescue teams are struggling to reach isolated villages devastated by Friday's earthquake in Morocco. The number of people who have died is now more than 2,600. Europe's economy is losing momentum as higher interest rates are biting. And the streaming platform, Deezer wants to pay royalties for real music and not just noise. The chief exec explains the expensive strategy. We are live from New York. It is Monday, September the 11th. I'm Richard Quest, back from vacation, and I mean business. We start tonight, of course in Morocco where the military has reached the epicenter of Friday's horrendous earthquake. State media is now showing trucks bringing in aid and equipment to the high Atlas Mountains southwest of Marrakech. It is three days since the quake initially struck. It is the most powerful earthquake to hit Morocco in more than a century. And as I said, more than 2,600 people are known to have died. Thousands of people are injured, many critically. And of course, help is still being needed and sought. There's still many communities that have not received what they need. The key roads into the mountains have either been damaged or blocked by debris. And as you can see, now the work is to clear the landslides on the way to Adassil, a small town close to the epicenter. Entire villages destroyed, those displaced and are facing more nights sleeping outside. CNN's Sam Kiley has this report from one of those devastated towns. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Another victim buried, returned to the earth that killed when it shook. More than 2,000 people have perished in the worst Moroccan earthquake in over a hundred years. Most of the deaths were in villages in the Atlas Mountains, where homes cracked and crumbled late on Friday night. KILEY (on camera): The pancaking of these buildings down a side street here in Moulay Brahim killed 25 people. Three or four are still missing, believe buried in the rubble. And this is a pattern that has been repeated throughout this province. And it looks very often like there's been some kind of airstrike, the collapsing buildings here actually leaving holes as if they have been hit by Russian bombs in Ukraine, but this has been an all-too-natural disaster. KILEY (voice over): At least three elderly people have been entombed here in the remains of their hotel and a fourth guest is missing. After the quake, Sami called his parents for a day-and-a-half. It rang out until the battery died, too.",

I've actually seen completely different comments now from economists on what to expect, so many think that we've already hit the peak, three and three-quarter percent is where the rate is right now for the ECB, that is the terminal rate, according to, I'd say, most banks, but some think there's another to come before the end of the year.

President Trump walked out; Kim basically came home empty handed and yet, he took that moment to decide, okay, done with the US, let's start building and creating a bigger stockpile of ballistic missiles. Let's start testing more missiles. Let's grow this nuclear arsenal. And of course, we know that North Korea already has had a large -- a huge stockpile of ammunition artillery, exactly the kind of thing that now Vladimir Putin needs on the battlefield. And so the fact that Vladimir Putin, you know, is potentially reaching out to Kim Jong-un, someone that in the past, he would have met with out of courtesy, yet now he's asking him for a meeting, asking to make a deal. Basically, you know, standing side by side with North Korea and Russia. Russia was North Korea's original patron. They were the ones that when the Soviet Union collapsed, North Korea's economy collapsed.

Now in the next hour, President Biden is due back in the United States after attending all of those meetings -- the G20, and the Vietnamese leaders in Hanoi. During the trip, Vietnam was elevated the US to a comprehensive strategic partner, the same term it uses for China and Russia. The two countries also reached deals on computer chips and rare earth minerals. Consensus was harder to find at the G20 in New Delhi. There, the members had to compromise on their description of the war in Ukraine. They condemned the suffering without blaming Russia directly. India hailed the joint statement as a diplomatic success as he takes on a more pivotal role in the world. The prime minister, Narendra Modi was at the BRICS Summit a few weeks ago in South Africa. I do beg your pardon -- at that meeting, he spoke directly to China's President Xi Jinping, who notably spurned the G20. The bloc agreed this year to add six new members as it tries to become a forum for developing nations. So Jim O'Neill is the economist who coined the term BRICS back in 2001. I guess, sometimes you just wish you hadn't, but other times, it's been very lucrative and, and well worth it. So you take it with one, and you give with the other. But Jim, two developments that really are. You've got the expansion of the BRICS and you've got, I would argue, the flailing, bordering on failing, of the G20 at heads of government level, what would you say? JIM O'NEILL, ECONOMIST: Hey, Richard, nice to speak to you. Long time to speak. I don't really agree with your assessment of the G20. In fact, I'm just about to write something that will be published in the next few days, saying that the sort of diplomacy, which I suspect the US played a big role of in here might have resurrected the G20 to a more usefulness than it's been for a few years. And while the statement on Ukraine obviously wasn't what Ukraine would have liked, it looks to me like the US probably dragged the Europeans into agreeing to what the Indians were proposing, partly because of the things that were said. It means Putin can't get away with some of what he thinks he can get away with, with his BRICS friends, quite as easily going forward. And that in itself is quite an achievement. And obviously, as we're seeing lots of Western leaders are still saying exactly what they were saying before. But in the broader context, I think the fact that the US has allowed Modi to seem so successful diplomatically in this G21, which is my next important point, is the whole idea of bringing in the African Union, which itself undermines the BRICS expansion, because, you know, instead of sort of randomly asking Ethiopia and Egypt on what criteria why those two countries, now we have the G20 embrace the whole of the African Union. That's quite a diplomatic coup.",

I think you've got the Brits joining the old TPP -- or what we used to called the TPP -- which is not exactly around the corner to the Pacific from the United Kingdom, but they use this argument that it is trade. Is that still a valid argument? O'NEILL: I actually think, as I was outlining a little bit, I think the G20 is a place to discuss really big global issues, however difficult it is with different countries having different political beliefs. You know, in this complex world, where some of the BRICS particularly China and India have become so big. And by the way, as an aside, I don't share the same view as your colleague from Taiwan, whilst China might say nice deployment, diplomatic things, to not embarrass Russia publicly, I personally don't think China is that enamored at all with many of the things that Putin has been up to. But on the core issues of China boost global trade, trying to get fair economic growth, dealing with climate change, fighting infectious diseases, having all of these guys in the same room, which now includes the African Union is a group that is 85 percent of global GDP. The BRICS+ as you might call it, as big as it is, because of China, you know, it doesn't have that many other hugely important economies in, and the G7 is a group increasingly dominated by the US because most of the rest of them are declining economically. So you've got to have it all there together, or some representation of them all there together, if we want to be really serious about all these truly, truly global economic issues, and goodness me, there is certainly no shortage of.",

Now Monday Night Football, which is the valuable show ESPN reportedly pays the NFL $2 billion a year for the broadcast rights. No wonder then that the NFL made an estimated $18 billion in revenue last year which makes it the most valuable sports league in the world. Coy Wire won't need to cable to watch tonight's contest. He joins me from MetLife Stadium where the game will kick off in a few hours from now. This is interesting because the deal for -- that they put together is significant when it comes to streaming.
