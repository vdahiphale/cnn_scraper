One of the criticism Trump's attorneys were making in court today was that the language is very, very broad, very dubious, to say the least, right? The idea that the word \"targeting,\" for instance. What does that mean? The unprecedented nature was something that he, John Sauer, lawyer for the former president, focused on the idea that the one of the leading candidates, \"the\" leading candidate, according to some polls, would have his speech filtered or restricted by a judge.

His mother reported the 37-year-old missing to Jackson police on March 14th but she did not receive word he was deceased and buried in a pauper's grave behind the police department until six months later. The Jackson Police Department says Wade was struck by a police cruiser but it failed to connect the missing person's report with his death. Police claim there was no ill-intent in delaying the notification of his next of kin. The family wants the Justice Department to investigate. In Italy, 207 mobsters were sentenced today to a total of 2,200 years in jail, 2,200 years. The trial was held in a bunker with a panel of judges under police protection. This is the largest mafia trial in the last 30 years of Italy's storied history with organized crime. Also, Argentina over the weekend elected a new president. He's a political outsider who's been compared to Donald Trump. Javier Milei, a former right-wing TV pundit, won 55 percent of the vote after promising to break up the status quo in that country. Keep in mind, Argentina has one of the world's highest inflation rates and the new president's campaigned on swapping the Argentinian peso for the U.S. dollar. Alex?",

Iceland's government says, this time around, the effects could also be devastating, with both Grindavik and a geothermal power plant nearby, which provides energy to Iceland's main international airport, in the possible path of lava. (on camera): The authorities here are highly concerned about the town of Grindavik. It, of course, has been evacuated a few days ago. But also about the geothermal power plant here in this area. And they are working 24/7 to try and dig a trench to redirect the lava if it comes to the surface. (voice-over): Government experts here acknowledge they're not certain the trench would prevent lava from damaging the powerplant.
