The record is clear on what he has done and what the Democratic Congress has done. So, do you want a guy who cut taxes for his wealthy friends at Mar-a-Lago or do you want somebody who wants to bring back manufacturing and build stuff in places like Ohio? That message is clear.You need an energetic, vigorous campaign over the next year-plus and get that message out. And I think the result the American people that will resonate with them, inflation is still coming down, these jobs are going to come online, these projects are coming online. And I think with a good campaign, there'll be a much different view in a few months.",

He's got to rise to the occasion.And again, you know, being out of Congress now, for a few months, John, people out here in places like Ohio, they're not paying attention to every little detail of the political discussion going on in Washington, DC. They will start cluing in, in the last few months of the election next year. And that's when we've got to have some juice gone, we got to have some energy going, we've got to have, you know, a lot of these projects will be coming online, he's going to have a lot to talk about, and it needs to be done in a very energetic way.",

But the reality is, he got the job done. And he needs to talk about that very clearly with a lot of energy. And there's a lot of different ways to do that. But I think we could be entering an exciting time in America if we put this insurrectionist moment to bed, and we move forward with building stuff and building a future for our kids. And I think as an -- as the elder statesman who's delivered, who's -- you know, fighting the anti-Democratic forces in Ukraine, he's fighting them here at home, he's bringing back manufacturing, and he's doing it in a way with a little bit of class and a little bit of dignity, unlike what we have seen so much on the other side. I mean, when Mitch McConnell was sick, he called him. Like, there's -- this guy's a humanitarian, he's a good person, you know, and he's done a good job.

Erdogan is trying to revive a deal that allows grain from Ukraine to flow through the quarter of ports around the Odessa region to then the rest of the world. He says that he is confident a solution can be breached -- reach rather.Vladimir Putin, who blames the West for the deals collapses, saying that Russia is open to negotiating. And all of this comes as Ukrainian officials say that two people were injured in Russian strikes in the Odessa region near the Romanian border. The target of the attacks appeared to be infrastructure around the port area. Let's go to CNN's International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson who joins us now.

Look, the -- I don't think anyone's under you know any illusions about what's been going on in Ukrainian military. Zelenskyy has been firing a number of senior officials, particularly on the recruitment side and in other areas, where he perceives there have been -- there's been corruption, and while no corruption allegations have been leveled at Resnikov.Clearly, the buck stops with what happens in the Defense Ministry and all those commanders under him on his desk so he's asked to step aside. And the man that Zelenskyy is putting in, Rustem Umerov is a Crimean Tatar. He has been involved in international negotiations such as the Black Sea grain deal. He was involved with the Saudis in helping get some prisoners released from the Russians. He's got a strong international profile. And perhaps one of the strongest cards that he has to play is because he's from Crimea, he has real moral authority when talking to allies and partners about the need to help Ukraine get Crimea back. That is something that he brings. But he's going to have to come into this with real energy and vigor because the international community is slowly beginning to potentially reconsider some of the -- some of the aid or the amount of military aid that they're going to give in the future to Ukraine. There are commitments being made about security pacts and that sort of thing. So, there's going to be -- need to be real energy in the defense ministry. And this is it appears what Zelenskyy hopes to get with his new -- with his new hire.",

It's an energy that in some ways defined so much of the 20th Century.And he was the -- you know, that original innovator, architect, framer of rock and roll. He did that by fusing together New Orleans R&amp;B with gospel music and boogie-woogie in a style that had never been heard before. It displaced what was really popular in music at the time, which was jazz and swing tunes and easy listening, and completely revolutionized the way that people came together around music. You know, rock and roll had a huge effect also in terms of desegregating America.
