He's under investigation by the House of Representatives, but Donald Trump thinks he'll do a great job as the nation's top prosecutor. So can Matt Gaetz get confirmed by the Senate? Also ahead, a frantic search turns into something stranger, the husband and father who police say staged his own death. And later, why are Chicagoans spending hours waiting in the cold and rain? Well, they say what they're waiting for is worth every second and every penny. Hello, everyone. Live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is off today. You are watching ONE WORLD. One of the most controversial U.S. lawmakers could soon be the nation's top cop. President-elect Donald Trump has picked Congressman Matt Gaetz to be his attorney general. The move has shocked Washington. Now, if Gaetz is confirmed as attorney general, he would be in charge of the Justice Department that previously investigated him for alleged sex crimes. Some Republican senators seemed reluctant to discuss the choice. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R-ME): I was shocked that he has been nominated. SEN.

And if that were to happen in about eight weeks, that's about the beginning of January, as early as January 3rd when the new Congress convened. So Johnson believes that Gaetz is doing him a favor by resigning early. So it's already a tight majority. It doesn't get tighter.

In the past, Matt Gaetz would become the top law enforcement officer in this country, if confirmed as attorney general. But he has minimal experience as a lawyer, none as a prosecutor, which makes that a highly unusual choice for Donald Trump and one that many prominent lawyers publicly even now. Ty Cobb, one of them who worked for Donald Trump in his White House, saying that he's totally unqualified for this position. Manu just mentioned shock on Capitol Hill when this announcement came across. There was shock across the Justice Department as well. I was hearing that from many sources in touch with people there. People even who are conservative lawyers saying that this is something that is they are disbelieving. That this is truly a shocking choice, both at Maine Justice, in the various attorney -- U.S. attorney's offices across the country. And then that House ethics report that is now not going be released publicly because he has resigned. That is essentially a misconduct probe, sexual misconduct probe that continued upon work that the FBI and the Justice Department had done into Gaetz previously, a grand jury investigation where he was not charged in federal court in Florida, but he was investigated. And there was reason to open that investigation during the previous Trump presidency, during that administration's work as just department investigators, where they looked into Gaetz. If he were to become attorney general, he would be in control of the investigative files that the FBI had collected there, giving him essentially access in an astonishing sense about witnesses that would have spoken against him.",

And that is usually a really extensive process that includes investigations, that includes a record, information being provided by the nominees, a deep investigation by the Senate. And it can take time sometimes, but -- and then there's also hearings. So the Senate has responsibilities. And each individual senator is going to have to decide whether or not they are going to evaluate each of these candidates on the merits. And that's why I think, Bianna, that what they're going to have to do is look at a few of these candidates, Matt Gaetz, Tulsi Gabbard for DNI, perhaps even Pete Hegseth for secretary of defense. And they're going to have to evaluate. Do these candidates actually have relevant qualifications? In Matt Gaetz' case, interestingly, although he is controversial and known as a flamethrower and has this additional ethics investigation, he, for example, has sat on the House Judiciary Tulsi Gabbard, on the other hand, as far as I can tell from her background, doesn't have any intelligence- related experience.

He makes them take untenable positions. There is no way that from a character, intellectual perspective, or an experienced perspective, that Matt Gaetz deserves to be over the Department of Justice. Just like there's no way that Tulsi Gabbard deserves to be over at DNI. I mean, that is -- that's ridiculous. I mean, Bashir al-Assad and Vladimir Putin are just cheering because Tulsi Gabbard has this opportunity now. I mean, and Secretary of Defense Hegseth. I mean, let's think about that. You had his resume versus Defense Secretary Austin, who was 41 years in the military, who worked with the Joint Chiefs, who led command battalions versus someone who was a major in the National Guard, who served admirably, I must say.

Police are asking the 44-year-old husband and father of three children to come forward and contact his family. CNN's Whitney Wild is following this mysterious disappearance for us. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WHITNEY WILD, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Green Lake, Wisconsin, in the middle of August, sheriff's deputies began searching for missing kayaker, Ryan Borgwardt. The husband and father of three had been on a fishing trip about an hour north of his home and never returned. They found his capsized kayak, car, and other belongings, his set of keys, wallet, license, even his fishing rod and tackle box turned up, but no Borgwardt.",

I had about probably 8 to 10 days of just, you know, reviewing the data. WILD (voice-over): Local and state authorities, along with volunteers, also helped in the search using high-end sonar equipment, drones, even cadaver dogs. But Borgwardt's body never turned up. So the Green Lake County Sheriff's Department pursued a different theory. Borgwardt faked his own death and fled the U.S. Sheriff Mark Podoll says a digital forensic search of Borgwart's laptop revealed that he replaced the hard drive and cleared his browser history on the day of the disappearance. And there's more. Investigators found that the 44-year-old moved funds to a foreign bank, changed his email, communicated with a woman in Uzbekistan, purchased airline cards and took out a $375,000 life insurance policy in January. The Sheriff's Office says deputies later discovered that Canadian officials ran Borgwardt's passport the day after he was reported missing.",

The Onion explained the purchase in its typical satirical style. \"Infowars has distinguished itself as an invaluable tool for brainwashing and controlling the masses with a shrewd mix of delusional paranoia and dubious anti-aging nutrition hacks. They strive to make life both scarier and longer for everyone, a commendable goal.\" Well, Alex Jones called for calm on his last show. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Eight of the families -- eight of the families ofthe victims, as well as one of the first responders to Sandy Hook, have been backing The Onion in this effort. And it's really poetic justice. In fact, that's the phrase that's being used both by some of the people involved and by some of the observers of this, because all of this started because Alex Jones lied over and over again about the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre. That's been a big part of Alex Jones' brand when it comes to Infowars for many years. You know, frankly, I've been a target, many people have been a target of Jones over the years. He's all about fear, fear of immigrants, fear of Democrats, fear of the government, fear of the media. But, eventually, somebody had had enough and it was these Sandy Hook families who decided to sue, who had great personal cost and risk. You know, they had to suffer basically again for years to file a defamation suit. But because they prevailed, because they won in court, that's why Infowars went to auction. That's why this satirical news website was able to buy the brand. And if you look at infowars.com right now, you'll see the website's gone. It's been taken offline for the time being. So even though Jones is off streaming this morning saying he's making other plans, and yes, he will re- emerge somewhere else. He will set up shop somewhere else. The big media brand that he built up for years, based on lies, and in this case defamation, it's gone for now.",

The Onion and others were bidding for Infowars for different reasons. You know, some of Jones' allies were bidding, trying to keep him in business, trying to keep him alive on infowars.com. But then he had these detractors or opponents like The Onion also bidding for the assets. And it was The Onion that apparently put up the most money. That's what -- that's what Collins is telling our colleague, Hadas Gold, that The Onion's did have the single highest bid. And that is partly because the Sandy Hook families were able to back him in this. Everytown for Gun Safety, which is the gun control group, the gun safety group, has come out as the exclusive advertiser for this new version of the -- of the -- of the -- I was going to say of The Onion, but it's of Infowars. We don't know exactly what this brand's going to become when it relaunches in January. But as you said, Collins is indicating it's going to be a mixture of humor, as well as information and advocacy. Ultimately, that's why this is poetic justice, because we're seeing another example of how the courts are the realm, the option, for people to hold liars accountable. We've seen this with Fox News and the Dominion case last year. Now we've seen it with Alex Jones and the Sandy Hook families. It is through the courts that people can achieve accountability for defamation.",

In fact, Jones has been dragging his feet when it comes to paying that massive billion dollar judgment. And there's no, you know, no realistic way for him to actually maybe pay that entire sum off. But in some ways, this symbolism, this is a ceremonial win, a symbolic win for the families that is very valuable. We've heard from some of the lawyers for some of these families today saying that they really appreciate what The Onion has planned here. Imagine if Infowars had been taken over by one of Jones' allies and he had been able to just keep doing what he was always doing at his old domain name, it would have been a much less satisfying moment for these victims.",
