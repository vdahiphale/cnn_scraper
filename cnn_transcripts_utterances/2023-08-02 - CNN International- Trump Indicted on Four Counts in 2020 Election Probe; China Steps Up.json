If you're just joining us, let me bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.Ukraine repels a Russian attack over the capital city Kyiv. But some Russian drones destroyed key infrastructure in the southern city of Odesa. And former President Donald Trump has been indicted on criminal charges for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He is due in court in Washington on Thursday. Law enforcement officials in Washington, D.C. area are already working with the federal partners to plan for Donald Trump's court appearance on Thursday. He could appear by video link, but a source tells a CNN that he is looking forward to the spectacle of showing up in person. CNN's Kristen Holmes has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Former President Trump was huddled with some of his close political advisers when he got the news of this third indictment in the special counsel investigation into January 6. And I am told that they spent the day talking about what their next plans were. Not just politically, but also legally. And as we have reported on multiple occasions, this has really turned into one fight, a political becoming the legal. Because as we know former President Trump likes to fight things out in the court of public opinion. And I am told by multiple sources that they really plan on painting this as election interference, saying that this is political. Now while they have been doing that since the beginning of these investigations and really ramped it up after the first and second indictment, I have talked to a number of allies who stress more confidence in this approach particularly after the last week given the recent polling that shows Trump really leading all of his primary opponents. Particularly one portion of a recent \"New York Times\" poll that shows him in a head to head contest with his top arrival Ron DeSantis beating him with a big margin. And I am told by these sources that they believe that this gives them the leverage to say this is political because he is effectively or at least looks like he going to effectively be the head -- GOP nominee going into 2024. Now of course, all of this cannot only be -- cannot also be the legal strategy here, that is something that they will be working on behind the scenes. But it is something to keep in mind here, it's seen going through that strategy, looking at what's going to happens next and still determining what exactly is going to happen on Thursday. We know there has been an option of a Zoom meeting or in person. They had not yet made that determination about what they will be doing on Thursday. But I am told by a source that it is going be a show and they will make sure that there is media presence as always. We know that Trump's team likes to make sure that they control the media narrative. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But however, in that indictment -- specifically on page 31 -- there's a statement that the prosecution is using against Donald Trump where he says, I guess we'll just leave it for the other guys to handle. Right there he's acknowledging that he did not win the election. So that right there is a key piece of evidence.In terms of how the defense is going to handle this, they're going to do exactly what they're been doing with the last two prosecutions. And that is, put it in the media because if Donald Trump is able to win and become the next president, what is he going to do? He'll probably either, one, he'll pardon himself or, two, he'll direct the attorney general and U.S. attorney to drop those prosecutions and that way he is free to go. And that is his strongest defense in these cases.",

It's a part of him framing the narrative that everyone is out to get Donald Trump as opposed to focusing on the facts, focusing on what's on that 45-page indictment and what the prosecution has shown thus far and grand jury has voted in terms of an indictment.

However, I do see this judge expediting this matter in the sense that she is not going to let the case linger and hopefully there will be a trial before the November election.So remember, while Donald Trump does have all these supporters, what's going to matter at his trial are the 12 jurors that are listening to the evidence and are evaluating the evidence and making the determination whether Donald Trump is guilty or not guilty.

Harris has criticized the state's new curriculum that states enslaved people -- states that enslaved people learned some skills they later used to their benefit.

We got an update to the death toll, Max, 21 people are now dead across China, that's 12 in Beijing with another dozen still missing.The storm has dumped the heaviest rainfall over the capital ever recorded in 140 years. Heavy rains began pummeling the capital and surrounding areas last Saturday with the average rainfall for the month of July falling on Beijing in just 40 hours. As a result, you know, we've seen those dramatic scenes of severe flooding. It's washing away cars, damaging buildings, roads. Many residents, you know, thousands of residents had to be evacuated. In neighboring Hebei Province over 800,000 people were evacuated. Authorities there say nine people were killed, six are still missing. And state media reports, Max, that maximum rainfall was recorded in ten weather sessions in Hebei Province, also breaking historical records. Now the good news is that rainfall in Beijing and Hebei is expected to ease today while the storm moves towards northeastern China. We've heard from Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, saying that every effort must be made to rescue those lost or trapped by the rains. China, as we know and we've been report on now for weeks, has been experiencing extreme weather and posting record temperatures this summer which scientists believe is a direct result to climate change. Now the bad news is that there is another typhoon making its way toward China. Typhoon Khanun, the sixth storm this year. It is powerful and slow moving. Now it is currently lashing Japan. Although authorities say that it has weakened slightly. Winds of up to 185 kilometers now. That's 115 miles-per-hour. It's the equivalent of a category 3 Atlantic hurricane. So far one person has died. It's knocked out power to a third of homes in Okinawa. Phone and internet connections have been disrupted. The airport in Okinawa's capital has been closed now for a second day. Okinawa, as we know, home to a majority of U.S. forces in Japan. This typhoon, Max, is expected to move towards China and Taiwan later this week.",
