I'm Abby Phillip in New York. Let's get right to what America is talking about. We are in the final countdown, the final hours, the final eeny, meeny, miny, moe, or whatever you want to call it, we are in that right now, as Kamala Harris is minutes or hours, or maybe she's just minutes past deciding who will be on the ticket with her in November. So, we're taking bets at the table tonight. I'm just kidding. But right now, the choice, according to our sources is narrowing between Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Tim Walz of Minnesota. This is going to be one of those moments where either it's somebody who seems like the most obvious conventional electoral pick or the guy who has gotten us all saying weird for the last three weeks.",

The one supposedly divisive name being discussed, Shapiro, is viewed favorably by 90 percent of Pennsylvania Democrats, 90 percent.I guess the Keystone State progressives didn't get the Internet's memo. The reality is, concerns about whether one of these DEI whites will solve the vibes are based on Twitter brain alone. I mean, that's a fair point.
