That is the biggest concern certainly for officials all across the country, here in Memphis. Obviously, a big concern is the reaction to once this video becomes public. And that is really every step here that has been taken by officials is to prepare for that.And those are the two things that are going on right now. We have whether or not any of these officers are going to be charged by the district attorney here in Memphis, and then obviously word on when this video will be released. We expect there to be something in the next few days, possibly today, tomorrow. But that is something that law enforcement officials across the country are waiting for, and on word of whether or not these officers will face any charges. That is what is happening here in Memphis. At the moment, and as you heard from the police chief in that video that was released late last night, preparing the community for the release of this video. Her describing just how heinous and how inhumane the actions by these officers were. It was really remarkable to hear her take that tone. She, of course, moved very quickly once all of the information and the internal investigation was complete to fire these five officers. Much of what the community has wanted was -- has been to see this video. The family has seen the video. So, now we wait for word from the district attorney here possibly today on whether or not these officers are going to face charges and when this video is going to be made public. So, definitely some critical developments here, perhaps as soon as today and certainly tomorrow.",

The police chief has obviously seen these videos already, describes them as heinous, reckless, inhumane, saying she does expect community outrage, understandably, it seems. There is, I suppose, a conflict here between the public's right to know and any concerns about what the reaction will be.

And so I think they're taking the right -- the right tack on this. I just -- I applaud them for coming out so strongly.And, you know, the fact that their charging or at least alleging that some of these officers simply didn't say anything about it would be an indication of how severe the situation is.",

Are we not going to believe our own eyes?And so, yes, as it relates to cases we've seen, George Floyd is the prime example in Minneapolis with respect to the brutality, the more public gets involved, then really demands for justice, the more we see jurors who are impaneled and who evaluate the case who really mete out that measure of justice. And so here, Jim, I think we're seeing the police department acting swiftly with respect to doing what I think they need to do to discipline the officers and then the federal investigation in conjunction with the state investigation. And I think that will do a lot really to have the public know and understand that, you know what, people are taking this seriously, everyone is looking and it will deter future misconduct.",

Just walk us through, remind us of the difference there and why that is so important. JACKSONWhen it comes to murder charges, you're looking at intent, right? You really charge based upon whether you did something intentionally, that is you knew specifically what you were doing, that was your goal, objective, it was your purpose. That is intent. That is murder. Then you look, Erica, at other things, like, for example, if you acted recklessly or carelessly, or negligently, when you start looking at reckless activities and negligent activities, now you're talking about manslaughter and lesser charges. And I think what the public is saying is that, based upon the brutality and, really, the specific nature of what these officers were doing, the length of time at which they did it, the fact it was described as just using him as a pinata and you look at the autopsy report, the public is saying, that seems awfully intentional. It didn't seem negligent. It didn't seem reckless. It seemed like you knew what you were doing and you did it anyway. So, generally, that is the distinction when you have murder intent versus other lesser included offenses.",

And the Justice Department and the FBI, as well as law enforcement in Europe has been fighting this because you see this group, Hive, and others that are targeting, especially they've been targeting health care organizations and they managed to steal the data and the information for hundreds and thousands of millions of people at a time. And then they use this website to try to shame those organizations to try to get money, to try to extort money from those organizations. And what we know is that the FBI along with working with law enforcement in other countries has seized this website. One of things they're trying to do is, in the next hour, we're expecting to hear from the attorney general, from the FBI director, Chris Wray, and I think the message that they're trying to send is that they're working to try to thwart these organizations, these groups that are really wreaking havoc across the globe.And in the case of the Hive group, they say they're about 1,300 companies and organizations that have been victims of this group, including back in -- a few months ago, a hospital in Louisiana, which said that it's information was on 270,000 patients was posted and was stolen as part of this effort by this group. And so that is what the FBI and the just department say they are focused on, which is to try to seize the money that these groups are extorting as well to try to prevent other groups from doing the same thing.",

Interestingly enough, I've been talking to some the defense attorneys who represent, some of these attorney, they too tell me they're waiting for word on what the status of their clients are going to be today. And then we're here at the courthouse because we're wondering if there is any activity here at the courthouse. The thing obviously is will they file these charges, are charges going to be filed and then at some point they're going to be a time where we're going to see the video. We don't know yet how all of this is going to play out because, really, officials have not been saying much. The police department has not described anything. They have not released any information as to how the events transpired, almost 20 days ago. So, hopefully, we could get some answers as to that, because there are still a lot of remaining questions on what exactly happened here. But certainly significant, that later this afternoon here, in Memphis, we will be hearing finally from the district attorney on the status of this investigation and what is next.",
