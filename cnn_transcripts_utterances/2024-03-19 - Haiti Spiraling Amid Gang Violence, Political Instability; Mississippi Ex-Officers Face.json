So that shows, it tells a story that efforts to maintain and increase access to abortion care in states without bans has improved access. We know that last year, there were more than 1 million abortions performed here in the United States. That number represents an increase of 10 percent since 2020. And when you look specifically at states without bans, they've seen an increase of 25 percent. These are states like Illinois, like New Mexico, particularly states that border states that do have bans. And the reason why we're seeing this increase, we know that some patients in states where there are bans are traveling to states without bans to get that abortion care. We know that with telemedicine and telehealth services, there's been an increase in abortion care there as well. So those are some of the trends that we're seeing. Efforts made by clinics, abortion funds, advocacy groups to maintain access. Those efforts appear to be seen here in the data, Boris.",
