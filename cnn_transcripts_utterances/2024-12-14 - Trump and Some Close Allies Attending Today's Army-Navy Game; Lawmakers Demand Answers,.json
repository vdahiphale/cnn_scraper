So by tonight, things are ending in Iowa, and you can see you start finding some of those icier conditions headed into places like Detroit, rain from Indianapolis down to Louisville and Nashville. Then we start to get some of that colder air in parts of Pennsylvania with some of the snow and the ice. And that's where you've got some problems along the Appalachian Mountains tomorrow.",

All right. We begin this hour with America's game about to kick off. Just moments ago, President-elect Donald Trump there arriving at the stadium in Landover, Maryland, for the 125th Army-Navy football game, which is set to get underway at any moment now. This is the fifth time Trump has attended the clash between the nation's service academies. It's also the first time in over a decade this high-profile rivalry game is being played right there in the shadow of our nation's capital.

His vice president-elect, J.D. Vance, there as well. We also are expecting Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, an interesting person to join Donald Trump because there's been a lot of intrigue as to whether DeSantis could potentially be a replacement as Defense secretary if Trump's nominee Pete Hegseth ultimately falters.That was some of the chatter last week. It's died down a little bit since Hegseth has had some more positive meetings on the hill, but DeSantis being there with him at this game is certainly noteworthy. Also because the two have just such an interesting past given how Donald Trump and him competed for the Republican primary last fall and through the winter. So interesting to see him there as well. And we also are expecting Daniel Penny to be there as a guest of J.D. Vance. He is the ex-Marine who was acquitted this week on charges related to choking and fatally choking a homeless person on a Manhattan subway. And he is someone who has become sort of a figure that is being championed by conservatives. And his appearance here today is certainly an extension of that -- Fred.",

So he has experience there. He's also someone who contributed to Project 2025, the playbook for a Trump second term that he attempted to distance himself from throughout the presidential race, but continues to pull names from to build out his cabinet and his administration.Tom Homan, another individual who contributed to that as well, will be Donald Trump's border czar. And then Devin Nunes, he will be serving on the Intelligence Advisory Board. He obviously has some relevant experience as the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee. However, just another individual with some conflicts of interest getting a position in Donald Trump's circle within the White House because he is also the CEO of Truth Social, that is Trump's social media site that he launched after leaving the White House.

So that was causing some concern last night. It led to the shutdown of the airspace over the airport, and it has the governor of New York today reacting to that, saying that it has all gone too far. She is calling on the federal government to step in. And she's also specifically asking for the passage of the counter-UAS authority, security, safety and reauthorization act. And that is a piece of legislation that would, in part, enable local governments to have a little more power and do more about these sightings. That's where a lot of the frustration is concentrated right now from local officials who say that the federal government is not doing enough to respond, but also to inform the public about what exactly is going on here. New Jersey is another area where many of these reported sightings have taken place, and we heard from a local state assemblyman just describing some of the movements that he himself witnessed in the last few days. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERIK PETERSON, NEW JERSEY ASSEMBLYMAN, DISTRICT 23: We don't have street lights. We don't have anything. It gets dark at night. You can see very clearly were not in any flight path for any airlines or other craft. And you can look up in the sky and see these drones and the way that they're moving, they move forward, they stop, they hover, they move sideways, they stop, they hover, they move backwards. So they're just lying to us that there aren't -- we're not seeing what we're seeing. And more importantly, they're lying to us that it's not a safety threat. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I should say we have heard from the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the FBI. They have told us that they have looked into many of these reports and part of what they said specifically about the sightings in New Jersey is that upon review of available imagery, it appears that many of the reported sightings are actually manned aircraft operating lawfully, and that there are no reported or confirmed drone sightings in any restricted airspace.But still, a lot of local residents and communities reporting these sightings. The spread of it on social media is also creating some of -- a lot of these concerns and questions. So the federal government likely will have to perhaps say more over the next coming days as pressure from local officials continues to build -- Fred.",

And if you're on videotape, that's the sort of thing that could be released later in court. So it always is a risk for someone to do this.

The Alexander brothers, Tal and twins Oren and Alon, are accused of drugging, assaulting and raping dozens of women over more than a decade. They face charges in New York and Miami. The attorney for Oren Alexander denied any wrongdoing in a statement, saying, Oren Alexander is innocent. The evidence will show that neither he nor his brothers ever committed a crime.I'm joined now by victims' rights attorney Gloria Allred. Gloria, always a pleasure to talk to you. This is a fascinating, complicated and confusing situation here. It is alleged to be a very elaborate scheme using dating apps, luring ladies they found attractive with travel plans to New York and luxury properties. I mean, this speaks to a kind of entrapment and trafficking. But is the evidence there to support that? GLORIA ALLRED, VICTIMS' RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Well, that's what we'll have to find out, Fredricka. And you're right, this is about luring women, enticing women, using their position, their status, very, very wealthy men, and recruiting them to travel with them or to them, and often sometimes, it is alleged in this superseding indictment, that they also used party planners and the lure of certain benefits if they came to their parties and to their events. There it is also alleged that they were drugged, the women, and then raped sometimes by one of the brothers, sometimes by both of the brothers, sometimes with a third person assaulting the women after they were under the influence. That it is also alleged that they provided cocaine to the women, or mushrooms or GHB, which we all know is a date rape drug, which is often placed in the drink of a woman surreptitiously without their knowledge. And so therefore, if a woman is under the influence of a drug or alcohol or both, they are unable to consent to sex with the person who is assaulting them. In other words, they're unconscious. They can't say -- if they say yes, it doesn't count. And most of them, I'm sure, tried to say no, but under the influence of some of the drugs, Fredricka, they can't move.
