Moments ago, he urged the Senate to end a month's-long hold on dozens of State Department nominees.A total of 38 ambassador nominations are awaiting confirmation. Keep in mind, some have been on hold for over a year. And for the first time ever, there could be no confirmed ambassadors in Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Lebanon by summer's end. CNN national security correspondent, Kylie Atwood, is standing by at the State Department. Kylie, Blinken said the holds are hurting national security.",

So what he told reporters today is that he sent a letter to all U.S. Senators urging them to move swiftly on these nominees for critical ambassador posts and critical top State Department official posts that had been held up, as you said, some for months, some over a year.In total, there are more than 60 nominees from the State Department that are on ice when it comes to congressional approval, their process to move them through and get them out into the field. And the secretary of state called this unnecessary. He said, as you mentioned, that it is undermining national security. And he said that this is really hurting Americans traveling abroad, it's hurting American tourists, and it's benefiting American adversaries. It is Senator Rand Paul who has a blanket hold on all of these nominees because he is demanding more information about U.S. government-funded Covid-19 research from the State Department. And so that's why the secretary of state said that this hold on these nominees is not actually about their credentials at all. Listen to what he told reporters just now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But, really important here, it won't blow hard enough to push the overall economy into recession.

And they're calling on them to obtain consents, credits, and fairly compensate writers for the use of copyrighted material in training A.I. Also, China's foreign minister has vanished, vanished from public view. He was last seen three weeks ago on June 25th. And the prolonged absence now driving intense speculation during a busy period of diplomatic activity in Beijing. Today, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said she had, quote, \"no information to provide.\" And Sir Elton John testifying in court today as a defense witness in the sex offense trial against actor, Kevin Spacey. According to Press Association reports, he appeared via video link. He was asked to speak about Spacey's presence at a fundraising event at the singer's home in England. Spacey is accused of aggressively grabbing a man who was driving him to the event, which the actor denies. Spacey is facing 12 sexual offense charges by four different men.

But we know they want to sort of give her some time with her family and then, apparently, they will interview her at some point. Like you talked about, the phone call came in around 9:30. She called 911 to say she saw a toddler. At some point, when police arrived on Interstate 459, they found that car and found her cell phone there. Then from that point on, there is no details about where she may have been. And of course, on Saturday, she showed up at the family home. And the family is so relieved that she's home. In fact, her parents released this statement: \"We are so grateful to all of you and acts of kindness, generosity, and compassion you have shown. Our baby is safe. Thank you, Father God.\" And, Boris, we should stress here, if you think about all the people who helped, not only the police department but family members and the community.

And they said that they had finished their submission to the FDA for full traditional approval and they expect a decision by the end of the year.And they also presented fuller phase three trial results at the international conference in Amsterdam today. What they show is that this medicine, like the one that we just saw get full approval a couple weeks ago, can slow the progress aggression of Alzheimer's disease by 35 percent for this drug in this trial. What that translates to is four to seven months benefit for people taking the drug compared to placebo in that lack of cognition and the ability to do daily tasks that comes with Alzheimer's over an 18-month trial. But this does come with some side effects, which we see for all kinds of drugs in the class, including swelling in the brain and brain bleeds. That happened for more than 20 percent for people who are taking the medicine. And there were three deaths in the trial associated with the drug. And so if this becomes available at the end of the year, similarly to the other one, it will have to be a conversation between patients and doctors between the risks and benefits.

And the 79-year-old pilot, she saved both of their lives in this crash landing.There's the video at the Martha's Vineyard airport. This airplane is a single-engine turbo prop. It's called a Piper Meridian. A pretty hot little airplane, about $2 million, goes about 300 miles per hour. What's so interesting is that the FAA and the NTSB are now investigating exactly what went wrong here, how this pilot had a medical emergency and what the nature of the medical emergency was. We're able to see from the FlightAware track that the plane, as it came in to land initially, went around once and then flew around the airport two more times and then ended up like this. Although, pretty good. They say any landing you can walk away from, not so bad. Just sheared off one of the wings. Mostly in one piece. That was pretty good. You can see the track here, though, how they circled the airport after they came from White Plains in New York, only about an hour-long flight. The investigators will want to know exactly what the nature of this medical emergency was and how this ended up in this way. This is the type of the airplane. Relatively simple and straightforward to fly if you're trained to do it. [14:55:03] But the big question is, how much flying experience did this passenger have? Was she regularly with this person on board this airplane? Was she familiar with the airplane enough? We've seen instances where passengers have swooped in to try to land an airplane when there's been some other medical emergency on board. It's not totally unheard of. The company, Piper, that makes these now, they make these with an automatic landing system for just this case. The company, named Garman, builds an auto land system so you press a button, it finds the nearest airport, lines it up with the runway and brings in a landing as smooth as glass. So that's an option on top of the $2 million, $2.5 million price tag for one that is new.",
