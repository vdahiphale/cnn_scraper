New information just in from Russian state media and ambulance crew tried to resuscitate Navalny for more than half an hour is what is being reported. He was serving time in a remote penal colony, of course, near the Arctic Circle infamous for its harsh conditions. Russia's Prison Service says it is investigating quote, the sudden death. But we know of course, Navalny had previously been targeted in a high profile assassination attempt in 2020. Let's bring in Chief Global Affairs Correspondent, Matthew Chance. And Matthew, I also want to bring in our Chief International Correspondent, Clarissa Ward. Let start with you, Matt, what do we know about the circumstances of Navalny's death if that is what this is, at this point?",

      "sentences": "Well, first of all, it seems to be although it hasn't been officially confirmed yet --Navalny's family -- one told that the there's expected to be a statement from Yulia Navalnaya, Alexei Navalny's wife very shortly. And so that will probably be the confirmation that we're looking for. We know that Alexei Navalny has been held, you know, in a very distant, very tough regime penal colony, a long way from the Russian capital right up in the near the Arctic Circle area of Russia. Conditions there is very harsh, but he's appeared in the several occasions, he's appeared on video in court, appearing for court in relatively good spirits. It was just yesterday that he last appeared on a video conference call to a Russian court and he seemed in pretty fine fettle. That didn't seem to be any indication of the problems. He's now obviously according to that prison authority, he's dead. According to media reports, Russian state media reports about the circumstances they're saying the ambulance crews, when they were called to the prison, tried to revive him for an hour, but were unsuccessful. The Kremlin has says that it's as a forensic investigation underway to try and establish what it was exactly that killed Alexei Navalny in this prison colony. But as we heard the U.S. Vice President says earlier at the Munich Security Forum, the fact that he died in Russian custody is a reminder of just how brutal, just how ruthless the Kremlin has become. Particularly when it comes to Alexei Navalny, someone who really touched a nerve in Russia, with his campaigning against official corruption in the country, he was able to bring tens of thousands of people, hundreds of thousands, in fact, across the country out at protests over the course of several years. And of course for that he was poisoned and then when he returned to Russia, he was arrested and put in prison. And now it seems that he has paid the ultimate sacrifice. And so what the response will be on the ground in Russia is unclear. The Russians I've spoken to so far today have expressed shock that Alexei Navalny, who is a very well-known figure, inside Russia. He is the face of the Russian opposition has died in this prison colony. It's not clear yet whether this will spark wide scale protests, or whether it will just be a chilling message to the people of Russia, that this kind of dissent will not be tolerated in the Russia today.",

But if it is true, she said then you know, they will be punished, referring to President Putin, and they should be punished for what they have done, we should fight together. They should be held responsible, basically a -- she went on to call Putin and his regime evil for what they have done not just to her family, but to their country, to the country of Russia. And as I had mentioned before, it's unusual to hear Yulia Navalnaya speak out publicly or certainly it has been in the last couple of years, in such strong terms as these but this is clearly a pivotal moment. This is a moment that I think many people even who were very cynical and very much aware of the capabilities of the Kremlin, we're still sort of taken aback by because why on earth now, what threat does Alexei Navalny pose and again, I think we have to underscore the fact that we don't know exactly what happened, we don't know exactly what killed him. But in the eyes of Yulia Navalny and Navalny's supporters and much of the international community, the bottom line is that the Russian state is responsible, he was being held in a Russian penal colony when he was killed. And so you heard there quite an emotional, she kept it together, she didn't totally collapse. She said what would Alexei want me to do? Should I go home to be with my family? Or should I speak to you and she said I know that Alexei would want me to stand before you today and to say these words, Becky.",

But so far we have seen that Putin has been undeterred by these actions that have been put together by the White House and its allies. So it really begs the question of what more the U.S. feels it can do in this moment. They're very concerned about the fact that the political Opposition Leader dissident had really died in the prison where Putin had placed him.
