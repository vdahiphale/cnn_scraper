Just ahead, thousands of people are protesting across Israel, even after a court ordered the end to a nationwide general strike. We'll have a live report from Tel Aviv.Then U.S. President, Joe Biden returns to the campaign trail, how his support may give new breath of life to Kamala Harris campaign? Plus, a look inside the largest U.S. overreach military base in the world just 60 miles from the North Korean border. We begin in Israel, where tens of thousands took to the streets in one of the largest nationwide protests since the start of Israel's war on Hamas. A nationwide strike is also underway as pressure mounts on the government to secure a ceasefire and hostage deal. The anger, grief and outrage were sparked after the killing of six hostages taken by Hamas terrorists on October 7th, three of them were expected to be released in the first phase of ceasefire hostage release deal. As protests continue today, many are blaming Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for stalling ceasefire talks. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is on the ground for us in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, tell us what you're seeing, what people are telling you there?",

But today, we are still seeing continued protests in this area, albeit in smaller numbers. You can see right here behind me, you've got several hundred people who, moments ago, were actually blocking this main intersection, and they are continuing to chant, demanding the release of the hostages, demanding that this government do more to secure that deal. Behind them is actually the Israeli military headquarters right now. And you can also see on this road as well, this street is entirely blocked off to traffic right now. It is a very active scene. We spoke actually with one woman who was blocking traffic about why she felt the sense of urgency and who she blames for the current situation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And next hour U.S. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will meet in the White House Situation Room alongside -- along with the U.S. hostage deal negotiating team. The meeting will focus on efforts to secure the release of the 101 hostages still being held by Hamas.National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, says the next few days are critical in pushing for the hostages' release. Kylie Atwood's joining us live from Washington. And Kylie, it's understood that three of the hostages who died had been expected to be released in any forthcoming ceasefire deal, of course, that deal is now been turned on its head. So, what can we expect to come from this meeting? How urgent now is this crisis? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, well, that is certainly one of the complicating factors that has arisen after this devastating news over the weekend that these six hostages were murdered by Hamas. We should note that U.S. officials say that at this moment in time, because of what happened over the weekend, there is added urgency, but that complicating factor the fact that the U.S., according to a senior U.S. official, had been working on a final proposal, a final proposed deal with Qatar and with Egypt that they could present to Israel and Hamas. And that some of the folks who were included, some of the hostages that were included in that final proposal, were actually murdered over the weekend. That makes things more challenging. So according to the White House, this meeting today here in Washington, in the Situation Room with President Biden and Vice President Harris is going to drive towards a deal. They're going to look at what is possible to try and achieve a deal for the release of these 101 hostages, of course, 68 of whom are believed to be alive. And they want to do it expedient -- expediently, particularly because of what happened over the weekend. We heard President Biden saying that Hamas is going to pay for the death of these hostages. But we also heard him say that he believes that they were on the precipice, effectively, of a deal, and he hopes that they can get there as quickly as possible. One of the things, of course, that we will be watching for is these conversations between all of these parties that have been involved, the United States and Qatar, the United States and Egypt, of course, Israel and Hamas. And according to a senior U.S. official, if you look at what happened over the weekend, of course, it calls into question, from their perspective, just how serious Hamas is when it comes to actually accomplishing a deal to release these hostages in a ceasefire. But the senior U.S. official also said that this put added pressure, as Jeremy was noting, on Israel and specifically, personally, on Prime Minister Netanyahu, to actually achieve a deal. So, there might be some more momentum at this moment in time. This is all something that we are watching incredibly closely, and we'll watch to see what comes out at that meeting at the White House today.",

That's a group that Democrats really view as a mobilizing force for them in November, whether it's knocking on doors or making phone calls. In the last couple of elections, a lot of rank-and-file union workers have been tilting towards Donald Trump, and the objective today is to really bring them back into the Democratic fold. And you really can't imagine a more Joe Biden type event than Labor Day in Pittsburgh. It's a place he's been on many Labor Days over the last several years, and so as we look for these various passing of the torch moments between himself and his vice president today is very much one of them, and it also exemplifies, I think, the campaign strategy that you'll see coming from President Biden over the coming months. It's something that his team has been sketching out over the last several weeks, and they very much intend to focus on the so-called blue wall Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, those are states where they believe President Biden still holds a good degree of political capital in its places that you can expect to see him a lot over the next coming months. It has been interesting in the time since Joe Biden dropped out of the race, his approval rating has actually seen something of an uptick, and you can expect the Harris campaign will very much want to use him in places where he will appeal, and you can expect that that will be among blue collar workers certainly. Now this is, of course, the kick-off really, to the final sprint towards November. Kamala Harris is expected to be preparing for next week's presidential debate with Donald Trump that will take place in Pennsylvania over the weekend, we did get a glimpse of where the race stands. A poll of likely voters showed her with a slight lead, but her campaign very much believes they are still the underdogs, and we heard from the Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who said that as we head into this final stretch of this race, that they are the clear underdogs, very much looking to guard against any overconfidence among Democrats as they head into this critical stretch.",

I think generally, what we have seen is an uptick in poll numbers of Kamala Harris since she became the presumptive nominee. So maybe a lot of that was captured initially, and so we haven't seen as big of a post-convention bump as perhaps we expected. She has received a lot of friendly media. Recently she's been in the press and the news a lot. I do think that this is maybe where the honeymoon period ends and she starts to receive more scrutiny.

Even so, as you know, Trump has been attacking toward the center on reproductive rights because he knows what happened in the 2022 midterms, Democrats significantly outperformed expectations, in large part because Democrats and moderate voters were energized by efforts to erode abortion rights after the overturning of Roe. Trump doesn't want to lose all of those votes, but at the same time, he's very mindful that he can't alienate social and religious conservatives who were largely responsible for him getting to the Oval Office in the first place.

That is why these pauses are so important are critical, as you heard there -- for this vaccine campaign to be carried out.But of course, Yesterday, we saw the vaccine rollout focus on an area which is being deemed as a humanitarian zone. Not all of the areas where these vaccine rollouts are considered humanitarian safe zones, necessarily. So, this is a risky operation for those workers on the ground trying to roll up this vaccine campaign, it really is dependent on all sides party to this conflict respecting that pause in fighting.",

It's the longest trip that any Pope has embarked upon. Francis will be going to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore.Now top of the agenda of this trip is interfaith dialog. Francis will be in Indonesia, which is a country which has the world's largest Muslim population. He'll be taking part in an interfaith dialog event at the Istiqlal Mosque, the largest Mosque in Southeast Asia. It's a mosque that is connected via a tunnel to the Catholic Cathedral across the road. It is an embodiment of the vision that Francis has for Catholic Muslim relations, the importance of coexistence and friendship. And he will be hoping that this message of dialog between faiths can resonate across the world at a time of growing conflicts and rising religious extremism. Now, Francis will also have the opportunity to support the Catholic communities in these Southeast Asian and Pacific countries, countries that are increasingly playing an important role in global Catholicism. Now the Pope, of course, is 87-years-old. He uses a wheelchair. He's had some health difficulties. Some are asking whether he will be able to carry out this trip at all. Nevertheless, Francis has shown he is determined to embark upon this trip the longest of his pontificate. And he's showing people, those critics who perhaps, are doubting whether he has still got the energy left to be Pope, that he still has plenty of gas left in the tank. Christopher Lamb, CNN, Rome.",

A quarter billion people travel here in the U.S., according to the TSA between Memorial Day and Labor Day.In fact, the numbers for this holiday weekend are really strong, 2.9 million people screened by the Transportation Security Administration here in the United States on Friday, that number even bigger than what they anticipated. They thought it was going to be about 2.8 million people today, about 2.66 million people traveling. The good news is that the cancelations and delays have remained relatively low. They really peaked on Thursday, when bad weather moved from the mid-Atlantic impacting airports here in the Washington D.C. area, also in the New York City metro area. So, the TSA is saying that things are moving relatively smoothly, even though the FAA says we could see some ground stops in places like Texas and Florida later on today, as thunderstorms start to build with the afternoon convection. Things getting a little bit warmer on those areas. Want you to listen now to passengers we talked to at the beginning of this holiday rush who said they were going to take all of those snags and snarls and stride listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They say it's a lot more accurate than humans checking it.

More than 40,000 people call Camp Humphreys home, including the Cooks. They have not one, but two sets of twins. The youngest just eight months old.
