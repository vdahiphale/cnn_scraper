Cuba's power grid fails, plunging the island into darkness. And Simon Cowell says he feels empty after Liam Payne's death, as the late singer's fellow One Direction stars also pay tribute. Live from New York, it's Friday, October 18th. I'm Julia Chatterley, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. And ad good evening once more. Tonight, a blitz across the state of Michigan as both candidates try to secure that crucial battleground. Democrat Kamala Harris has three stops, Friday. She will meet with union workers in Lansing later and on Saturday, she'll try to appeal to Black voters alongside singer, Lizzo, who is from Detroit. Meanwhile, Republican Donald Trump is also set to hold two events in Michigan. He is spending, or spent the morning doing media appearances on mostly friendly territory. He canceled other interviews on mainstream platforms earlier this week. The Vice President seized on those cancelations in Grand Rapids just a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: He is ducking debates and canceling interviews. Come on. Check this out, his own campaign team recently said it is because of exhaustion. Well, if you are exhausted on the campaign trail, it raises real questions about whether you are fit for the toughest job in the world. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So certainly we'll hear more of that today here at this rally later, but the vice president also knows, and her team knows that they need to fortify her coalition, and that includes union workers. They are aware that some rank and file members have been leaning toward former President Donald Trump, so part of the argument today here in Michigan is going to be on labor and manufacturing and trying to draw the contrast with her Republican rival there. But today also provides a snapshot on the vice president's path to victory in Michigan. Of the three counties she's going to, one of them voted for former President Donald Trump in 2016, then Biden in 2020. The other two, Biden won by wider margins in 2020, so this is what the campaign is trying to emulate and build on now, when she is in Michigan. On top of all of that, though, they want to capitalize on early voting. That's what campaign officials tell me, that early voting is the first time it will be allowed in person for a presidential here in Michigan. So the goal is for the vice president to reach these voters, to target her messaging and try to make sure that they go out to those early voting which is why she's doing that Get Out the Vote event tomorrow with Lizzo, so they can pull in that coalition early on in what is a crucial state in those blue wall states, and what is up until this point, perhaps the most favorable path to 270 electoral votes for the vice president.",

We heard him, of course, discuss last night during his speech at the Al Smith Dinner. But now to get back to your point about what he's going to be saying in Detroit, one thing that I think will be very clear is he's going to talk about the auto industry, about wanting to reinvigorate the auto industry. He's going to talk about the trade deal that he negotiated when he was president. He's going to say he wants to say he wants to renegotiate that, it was the one the deal between Mexico and Canada. I also think you'll hear him really lean in to the economy, and probably talk a lot about -- or excuse me, immigration as well.

Fred, no change there, and that much to the disappointment, certainly of the Ukrainians, we can talk about that, but I do think that that point about there being some way to perhaps stop the back and forth between Israel and Iran is an interesting point to make, particularly while the world still is waiting to see how Israel responds to Iran, and obviously there, at the suggestion from the United States has been that could come before the presidential election.

All he said that those he believed that that back and forth between Iran and Israel could be stopped, and he believed and he was quite optimistic about that. It's quite interesting because it actually comes in a situation where the Israelis are still saying they are going to strike back, and they have said that that strike is going to be very sudden, that the Iranians won't know what hit them, I think was something that the Israelis said, and that it was going to be tough. It was going to be a harsh response to that massive ballistic missile attack that the Iranians launched, which did hit an Israeli air base. Now the Iranians, for their part, have said that if Israel retaliates that, then there would be an answer coming from Iran. So how exactly the US president believes that the back and forth can be stopped is really difficult to say. He did also mention, though, and this came to a reporter's question where he was asked if he had any sort of insight into what exactly the Israelis are planning to do and when they plan to do it. And in both of those questions, he said yes and yes. And then he was asked whether or not he would disclose any of that, and he said no and no. And so it seems as though there is some insight by the administration about what could happen next, but certainly not something that they're going to disclose right now, but at the same time, you do still have, obviously, a very charged atmosphere right now in the Middle East, where the Iranians are unequivocally saying that if their territory is struck, if their assets are struck, that they then will strike back. Now, of course, they have not said how exactly they're going to do that, and they also have said that they don't want further escalation in the greater Middle Eastern region. So maybe that is some sort of inroad where the president believes that there could at least be a halt to that back and forth that's going on that really is something that has been destabilizing that entire region for quite a while now -- Julia.",

During his speech in NewYork, Trump insulted Kamala Harris and her family. The Vice President sent her video message to the Al Smith dinner, which is bipartisan and usually held in good natured. Trump said the jokes were written by people at Fox during a visit Friday to the network. He also complained that Fox was airing ads for the Harris campaign. Just listen in.

He watches it all day long when he's not on the campaign trail. And he hates seeing ads that are about him. The oppositional ads, the negative ads the Democrats are buying on Fox. They're clearly getting under Donald Trump's skin, so much so that he says he's going to the head of the company to complain about the negative ads. But here's the thing, Julia, in the United States, there are government laws that basically require T.V. stations to carry political ads even if they're negative, even if they're full of lies actually. These are federal laws that apply to broadcast stations, like the stations owned by Fox. Now, those laws don't always extend entirely to cable news, like Fox News, but Fox News, CNN, other networks, they basically play by the same rules. So, you kind of have Donald Trump today saying, I'm going to go ask Rupert Murdoch to break the law. Of course, Fox is not going to do that. Fox is going to keep airing the ads. But it's really revealing that these negative ads are getting under Trump's skin.",

What did you make of what happened in New York at the Al Smith dinner because one candidate didn't turn up, Harris chose to continue campaigning in the battleground states?

But look, this actually was best for both candidates. Why? Because Trump appeared to be the institutionalist, for a change, showing up being part of the tradition roasting Harris. But Harris has better places to be right now. She's focusing on the battlegrounds, and quite frankly, she didn't want to sit there and listen to Donald Trump insult her to her face. It's probably smarter for her not to create those television images, because those images would have been replayed for days at a time.

So Tinder, for example, has rolled out these stickers that users can put on their profile to note that they have registered to vote or show support for certain causes, like reproductive rights, one of the ones that I really like, although I'm not on Tinder, says hot people vote, and you can put that on your profile. Ok. Cupid has also rolled out matching questions that users can add to their profile, things like, what's the most important issue to you in the 2024 presidential election? And is it a deal breaker to you if your date votes for somebody else in the presidential election from you? And so, these things are really designed to give users a sense of how potential matches stand on some of the very personal issues that so many people are thinking right now as we head into election season.
