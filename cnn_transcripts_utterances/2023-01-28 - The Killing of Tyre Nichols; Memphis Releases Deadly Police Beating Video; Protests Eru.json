So far though, the protests we've seen across the country have been peaceful. In Memphis, for example, protesters marched on to a major interstate bridge across the Mississippi river, bringing traffic to a standstill for a time. No arrests were reported.Tyre Nichols died three days after the violent encounter with police. He was just 29 years old. His funeral has been set for next Wednesday. All five officers have been fired. And on Thursday, they were charged with second-degree murder, kidnapping and other offenses. The first arraignments are set for next month. Now, we want to play some of those newly-released videos. They are, obviously, difficult and disturbing to watch. There's a lot of foul language as well. We do not see Nichols being pulled over for the alleged reckless driving. But, the first clip is from an officer arriving at the scene after he is pulled over. From there, the situation deteriorates rapidly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So, that is about 7.5 hours time or so, and that also imploring Israelis not to take the law into their own hands, saying that Israel has an army, a police force, security forces, who will act on the orders of the cabinet. Now, you know too that there were seven people killed. There were also three people injured. There was a 15-year-old boy who is recuperating in hospital. He's in a moderate condition. A 24-year-old man is in induced coma; he is in a stable and serious condition. And there is a 60-year-old woman who is in a moderate condition as well.

We've heard from the U.S. urging de-escalation. We should also -- I should also say that we heard of a call between President Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which President Biden said -- this is the readout from the call -- the President made clear that this was an attack against the civilized world. The President stressed the ironclad U.S. commitment to Israel's security and agreed his team would remain in constant touch with their Israeli counterparts.As I said, this includes an urge to ensure the tensions which are sky- high already, are somewhat de-escalated. But I think, given the situation where we are right now and given, as you say, the pressure of this government to act and to show that it is good for its word and that it is better than the previous government at keeping a lid on attacks such as this, I think it's inevitable that there will be a significant response.
