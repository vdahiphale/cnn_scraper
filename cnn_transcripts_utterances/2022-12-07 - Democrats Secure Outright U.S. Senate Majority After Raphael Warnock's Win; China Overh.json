Tonight, a Democratic victory in the Georgia Senate runoffcould spell disaster for Donald Trump's re-election hopes. Then dismantling zero COVID. Millions in China regain every day freedoms. And Peru's president dissolves congress and puts the country under curfew, as he tries to block an impeachment vote. This Autumn's U.S. election was once predicted to be a Republican landslide. But in the state of Georgia last night, Democrats put that firmly to rest as Raphael Warnock was elected to a full term in the U.S. Senate. Warnock defeated Georgia football hero, Republican Herschel Walker in a runoff election. His victory was another rebuff of Donald Trump who endorsed Walker and other Republicans, almost all of whom lost their races. Warnock celebrated with his supporters using language which was more suited to his role as pastor of the Atlanta Church where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once presided. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RAPHAEL WARNOCK, SENATOR-ELECT FOR GEORGIA:  Let's celebrate for a little while on this mountain. Let's dance because we deserve it. But tomorrow, we go back down into the valley to do the work. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I want to look at the numbers because it's really interesting todissect, 51 Senate seats for the Democrats, 49 for Republicans. And this basically means the legislation is going to be, you know, processed faster. But I'm interested in the Senate Judiciary members. Twenty two members, 12 of whom are going to be Democrats. Could you tell us how this is giving Democrats an edge? AMARA WALKER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it's absolutely giving Democrats an edge. So, if you have a majority now in these committees like the Senate Judiciary Committee, that approves Senate Judiciary nominations before it moves to the full Senate, then yes, it will definitely make an impact in terms of moving these nominations through much faster. And when you talk about the margins, Eleni, Raphael Warnock was able to extend his lead compared to the runoff by 95,000 more votes he got this time around, compare it to 37,000 votes. I also want to mention, Eleni, that this was really a historic election. This is the first time that Georgia saw two black candidates running for the U.S. Senate seat. And Warnock's win also cements Georgia as a critical swing state now. His win on top of Biden's win in 2020 when President Biden won in 2020, the state of Georgia, it was the first time that a Democrat had won the presidency in nearly 30 years. You heard Raphael Warnock's victory speech there. Take a listen now to what Herschel Walker had to say, the Republican challenger, as he conceded last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I know, of course, his attorneys are saying that, you know, he didn't and they wanted -- they moved for a mistrial on that, but the judge denied it, saying that, you know, he would tell the jury and he did, that they shouldn't put as much weight on that. But this decisive verdict coming on the second day of deliberations, eight men, four women, all New Yorkers, all agreeing unanimously that these two Trump entities were guilty of tax fraud, falsifying business records and other crimes. So now, what's next is that the Trump Organization says they are going to move to appeal. That is a thing that will take some process. It will be sometime. But next month, the judge has already scheduled the sentencing for the Trump Organization entities. And they face under New York law a maximum of $1.6 million in fines. What is unknown is what kind of repercussions that this may have, either reputationally for the former president and this company, or you know, just in a matter of how the company will function.

And yet, despite all of those powerful tailwinds, the Trump-backed candidates lost in all of the states that will likely decide the outcome again in 2024. And I think that's a pretty clear signal that there is a stable coalition of voters in those pivotal states that are resistant to the vision of America that Trump put forth. The last point that's worth noting is that the outcomes look very similar, Eleni, in all five of these states. The kind of coalitions that came together to beat these Trump candidates, college-educated voters, young voters, secular voters, female voters. All clustered in the big metro areas of those states. It looked the same in Arizona as it did in Georgia and Michigan and Pennsylvania. So, I think there's a consistent and clear message to Republican leaders.

And there were weapons involved there as well. This was more organized. This group had actually already plotted and planned who would take over various militaries. They were going to take over the army and take control of the army as well. So this was a potentially deadly on the day plot with wide ranging implications. Fortunately for Germany, this is a very tiny, very fringe group.",

But as the ministersaid, this was based on coup d'etat fantasies. I guess the question then becomes, how much bigger is the network? Have they arrested all the suspects? Are they going to try to root out even more potential issues?",

Three of those --three others believed to be supportive of the group. There were definitely others out there. How big is the conspiracy, look, we know that some of these sort of real right-wing populists delve very deeply and get sucked into these sort of rabbit holes of ideologies and conspiracy theories, such as QAnon and the Deep State running the United States. And the similarities here is that in essence, this group thought there was a deep state that was running Germany. They don't believe that the German government was legitimate. They believe that, after the Second World War, the government that was established there was really run by the Allies that brought down Nazi Germany. There's so much -- look, the reality is most people are very aware that that is just complete lunacy. But these people were willing to believe it. These ideas spread and get traction. So I think the police really want to understand how broad does it go. They did get 25 today. They were after 52. They went into 150 properties. You just have to know this is only the beginning.",
