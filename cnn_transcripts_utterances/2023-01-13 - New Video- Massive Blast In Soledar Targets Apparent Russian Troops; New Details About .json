We have new video in tonight of Ukrainian forces taking out a shelter with dozens of Russian soldiers inside. Powerful explosion that tells a major story. Plus, chilling online post reportedly from the Idaho murders suspect, including a message about, quote, demons in my head mocking me. The reporter breaking the story is my guest. And in the story, you'll see first out front, a man who sparked protest against Xi Jinping zero-COVID policy is missing tonight. As his followers compare him to the brave man standing in front of the tank in Tiananmen Square. We have a special report from Selina Wang. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening.  I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, deadly explosions. Tonight, we're getting remarkable new video of the bloody battle for power in Soledar, as that town is on the cusp of falling to Russian control. We're going to show you this new video here. This is -- what you're looking at, what appears to be a group of Russian soldiers walking along the street in Soledar, towards that building with the green roof. Just to give you a sense of your bearings there. According to Ukraine, the building was being used as a shelter for Russian troops. They're walking, there is a building. And then moments later, that building is blown to pieces. A Ukrainian soldier says they were at least 25 Russians inside that building. It's graphic, what you're seeing human lives extinguished there. But that forces home the reality of the total death and destruction that's completely leveled the town of Soledar to stand for where the war is right now. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, tonight claims his forces are still putting up a fight in Soledar. But Putin's brutal private army, the Wagner Group, which has been leading the fight there, does appear to have the upper hand. Now, if the notorious Wagner Group can pull this off, it would be a victory, a pyrrhic one perhaps for this private military force. It's run of course by Yevgeny Prigozhin. It would be morale boost for Russia. Putin's state television is making the most of it, already doing a victory lap. Here's what they're saying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALEXANDER SIMONOV, RIAFAN JOURNALIST EMBEDDED WITH WAGNER IN SOLEDAR (through translator):  The most striking thing to me is the enormous number of dead Ukrainian fighters. Of course I can't talk about statistics. I don't think anyone can really say. But I saw about 10 to 15 dead soldiers in the entryway of each building where their troops were holed up. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  The situation in Soledar is not easy. The enemy doesn't reveal themselves, because of the artillery fire. So we can't find them. But it's obvious, we've decimated them. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "The defense minister of Russia posted a message praising the, quote, courageous and selfless actions of the volunteers of the Wagner assault squad.This is very significant that they would do this because the former military leadership in Russia is now an internal battle, a duel, against the Wagner group, led by Prigozhin. They're fighting for power. So, that -- that's sort of congratulation is important. But this all comes down to Soledar itself, which has little strategic importance. So, Russia, as I said, I called it a pyrrhic victory, they may win it for now. What they fought for, though, is a hamlet, and they have sacrificed untold lives threat. It's now completely leveled. It's extremely limited if any strategic importance. One Ukrainian soldier tells CNN that when his unit questioned the capture of Wagner fighter there, he told them only three members of his 35 member platoon even survived. That's the depth that the Russians are enduring now. And the incredible failures of Russia's military way beyond this that we've all seen have cause Putin to publicly lose his cool. There was a meeting today, in the context of a consistently stern and unemotional Putin that we've all seen so much. It's worth showing to you. So, today, Putin met with his trade minister and the meeting was about the delivery of military aircraft. And so, let me play what happened for you for all to see.

The target, Russian positions in Soledar. The leader of this national guard mortar unit, who gave us only his nickname, \"Engineer\", says they need help to stop the enemy from advancing. We need 120 millimeter rounds for the mortar he says. We'd also be happy if someone gave us as a surprise 23 mortars. The battle for Soledar rages on. Russian officials claimed they've seized a town. The Ukrainian military insists they still control part of it. What the Russians now control is under heavy fire. Ukrainian tactics are designed to make every step forward come at a heavy price. Despite the battle nearby, this soldier nick manned Sova is certain of how the war will end. To be honest, in the first days, I had some doubts because according to the news, Russia has the strongest army, he says. But since we've pushed them back from Kyiv, and Kharkiv, I'm confident we can win. For the few remaining civilians near Soledar, exhaustion. Nine months like this, says Valentina, flying back and forth over my head. With conflicting rumors coming from the town, Paulina says her family is leaving. The soldiers are surrounded, she tells me. My sister's pregnant, decided to leave. So, we'll follow her. Late afternoon, and Ukrainian marines prepare for fresh salvo with rockets. The battle for Soledar is not over yet.

And I do want to get to that in just a moment. First, though, Colonel Leighton, from the reporting here you just see from Ben, the brutal fight for Soledar, and as Ben said, the Ukrainian tactic, the key one there in this town, which is of such limited strategic importance, is to kill as many fighters of the Wagner group as possible, right, talking about one Ukrainian soldier saying that they had taken -- captured one member of the Wagner group. He said only three members of his 35 member platoon are even still alive. Is it -- is this toll for Russia, Colonel, in any scenario worth it to win at town, that when it had people who lived in, it there's no structures even left essentially, had only 10,000 people?",

And what he's doing is he's finding a place where he can not only make the stand, but take it over. And that is why Soledar has become so important to Putin.

Three of the closets closest to this office are highlighted in yellow. So, you can see that on your screen, because it comes as exclusive CNN reporting reveals the documents included, U.S. intelligence memos, briefing materials involving Ukraine, Iran, and in the UK.

But from the blueprint that we have of the office showing the private office, showing the nearby closets and that we understand that the lawyers found these documents in a closet, what questions do you have now based on this? RYAN GOODMAN, CO-EDITOR IN CHIEF, JUST SECURITY:  So, the big question is who had access to that office, who might've used the office, who's located proximate to the office, so that all of these people do not have security clearances and all of these people do not have the authority to have access to classified materials. That's important as a legal matter because if it were determined that Biden willfully retained the documents for which there is currently no evidence or reason to suspect. But if that box were checked off and then they found that other people had access to those documents, it would really ratchet up the Justice Department's reasons to prosecute if the information is disseminated to third parties.

There are differences between Trump and Biden's handling of the documents. There is also of course a special counsel appointed in each. So there is fair treatment. They're looking into each of them.

They're going to lean on that and using double standard, he's really doing what we used to say is a false equivalent. He's trying to flatten these two events.But while the White House probably isn't worried about the legal question because they have really said over and over, they do not believe the Biden took this willfully, they are worried about the political question because that could play into the minds of voters or make it harder to prosecute Donald Trump. And so, even if it is not a literal kind of one plus one on this front, in politics, that sort of truth doesn't always matter, particularly when lay voters aren't necessarily coming to this issue, but the full set of facts that we know legal folks are and the kind of political insiders are.

But then what's interesting is after that it seems like his life turns around some wide he goes to community college and starts studying psychology and starts messaging other friends about saying, he's interested in studying the minds of criminals.
