And as we all saw then, it turned out quite poorly for them.I think the -- one of the underlying reasons that this is so powerful and it's happening right now is because of the state of play of Michigan, right? So, this isn't Donald Trump yelling about, oh, you know, organized labor is against me and, you know, saying stuff about China, including an argument about China that is completely undermined by his entire policy on tariffs, which economists have said will, you know, actually drive up costs and competition and wage warfare with China. But, I think this is about putting Michigan in play and the power that organized labor has in Michigan, but also in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania, in all of these broader states. So, what we see is Donald Trump raging against a larger institution that has essentially said, you know what, Joe Biden did the work, Joe Biden is who we're going to endorse, Joe Biden's -- who we're getting against. And I think for somebody like Biden, this is a key moment, right? We saw that he jumped into the fray. He called Trump a scab. If you don't know, that's a - you know, an age-old kind of labor -- labor talk. Someone who's a strike-breaker, who goes against the union, an all- around jerk. But we know that this is critical for Biden because Michigan is in play and Biden is also struggling a little bit with Arab Americans in Michigan, black voters in Michigan, and young voters in Michigan.

And now you're going to see that even more because of the strike that happened in Jordan, where three soldiers were injured and 40 were injured. That, for the United States, of course, is a read line. And that is not because of Israel Gaza. That is a very - that is a common misconception. That's because these groups take advantage of instability when it breaks across the region because it gives them legitimacy to attack U.S. presence, to try and goad the United States into a response.

Kim's own uncle, Jang Song Take, seen half-heartedly clapping when Kim came to power, South Korean lawmakers said he was executed by antiaircraft guns, and possibly decapitated former President Trump claimed.
