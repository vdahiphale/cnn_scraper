That needs the kind of support and the kind of really serious commitment, especially from western governments, which we do not have right now. But they have changed completely. If you look -- if people have the historical memory to look at how things were when the revolution first happened, it's not even comparable. And the level of interaction that women have in various aspects of society, it is amazing. They are really -- they are the majority of the university graduates, they are doing all of the things that have to do with the arts they're participating in, which ones they weren't able to. And it's not that the government is happy with that, it's just that they can't stop them. Once the population is aware of what they want and of their rights, there's no way to get that out of their heads. And they have been amazing in doing it so wisely and so properly.",

This has really helped a great deal, because you have to get more and more of the population involved and get by far a large majority.

And that's a starting point for any talks. And then, we had to schedule, five- year schedule, for how to make peace around Jerusalem, the illegal settlements, the borders, the future of Palestine as a political entity, and we got two strong forces against the peace process on both sides. A lot of terrorism. Prime Minister Rabin, whom I knew well and who was there with us, who endorsed the Oslo agreement, he was killed, not by the Palestinian terrorists, by a Jewish extremist, killed during a peace demonstration.

JOSEPH (through translator):  It would be much better if they had worked directly with us. They know they can help, they're just not doing it. NEWTON (voiceover):  We sat down with a half-dozen families, some of whom have received money mostly for schooling.

First, fighting for paternity tests and financial support, submitting receipts for expenses to the U.N., waiting months or years for money that arrives sporadically or not at all. If money is granted, the U.N. decides how she should spend it. BAPTISTE (through translator):  If you get the money to pay for school, and the child dies of hunger when he's back from school, what would you do? NEWTON (voiceover):  By the U.N.'s own admission, allegations of exploitation and abuse have been a predictable problem in U.N. missions around the world. In 2017, the U.N. secretary-general launched what he called a new approach, pledging zero tolerance for future abusers. And he appointed Jane Connors as the first U.N.'s first Victims' Rights Advocate. Her expertise is matched by fierce will to help. But she acknowledges the limitations of the U.N. system. JANE CONNORS, VICTIMS' RIGHTS ADVOCATE FOR THE UNITED NATIONS:  The U.N. doesn't provide compensation and the U.N. is in a position to essentially create cooperation with the member state in order to reach the desired objective. I would love to see more progress, but I think that you can't argue that there is been no progress.

But at the end of the day, as it was explained to us, as it is explained to these women, it is the member states that hold the responsibility for any exploitation or abuse committed by the peacekeepers they send around the globe. The women we spoke to, Christiane, say this is exactly the problem, that the next time you deploy peacekeepers in this way anywhere that it should be understood that the U.N. does accept responsibility. And more to that, Christiane, we were certainly struck by what we witnessed and what the mothers told us was intergenerational trauma. These children, in some cases, are teenagers now. They understand the struggle of their mothers. And they also tell us of some stigma that they go through even in Haiti, because, in some cases, they are lighter skinned, and everyone knows that their fathers were peacekeepers and this is also adding to the hardship, hardship the mothers believe, you know, could really be helped if the U.N. lived up to what they say is the U.N.'s responsibility.

And so, the rise of the IFD and, you know, a political option on -- you know, on the far-right is something, you know, that is still very shocking to a lot of people. And it's a very -- it's a relatively recent phenomenon, the IFD. And I think that, you know, one of the things that we know about Germany is that Germany is going through a lot of transitions at once. You know, it's -- first of all, Merkel who have been in power for a long time is no longer there. So, it's certainly was a transition away from her. Then, you know, it had to really sort of, you know, revise its attitude toward its energy policy, its attitude toward Russia, whom it had tried to treat to, you know, treat as a partner, it's going through a rough time economically. And of course, the IFD is something that is based mostly in the former East Germany where, you know, economic conditions are, in any case, even on a good day, nowhere near as good as in -- you know, in what we might still call West Germany. So, there is an economic backlash there. But also, I think, you know, a slight backlash, kind of a nostalgic major knee-jerk reaction because Germany is feeling it's losing its footing a little bit. There is -- the national narrative is being called into question in all sorts of ways. Austria on the other hand, I mean, we have to keep in mind that, you know, Austria, didn't do all of that work that Germany did on its own past, right? It tried to bypass that kind of collective consciousness and owning of the past in order to do better. And actually, the far-right was -- you know, the FPO, which is the far-right party, I mean, was actually in power in Austria back in the 2000, right? That's the first time that it was -- that it, you know, already sort of, you know, became important. So, they have ebbed and flowed since, but they've been an option on -- you know, on the electoral map, you know, for essentially the better part of 40 years at this point.",

Now, underlying that is the notion that it's a fair fight, that it's a level playing field. I mean, what is your response to that?",

And of course, I have to apply this to the United States. And I wonder what are the lessons that are kind of going back and forth? Is there almost an ecosystem of support? Because I have never seen as much interest in Hungarian politics as I did over the last few years in the conservative media in the United States in espousing and supporting Viktor Orban who, maybe two administrations ago would have been considered an authoritarian dictator, but here we are.",

And I wonder if you are seeing different minority communities even within. And what I'm thinking of right now is kind of anti-LGBTQ legislation, not just in the United States but also in parts of Europe or even really attacks on women's rights in places that we thought were otherwise progressive safe havens.",

And, you know, I think that in -- you know, Orban probably set the tone on -- you know, on this early on, not just anti-immigrant, anti-Roma, but also, you know, very much pushing back on, you know, women's rights. Certainly, the -- in the Polish case on abortion, which has been a huge issue in Poland with the current government, you know, really trying to crack down on it. And, you know, Polish citizens really trying to push back. But, you know, where we also see it where I think is interesting is in the Scandinavian countries, right? So, Scandinavian countries that have always been kind of, you know, trailblazers in terms of particularly women's rights. The pushback in a place like Finland or Sweden isn't just on immigrants but it's also on the fact that, you know, the other here is the women who have taken the service jobs, right? And, you know, in a way it makes sense. It's those places that were furthest ahead like the Scandinavian countries on particularly gender rights that, you know, were the pushback is most conspicuous and it's no longer just traditionally the migrant or the immigrant, but it is increasingly, you know, other perceived minorities. The final other that I would mention and then I think it's taking shape, you know, really under our eyes in Europe is the kind of middle-class environmentally conscious citizen who is, you know, starting to become, you know, a figure of hatred. You know, trying to push an environmental agenda, trying to raise the alarm on climate change, you know, they are considered, you know, a kind of elite that is -- that also needs pushing back on.",
