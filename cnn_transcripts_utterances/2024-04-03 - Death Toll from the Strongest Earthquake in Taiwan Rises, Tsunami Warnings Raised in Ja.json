Rescuers are scrambling to keep the death toll from increasing in Taiwan after its strongest earthquake in 25 years.Officials say at least four people are dead and more than 700 others injured. Rescue operations are underway for dozens of people thought to be trapped in the island's 125 damaged buildings. The 7.4 magnitude quake struck around 8am local time off the east side of the island. That led to tsunami warnings and evacuations for not just Taiwan but also parts of Japan and the Philippines. All of those warnings have since been lifted. CNN's Hanako Montgomery is live in Tokyo. She joins us now. So Hanako, in the wake of this powerful earthquake and aftershocks, what more are you learning about casualties and damage done as well as those rescue efforts to try to find those still trapped under the rubble? HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, Rosemary, we have some details about actually the four people who have been confirmed dead in Taiwan as a result of that very, very powerful earthquake Wednesday morning local time and the subsequent aftershocks. So we know that three of those people were actually hiking in a very popular tourist hotspot in Taiwan, actually in Hualien County, which is on the eastern side of the island. It is known to be very, very popular among international and domestic tourists. It's also a rural area and where most, actually Taiwan's earthquakes take place. We also know that one of the people who died was a truck driver who was hit by fallen rocks. Now, like you mentioned, 77 people are still trapped underneath collapsed homes and buildings and rescue workers are desperately trying to get to those people and pull them out from under the rubble. Now, most of the damage, the significant damage that we've been seeing is in this part of Taiwan, Hualien County, where schools and work have been suspended because of these really powerful aftershocks that we've been seeing. The Taiwanese government has been warned that we could be seeing aftershocks with magnitudes ranging from 6.5 to 7 in the next three to four days. So still very, very powerful and alarming to residents there. We also know that in Taiwan, the defense ministry has dispatched military workers to try to get people out safely. They've been working with local governments to try to get people to these safe locations. But a main road leading from Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, to Hualien, this county that's seeing a lot of the significant damage, has been damaged quite severely. So it's been difficult for aid workers to get there, to get people to safety. But we are seeing the Taiwanese authorities try to get people out from under this rubble. We also know that across the island, more than 91,000 homes are without electricity. We're also seeing reports of how people are still trying to find their loved ones, of course, in this trapped rubble and still trying to communicate just to see who exactly is safe. Now, we are still waiting for more updates from the Taiwanese government about how many deaths and how many injuries we're seeing in this island. But in terms of international aid and support, the Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida, has given his condolences to Taiwan and the Taiwanese people, saying that if need be, if any assistance is needed, Japan will be there to help Taiwan.

We did hear quite a firm message from U.S. President Joe Biden yesterday, writing that he was heartbroken and outraged to learn of the killing of the seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen.He issued a statement acknowledging this is not a standalone incident and that Israel has not done enough to protect civilian lives in Gaza. He acknowledged, of course, that the Israeli Defense Force has said that they are carrying out an investigation, but also said that this investigation must be swift, that there must be accountability and the findings of this investigation must be made public. Now, there has also been condemnation expressed here in the United Kingdom. The Israeli ambassador to the United Kingdom has been summoned, the British government expressing its unequivocal condemnation. The Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, spoke to his Israeli counterpart yesterday, saying condemning the killing of the World Central Kitchen aid workers, including, of course, three British nationals, and saying that the situation is growing increasingly intolerable. Now, we have heard also, of course, condemnation expressed by a number of humanitarian organizations, including U.N. agencies. It is important to underscore that we have also heard from the humanitarian coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territories, acknowledging once again, noting that this is not a standalone incident, that countless aid workers and humanitarian workers have been killed since October 2023, 196, according to those figures, up to March 20th. It is a staggering figure and this has, of course, raised a huge amount of concern amongst not only world leaders, but also, of course, humanitarian organizations.",

At the time, lawmakers said it was inappropriate that citizens fit for service could not be called up. Now men as young as 25 could be drafted into service.

And a part of what Donald Trump's messaging is, is trying to paint the status quo under President Biden as so terrible in order to energize voters to come out and vote in November. They know that in 2020, there were a number of Republicans, this is going to be critical in a state with a narrow margin like Wisconsin, that didn't come to vote because they were tired of four years of Donald Trump. They are trying to re-energize those voters and they're doing so by hitting home, by ramping up that anti-immigrant language. Take a listen to one of the things he said today.

The threats, of course, to these systems are many and varied. Despite all that we've heard of state actors, the most, the principal threat, if you will, is cyber criminal. And you mentioned ransomware earlier, and when it comes to particularly municipal governments, public sector organizations, healthcare and so on, this is probably the number one threat, because this is criminals trying to extract money from organizations to return their data.

Both women are 109 years old and are fighting for a chance to argue for reparations from the state for what happened more than a century ago. Here's what we know about what sparked the massacre. It started after allegations that a 19-year-old black man had assaulted a 17-year-old white woman in an elevator. He denied the rumors, but it didn't matter. White residents of Tulsa banded together while black residents rushed to prevent the accused from being lynched. In the following hours, an estimated 10,000-person mob descended on Greenwood District, completely destroying the area known as Black Wall Street. CNN's Omar Jimenez spoke with one of the survivors still fighting for justice. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
