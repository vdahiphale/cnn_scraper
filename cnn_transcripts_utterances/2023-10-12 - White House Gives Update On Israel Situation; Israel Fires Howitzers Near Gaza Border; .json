They don't want to go. And we have to respect that as well. So we tailor the approach based on what's going on. And what's going on geographically inside a country because some parts of countries that are in distress are safer than others and people are less likely to want to go. You have to take all that into consideration.And the other thing I'd say to your question is, as this situation evolves, you should expect that so too will our approach evolve. And if there's a need to do more or to do it differently, well, by goodness, we'll do that. But right now in the early hours there was still ample commercial flights going out of Ben Gurion and certainly there were some viable land routes. We kept -- and part of the reason why we're doing this is because we have such good communication with Americans and we're having these conversations, and we realized that as the situation has evolved more and more Americans were expressing a desire to leave and because not all carriers are working out of Ben Gurion this makes sense as the next best move.

      "sentences": "We've been listening to NSC spokesperson John Kirby from the podium in the press room at the White House discussing the ongoing situation in Israel. The NSC spokesperson answering reporters' questions. We're going to keep monitoring that.Just some highlights. He confirmed at least 27 Americans have been killed in the Hamas attacks over the weekend. 14, 14 remain unaccounted for, though the NSC spokesperson says he believes that fewer than a handful are currently being held hostage by Hamas. He expressed that the United States is now mobilizing an effort to learn more information, information sharing with Israel to get a sense of where they may be, exactly how many there may be, and to move forward in recovering those hostages. He also talked about trying to offer resources to Americans currently in Israel experiencing difficulty in trying to get out. And notably he was asked repeatedly about reporting that is circulating that there was an agreement with Qatar to hold on to $6 billion worth of Iranian money that the United States recently unfroze as part of a negotiated deal to release Americans that had been detained in Iran. He refused to get into that reporting. He did say not a single dollar of that money has been spent. Obviously, there are still many questions over just how involved Iran may have been in the attacks over the weekend. We want to get some perspective on not only what we just heard from John Kirby but also some battlefield perspective as well, from CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Colonel Leighton, thanks so much for being with us. What of what John Kirby said stood out to you? [13:35:03] COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, one of the things in addition to all the things that you mentioned, Boris, is the allusion to the laws of armed conflict and words by both the secretary of State and the president of the United States that Israel must follow the rules of armed conflict. The White House was I think trying to make sure that that message got out without making it too public. But the fact of the matter is there is some concern that Israel will not follow the same rules like we're used to, for example, if the American military goes in there and the concern I think on the White House's part is that it look good in the sense that if Israel goes in to a ground invasion, if they actually go into Gaza like that, that they do it under the strictest control with a minimum of civilian casualties.",

And the basic area that they're covering is about this area right in here in this part of Gaza, the very northern part of the area. And when you look at that there are going to be some things that they're going to have to deal with as they go into this.You know, if you go into an urban warfare environment you've got to deal with rockets from the other side. You've got to deal with drones from their side. Your drones may also be impacted by that if you're an Israeli. Tunnels are going to be a major factor. Anti-armor attacks could very easily happen. And tanks are going to be actually a major effort in any type of scenario here. Tanks like the Merkava tanks that the Israelis use are going to be present in any type of urban warfare environment and they're going to be present on almost any battlefield that you have out there, whether it's in the north or in the south.",

Are the mosques being used for only legitimate purposes, same with the hospitals, or are they also being used to house Hamas elements?And that has happened before where all of a sudden a hospital will become a legitimate target because it is being used by the opposite side, by the adversary. And that is something that has to be sorted out and it's very complex, but it has to be done in a legal manner and it has to be done very thoroughly, and even with all the oversight in the world mistakes are still possible.",
