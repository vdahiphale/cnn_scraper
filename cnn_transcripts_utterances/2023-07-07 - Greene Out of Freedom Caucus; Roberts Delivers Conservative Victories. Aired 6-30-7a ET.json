So, he told reporters that they decided to remove her, quote, for some of the things she's done, closed quote. So, no specifics. But her profanity-laced altercation on the House floor two weeks ago with another member of the Freedom Caucus, Congresswoman Lauren Boebert was the straw, apparently, that broke the camel's back according to Harris. A spokesperson for Boebert declined to say how she voted at the June Freedom Caucus meeting. Greene has broken ranks from her colleagues in the past, embracing extremist conspiracy theories, even upsetting more conservative members of the Freedom Caucus with her support of Speaker McCarthy.Now, Greene has not confirmed whether she's in or out at this point. Instead, she released a statement saying that she will never change and that she, quote, serves no group in Washington. Let's bring back our team. Also joining us, Scott Jennings.
