Trump this November after primary wins in three more states on Tuesday, put both candidates over the top, securing enough delegates to win their party's presidential nominations. Now, projected win in Washington state made it official for Donald Trump. His last remaining Republican challenger, you'll remember Nikki Haley, dropped out of the race last week. And President Joe Biden wrapped things up with a win in Georgia. He will officially be nominated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August. Now, polls show. Voters are concerned about Biden's age, and many in his own party disapprove of his handling of the war in Gaza. Meantime, Trump is facing 91 felony charges for his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, mishandling classified documents and covering up hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels. The former president just posted this reaction on social media a few moments ago.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, U.S. REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE: It's your favorite president speaking to you on a really great day of victory.

He said that he believes that the country is in the middle of a comeback. But he also goes on to say in this statement, amid this progress, we face a sobering reality.Freedom and democracy are at risk here at home in a way they have not been since the Civil War. Donald Trump is running a campaign of resentment, revenge and retribution that threatens the very idea of America. Voters now have a choice to make. About the future of this country. Are we going to stand up and defend our democracy or let others tear it down? Now, the Biden campaign going into Tuesday fully expected that the president was going to cross that delegates threshold. But the fact that it was a state of Georgia that put the president over the top is basically a cherry on top for this campaign. Of course, President Biden ended up defeating former President Donald Trump in that state back in 2020. And that marked the first time that a Democratic presidential candidate had won that state in 28 years. And there's no question that the Biden campaign continues to see that state as a battleground state going into November. They would very much like to win that state. It's not a coincidence that the president travelled to Georgia this weekend as he kicked off his post State of the Union tour. Now, zooming out Tuesday night was not only just a symbolically important moment for the campaign, but campaign officials saying that they are hoping that the events of Tuesday night will help some voters who have so far been tuned out of the election see and realize for the first time that the 2024 election is, in fact, going to be between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

And Trump, as we saw in the primaries, continues to face substantial resistance among white-collar, right- leaning voters who normally have pulled the, you know, pulled the lever for Republicans, but are resistant to him.We're likely, as you say, to have this come down again to six or seven swing states at most. There were five states that decided 2020 by swinging from Trump in 16 to Biden in 20. Those were Arizona and Georgia in the Sun Belt, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania in the Rust Belt. Those are the absolute core heart of this election. Maybe Nevada for the Republicans to put in play, maybe North Carolina for the Democrats to put in play. Beyond that, we're, you know, probably our people, it could be as little as 250 or 300,000 people in those handful of states that decide our direction. Biden is facing a lot of discontent over his performance and his age, but that doesn't mean there is a majority of Americans who want to live in the America that Trump is sketching out. And we saw, in fact, the opposite in 1820 and 2022. There is substantial resistance to him, even among voters, even among a surprising number of voters who are discontented with Biden's performance and the way things are going.

But the leadership, especially the Speaker, and the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, are against this aid. So, the Speaker needs to bring it to the floor. And if he doesn't bring it to the floor, there's no vote unless Congress uses other means, including what's known as a discharge petition, which is now underway. That takes time. It takes a bit of jumping through hoops. It's really a last resort. But I'm told by both Democratic and Republican lawmakers that they're willing to try that last resort. We'll see if it works.

You heard that correctly. He said that Trump said, quote unquote, \"Hitler did some good things.\" And John Kelly, when he heard that, said, \"What good things?\" And Trump said, \"Well, he rebuilt the German economy.\" Reminded him that, well, he used that rebuilt economy to launch war on Europe, the bloodiest war in human history, not to mention carrying out the Holocaust.And Kelly said to me, I can't believe he, in effect, forgot the Holocaust. Trump went on, said that Hitler's generals were more loyal to him, a complaint that Trump would make about his own generals not being loyal enough to him. But the concern is that beyond that fundamental misunderstanding of Hitler and alarming, appalling praise for him, that Trump has this admiration, this affinity for other of today's despots, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un. And his advisors say he was just fascinated by them, felt that he could have a good relationship with them, and to a large degree envied their power. So the choice that American voters face in the fall whatever your politics are, is a very real one in terms of how the U.S. approaches the world, its adversaries, but also its allies. And this should be a concern for Europe because, as advisors tell me in a second term, Donald Trump would be very likely to attempt to take the U.S. out of NATO, as well as other long-lasting, decades-old security agreements, such as with South Korea or with Japan.

The council will be tasked with appointing an interim prime minister and establishing a provisional electoral council to facilitate free and fair elections.The UN welcomed the new developments but says it's hard to predict if it'll help end the violence. CNN's Patrick Oppmann takes a look now at how Haiti will now move towards hopefully some stability. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN HAVANA-BASED CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  For more than a week, Haiti's marauding gangs prevented Prime Minister Ariel Henry from returning to the country he was supposed to lead. Until finally, Henry reached a breaking point and agreed on Monday night to resign. ARIEL HENRY, HAITIAN PRIME MINISTER (through translator): My government will leave immediately after the inauguration of the council. We will be a caretaker government until they name a prime minister and a new cabinet. Haiti needs peace. Haiti needs stability.

Haiti to Kenya to sign an agreement with the government there to provide troops to fight the out-of-control gangs terrorizing his beleaguered nation. Once he left, the gangs united to further batter the Haitian government in a series of coordinated attacks. The latest explosion of violence leading to a massive jailbreak that freed thousands of prisoners closed the country's main airport indefinitely and forced the United States and other embassies to evacuate diplomats via helicopter.  The news of Henry's impending resignation is not placating the leaders of gangs, though, who have threatened an all-out civil war.

Using hunger and sexual violence as weapons of war. Bodies of their victims lie uncollected on streets. On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with regional leaders in Jamaica and announced an increase in U.S. funding to the security mission to be led by Kenyan troops. ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I'm announcing today that the United States Department of Defense is doubling its approved support for the mission from $100 million to $200 million.
