      "sentences": "-- NEWSROOM. I'm Alex Marquardt in New York, in tonight for Jim Acosta. Thank you very much for joining me.We have breaking news. Polls are about to close in the nation's first official Democratic primary of this 2024 presidential campaign season. Tonight, 55 delegates are up for grabs in South Carolina, which you may recall propelled President Biden to the 2020 nomination after a series of bruising defeats. Now Biden is far and away the overwhelming favorite in tonight's primary. He is facing minimal competition from Minnesota Congressman Dean Philips and author Marianne Williamson. We will continue to monitor those South Carolina results as they come in and bring you complete up-to-the-minute analysis. But first, we are also following breaking news in the Middle East where Iran-backed Houthi rebels are vowing tonight to retaliate after a new round of airstrikes by the U.S. and the United Kingdom in Yemen. They were also supported by several other countries. Today the Houthis -- sorry, the group of countries hit at least 30 Houthi targets across more than a dozen different locations. Senior Biden administration officials say that President Biden approved these strikes earlier in the week. Now, all of this is coming just a day after the U.S. launched other airstrikes. Those were retaliatory strikes against Iran-backed militants in both Iraq and in Syria. Those followed the deadly drone attack last weekend on Sunday on U.S. troops in Jordan that left three American service members dead. CNN's international diplomatic editor Nic Robertson is live in Israel with more on what this could mean for the region. But first, let's get straight to CNN's Oren Lieberman at the Pentagon. So, Oren, unlike last night's strikes in Iraq and Syria, today's the U.S. did not conduct alone.",

      "sentences": "That's right. This was one against conducted with the U.K. This is the third time the two nations have operated together to strike Houthi targets in Yemen. The message effectively coming out together from these countries, saying that they find the ongoing attacks from the Iran-backed rebel group on international shipping completely unacceptable, especially because they have targeted U.S. and U.K. commercial vessels and warships.Now, it is worth noting here that there were a number of countries backing them including Australia, Bahrain, Denmark, Canada, the Netherlands and New Zealand, offering not only diplomatic support but different kinds of perhaps operational or logistical support for this operation. And we've seen that happen as well. A measure of how grave not just the U.S. and the U.K. view this but also all of these other countries involved because of the effect that the Houthi attacks have had on the global economy, on international shipping, considering they have targeted some of the world's most important international waterways. This set of targets, 36 targets across 13 different locations in Yemen, according to U.S. Central Command. And the list of different types of targets here, I'll read this off from their statement. Multiple underground storage facilities, command and control, missile systems, UAV storage and operation sites, radars and helicopters. And these pictures you see on your screen now, these are FA-18 fighter jets launching from the deck of the Ike as well as a destroyer here launching tomahawk cruise missiles. All of that part of this attack here. And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin warning that if the attacks on international shipping don't stop then these strikes on Houthi weaponry will continue. And again, it's noteworthy here that it's not just this joint operation here. The U.S. struck drones and anti-ship cruise missiles over the course of the last 24, 36 hours. So this is a much broader effort here. Alex, I'll make one final point here. You said in the intro here that President Joe Biden had approved this earlier in this week and that's just as he approved earlier in this week the strikes in Iraq and Syria. This is how gravely the U.S. and the Biden administration view this, a determination to keep getting after this problem even if the Houthis and some of the Iranian-backed militias in Iraq and Syria vow to continue their attacks. The U.S. not deterred from acting here as well. And finally, I'll point out that in Iraq and Syria, Austin says, U.S. operations there, the U.S. response to the attack last Sunday that killed three U.S. service members, wounded scores more, that's not over yet.",

      "sentences": "And big questions about to what extent Iran is trying to resupply those Houthis as they continue their fight.Nic Robertson in Tel Aviv, Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon, thank you both. Let's bring in our panel of experts for more on this. Joining me now is CNN global affairs analyst Kim Dozier and CNN military analyst, Lieutenant General Mark Hertling. Thank you both for being with me. General Hertling, I want to start with you just because we heard Oren Liebermann rattle off that list of targets including underground facilities, missile systems, storage sites. This seems like a rather broad range of targets, some 36 of them in 13 different locations. So to what extent do you think, General, that the U.S. and its coalition partners have been effective at degrading Houthi capabilities? Because it doesn't seem like they've been effective at deterring them. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, I believe, based on the number of targets and the type of weaponry that was used, based on what the over-the-counter intelligence is saying, the so-called OCIN, that it was both an air and cruise missile strike, Alex. So that's going to strike a lot of targets that are conducive to the Houthis continuing to attack the sea-based platforms, the shipping that's going through the area. They talked about the underground targets. When you're discussing any force that lives and fights in the deserts like the Houthis do, there's no cover and concealment for the kind of equipment or the ammo caches they have. So the type of attacks have to strike into these deeply buried targets. We're seeing that in Israel in Gaza with what the IDF is fighting against Hamas. The Houthis use the same kind of approach where they bury the things they're using, the rockets, the missiles, the equipment. So it's much more difficult to strike and destroy those targets, but I think with what we're talking about here, the number of aircraft and sea-launch ballistic missiles that have gone into the strike, I would suggest they have been deteriorated quite a bit tonight. And this is, again, the first night against the Houthis. There's going to be more.",

Like taking powerful enough action to not escalate, and there has been some criticism that those two things are essentially in conflict with each other. So moving from the Red Sea and the Houthis up to Iraq and Syria, we saw a rather powerful set of strikes last night, seven different facilities, 85 different targets against these Iranian-backed groups.The Biden administration making clear they see this just as an opening response for that strike last weekend by militants that killed three American service members. How do you think the Biden administration is walking this line in carrying out powerful, they hope deterrent strikes while also not going beyond what they feel would be a line that would causes escalation?",

      "sentences": "Yes, you bring up a very good point, Alex. This is not a proportional response. This is total destruction of some of the equipment of both the Houthis and the PMFs in Iraq and Syria. That's what I think is needed truthfully. You know, for all of the individuals who are saying strike Tehran, strike inside of Iran, what I suggest from a military doctrinal and theoretical perspective, hate to get deep on all of us here, but the center of gravity of the Iranian government are these PMFs, are these proxy forces.So if you can destroy or at least hinder their continued operation, it causes the regime in Iran to think twice. This is their strength. This is how they conduct strategy by deploying these multi-phased rebel groups as well as supporting elements like the Houthis in Yemen, like Hezbollah in northern Israel and southern Lebanon. Those are their kingpins. That's who they rely on. So the continued strikes against those groups will actually deter the Iranian regime. It's a smart move in my view from a military perspective. Is it going to completely destroy them as Israel said they want to do to Hamas? No, it's not. You know, what might be interesting, Alex, is the day after these strikes occur, there may be a missile shot at a seaborne vehicle in the Red Sea. We have to expect that. They will continue to fight on, but I think each one of these strikes that are being conducted against these Iranian proxies is depleting their capability and they believe that, and so do the Quds Force that are supporting them.",

They are saying the U.S. is being irresponsible, the U.S. has taken aggressive action, and that plays across the Middle East and parts of the global south really well. It makes the U.S. look like the bad guy again. Iran, what it usually does is strikes in secret, waits until later, bides its time. It's going to see how all these strikes add up in both Iraq and Syria and Yemen.And its long-term strategy is if it could get U.S. troops out of Iraq, for instance, one of its major areas of influence, that would mean they have greater control over the Iraqi government. Whereas, while the Iraqi leadership is saying they want the U.S. out, if you talk to Iraqi officials privately they want to keep U.S. troops on the ground because essentially they play Washington off of Tehran. Take Washington out of that equation, they could get gobbled up by the Iranian regime.",

I mean, you know, traditionally Democrats have worried pretty much solely about mobilizing black voters, maximizing turnout, and the question was whether people would show up.This year Biden has an issue as well with persuasion. I mean he faces the risk, given the discontent over his performance, and particularly about the economy and inflation and the strain that it puts on voters near the median income of any race. He faces a risk of potentially a significant gender gap among black voters. I mean there are some indications, you know, in polling so far that the gender gap among both black and brown voters could be bigger than among white voters. So he has some work to do not only on the usual front the Democrats worry about of ginning up excitement but he also has work to do about reeling back in some black male voters and Hispanic males over when polls are expressing dissatisfaction with his record and some receptivity and openness to Donald Trump.",

Dean Phillips, of course, a Minnesota member of Congress, tried to spark a conversation. He tried to spark a competition inside the Democratic primary base, but it really just never happened.So we will see how he does tonight in South Carolina, but he campaigned so aggressively in New Hampshire and, of course, that was a write-in vote for Joe Biden but it's hard to imagine him doing any better. Look, but one thing it does overall, the fact that President Biden has escaped a serious primary challenge is so significant for him. History will show that when a president has a primary challenge, they have a general election problem on their hands. So by escaping a serious primary challenge that is probably one of the best things that this White House has going for it. But, look, Dean Phillips has spent a lot of money. It's hard to imagine him doing much tonight but we shall see. But as Ron was saying, what the Biden campaign and the White House is looking for is to spark some interest and enthusiasm particularly among black voters, that they're listening to his message. But the turnout is not expected to be very high. I mean the early voting and absentee voting was actually higher than four years ago, but that was a very aggressive campaign. So we shall see tonight, but the reality is, I'm not sure we'll be able to draw all that much from the results tonight in South Carolina, how it speaks to the bigger challenges here facing the White House.",

The younger voters we speak to, yes, in Michigan but beyond that, they have real reservations about what this administration, what this president has done in terms of a full embrace of Israel. Now we have seen, you know, a shifting in language and we saw theexecutive order this week, but that did very little to ease some of these concerns. So I think the biggest question of all facing the president over the next nine months, can he build, can he re-piece together that coalition that really sent him to the White House of younger voters, older voters, certainly Latino voters, black voters. And there are real concerns about that. I talked to a reverend in Detroit just a couple of days ago and he said that there is, you know, economic concerns, sure, but simply voters do not know necessarily exactly what this administration did. They still remember in some respects the checks that Donald Trump sent out. Of course, the Biden administration has passed significant legislation, but it's been so huge in many respects from infrastructure, other things that people don't necessarily know how it's affecting them. So the burden and the challenge is on this White House to make that case. But this coalition is certainly a challenge for the president to rebuild.",

A Republican, longtime Republican, but now says that he is worried about the future of American democracy, the preservation of our Constitution, and that is why he is supporting this president. We also spoke to a number of Black voters and their view is entirely mixed, Alex. One woman telling us that she was not feeling that she was economically suffering, and that she is tired of historically voting for Democrats and feeling like she isn't getting that much from him. But other people who are really excited about President Biden, especially because he was former President Barack Obama's vice president, and then more pragmatic voters, we heard from Alex who say that they are really principally worried about Trump returning to the White House. But this was not a surprising outcome tonight, but really still a consequential state for President Biden. This was the state that resurrected his campaign in 2020, and so we are going to get the sense as we really comb through these results here what Black voter sentiment is in this region, and perhaps throughout the country -- Alex.

She has been essentially weaponized by Republicans. We've heard Nikki Haley who is also still in the race in South Carolina, and to people who may be wondering what is happening on the Republican side, we should point out the Republican primary is not until February 24th, so that's a few more weeks here to campaign. But she has been, Nikki Haley, the former governor there, has been campaigning aggressively against Kamala Harris saying a vote for Joe Biden is a vote for a President Harris. So she has been weaponized by Republicans, but she is essentially the weapon for Democrats to drum up a turnout. So this is something that we're going to be watching over the next nine months, what role she is going to play in this campaign. It is a very big one, of course, for President Biden. But as Eva was saying, four years ago, tonight, it revived and relaunched Joe Biden's path to the White House. They're hoping it does the same thing tonight, but boy, things are so much different than they were four years ago, not just on the policy set and things happening around the world, but for the president himself, he is a very different candidate.

When voters are concerned about their lives, they are not too concerned about the candidates. They want to know what the candidates are going to do for them. It's about the future. Are we going to restore Roe as the law of the land so that women can have their fundamental rights again? Are we going to continue to lower costs for Americans like the president has done by capping the cost of insulin and taking on big pharma and winning? Are we going to ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines? Only one candidate is going to continue this work, and that's Joe Biden. Donald Trump is out here every single day rooting for the economy to crash. He is pledging the rules as dictator on day one. He is trying to take away, you know, the Affordable Care Act once again. So as it relates to the voters, the choice is going to be fundamentally clear to them on Election Day, and the only choice is going to be Joe Biden.",

Now two senior administration officials tell me that President Biden gave the greenlight for these strikes in Yemen to occur earlier this week. This is part of these multilateral strikes that have been going as part of this coalition of countries to defend vessels in the Red Sea, including commercial ships against Houthi actions. Now, those two senior administration officials also telling me that these are separate from the retaliatory measures that we saw happen just yesterday when the US hit those targets in Iraq and Syria, and that this is again part of the actions by this coalition to deter Houthis from their activities. Now, whether or not that is having an effect remains to be seen. The activity has continued. They have continued to try to strike these vessels, but the US and its partner countries making clear here that they will not stand for it engaging in these strikes. But again, Alex, to your earlier point, all of this colliding today as the president is also attending a campaign fundraiser here in Los Angeles while also trying to avoid a wider regional war in the Middle East.",

He reflects on 2020, when the state really turned the tide for him during that election. He has repeatedly credited the state for helping launch him to victory in November of 2020. And he says some of the same in this statement, going on to say that: \"Now, in 2024, for the people of South Carolina have spoken again, and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the presidency again and making Donald Trump a loser again.\" Now, this is a language that the president has started to use more often and drawing a contrast with former President Donald Trump. I was with President Biden in South Carolina last week where he was energizing or at least, he is trying to energize and mobilize Black voters to the polls today. It seems as though he did just that based off the interview with Michael Tyler earlier in which they are seeing more Black voters make up the electorate this time around than in 2020.",
