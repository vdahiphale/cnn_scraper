In Lebanon and in Gaza, the human toll of Israel's war grows more shocking. Overnight, at least one person was killed and five injured in a series of airstrikes in Beirut's southern suburbs. The Lebanese health ministry calls them the most violent since fighting began, as well as reporting hospitals being targeted. And Gaza is at the breaking point, that's according to a U.N. report which warns that Israel is bombing measurements for life expectancy, education, standard of living, back to 1955 levels. The IDF justifies its attacks, claiming Hamas and Hezbollah are deeply embedded amongst civilians, which makes an exclusive new report particularly horrifying. Correspondent Jeremy Diamond investigates claims that Israel is forcing Palestinians to act as human shields in Gaza to avoid putting their own troops in harm's way. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  They walked through the rubble at gunpoint into potentially booby-trapped buildings and down darkened tunnels. Some were teenagers like 17-year-old Mohamed (ph). MOHAMED (PH) (through translator):  I was handcuffed and wearing nothing but my boxers. DIAMOND (voice-over):  Others, like Abu Ali Yassin (ph) were grandparents. ABU ALI YASSIN (PH) (through translator):  They placed me in areas where I could be exposed to gunfire. DIAMOND (voice-over):  These five Palestinians, all civilians, say the Israeli military detained them and used them as human shields in Gaza. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  We were forced to enter homes. Each time, our lives we at risk. We feared death. We were afraid something might happen. They would ask us to do thing like, \"move this carpet,\" saying they were looking for tunnels. DIAMOND (voice-over):  Now, for the first time on camera, an Israeli soldier is coming forward with his own account, describing how his infantry unit used two Palestinians as human shields.",

And in the case of tariffs, there is nothing that has a more immediate impact when you're trying to get a third-party to the table to discuss an issue of vital importance to U.S. interests than to threaten tariffs and to, in fact, temporarily impose them, if necessary, in order to extract the behavior you want. I saw a firsthand example of that with the automobile manufacturers in Europe, when we threatened tariffs, and they came to the table within days.

So, that's one thing. The next thing is the huge amount of information, evidence and facts that are coming out about Trump's anti-democratic leanings.

But let's understand what's at stake. We have one candidate in Kamala Harris who is responding directly to women losing the right to control their bodies. We've got 13 states with absolute abortion bans, 28 states with gestational bans, and we know that for women across the country, their lives are at stake, that there are reports of women dying, including in my home state of Georgia, because of these laws. We also know, however, that for young men, in particular, there have been very strong challenges for focusing, particularly on young men of color, being able to navigate in a time when someone like a Donald Trump is pitting people against one another and is undermining the potential that most of us have. And so, what I look to is that the gender issues are ones grounded in what is possible and who is willing to think about that possibility. And of course, Kamala Harris has been much more articulate about this and much more intentional about this. And so, where protest music enters the conversation, it is to say, we are all entitled to participation, we are all entitled to opportunity, we are all entitled to inclusion, as Melissa talks about, which is a very long way of saying. I hear about the gender gap, but what I do is have a lived reality. We're often the questions of housing, of health care, of starting your own business. Those are issues that resonate across the board, and it's a question of who can prove it. And this is a moment where a woman can prove that we can get the job done.

We are excited to have Vice President Harris and President Obama coming to the state.

Voters who were told they cannot vote by mail are finding other ways to cast their ballots, despite what Republicans have done, not because Republicans have done something good.

And so, most of the protest music has been in response to conservative orthodoxy, conservative laws, conservative belief systems. The challenge with doing protest music that has a conservative voice is that we have not created a space where that's -- where protest has come from. By and large, protest music, especially for women, has been about how do we fully insert ourselves into the lived experience of this country? How do we have full access to the promises of this country? How do we create our own American dream? And to date, that has been almost exclusively coming from a moment of progress. We want to move from where we are to where we can go. And progress beyond the political is about change and saying we're going to do something more, something new, something additive. That means that if you're looking through the pantheon of singers who have done protest music, you are often and almost exclusively going to find women who are protesting in the space that is considered progressive because they're trying to make it better for everyone.",

In general, there is evidence that when youhave more immigrants it, on average, drives up house prices, but it'll do different things in different neighborhoods. Immigrants also play a role in the building industry and constructing houses. And overall, even if it was the case that expelling large number of immigrants with lower house prices, it would only lower them by a little bit at what I think would be an unacceptable cost in terms of both humanity and decency as well as other issues in the economy.",

We've had tons and tons of jobs every month, you know, hundreds of thousands, and that would not havehappened without this big influx of immigrants. The reason is the American population would be shrinking were it not for immigrants. That's in part because the fertility rate is below the replacement rate and in part because the population is aging and more people is retiring. So, we're an economy that really depends on immigrants. We all benefit from them. But I do not think it's an ideal system that you're basically relying on something and need something that you don't have a formal legal process to do. We basically have a set of laws that if they were fully enforced would be inhumane and uneconomical, but -- you know, but we -- but not enforcing the law isn't a good answer either.",

So, we look at 25 to 54. It's a very good way to measure these things. That employment rate is a decent amount higher than it was before COVID. In fact, it's the highest it's been in about 25 years. So, immigrants, if anything, maybe seem to have been creating jobs for people by increasing demand, by working well together and the like.

I mean, not just as a weapon to try to protect small segments of the economy, but thinking tariffs are generally good.

And so, what you see is that China -- and by the way, it was mostly China's growth, not the China's entry to the WTO that mattered here. It created jobs in some areas, lost jobs in other areas. And by the way, you know, it does that at a much, much bigger scale as technology. All the time technology is destroying some jobs, adding some jobs, and if we had kept the world frozen the way it was 50 years ago, 100 years ago, 200 years ago, we would all be much, much poorer. So, I agree, we need to think really seriously about what we can do to help people, but if your answer is tariffs, you're going to end up helping some jobs, hurting other jobs, and the net will be a negative.",

There is not enough taxes that we could raise from the rich to pay for everything that Harris would like to do, everything that the Democratic Party would like to do, and also put our debt on a sustainable course. But there's some money there. You know, the easiest things are just raising the tax rate a little bit, raising the tax rate on capital gains a little bit, plugging some of the loopholes, like the way people pay themselves as pass through entities in order to get a lower tax rate. There's another proposal regarding taxing capital gains before the asset has been sold, as the gains have been accrued.

So, he's starting with a minority of where we need to go.
