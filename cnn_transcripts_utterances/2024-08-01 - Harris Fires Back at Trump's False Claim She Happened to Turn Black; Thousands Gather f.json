And then there is more, then later at a rally, still hours later, what equates to essentially a billboard Business Insider headline seen at a Trump rally recognizing Harris Indian heritage again. And still, there's more. J.D. Vance then pushed the now new phony attack line at his own rally.You can be sure that there are more twists ahead with this Trump campaign attempt to define their opponent, though there is no question, she is a black woman and will likely become the first black woman and first Indian-American woman to top a major party's presidential ticket in a matter of days.

That's where he had been based in recent years as the political leader of Hamas for burial there. The Iranian government continues to vow that it will carry out vengeance against Israel, which it accuses of this assassination. Israel has not denied or claimed responsibility for this, but all the fingers in the region are pointing towards Israel here. An important point is you've got senior Iranian officials that are also casting blame at the U.S., saying that the U.S. is the primary sponsor, the primary funder and supplier of weapons to Israel and arguing, claiming that there's no way Israel could have carried out this assassination without the U.S. support. Senior American officials have said that the U.S. was unaware of this assassination plan and had nothing to do with it. The U.S. secretary of state, Antony Blinken, instead is saying that, hey, the region is heading towards conflict, wider conflict, and now you need a ceasefire more than ever. But those appeals are ringing hollow right now. As the prime minister of Qatar has pointed out in a statement after Ismail Haniyeh's assassination, what's the point of mediation when one party assassinates the negotiator on the other side of the negotiating table? Ismail Haniyeh was a key interlocutor that Israel was indirectly negotiating with, and now he's been murdered. Back to you.",
