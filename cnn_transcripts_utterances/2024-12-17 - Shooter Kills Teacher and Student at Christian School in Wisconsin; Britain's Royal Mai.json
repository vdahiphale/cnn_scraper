Russia's investigative committee says a top general was killed by an explosive device in Moscow in what they're calling a, quote, terrorist attack. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov was killed outside an apartment building some seven kilometers, that's about four miles southeast of the Kremlin. His aide was also killed in the blast.Russian officials have opened a criminal investigation. Kirillov's death comes a day after Ukrainian prosecutors charged the general in absentia with the use of banned chemical weapons in the war in Ukraine. A source with knowledge of the operation told CNN that Ukraine's security services were behind Kirillov's assassination. A Christian school in Madison, Wisconsin, that was preparing for Christmas activities is now grappling with gun violence. Police say a 15-year-old female student shot and killed another student and a teacher before killing herself. The uncle of a survivor spoke about the community's shattered sense of security.

Chrystia Freeland's resignation came after weeks of disagreement with the PM over the best way to prepare for Donald Trump's promised tariff hike. The U.S. president-elect has threatened to implement 25 percent tariffs on all products imported into the U.S. from both Canada and Mexico, unless the two nations stop the flow of illegal migrants and drugs across the border.In her resignation letter, Freeland said Canada must push back as the Trump administration pursues what she describes as a policy of America first, aggressive economic nationalism. Prime Minister Trudeau moved quickly to name a member of his inner circle, Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc, to replace Freeland.

Royal Mail was privatized a decade ago.Since then, its financial performance has been poor, to say the least. Now Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky is buying it for the princely sum of $4.5 billion. Now, he made his money in energy, but he has a few U.K. interests already. He owns a 27 percent stake in the West Ham United Football Club and a 10 percent stake in the British supermarket chain Sainsbury's. His mysterious personality and reluctance to talk about business dealings earned him the nickname of the Czech Sphinx in 2019. Now, he won't be able to do anything he likes with Royal Mail. This takeover comes with strings attached. Royal Mail will still have to deliver letters six days a week, Monday through Saturday, and parcels Monday through Friday. And the U.K. government will hold a so-called golden share in the company because this is vital British infrastructure. So they'll get final approval on things like a change in ownership of the company, a change in headquarter location or tax residency. This takeover is expected to complete next year.

      "sentences": "The German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of confidence that he called in himself on Monday. He lost that vote by 394 votes against him versus the 207 votes in favor of him. What that means is that Germany is now almost certainly headed towards a federal election, the date most likely to be the 23rd of February.Now, the vote today came about because Olaf Scholz's bickering government collapsed back in November when he fired his finance minister, Christian Lindner. The two had been bickering for some time over a financial mechanism and Germany's economy. But what resulted in this was Scholz leading a minority government. That meant he had very few other options left to him apart from calling this confidence vote. What the opposition party saw, though, in Scholz's weakness was the ability to force him to make the call on having the confidence vote and the election earlier than he had originally wished. That animosity was very clear to see on the floor of the Bundestag today with all parties levelling accusations at one another. Scholz took another opportunity to remind the German people that the reason this government collapsed, in his mind, was because the liberal partners in his coalition were not prepared to agree with his policies and timetables. The CDU, the former party of Angela Merkel, now led by Friedrich Merz and one of the frontrunners to be the next chancellor, also took his opportunity to blame Olaf Scholz. FRIEDRICH MERZ, CDU OPPOSITION LEADER AND CHANCELLOR CANDIDATE (through translator): You are asking about confidence today. Mr. Chancellor, you had your chance. You did not take this opportunity, and it applies to today as well as to February 23rd, 2025, the expected date of the Bundestag elections. You, Mr. Scholz, have not earned any trust.",

Now, Jay-Z has already fiercely denied these accusations and his legal team has already asked the court to dismiss this case entirely.But now, for the first time speaking to reporters since these accusations came out, Jay-Z's attorney, Alex Spiro, held a press conference of sorts. There was a private meeting at Jay-Z's Roc Nation offices in New York City where CNN was invited to watch a presentation put on by Jay-Z's attorney where he had a PowerPoint where he showed different details that he says disprove Jane Doe's case. Let's take a look at some of what he said. ALEX SPIRO, JAY-Z'S LAWYER: This is not an account of inconsistencies. I wanted everybody to understand that this never happened. This is completely false. You have to look at the timeline. You have to look at the timeline. So there's an old expression that time doesn't lie. Everything else that I'm talking about, these glaring inconsistencies, these are not minor inconsistencies. These are not minor problems with this story. This is utter falsehoods. Time never lies.
