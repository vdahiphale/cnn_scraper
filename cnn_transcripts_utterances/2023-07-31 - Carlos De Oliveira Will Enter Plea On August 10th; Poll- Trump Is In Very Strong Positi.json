Later indictments or not, new polling shows it is Trump's race for the Republican nomination and his nearest rival Ron DeSantis is at a whopping 37 points behind. Also tonight, Haiti, months of gang violence and kidnappings have terrorized and paralyzed the country. Now, an American nurse and her child on a humanitarian mission have disappeared. The latest on the search. Good evening. The legal troubles for former President Donald Trump continue to grow today, a supervising judge in Georgia rejected the former president's challenge to the state's election related investigation, and today marked the official start of the time window, Georgia district attorney, Fani Willis set for announcing possible charges against him. Tomorrow, the grand jury in Washington meets and it is possible there could be news on whether or not they will indict him on federal charges related to his attempt to overturn the election results. In Florida, a bad day for Carlos De Oliveira, the Mar-a-Lago property manager who appeared in court for the first time since he was named a co-conspirator in the documents case against the former president. Randi Kaye starts us off tonight. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

That's according to the indictment, which does not indicate the footage was ever deleted. It's unclear if Taveras is cooperating with the special counsel, but sources tell CNN that the new allegations resulted at least in part from information Taveras provided to investigators. De Oliveira has not yet entered a plea. We tried tracking down De Oliveira before his court date at his home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida about 20 minutes north of Trump's club. Nobody answered the door. KAYE (on camera): But De Oliveira's landlord agreed to speak with me by phone, he told me he has known him 30 years and described him as a good friend and a good guy. He also told me if De Oliveira knows anything, he said he should \"come clean.\"   KAYE (voice over): De Oliveira has worked at Mar-a-Lago for about 20 years, his landlord said, starting out as a valet, then holding various maintenance jobs before becoming the club's property manager. This neighbor of De Oliveira has said he's known him for a few years. When asked about the federal indictment, this was his response. RAYMOND BRION, DE OLIVEIRA'S NEIGHBOR: Anybody that gets involved with Donald Trump, he's a train wreck, and anybody that gets involved with Donald Trump ends up somewhere either in a bad place. I don't think that guy had any knowledge of what he was doing. KAYE (voice over): Those closest to De Oliveira say that as a Portuguese immigrant unfamiliar with the US legal system, he may not have understood the consequences of what Trump allegedly told him to do.

Now, he has already hurt his opportunity to do that by being caught lying by the FBI so that one of the charges against him is a thousand and a one, that's a false statement to federal official.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EDITOR (voice-over): Russia's war in Ukraine is increasingly blowing up in Moscow. This Ukrainian drone attack Sunday night bringing Russia's war hundreds of miles away into the heart of its own capitol, shocking citizens. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation): My friends and I rented an apartment to come here and unwind, and at some point, we heard an explosion and it was like a wave. Everyone jumped. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Attacks like this in Moscow, becoming increasingly common. Last week, another Ukrainian drone hit a Ministry of Defense building, a psychological blow for a population repeatedly told by Putin state media. They are winning the so-called special military operation. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translation): I was asleep and woken up by an explosion. Everything started to shake and the whole building had come down. ROBERTSON (voice-over): This weekend, Putin was keeping up the pretense, everything is OK, celebrating Navy Day. But behind the scenes, his officials appear rattled by Ukraine's refusal to be beaten. (on-camera): Former President Dmitry Medvedev says if Ukraine's counteroffensive is successful, Russia will use its nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the Kremlin is dismissing the drone strikes in Moscow as an act of desperation. The defense minister calling them terrorist attacks. Reality, they've got Moscow's attention. (voice-over): Ukraine's President is hinting more of these strikes to come. VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translation): Ukraine is getting stronger. Gradually, the war is returning to the territory of Russia to its symbolic centers and military bases. This is an inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process. ROBERTSON (voice-over): Zelenskyy is stating what is becoming increasingly apparent. Ukraine is ramping up drone strikes inside Russia. In recent weeks, targets just over the border in areas vital to Russia's war efforts have increased too. The impact even breaking through on Russia's state media. What is clear, Ukraine's fight on Russian soil is having effect. Nic Robertson, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

I've always felt a huge amount of love and respect for my friends, fans and supporters. I've loved you all so much and enjoyed making art for you\".Reubens was an actor from an early age, develop Pee-Wee Herman in the late 70s, the Groundlings in Los Angeles, the legendary breeding ground for many of America's best improv actors. Tim Burton, of course, directed Pee-Wee's Big Adventure. And for five years, he had the weirdest and most groundbreaking kid show on television Pee-Wee's Playhouse. His success as Pee-Wee Herman also helped Reubens usher other actors into the spotlights their road to fame. Some of these Pee-Wee's Playhouse costar included Laurence Fishburne, Natasha Lyonne, Jimmy Smith, Sandra Bernhard and S. Epatha Merkerson, who I also loved on \"Law &amp; Order\". An arrest for indecent exposure in 1991, and a separate guilty plea on an obscenity charge in 2002 derailed his career for a time but his talent always found a home.
