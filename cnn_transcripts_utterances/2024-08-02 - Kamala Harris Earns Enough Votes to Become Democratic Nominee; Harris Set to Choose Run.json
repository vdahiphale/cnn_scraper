The next few days will be critical, as the vice president prepares to make one of the most important decisions of her political career, choosing a running mate. Sources tell CNN that Harris is going to be meeting with her V.P. finalists this weekend before making the big announcement ahead of a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday.",

This is the official part before the convention. So let's bring in our panel of experts, starting with CNN political director David Chalian. How does this change things? And we have to be clear, I think, about what this moment is. Everyone's ready for the hoopla of the convention, but this is actually what seals the deal and makes it official.",

They have several days here to do it. We will see when she reaches that threshold of enough delegates to be 50 percent plus one and therefore may declare the actual nominee of the party. There will be a ceremonial version of the roll call that everybody has gotten accustomed to seeing at the convention, and that will play out. And everyone, the delegate representative for each state will speak up and offer their state's delegates. But it is this now that will actually make her the official nominee. And one of the reasons why they're doing it, the party,has said, is because they are concerned about ballot access specifically in the state of Ohio. It's not clear how much that concern should really exist. But this is what the party is saying, is that they want to make sure that their presidential nominee and their vice presidential nominee get on all 50 state ballots and the ballot in the District of Columbia. And some rules, by doing it so late at the convention in Chicago, may not allow for that. And so they're doing this earlier virtual roll call.",

I don't know that we have had very many other national candidates who have done jobs at every single level of government like that, from local all the way up to national. So she's got this great record. And so what's remarkable about this -- obviously, race and gender play a part of this -- is also she's our first presidential -- she could be our first President Trump California since Ronald Reagan. But the country is moving more to the South and to the West, right? We have seen the Sun Belt become more of where our population is. And we're seeing more women leaders take leadership around the country, whether Democrat or Republican. We're seeing that. We're also seeing more educated Americans who are started to -- the country's becoming more educated. So in many ways, she's the breath of fresh air from the future and is thinking about what's going to happen in the future. And I think that background is very appealing to people, which is why I think so many people have rallied to these big phone calls with hundreds of thousands of people and have given $300 million over the course of the last month.",

The official line from the president and other White House officials has been, no, that had nothing to do with the timing.

Isaac, you -- as you write -- and you have some excellent reporting on this -- some Jewish Democrats wonder if America is ready for a Jewish vice president, which I think is a headline that should prompt a lot of soul-searching in the Democratic Party, because the fact you write that has other Democrats saying that there are some progressives who are antisemitic, because that is a question that is out there. Tell us about this internal strife in the party. EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE, CNN SENIOR REPORTER:  Yes, look, most of this is focused on the question about Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, who, as Jeff says is, leading a lot of the speculation about where Harris may go. Of course, J.B. Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, also in this process, he's also Jewish. But Shapiro has been outspoken as both a supporter of Israel and a critic of the campus protests that were there in the spring, saying in some -- that some of them dipped into antisemitism in ways. And that has led to a lot of focus on him, some groups calling him \"Genocide Josh,\" even though he has no foreign policy experience or voting record. And you can debate whether there is a genocide that's going on there. But it is creating this question of, even among Jewish Democrats, is this the moment to have a Jewish running mate? Is the party going to be too divided over this? That leads to other Jewish Democrats saying, are you kidding? How can we say that we're going to have a problem with this guy just because he's Jewish, and what does that say about as Democrats as a party if that's where things are?",

      "sentences": "I want to go Molly Ball, because, Molly, Donald Trump has weighed in on this -- we should note she's a senior political correspondent for \"The Wall Street Journal.\"Molly, Donald Trump just said today that, if Harris picks Shapiro, in his words, who happens to be Jewish, she will lose her little Palestinian base. Trump then went on to say that that base actually prefers him because he will -- quote -- \"bring peace to the Middle East, even though I'm very strong for Israel.\" How do you think Trump and his team would react to a Josh Shapiro pick for V.P.? MOLLY BALL, SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL\": I think they're probably most concerned with what the Democrats are most concerned with, which is winning Pennsylvania. And the most salient characteristic of Josh Shapiro for both campaigns is how popular he is as the governor of Pennsylvania. Look, I don't think the Democrats are taking advice about who to pick from Trump and his campaign. Certainly, the concerns that Isaac laid out are going to be in the back of their mind. But then there's also the possibility that it cuts the other way as a signal to swing voters that the Democrats are not captive to that left-wing base that is against what's going on in Gaza and would like to see the administration take a harder line with Israel. And as Harris looks to reassure swing voters that she is not the wild- eyed progressive she arguably ran as in 2020, that could be helpful to her as well. So I think all of the candidates she's considering have that potential to appeal to the middle of the electorate. And that, as a national message, in addition to what kind of sway they may have in swing states -- and I don't think any swing state is more important than Pennsylvania -- that, I think, is primarily what both campaigns are attending to, even if Trump has different ideas.",

And to everyone on the call, thank you for your hard work and all you have been doing over these last many, many, many months. And I know that we are excited about the future, but we also know that we got a lot of work to get there, and we have a lot of work to do. It's good work. We like hard work. And I just want to thank everyone for joining this call. Listen, I think we all approach our campaign with the same spirit, including that this is truly a people-powered campaign. And I would not be on this call right now and with you all were it not for your support and your trust, for which I am deeply grateful. I am honored to be the presumptive Democratic nominee for president of the United States. And I will tell you, the tireless work of our delegates, our state leaders and staff has been pivotal in making this moment possible. And your dedication cannot be overstated, your dedication to our country. I know we all feel this way so strongly. We love our country. We believe in the promise of America. And that's what this campaign is about. So, of course, I will officially accept your nomination next week, once the virtual voting period is closed. But, already, I'm happy to know that we have enough delegates to secure the nomination. And later this month, we will gather in Chicago, united as one party, where we're going to have an opportunity to celebrate this historic moment together. And, again, this campaign is about all of us coming together, people coming together from every walk of life, every lived experience, and being fueled by our love of country, knowing that we are prepared to fight for the best of who we are. We believe in the promise of America, a promise of freedom, opportunity, and justice not just for some, but for all. And, ultimately, in this election, you all have heard me say many times, we each face the question, what kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom, compassion, and rule of law, or a country of chaos, fear, and hate? And the beauty of our democracy is we each, every one of us, has the power to answer that question. And that is why I say and know the power is with the people. So here's the bottom line. I say to all the friends on the call, we are going to win this election. And it is going to take all of us, whether it is making calls, connecting with our communities, engaging online, or even talking with people where we go every day, whether it be to the grocery store or our church. We are going to talk with people about the fact that we are all in this together, and we stand together. And so let's let folks know that our campaign is about the future, and it's about an expansion of rights and freedoms and for the opportunity of everyone to not just get by, but to get ahead. So, November 5, November 5 is 95 days away. And North Carolina, for everyone there, you're kicking us off with absentee ballots that are being sent in just 35 days. So, we are -- we are in this, everyone. We are in this. We are on the road. And it's not going to be easy, but we're going to get this done. And as your future president, I know we are up to this fight. And when we fight, everyone will say in unison, we win. So, thank you, everyone. Please take care. And I can't wait to see you in Chicago. And thank you again, Jaime.",

We should note, she didn't say she was accepting it on this call. What was announced here by DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison is that she has secured enough delegates to be the Democratic nominee. She hit over that 50 percent plus one threshold, but the voting is still open. And so delegates are still getting in their ballots, and so she clearly wanted to not shut that off and allow more time and said that, when the voting period comes to a close, then she would formally accept the nomination.

What is happening now is, Democrats look more like Republicans in Milwaukee a couple of weeks ago.
