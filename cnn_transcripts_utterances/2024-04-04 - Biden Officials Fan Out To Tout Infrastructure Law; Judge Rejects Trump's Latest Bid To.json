      "sentences": "It's all hands-on deck, or in this case, the campaign trail for the Biden administration. Today, six administration officials, including the Vice President, are fanning out across the country to tout how Biden's signature infrastructure law, bipartisan bill that passed, will help fund projects in different communities. It's part of a larger effort for the President to convince voters that his legislative achievements have actually earned him a second term in office. The question is, will voters buy it?Joining me now to get into that and much more are Republican pollster Brenda Gianiny and Democratic pollster Terrance Woodbury. Thank you so much. It's great to see both of you. Let's start with that question. We have talked before, and with you, just sort of non- stop since the infrastructure bill became law a couple years ago, about the question of whether and when voters are going to actually see and feel what he got done at home. Is that happening? Are you seeing it in your data?",

It is a multifaceted, multicultural issue that reaches across demographics and geographics.Unlike many issues, we have seen shift of one or two points because people are kind of hardened in their positions. Infrastructure has had the ability to shift by more than 10 points, increasing support for Joe Biden. I think that's because, one, it does not have the hyper- partisanship baggage, but also because it does have the -- because when you talk about it in terms of what we saw as the EEEs, the environmental impacts as the biggest investment to combat climate change in the world's history, not just the nation's history, but also the economic impacts, its ability to create infrastructure jobs right now and create competitive --",

They were going out there, fanning around, saying, no, the economy is really good. And I think as Republicans, we were all very excited about that. We said, keep trying with that. That message is going to fail. So I think they were very smart to pivot to infrastructure.And we saw, after the State of the Union, we saw a slight blip in the polls for Biden. And I think, nobody watches this speech, I think it was him getting out there and talking to real Americans and his roadshow. So I think this is going to help him.",

And it really has just -- it's sort of been a downhill effect from there.Right now, the only movement we see is really Joe Biden's biggest challenge. He's building his coalition again. He's bringing Democrats back home. I think he can do it. I mean, the easiest thing to do is get a Democrat to vote for a Democrat and a Republican to vote for a Republican. But he has not done that yet. He does not have his base intact. So he's working and we're seeing the numbers start to move.",

We have seen other co- defendants in this case in Georgia try to make these First Amendment arguments. Scott McAfee, the judge, also rejected them in the case of the other defendants. We've even seen these arguments made by Trump in the federal case. And we saw federal Judge Tanya Chutkan consider these First Amendment arguments and reject them there. So, in many ways, this was not the motion that the Trump team was really hanging their hat on, was really hoping would lead to the end of the indictment.

Look, Dana, though, this is really important because Democrats and Republicans have been saying throughout the cycle this is going to be a very close election and it really could come down to just a few electoral votes, a few thousand votes in states that otherwise really haven't been attended to by either of the big campaigns.",
