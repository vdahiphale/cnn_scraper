I'm not going to argue back and forth because I don't know the whole -- the whole fact situation about when they went and met with him. But it seems to me that they had probable cause that he had made that threat. And we're going to have to determine as a society here whether a threat -- now we're looking at a threat and saying, oh, he's a 13- year-old boy. Let's not ruin his whole life over something stupid.

Yes, we're dealing with a terrorist organization. And they have been holding on to our kids for 11 months now.

You voiced optimism at the time that it was the start of a new process. Sadly, sadly, very sadly, it wasn't. What is your level of optimism today? RONEN NEUTRA, FATHER OF ISRAELI-AMERICAN HOSTAGE OMER NEUTRA-ORNA: Listen, Wolf, we have to stay optimistic. There's no other way. But we see how difficult it is. We were heartbroken with the news of Hersh Polin-Goldberg being murdered a few days back with other five Israelis. We know that the situation is dire. We know that our son is at risk of gunpoint any minute. And 11 months in, we are calling on all the leaders, including the Biden administration. Do everything you can. Do your responsibility. It's urgent and our kids are dying there. And you have to do whatever you can to bring them back now, because there won't be too many more opportunities.",

The prime minister, Prime Minister Netanyahu, is totally adamant that he won't compromise on his demand to keep Israeli troops along that Southern Gaza border with Egypt known as the Philadelphi Corridor.He says it's essential to block the flow of smuggled weapons and ammunition into Gaza that would wind up in the hands of Hamas and potentially could wind up killing more Israelis. Do you feel the prime minister is doing enough to prioritize bringing Omer and the other hostages home? R. NEUTRA:  Listen, we are doing a deal with the devil, the worst terrorist organization in the world. But let me ask this question. For 20 years, close to 20 years, Prime Minister Netanyahu was in charge in making sure that this border is protected and flow of ammunition is not coming in. Where was he? Where was the army? And now that we are there, do you really think that a few soldiers being there is going to make sure that the tunnels are not being operated underneath them? I don't buy that. We look at it as a political excuse. We know there's got to be a deal with the devil. Do the deal, bring the hostages and later on do what you need to make sure that Israel is secure, not on the back of my child.",

He's an all-American kid. He grew up -- he was born in New York City. He grew up on Long Island. He loves athletics. He loves the NFL, the NBA. He was the captain of three sports teams in high school. He was a leader in his youth group. Like you mentioned, Wolf, we have a very big family in Israel. Both of his grandparents are Holocaust survivors who moved to Israel. And after spending some time in Israel on a gap, Omer felt that, before he came back to college here in the United States, he needed to serve himself. So that's the kind of kid that he is. He's just a regular kid, but he's also a kid that will do the right thing. And we need to do everything to bring him back.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, court just gone under way about 15 minutes ago here in downtown Los Angeles.And Hunter Biden's attorneys have stood up in court and said that he's offering to resolve this case, avoid going to trial. The trial is supposed to start with jury selection today, Wolf. But he's offering to enter a plea, what's known as can Alford plea, where he maintains his innocence, but essentially puts himself at the mercy of the court and accept whatever sentence, whatever punishment the judge in this case deals out. And so we don't know, obviously, how this will happen or where -- how this will turn out in court right now. Generally, the Justice Department has a policy against Alford pleas. They would insist that Hunter Biden needs to plead guilty to all of these charges. Just a reminder, he's failing -- he's facing three felony counts for tax evasion and six misdemeanor counts for failing to pay -- failing to file and pay his taxes. This is for the years 2016, 2017, 2018. We saw Hunter Biden arrive in court just a little while ago. And, certainly, the expectation was that at least before this trial got under way, Wolf, that there would be some kind of discussion of a plausible plea agreement. It appears there have been no such negotiations, at least not recently. And Hunter Biden instead is offering in court today to enter this Alford plea, again, where he maintains that he is innocent, but that he acknowledges the government has enough evidence to convict him and accept whatever punishment the judge sentences him to. So we don't know, again, how this will turn out today. We expect that the government will object to this arrangement and we will see whether -- what Judge Mark Scarsi says in response to Hunter's offer -- Wolf.",
