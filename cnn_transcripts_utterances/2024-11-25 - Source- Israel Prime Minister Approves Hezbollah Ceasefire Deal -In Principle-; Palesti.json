Source tells CNN, Israel's prime minister has approved the emerging cease fire deal with Hezbollah in principle. This, following a deadly exchange, a fire between Hezbollah and Israel over the weekend. And another potential punch to press freedom in Israel, where its cabinets unanimously voted to sanction the nation's oldest newspaper, Haaretz, citing its critical coverage of the war following the October 7th Hamas attacks. And the infamous Menendez brothers set to make their first public court appearance in nearly 30 years. They are bidding to get out of prison decades after killing their parents. All right. We are following a major story out of Israel this hour, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved, in principle, the outlines of a ceasefire deal that's being discussed with Hezbollah. That's what a source close to the story is telling us. Now, we've also got multiple sources saying an agreement will not be final until all issues are resolved. All this coming as we're seeing an uptick in air strikes. The Israeli military said on Sunday, it struck 12 Hezbollah command centers in Beirut's southern suburbs, and this video showing Israel's air defenses intercepting Hezbollah projectiles, fired from Lebanon. We're back in Jerusalem this hour. We've got CNN's Nic Robertson, tracking developments and joins us now live. The latest that we have from our source is that Netanyahu has agreed to the ceasefire in principle. What else are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Yes, in the last few minutes, Eleni, we have learned that there will be a Cabinet meetingtomorrow. This has been confirmed. A Cabinet meeting will be held tomorrow where they will take a vote on that cease fire. Now, we heard from the foreign minister earlier on today, speaking about this. He said the prerequisites for this deal are that Hezbollah goes back north of the Litani River. This is what's been under discussion as we know. That's 30 miles north of the Lebanon-Israel border. He also says that -- and this seems to be -- yes, perhaps one of those areas where there is proving to be sticking points. But he said that it must be a deal where Hezbollah cannot be allowed to regrow in Lebanon, and in essence, that other political sort of influences in Lebanon can take hold as well. That's a -- that's a pretty big thing to be asking for in a sovereign country. But that's what the foreign minister is saying. As we know, one of the big issues for Israel is that right to strike back and strike back immediately if Hezbollah breaks a cease fire. This is expected to be a 60- day cease-fire. We have also heard from one of the most hardline right-wing members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet, who will be there with a vote. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister. He is saying that he has told the prime minister no to a deal with Hezbollah. He says that we're close to essentially being able to completely crush Hezbollah. I think there are a lot of analysts in the region and Hezbollah themselves who would take issue and don't believe that, they have certainly taken a pounding. But Itamar Ben-Gvir saying that we have a moment of opportunity here to completely crush Hezbollah, and that's why he is telling the prime minister not to -- not to support the deal. Now, there is a lot of time, 24 hours between now and when the Cabinet, including the foreign minister, including Itamar Ben-Gvir, will sit down with the prime minister and take the vote. But the view from the region at the moment is that this deal is getting close, and there appears to be a degree of momentum towards that. Some of that momentum might look negative. The number of strikes coming into Israel today from Hezbollah is high. Again, the number of strikes by Israel at Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, again, is high today. But this is -- this is what we saw back in 2006 when the war back then was coming to a conclusion, cease fire was being negotiated down to the wire, and there was a significant uptick and -- on strikes both sides. We seem to be in that moment right now, Eleni.",

Authorities in the UAE say they have arrested three Uzbek nationals inconnection with the death of an Israeli rabbi in the United Arab Emirates. The White House is condemning the killing of Rabbi Zvi Kogan, and says it is working closely with Israeli and UAE authorities. On Sunday, Israel's prime minister called the killing an anti-Semitic act of terror. Egyptian authorities say 17 people are missing after a tourist boat sank in the Red Sea. Officials told the Associated Press, 28 people have been rescued, some of them being airlifted to hospital. According to the regional governor, 45 people were on board the boat named the Sea Story, which was on a five-day trip when it went down near the town of Marsa Alam. The Egyptian Weather Service had warned on Saturday about rough sea conditions. Russia says it will use every means at its disposal to protect itself. Those comments from his senior diplomat come after Moscow fired a new non- nuclear ballistic missile on Ukraine's Dnipro region last Thursday. President Vladimir Putin said in a televised speech the strike was a response to Ukraine's use of American and British long-range weapons against targets inside Russia. Meanwhile, Kyiv and its allies of studying debris from the new Russian missile fired on central Ukraine, as they work to assess Moscow's latest military technology.

Still, broken glass on the ground below me. And really, it's these vulnerable Ukrainians on the receiving end of the broader geopolitical message that Russian president, Vladimir wanted -- Putin, wanted to send. The parts of the debris of that missile on display to news agencies in Kyiv today, a select amount, clearly Kyiv trying to show the world exactly what technology was used against them, and there is, of course, going to be a lot of forensic attention as to exactly what those missile parts indeed show. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE (through translator): Experts are currently analyzing the evidence and working with our partners to establish all the details and the specifications of this missile, and to find a response together to this latest Russian escalation. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALSH (on camera): There appears to be a consensus this was a hypersonic missile and it was one with multiple warheads, non-nuclear indeed. Vladimir Putin suggested that it can potentially get through all Western air defenses, and I'm sure that the parts on display will be pored over to see if, indeed, that provides any clues as to whether this is a technological leap by Russia or not.

      "sentences": "Right. Eleni. That's definitely a big concern, particularly because, look, DonaldTrump has moved much faster than we have traditionally seen people in his position, president-elect at the same point in this transition process move. I mean, if you look back eight years ago to when he was first elected, he had only named one Cabinet pick, at this point, attorney general. President Biden, at this point in the transition process, had not named anyone for his Cabinet role. So, Donald Trump is moving very quickly. And that's part of the reason why the question over vetting and background checks -- FBI, background checks, I should say, specifically, has really become a concern among the senators on Capitol Hill, who will be tasked with confirming all of Donald Trump's different appointments and nominees. Now, part of the reason that they're not getting these FBI background checks is because Donald Trump and his team have missed a lot of the paperwork and missed a lot of the deadlines that is traditional for this type of transition, and that includes these FBI background checks that are really in senators minds kind of required before they begin the confirmation process. Now, there, as you mentioned, I do think among all of Donald Trump's Cabinet picks and other top picks for top administration roles in his second term, most of them are expected to have a pretty smooth confirmation process. People in the Senate believe that they have the credentials that are necessary, that Donald Trump deserves the right to fill his administration and his Cabinet with the people that he wants. But there are some areas of concern, and people, I should really say, of concern. That does refer to Tulsi Gabbard. She is Donald Trump's pick to be his director of national intelligence. Some of the controversy around her is one, she is a former Democrat, but it's mainly that she is very skeptical of the way that the government -- American government, has been conducting surveillance over the last several years. That is something where she differs from a lot of people and conservatives, especially, about how she could potentially operate once in that role. She also has ties to a lot of foreign leaders that people are uncomfortable with. She met with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad in recent years, something that wasn't totally confirmed or checked off by the Senate when she was in that process. And so, there is some -- excuse me, in the House, she was a former House congresswoman. So, some questions around that. As for Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick to lead the Pentagon. One is he is a former Fox News host. Some people have questions over whether he has the credentials, the experience, to be in that role. But there is also concerns around recent sexual assault allegations against him, some of which we reported last week that came out in a police report. And so, a lot of questions here that I think, or I know I should say that the Trump team is really working with senators on to see how they can help assuage some of those concerns. I think a big thing to watch for is many of these different picks are going to be going to Capitol Hill to be meeting with Republican senators behind closed doors to hear what they have to say, kind of figure out what the vulnerabilities are and see what they can do and try and, you know, assure the senators and assuage those concerns on the front end before they go through these very public confirmation hearings.",

It is the last meeting of these foreign ministers before Antony Blinken and the Biden administration leaves office. And they are going to try to push forward as much as they can on their own agenda, especially when it comes to Ukraine. We have heard from the Biden administration that they are trying to surge their support, military and financial to Kyiv before they leave office in January. We have seen a surge of military equipment. We have also seen in recent weeks that change in policy to allow Ukraine to strike with those U.S.-provided attack on long-range missiles on sites further into Russia. So, this was a significant change in U.S. policy. And when Blinken is in Italy today, he is going to be meeting with his counterparts to discuss how to continue that support and have the Europeans sort of take on the mantle of supporting Ukraine. This is something we have also heard from European officials, the need to take up the support and lead the charge here to continue to provide that assistance to Kyiv. The other big issue that we expect to come up is the ongoing wars in the Middle East. Even though there seems to be progress on the war between Israel and Lebanese Hezbollah, coming to a diplomatic resolution, as we heard, the Israeli cabinet is going to be voting on a cease fire proposal tomorrow. There is still a lot that needs to be worked out on the Gaza front, there has been very little movement, and the prospect of an incoming new incoming U.S. administration is likely to put a pause on a lot of those efforts.

Imean, this is very important, because what he did, the minister of -- what I call anti-communication, he was intimidating and he was inciting against them. So, we, at the Union of Journalists support Haaretz. We want -- we are trying to create a collective solidarity for hearts journalists and for other journalists who are being intimidated and attacked. And we are going to use all the legal tools and other tools that we have in our toolbox to support the press freedom in Israel and fight back against this trend by the government. So, what's interesting here, specifically with Haaretz, it's actually saying that no public entity can, you know, buy any advertisements, and in fact, also it goes down to subscriptions of any government employee. And I wonder if there's any way that government could exert that kind of influence over private companies. The reason it's interesting is that it's trying to squeeze Haaretz revenues so that it becomes economically unviable.",

AAA expects this Thanksgiving to be thebusiest on record with estimates of nearly 80 80 million people hitting road or the skies. On the radar, a series of serious storms expected to bring rain and snow that could throw a serious range into travel plans. CNN Meteorologist Derek Van Dam is tracking it all for us. Here to dampen your plans clearly, Derek, are you a bearer of bad news?",

So, we're going to tie these things together, because a series of weather systems will move from west to east across the United States. So, busiest travel year, time of the year, I should say. In fact, Tuesday and Wednesday of this week are the busiest travel days of the year across the U.S. Right now, we have a generally dry outlook here along the east coast. If you're getting an early start in your travel plans, no problems for let's say JFK. Southward into Atlanta, Hartsfield, Jackson International Airport. The same cannot be said, though, for Chicago, Detroit and northward into Minneapolis, St Paul. And there's another storm system. This is the big one that's going to send kind of a wave of weather across from the west to east. But breaking down these numbers, you heard Eleni say, almost 80 million Americans expected to travel. About seven percent of them will travel by air. That's roughly six million people. So, looking at the specifics for the airlines, again, no problems. You can see the shades of green on our little airline figure there. That indicates no weather delays on account of bad weather. This, of course, represents the cold front that's moving through. So that shade of yellow could bring some minor delays to Chicago and Detroit. And of course, the shade of orange means that moderate delays because of the weather incoming along the west coast. So, as we take you into tomorrow, that weather moves inland and then brings the delays, at least the potential to Salt Lake City and places like Denver. And this is the forecast rain and snow accumulation through this entire week. So, a lot of blue, a lot of white and purples on this map, indicating that we have an active weather pattern across North America. And here it is, the first cold front moving through now, bringing the delays, or potential delays, Chicago, Detroit. Eventually, we'll get some rainfall into the east coast by early Tuesday and into the lunchtime hours. There's the next major weather disruptor. This is the storm we're paying very close attention to because where it goes from here, how it strengthens, how it evolves is so critical to what happens on that busy travel day of Wednesday and certainly into the day on Thursday. So, looking to kind of explode in strength and coverage. So, rainfall expected on the southern tail of the storm all the way down to Atlanta and Florida. But that is snowfall for northern New England. How far that creeps south? That's still to be determined. But the latest weather models we look at this does appear to be a rain event for the major East Coast cities along that I-95 corridor, Washington, D.C., New York City, Philadelphia, all the way to Boston. So, we're enjoying above average temperatures now, but that cold front I just showed you a moment ago is going to change things dramatically. A lot of blues and purples on this map. That means the temperatures are going to tumble, and there are going to be many locations over the eastern half of the U.S. that will be protected from this cold shot of air. In fact, Chicago will be running 15 to 20 degrees below. Average by Thanksgiving. New York City, we've got a cool and wet Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which starts at 9:00 am on Thursday morning, first time to see Santa for the kids. And they will also be cooling off dramatically by the weekend as well here in Atlanta. More the same. Eleni, I am the bearer of bad news but that is my job.",

It has dated back centuries, back to the date -- days of Abraham Lincoln, folklore going back centuries. It is a raucous event on the White House South Lawn. It is something that is well attended by members of the public, members of the administration. So, they choose these turkeys based on their calm temperaments. Their ability to withstand these crowds, these bright flash bulbs, and, of course, the lots of laughs from those who are attending. Peach and Blossom are from Northfield, Minnesota. They are 40 and 41 pounds respectively. They were born in July and in the four months since then, the chair of the National Turkey Federation says they've been listening to a steady stream of poke music and ACDC. They are headed to what is called an interpretive agriculture center, after their part, and essentially a learning center that's a step above a petting zoo here in the United States, where, of course, they will be spared from being on anyone's table in the future. As you mentioned, this is President Biden's fourth and final Turkey pardon. It is always a moment of levity here at the White House because it -- this year comes after a bruising campaign cycle against the backdrop of simmering geopolitical tensions. So, it is something that can at least allow the staff here who has been through quite a gauntlet over the last several months, with their candidate dropping out of the race and then their party losing power here in Washington, that at least that can give them a moment of comic relief.",
