I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, AmErika's pre-election jitters are being felt around the world. In Europe, there is talk of Trump proofing, buttressing alliances, on shoring support for Ukraine, building up Europe's military and defense capabilities, as leaders anticipate a potential return by Donald Trump. Debates about Trump's right-wing authoritarianism echo similar tensions in Europe, including in France, where this summer Marine Le Pen's National Rally Party performed strongly in parliamentary elections. Meanwhile, Russia is flexing its muscles. In October, Russia made its largest territorial gains in Ukraine since the summer of 2022, as the Kremlin faces accusations of openly meddling in elections in Georgia and Moldova. Benjamin Haddad joined France's new conservative leaning government after the strong showing by the far-right in the July election. He is the minister delegate for European Affairs, and he joins us from Paris. Benjamin Haddad, welcome to the program. So, a lot of the focus here, from the media, from voters has been obviously on our own election in just four days from now. From your perspective, you've spent a lot of time working in the United States, in Washington, D.C. How is Europe viewing the stakes of this election on Tuesday?",

When you look at all global issues like tackling climate change, like China, so many economic challenges that we face together, we have an interest in working together. But at the end of the day, the truth, if you look at the writing on the wall over the last few administrations, is that we cannot just, you know, depend on whoever gets elected every year or four years. Europeans need to take more ownership for their own security, for their own defense, be able to defend their security interests on their own, especially as, we see once again, the war of Russian aggression at our border that engages our security and stability, first and foremost.

And as we see the arc of crisis around us, as we see the war of Russian aggression against Ukraine, you've seen first an increase in defense spending all across the board in Europe. If you take the example of France, over the two terms of the Macron presidency, we'll have doubled Russian defense spending. But this needs to continue in the long run. And we also need to increase our cooperation at the European level. We have so many duplications, redundancies. When you look at our weapon system, when you look at our defense markets, we'd be much stronger if we can act together and especially if we face the challenges. And I will say, this is something that we've heard from the United States, from Democratic and Republican administration. It's a legitimate request coming from AmErikans. And if we want to work together in a more balanced partnership to face the challenges that we face today, we need to be able to increase our defense spending and it needs to go through European cooperation and a stronger European defense that will be at the heart of the agenda also of the next European Commission that we'll be supporting.",

So, let me now turn to the devil's advocate point here, because however much you think that whatever Trump's threats or hislanguage or his actions strengthened the E.U. and NATO as a whole, a Trump 2.0 could look quite different. I mean, there were balances in place, guardrails from some of his top advisers who had been supporters and advocates for international alliances, specifically NATO speaking strongly against Russia's illegal invasion into Ukraine and supporting Ukraine heavily. Now, there is a lot of concern, some of it coming from Trump's own language about what the U.S.' role, if he wins in NATO would look like and what U.S.' aid towards Ukraine could look like if he is re-elected. He said that this war is going to end on day one. Most people assume that means Ukraine would have to acquiesce and agree to a much weaker deal with Vladimir Putin than they would like at this point.

If youlook at what's just happened in the last few weeks, you see North Korean troops that are being sent to support Russian aggression, which is a serious escalation in Ukraine. You see Iranian drones and missiles that are also used to fuel Russian aggression. So, you see there's a global dimension to this that goes way beyond just the war on Ukrainians. It's European security that's at stake, and I would say it's a global challenge against democracies that also is at the heart of the NATO alliance. This is why we support continuing to increase military support to Ukraine. We'll be finalizing in the next few days, hopefully, a $50 billion loan funding on the windfall profits of Russian frozen assets in Europe that will be -- that will lead to more support, military support to Ukraine. We support -- France supports inviting Ukraine to a NATO. This will send a strong message to the morale of the Ukrainian population. This will also send a message to the Kremlin that we're with Ukrainians in the long run, this is the only way, once again, to ensure long-term deterrence and stability in this region. It's a common interest that we have. But once again, you know, I would say as we look at this as Europeans, Ukrainians are fighting and dying for their freedom, for their sovereignty, for their independence, but they're also defending the security of Europeans, this strategic and military security. But also, when you look at food prices, when you look at energy prices, it's our interests that are at stake, and this is why we all need to be able to step forth together and support them.",

And so, it involves our interest, but also, the interest of the alliance in the United States, and I think we need to continue to work together on this. But, once again, I mean, Europeans need to give themselves, this is why we need to step up on defense spending, we need to step up on defense and security cooperation at the European level. Develop the financial instruments to be able to continue to support Ukrainians even off on our own if needed, and this is the message that France is sending to its security partners in Europe. And by the way, I want to add, if you look at the combined military, economic, humanitarian support that Europeans as a whole have provided Ukraine since the beginning of the aggression on February 24, 2022, it's today higher than the one of the United States. So, when you talk about burden sharing, when you talk about Europeans stepping up and taking their part and their responsibility for their own security, Europeans are here with Ukrainians.",

I know you are being verydiplomatic, as you should be in representing your government, publicly stating that you are capable and willing to work with any administration that the U.S. elects here in the United States. But it is notable that at least one of your neighboring leaders, Viktor Orban, has gone out publicly and put his thumb on the scale saying that he would like for Donald Trump to win, that he endorsed him. He's met with him in the United States recently. Here's what he tweeted on October 31st, just got off the phone with President Donald Trump. I wished him the best of luck for next Tuesday. Only five days to go. Fingers crossed. What do you make of that given the criticism? I know you've heard that he's received for being a strong man, an authoritarian, illiberal democracy proponent. And also, one of the outliers in terms of providing aid for Ukraine.

We've managed to approve the different instruments like the European peace facility that's allowed us to fund the weapons deliveries that we've sent to Ukraine. So, I don't want to exaggerate also the divisions when you actually have seen a united front from Europeans in the support of Ukraine. Now, I want to add to this, you know, when we have this dialogue when -- with the United States, we also have to defend our interests, when you think about trade issues, when, you know, we want to have a robust Transatlantic, but a balanced Transatlantic partnership with our AmErikan friends, we're much stronger if we're united. I think it would be a grave mistake on our end to go for bilateral relations, to go for transactional relations when we actually need to stay united and show united front in this Transatlantic relationship, because this is also where the ones that are trying to weaken and divide us like Vladimir Putin will be clearly looking at.

Putin himself never appears in the play, but his looming presence is felt in everything that transpires. It's the story of a journalist covering Putin in the early days of his regime. When western leaders saw him as a new hope for Russia, ignoring warning signs of a budding autocracy. Francesca Faridany plays Raya, the intrepid journalist, and Norbert Leo Butz plays her editor and friend, Kostya. Francesca, Norbert, welcome to the program. Thank you so much for joining us. I have to say, I really enjoyed this play. It hit a little too close to home, given everything that's transpired and obviously all of the attention that we have focused on Russia over the last two and a half years with the war in Ukraine. But your play sets us back at the very beginning, In 2000, beginning with Yeltsin, President Yeltsin signing off to the Russian public on New Year's Eve with his message saying that they will wake up to a new president. And that president was an unknown for the majority of the country, Vladimir Putin. And here we are, Raya with your character, Francesca, really a fictional character, but one who was based a lot on Anna Politkovskaya, an intrepid reporter who actually lost her life working on finding the truth on covering a war in Chechnya. How much did you know about the background of this story here with Vladimir Putin and about Anna Politkovskaya before you took on this role? FRANCESCA FARIDANY, ACTRESS, \"VLADIMIR\":  I didn't know a huge amount of that -- about that particular part of Russian history, so I dived right back in and read a lot of Masha Gessen's work and also watched a lot of documentaries to really -- because Russian history is so immense and so extraordinary and so when -- you have to really go back quite a bit to really get a run up at it. And for this specific part, which is really, you see that moment of Yeltsin sort of abdication speech, and then you jump to 2004. So, it's the first -- that's our first scene, which is the first scene of the play after the prologue. And you have -- you've seen him be in power for four years, and it's his \"first election,\" heavy quotes. And so, yes, I had to go back in and really remind myself what exactly was going on and who all the people are, who the moving parts are, because it's complicated. I found it complicated.",

And those cases, I just discussed as a cluster, and there are more. You would have to go back to the 1960s and '70s, that is 50 years ago, to find other high points that look like this. Now, why are we in this historically high period? Well, as in the 1960s, periods of social change and radical social change often correspond with periods of high political violence in societies. That is that common pattern. Well, what is the social change that we're going through today? Well, the big historic social change is we're going from a white majority democracy to a white minority democracy truly multiracial democracy. In 1990, 77 percent of Americans were non-Hispanic white. Today, that number is 61 percent. In about 10, 12 years, that number will be 50, 49 percent. We are going through the period, the transition period. It's about 20 years. It started about 10 years ago. And that corresponds with the rise of Donald Trump and also the virulent opposition to Donald Trump. And that also corresponds with the rise of this period, I call the era of violent populism in America. And that era of violent populism is unfortunately likely to be with us for a number of years because it -- yes, Donald Trump is a cause, but he's also a symptom of this era that we're going through. And it's not simply a matter of this one a lead or that one a lead or this election or that election, things have been getting worse steadily as we are going through this historic transition to a genuinely multiracial democracy.

And what that would look like is with senior leaders would say all political violence, not just violence by the other side, but all political violence is illegal, immoral, and anti-American. And the leader who's been doing that the most is President Biden. For several years, we have found in our data strong support for political violence to restore a woman's right to abortion. 10 percent of the public supports that. That's a lot of people. That's 30 million people. Well, why aren't we seeing more violence in that regard? One of the big reasons is President Biden. What President Biden has been doing is, from the day of the Dobbs decision, June 22, 2022, what President Biden has been doing is condemning the Dobbs decision, but also having big fat paragraphs that condemn political violence, even if it would come from the left. And he then says, take that anger you all feel and redirect it away from violence and toward voting. So, he's not trying to tell people to not be angry, he's trying to tell people to redirect that anger into voting and change the result in the democratic way. Well, that is extremely valuable. And he's been saying that not just about the issue of abortion, but he also in his Oval Office address right after the first Trump assassination attempt, said the very same thing for 15 minutes in front of the country as a whole where he condemned all political violence.",

So, the threats against the election officials, for example, these aren't disconnected, isolated events from all that -- those other acts of political violence, I just pointed out, they are just another dimension of the political violence around the outcome of elections, and specifically around the outcomes related to Donald Trump. Because Trump isn't just a political leader, he's representing for not only his people, but the folks who disagree with Trump, this return to and keeping frozen in time, this white majority democracy. And as a result, then you can expect the violence will be very focused around what will determine his success or failure, and that is resulting of the counts of the election the mail-in ballot boxes that are now being burned.
