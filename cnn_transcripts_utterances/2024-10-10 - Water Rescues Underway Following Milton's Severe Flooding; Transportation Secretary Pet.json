As we know, they've been conducting water rescues throughout the morning and the aftermath of Hurricane Milton.And this is video they just posted to social media of a young boy that was apparently floating on a piece of fence. And officers -- deputies, I should say, we're coming by him. He apparently gets their attention, and as you can see, there, calls out for them. They approach him and they are able to get him out of the water safely. Some incredible video. Again, 14-year-old boy on a piece of fence being dragged out of the floodwaters of Hurricane Milton. We actually want to talk to the sheriff of Hillsborough County. Now, Sheriff Chad Chronister joins us live. Sheriff, you put this video out on social media. I'm wondering what goes through your mind when you see footage like this? CHAD CHRONISTER, SHERIFF, HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT (via telephone): Listen, I just happened to be on the airboat for that one out of the over 200 rescues we've done and are still actively conducting. We just also noted a family. as I'm standing here by the flooded water, he was waving us down, flagging us down. Most people were saying hello. He was frantically waling his arms. We went over and it literally was like a scene at the \"Castaway\" movie, how he's hanging on for dear life. His mom evacuated him to a safer area last night. He was walking home. Didn't realize the water was going to get as flooded and as deep as it did. And he's not a good swimmer. And hence -- hence the rescue. He was visibly shaken. I mean, he thought -- he was just so grateful. We took him to some dry land. But just one of many rescues we've been conducting today.",

Let's take them up here because there'll be safe here.I started my career here 33 years ago in this neighborhood. I fell in love with this community right here. And they conduct those rescues where individuals thought that they would be safer here. And now to see the type of flooding that's fairly receding. You know, we're very fortunate and blessed we didn't get the storm surge. But the 16 to 18 inches of rain that we got to already heavily saturated areas, there's nowhere for this water to go.",

      "sentences": "Well, that's exactly right. Some of the worst-case scenarios did not materialize, but this is still a massive, massive impact for so many people.Right now, at the National Response Coordination Center where FEMA brings together all of the different agencies working these issues, from the U.S. military to a department like our Department of Transportation. And of course, we're engaging with the state and local officials on the ground to help support that response. There are now thousands of federal personnel, hundreds just for my department alone, deployed across the two storms, that Helene recovery and the Milton response. We see local officials and Florida's DOT doing extraordinary work quickly working through inspections to make sure that roads and bridges can be safely reopened. Our FAA is working with airports, about 25 significant airports in the impact area. Roughly half of them still closed, roughly half of them either partially open or fully open. We think more and more of them will be back to normal as we head into tomorrow. And then a real focus on the port of Tampa Bay. This port accounts for about 40 percent of the oil and energy coming into the state of Florida. Work is underway, getting underway to assess the conditions of the port and see what it will take to get that back up and running. The Coast Guard is leading that work. But with our supply chain team, we're tracking that very closely as well as at the DOT.",

We've been fortunate to see a number of gas stations open and it did not appear that there were huge lines, which, as a Floridian, I'm using to seeing after storms, these massive, massive lines outside of gas stations.I'm wondering, as your coordinating with local and state officials, what you're hearing is the greatest need right now?",

The other thing is just to give people good information. Importantly, yesterday, going into yesterday, a lot of the message that local officials needed people to hear was the message to evacuate. And it sounds like that message was well headed and that saved lives. Now, in many locations, residents are going to hear a different message. The message will be to stay put until word goes out that it is safe. When you're talking about standing water or other areas where there might be downed power lines, there's still a lot of active hazards. So you really want to pay attention to good local information for trusted sources -- from trusted sources about when it is safe to leave if you've been sheltering in place. And of course, so many people wanting to know when it will be safe for them to return home if they did evacuate.",

It's extraordinary work working through the existing concept of operations that allows what are called Title X forces, U.S. active- duty military and National Guard to come into play. I'm sure there'll be more conversations, as always, about how to develop, evolve or fine-tune the structure for an exact response. But what I've seen is that, in and out of uniform, you've got people doing an amazing job, working together and working to support those -- those local responders and state and local authorities who are doing everything in their power now.

And the best thing to do is just really avoid it. It could be a very simple little cut.
