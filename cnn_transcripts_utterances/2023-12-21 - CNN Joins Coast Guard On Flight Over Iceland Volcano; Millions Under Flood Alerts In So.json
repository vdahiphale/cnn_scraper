(on camera): These flights are extremely important for the Icelandic Coast Guard. On one hand, they have to survey the area but they also have to practice in case they need to do plan evacuations. (voice-over): Iceland was prepared for the massive eruption that started earlier this week. A more than a two-miles-long fissure spewing magma hundreds of feet into the air.

You will notice that we have the flashflood warning there but also flood watches. Those are starting to expand eastward into Arizona because that is where the system is going to be moving in the next 24 to 36 hours. Today, again, the focus across southern California, but notice the moisture moves into New Mexico, Nevada, also areas of Utah and portions of Colorado eventually. The focus for today is still going to be across southern California, L.A., San Diego, and some of the northern Los Angeles suburbs as well. Tomorrow, the concern for flooding still includes the eastern suburbs of Los Angeles. But then it really starts to stretch to the east, places like Phoenix, Tucson now in the threat for potential flooding. Then the system as a whole continues to make its way across the U.S. This is likely going to cause further travel delays on Friday, even Saturday, and Sunday if you have some last-minute plans. Because this system is going to continue sliding east. So Christmas Eve, likely dealing with rain first, then some snow in a city like Denver and rain across Minneapolis and Chicago. Christmas Day likely to be very soggy from Wisconsin all the way down to the gulf coast.",

Are we expecting this to help get more home buyers into the market? VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN BUSINESS &amp; POLITICS CORRESPONDENT: It should because you have so many Americans that were not able to buy a home because mortgage rates were over 7 percent. And even in the fall, coming close to 8 percent. Now that you see rates coming down to 6.67 percent today, that is a significant drop from just a week ago. And that is the ripple effect of the Federal Reserve deciding to pause interest rate hikes last week. The one thing that home buyers are going to have to contend with is still low inventory and high prices. The median price for a home in the U.S. right now is $387,000. The hope is that along with falling mortgage rates, you will have more inventory on the market and that will help bring down home prices.",

You don't have forever to pay 66 cents for Forever Stamps. The U.S. Postal Service says, one month from today, the cost for Forever Stamps is going to go up two pennies to 68 cents. Other postage costs will also rise. That includes Priority Mail, Priority Mail Express and USPS Ground. It is the fourth rate hike in less than two years. I don't know if you're feeling lucky, but the Powerball jackpot has jumped to an estimated $620 million after there was no winner in last night's drawing. Lottery officials say, if someone wins the next drawing on Saturday and they choose the cash option, they could go home with close to $311 million. Just in time for Christmas. What about it? May be, huh? And scientists in California say they have successfully replicated nuclear fusion at least three times this year. Nuclear fusion is a reaction that involves smashing two or more atoms together to form a denser one in a process that releases huge amounts of energy and leaves no long-lived radioactive waste. If scientists master this process, they could provide the world with a near limitless source of clean power and potentially help solve the global climate crisis.",

And we have the bedroom in the middle that we can be for our relation. Is she on to something there? Let's discuss with psychotherapist, family therapist and author, Robi Ludwig. Thank you so much for being with us, Robi. Spouses can have different schedules, potentially a partner that snores, kicks, punches, does all sorts of things. That can cause problems in a marriage, right? ROBI LUDWIG, PSYCHOTHERAPIST &amp; AUTHOR: Absolutely. Also, there are other problems that can happen when somebody gets less than their seven to eight hours sleep. They can be more vulnerable to certain medical conditions, like diabetes or cardiovascular issues, even dementia. And also, our mood can suffer making us more irritable and difficult to get along with. So there are a lot of reasons why sleep is so important. But I don't know that people necessarily need to sleep in different beds in order to achieve good sleep hygiene.",

But I want to make it clear that sleep divorce -- and I don't really like that name because it suggests -- you know, divorce sounds so dire. But we want to achieve sleep compatibility. It doesn't need to be all or nothing. If you have a big business meeting, or if you find during the week it's important for you to have good sleep, you know, you can find that maybe you have separate sleep for a period of time and sleep together on the weekends. You just want to make sure that your intimacy as a partner doesn't suffer.
