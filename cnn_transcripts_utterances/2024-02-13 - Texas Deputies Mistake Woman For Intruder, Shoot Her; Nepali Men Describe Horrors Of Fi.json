So they are now examined in the Sheba Medical Center in Israel. Obviously, we are very happy that they survived but they do have a mental and physical implications, especially for Louis who needed several medications. Unfortunately, it seems like he did not receive his needed medications, including the shipment that we, through the French and Qatari, were supposed to receive as the Qatari promised. Their families and France -- that they would receive the medications but we don't have indication for that. They will have a very long recovery process.

The recruits are first enticed with the promise of money and a passport and then deployed to the front lines with just a gun and some very basic training. Now, hundreds of Nepali families say their relatives are missing and they fear the worst and some haven't been in contact for weeks or even months.CNN's Matthew Chance has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN CHIEF GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): It should be a world apart from the battlefields of Ukraine but this Himalayan state has become an unlikely casualty of Russia's brutal war. Nepalis, like Ramchandra, who escaped the Russian army with his life, have prayed for his comrades still fighting on the front lines. He took a bullet and shrapnel in Ukraine, he told me, and saw many Nepalis killed. RAMCHANDRA KHADKA, FORMER FIGHTER (Speaking foreign language). CHANCE (voice-over):  \"Some complained they were sent forward while Russian troops held back,\" he tells me. \"But the main problem is the language barrier. Sometimes you couldn't even understand where you're supposed to be going,\" he says -- \"which way to point your gun.\" But that chaos hasn't stopped Nepalis signing up. Many posting upbeat videos on social media of their military training in Russia where they're meant to be prepared for the hardships of the Ukraine war. In reality, several former Nepali recruits tell CNN they were sent into battle after barely two weeks to fight for the Kremlin armed with a rifle and a contract for a few thousand dollars a month -- a fortune in Nepal where unemployment is high. CHANCE:  For the vast majority of Nepalis fighting for Russia in Ukraine, they're doing it for the money. And they come from these (INAUDIBLE) impoverished areas across the country. We've actually come to one of them now on the outskirts of Katmandu to meet a woman who in the past few days has learned that her husband has been killed fighting in that distant war. Hello. Hi.
