SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME &amp; JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, there definitely has been a shift here, Erin. In the last hour, we have seen an increase in the presence of the Secret Service officers and personnel. You could see them here. They were not here earlier. This is the area where we expect Trump to come to, his motorcade to drive in here, and then to be taken through the garage here, into the courthouse. He will be placed under arrest, and then taken to the courtroom. What law enforcement here has done is that they have put these snowplows all across here to try and just give the extra measure of security. And you can see that there are many photographers and media personnel here, because they want to get a shot of the motorcade arriving, of Trump going inside. But law enforcement, the police have done a fairly good job here, as you tell, of trying to block any sort of access to the street here. Also, I can show you, here in the last hour, we have seen more police officer, Metro, Washington Metro P.D. and more officers arriving here on bikes and more law enforcement personnel here as we get ready for that 4:00 hour, we are seeing the increase of the law enforcement. And we expect, as I said, the motorcade to come this way, enter this street here, and he will go inside -- Erin? BURNETT: All right, Shimon, as we await that arrival, thank you. Wolf?",

      "sentences": "Right now, a once unimaginable spectacle in the nation's capital. Donald Trump is returning to Washington, D.C., for his third arrest and third arraignment.Trump just landed at Reagan National Airport. You see the plane right there. It's his Boeing 757. He is about to answer to a historic indictment that charges him with grave crimes against the very nation that he once swore an oath to protect and defend. Welcome to CNN's special live coverage. I'm Jake Tapper. Soon, Donald Trump will travel by motorcade from Reagan National Airport to the criminal federal courthouse in downtown D.C., where he will, again, face arrest and enter a plea before a magistrate judge. Last time, he was in Florida. This time, in D.C. This time, he's accused of orchestrating a conspiracy to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Trump may get a glimpse of the capitol on his way. That's, of course, where prosecutors say he exploited and perhaps even incited the violence and chaos of January 6th in his determined bid to stay in power. The 45th president will return to the scene of his alleged crimes as the Republican frontrunner in the 2024 race for the White House. Trump is expected to plead not guilty to all four counts in this indictment. Those counts include conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights, specifically the rights to vote and the rights to have your vote counted. Our correspondents are covering it all, including Mr. Trump's hearing inside the courthouse and security throughout the city of Washington, D.C. Plus, CNN will have one of the only TV correspondents traveling in Donald Trump's motorcade. CNN anchor and chief correspondent, Kaitlan Collins, is outside the courthouse for us, and she will be with us throughout our coverage. Kaitlan, how is Donald Trump planning on approaching this moment? KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF CORRESPONDENT: I think as about as expected, Jake. I mean, weirdly, this has become routine for the former president. This is not anywhere close to being his first arraignment. It is his second on federal charges and, of course, his first on charges about what he allegedly did while he was president for actions that he took then. That is the significance of this moment of him, as he has just now landed here in Washington at Reagan National Airport. You know, not Joint Base Andrews where, typically, as president, you would fly into. This is where ex-presidents fly into. And so he has landed there. He will make his way over here to the courthouse with his attorneys in tow. And that is where he will go in to issue that plea of not guilty, Jake. And I should note that, as he was on the way here, he was already attacking the venue of where this case is taking place and also the judge who is overseeing it, claiming, in all capital letters, that he believes both are unfair. That is not a surprise, of course, Jake. He's attacked several other judges previously. But it is notable because the venue, that is something that we have heard from his attorneys, that they believe they could try to ask for a different venue here. Whether or not they're successful in arguing they don't believe he can get a fair jury here remains to be seen. They also kind of argued that in Miami, saying they didn't believe he could get a fair trial while he was running as the Republican frontrunner for the president of the United States. I will say, Jake, there was some question about whether or not Trump was going to appear in-person for this arraignment. I'm told he did not want to appear here in person. But it's standard procedure for him to come in with his attorneys to issue that not guilty plea. Of course, then it's what happens after that, that is the real story, of what this judge decides on the timing and what this trial could look like. TAPPER: Paula Reid is also standing by outside the federal courthouse. Paula, walk us through what we should expect to happen during Trump's appearance in court today.",

We have a former president of the United States who is being arrested because he tried to overturn his election loss. DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT: And it's being incorporated inextricably -- easy for me to say with a cold -- with what he's trying to do now, which is win the White House back again through that very democratic system that he tried to overturn and undermine. And it is really remarkable the way he continues to be so brazen about using what we're seeing now, being in a very precarious legal situation, as a political plus for him. In post after post, that he has put on his social media platform today, talking about how, this isn't just about me, this is about you, using that whole notion of, I'm fighting for you, for the little guy, somehow not just about financials and economics and social issues but about the justice system.",

We were all witness, in a way, in the court of public opinion, which will then translate to the courtroom of law, about what actually transpired. We got a behind-the-scenes glance, of course. We're talking about the congressional January 6th hearings. And so, in many respects, you do have the public very aware of the circumstances, about part of the nuances. The remaining question is what these prosecutors have to actually prove, that he really did, in fact, know that he lost this election. It wasn't just chest-beating. But take a step back and realize that this is not only the first time we're seeing an American president arrested under indictment or even going to be arraigned. It's now the third and four months that this is actually happening. It's so significant, especially because he himself was on Truth Social talking about, he just needs one more, hoping it will be an advantage. He does not seem to believe the gravitas that you have articulated today about the somber occasion. He sees it as a kind of feather in the cap, which only helps the prosecution to really unpack this case even more.",
