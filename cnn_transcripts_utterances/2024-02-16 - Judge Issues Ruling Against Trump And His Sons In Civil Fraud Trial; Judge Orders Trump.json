      "sentences": "Yes. The paper is still warm, but we're going through it right now. And as you and Kara were talking about, this case is so personal because it represents such a threat to Trump's business, his family business and his identity. Remember, it was his identity as a businessman that brought him fame before he arrived at the White House. But in looking at the summary of this ruling, we see, in addition to the monetary penalties that Kara just laid out, they have found him liable for fraud and they are going to continue the appointment of an independent monitor.So back in 2022, the judge installed a monitor to keep an eye on exactly what The Trump Organization was doing when it came to its business dealings. Now, among the things this monitor uncovered were a $48 million loan, for example, to the company itself, but there was no paperwork. They couldn't really find any information. That was just one thing that came up. Now, Trump lawyers have insisted, because they loaned the money to themselves, they didn't have the paperwork that they needed, and insist that the monitor has found no fraud. Now, the judge also here orders the installation of an independent director of compliance. But I also want to note that they are saying here, the judge is saying that they're going to limit the defendant's right to conduct business in New York for a few years. Now, it's probably going to take a few minutes before we unpack exactly what that means. Does that - that does not appear to be an indefinite ban, the so-called corporate death penalty, but it does appear that the judge is going to put some restrictions on Trump and The Trump Organization's ability to do business in the state of New York. But let's go back to the idea of this independent director of compliance that appears to be maybe an executive level person who will ensure that they are being honest when evaluating their assets, when applying for insurance or loans from banks. Because, of course, that is what the judge here found Trump liable for last fall, before this trial started. They said you are liable for fraud. They believe that he was not honest about the value of his assets, because he was trying to get more favorable terms from banks, from insurance companies. Now, Trump's defense here was that they were - these are subjective valuations, that ultimately there was no victim. And I want to note, when it comes to barring anyone from doing business in the state of New York, the so-called corporate death penalty is something that is rarely handed down in the state of New York, especially when there is no obvious victim. So we're going to keep reading to learn more about the limits that they're going to put on his ability to conduct business in New York over the next few years.",

First to you, Norm, just your reaction to this filing by Judge Engoron and the news from Paula that The Trump Organization will not face the corporate death penalty, though there will be some limits on their ability to do business in New York.",

      "sentences": "And I want to bring in Renato, just sort of a - with a technical question. And Paula, jump in too, if you know this.As we understand now that the judge has ordered Trump to pay nearly $355 million in this civil fraud trial in these ill-gotten gains, in disgorgement, as it is called. What happens, because obviously he's appealing this, is the - is there some kind of bond that is posted? What is the process for securing the money even as this appeals process continues? Does he have to do that?",

      "speaker": "RENATO MARIOTTI, FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR",
      "sentences": "So that's typically the case in most states, is that you do have to post a bond, pending appeal. And that often is something that you'll post a certain amount of capital. You won't post the entire amount in order to obtain that bond.Here I would expect, for example, there not only to be a bond that's posted, but of course, in the meantime, he's going to have to comply with some of the conditions that the judge has already imposed. So then that's going to limit his ability to continue to make money and run his business. I mean, as a practical matter, businesses have to be nimble. And having an independent compliance director and a monitor and so on is going to also, I would say, hamper his ability to be nimble and act in a way that he ordinarily might want to in his business. So I think it's a very significant impact on him in the short run, regardless of his financial situation. I don't see any way, despite Trump often spinning things as a win, I just don't see how any lawyer with a straight face could tell their client that this is a great result. This is a devastating result for Trump and his businesses.",

      "sentences": "Yes. They were bracing today. Obviously, they were not expecting this financial penalty to be anything, a light or anything favorable to them. They already knew that this was working against their favor, given what the judge had ruled. And right now, they're reading this in real time, just like we are. They were waiting. They knew it was expected to come out in the mid afternoon. The former president is preparing to potentially speak on this.But as of this moment, since this just came out from the judge, they're looking at it themselves. And I can tell you one thing that has caught their eye, that it's not totally clear what this actually means for the future of this company is what Norm was just referencing there, where Trump has been banned from serving in any top roles in any New York company for the next three years. Also, his two adult sons cannot do it for the next two years based on what I'm looking at. And of course, Eric Trump is essentially in charge of the - he's the executive - the chief executive of The Trump Organization. And so when you're reading through this and this is a question I've had for his team is whether or not it means anyone in his family can run that in the near term and what that means for The Trump Organization over the next two years. And so that is something that is very much in doubt at this moment as they are reading through this and trying to understand really the implications of this, given they already knew just how expensive it was going to be. Yes, they do plan to appeal. But the question, since this is a little under what the attorney general was asking for here, it's not clear just how much they could potentially get it down, if at all, in an appeal. And so that is certainly something that is kind of tying up this years-long investigation that Trump has been fighting for so long and now it's culminated with this ruling from the judge.",

How do you anticipate that will affect him in a very real way, but also just, I guess, sort of how he feels about his image and the fact that that will be tied up?",

If you look at the primary results in the polls that we've seen, both of people voting or just in polling in future states, Donald Trump's in an extremely comfortable position. Not just - we used to talk about the Trump core base. That's really the party writ large at this point.But to Renato's point earlier, he talked about how if Donald Trump sees any weakness, he can go after and seemingly almost anything that's been thrown at him in a courtroom. This is not an example where Trump can do that. It cuts to his core. These are very real costs on this. It makes it easier to define him, not as a successful businessman, which he's obviously successfully pitched over the years, but as somebody who's done it through ill means. And ultimately, you've used the word disgorgement a lot, Brianna. That's a term that's usually used for champagne. And there's no Dom Perignon or even Trump's sparkling wine being opened at Mar-A-Lago over this. This is bad news.",

Andrew Cuomo on how he dealt with COVID numbers and then how those sexual harassment allegations, many of them against him, so that predated him leaving office.So she does have a record of being pretty tough, but across the aisle as well. I really wonder what you think about - it's almost like a conservatorship or babysitting of The Trump Organization.

      "sentences": "So I'm going to go back up to the top. It's a 90 - over 90-page opinion here. So I'm just going to scroll up to the top and let's talk first about this independent monitor. This was something that was first installed back in 2022. And of course, The Trump Organization isn't going to be happy. No organization, no business, no police department, no government organization is ever happy when they have someone come from the outside to come inside, look under every rock, turn over every stone, trying to figure out what you may be missing, what you may have done wrong.But in a case like this, where a judge has found him liable for fraud, suggesting that he - or finding that he lied about the value of his assets to banks, to insurance companies, installing a monitor, the purpose was to see what else may not have been on the up-and-up. And as I said earlier, I mean, one of the things that the monitor discovered was this $48 million loan The Trump Organization sort of within itself, but couldn't find any paperwork to support this. And The Trump Organization insisted that look, because that was money we loaned to ourselves, we didn't need to document it. There was no fraud that was found here, but the judge extending the appointment of that monitor, and not only that, but also adding another position, an independent director of compliance. So this appears to be someone who will operate within the organization to make sure that they are complying with the rules, with the regulations, with the laws. Of course, this is something particularly - closely held business like this, they're not going to be happy to have that. But of course, it could have been worse. They are not - it appears - not dissolving The Trump Organization. And there are some restrictions on the ability of many of the executives to do business in the state of New York. Those are pretty detailed. We're still hammering out exactly how we want to articulate those. But again, they're not going to be happy about this outside oversight. It's not forever, but there's a reason. Again, a judge found him liable, found that he did not accurately represent the value of his assets and did so to get more favorable terms from insurance companies, from banks. Ordinary people know when you are applying for insurance or for a loan, you cannot lie on those applications.",
