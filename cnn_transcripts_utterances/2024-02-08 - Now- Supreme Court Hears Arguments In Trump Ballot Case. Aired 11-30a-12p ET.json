But I think one point your friends on the other side would make is well, that's just how the Constitution uses those terms.So, for example, we know that the president pro tem of the Senate and the Speaker of the House are officers of the United States because the Constitution says they are. But we also know that they don't hold an office under the United States because of the incompatibility clause that says they can't. So, maybe the Constitution to us today, to lay reader might look a little odd in distinguishing between officer -- an officer, not prepositions, nouns, but distinction. But maybe that's exactly how it works. Thoughts.",

And so, they created a democratic safety valve. President Trump can go ask Congress to give him amnesty by a two-thirds vote. But unless he does that, our Constitution protects us from insurrectionists. And third, this case illustrates the danger of refusing to apply Section Three as written.
