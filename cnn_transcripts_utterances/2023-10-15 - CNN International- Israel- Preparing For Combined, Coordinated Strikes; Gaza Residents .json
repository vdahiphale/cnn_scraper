Welcome to our breaking coverage of the \"War in Israel.\"Well, Israel's military says it is preparing for the next stage of its war with Hamas. It's expected to involve coordinated strikes from air, sea and land, but Israel has not yet given an indication when it might begin. In Gaza though, deadly Israeli airstrikes do continue to fall the IDF's latest update saying, it's at 250 targets in Gaza today. And Hamas commander they say was killed. For civilians living in fear and under a complete blockade, aid workers are warning that the situation has now descended into complete catastrophe and adding to the misery.

MCLEAN (voice-over): Across Gaza, Israel says it hit more than 100 military targets overnight and more on Sunday. In the aftermath of each people rush to frantically find victims never far from danger.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): It is as you can see destruction, destruction. They are destroying us. (FOREIGN LANGUAGE) MCLEAN (voice-over): Even hospitals like this children's hospital had been told to evacuate from Northern Gaza. But with newborn babies and children on ventilators, doctors say they can't. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translation): Where will these children go? They're on ventilators. And it's not possible to move them. MCLEAN (voice-over): The World Health Organization said it strongly condemns Israel's repeated orders for the evacuation of 22 hospitals treating more than 2,000 inpatients in northern Gaza, saying forcing the evacuation of patients south could be tantamount to a death sentence. Across Gaza, aid groups say that food and fuel are running desperately low. The UN says most people already lack access to water. Foreign aid is being sent by the plane load and the truckload to Egypt in hopes of getting it into Gaza. But Egypt and Palestinians on the ground say the roads near the border are too badly damaged from airstrikes for trucks to pass. In Sunday, CNN asked the IDF whether it was coordinating with aid groups to ensure that supplies get in. LT. COL. PETER LEMER, IDF SPOKESPERSON: The IDF and the defense ministry are engaged with the international community, to try and facilitate various different things. You know, I think we need to leave -- I speak on behalf of the IDF so we are deeply involved in the combat, we are the warriors we need to leave the diplomacy for the diplomats. MCLEAN (voice-over): In just eight days, the death toll in Gaza has already surpassed the number of people killed in the 2014 conflict, which lasted 51 days. And with an Israeli ground invasion looming and supplies running low, there is little hope that things will soon get better for the people of Gaza. Scott McLean, CNN. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

But on the basis of the five rounds of Israeli-Hamas conflict that we've been through over the years, I would say that the Israelis are essentially revving the tanks with this massive buildup on the border to unsettle Hamas to get the sense that they're about, about to be clobbered. At the same time, allowing time for the Palestinian civilians, to leave, because the most important thing from the Israeli point of view is when they go in to try to uproot the Hamas militias, they don't want to have to be dealing with civilians, who are heavily in these heavily populated areas.So that's the reason why Hamas is telling them to stay and why Israel, the time delay, it's because they want to get them out of the area of conflict. Israel doesn't have any real pressure to move at the moment. And they've got to also consider their hostages and American hostages that are in Gaza. And that complicates their operations. So, I think that they're not on any kind of stopwatch here, but could go at any minute when they think that the area's clear enough. And they've got a clear enough shot at Hamas militias.",

The region wants to see a ceasefire. This is at odds with the language that we heard from the U.S. only four or five days ago, and indications from our reporting that there had been, you know, the use of the term calm things down ceasefire, de-escalate, had not been terms that the State Department had wanted to sort of circulate. But they've certainly heard that concerted message from the region.How much pressure is the region putting on the U.S. to feed back to the Israelis?

But the basic point that you make Becky is I think absolutely right, that, that the United States is now hearing from our Arab friends and allies, that we really need to find a way to prevent the civilian casualties involved now, on the Palestinian side, as opposed to be atrocious casualties that occurred on the Israeli side, that the United States has to find a way to kind of avoid massive casualties, because that's going to create problems in these Arab states with their populations.So far, there haven't been massive demonstrations, large ones in Iraq, but elsewhere, you know, it hasn't been a major issue, but I think they're walking on eggshells here. And they want the United States to get Israel on the one hand, to do what it has to do with Hamas. They're no friends and Hamas by any means. But on the other hand, to protect -- to get them to avoid civilian casualties as much as possible. And the United States is using its influence, just appointed a special envoy for Humanitarian Affairs. Somebody I think, you know, well, David Satterfield (ph) who's, who's going out there, it's going to work this with Egypt. And I expect that the unit the Israelis are listening, they're not behaving in the normal way of going in. And without the same regard from civilian casualties.

The sensitivity is, is because neither Egypt nor Jordan wants Israel two to foist the Palestinians on them. And they want to avoid as much as possible, an arrangement where they have to take responsibility for the Palestinians. It's Israel's problem, as far as they're concerned. For Jordan, which already has a majority Palestinian population. It's deeply destabilizing. But I don't think there's a real risk there at the moment that, that there's going to be a major refugee movement into Jordan. For Egypt, they don't want -- they could take it's a big country, they could take up to million, 2 million refugees, Palestinian refugees, temporarily, if they really had to, but the security dangers for them in Sinai, which has been very problematic for them a lot of smuggling, a lot of jihad has associated elements in there. And I think they're, they're very reluctant to have a large Palestinian population coming in. That's different two, dual nationals, Americans, I think they will arrange in the next day or two, to have all of them come out.But they don't want the Palestinians coming across the border, if they can possibly avoid it.

The diplomatic pressure at the moment is on Israel -- is on Egypt rather, to let them into Egypt. Of course, that is a political decision for the President of Egypt, President Sisi and it's not one that he wants to take. He doesn't want to have the liability of several million potentially Palestinians in Egypt, he would see that as destabilizing he would see it as well as the Palestinian problem if you will, being shunted on to Egypt.So, for the Palestinians who are in Gaza, at the moment, there's no place to go apart from move towards the south. And that is not necessarily safe. The UN agencies are telling us that the hospitals are right capacity. They're saying that one UN agency is saying at least that they're running out of body bags, that there are shortages of water that the food is in short supply. The situation, the humanitarian situation in Gaza, at the moment, according to the UN agencies there on the ground is an absolutely desperate situation on this side of the border. The preparations are being made and we went to see them today with the IDF. The preparations are being made for a possible grounding cushion. We were with troops and fields who were training for that moment where they possibly get the order to go in, they were lining up their vehicles. It was a combined military force, you had tanks, you had infantry, you had as well combat engineers. So, they were practicing for the moment, they're told to go in that they can, that they can sort of move off in a convoy together. And as well, we saw them practicing some IDF troops, practicing and in a mocked up Palestinian town, it had mosques, it had stores, it had houses, and they were training for combat in an urban environment. And while we were there, I said to one of the officers there who would be first in with the troops. I said, you know, Hamas, as you know, is telling the civilians not to leave the north of Gaza. If you go in, there's a potential for civilians to be there. And he said like, the IDF is a professional force. We don't target civilians, we target the terrorists there. These were his words. He said that, you know, because there could be civilians that that will make it very, very difficult. But I also spoke to an IDF spokesman and he told me, look, if that Hamas tells the civilians not to leave, then the responsibility for civilians, if troops go in will be with Hamas, not with the IDF. So, it will be a very, very tough and difficult situation for the civilians and for the troops. And we talked earlier today with a -- with an IDF soldier who was first -- one of the first into Gaza in 2014, the last time there was an incursion, and he said yes, we encountered civilians, and this was a combat zone.
