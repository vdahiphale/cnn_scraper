      "sentences": "So, new this morning, a Fox News poll on the state of the race, when asked who voters think can bring needed change, look at that, Harris in Georgia, Nevada, and Arizona with a slight lead over Donald Trump. Trump with a slight lead over Harris in North Carolina. Obviously, all within the margin of error.With me now is press secretary to Donald Trump's campaign, Karoline Leavitt. Thanks so much for being with us. So, how do you explain now that Vice President Harris is seen as perhaps the candidate of change? KAROLINE LEAVITT, NATIONAL PRESS SECRETARY, TRUMP 2024: Well, thank you so much for having me, John. And it is our goal, over the next several weeks, ahead of Election Day, to ensure that voters understand, Kamala Harris is not the candidate of change, nor is she the candidate of the future. Kamala Harris is the vice president of the United States right now. And she is wholly responsible for the failures over the past four years. Kamala Harris said she was proud of Bidenomics, which has ushered the worst inflation crisis in a generation. Kamala Harris was named the border czar and has allowed an open border policy of more than 11 million illegal people into our country that has caused a migrant crime epidemic across our nation as well. Kamala Harris does not deserve a promotion. She deserves a demotion. And unlike Kamala Harris, President Trump has a strong record in his first term as president, where he secured the border, unleashed the might of our energy industry, ushered peace around this world. And that's our case to make to voters across the country.",

And Kamala Harris was not the border czar, she was appointed to deal with the northern triangle.But let me - let me ask you a follow-up to my initial question here. Even if what you say, taking your argument there, if the voters in all these states are seeing the vice president of the candidate - as the candidate of a change, does it tell you that maybe they are beginning to see a Republican nominee who's 78-years-old and been running for president for nine years, is that beginning to have an impact?",

And the truth is, the border has been a complete disaster. Everyone recognizes that.And energy prices, gasoline prices, are still 50 percent higher today under Kamala Harris than they were under President Trump. And if you look further and deeper into these polls, if you look at the issues that matter to voters, like immigration, like the economy, like foreign policy, where we've seen war erupt all over this world under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, voters trust Donald Trump on those issues. They trust him because he, again, has a first-term record to stand on. And you brought up Donald Trump's age, so I do want to mention it. This race is not about age, it's about competence. And President Trump has proven to be a leader who can bring stability back to this world, who can bring peace through this world, who can make America strong again. And that's why voters trust him on the issues that matter.",

Basically, the Biden administration has imposed a policy that has allowed Russia to have sanctuary free from Ukrainian long-range attacks using U.S. weapons but for counter fire. And that was really only a recent change. And so what he's saying is, if you - if I'm going to win this war, at least change its strategic direction, than I've got to be able to strike deep into Russia at targets such as depots and airfields and warehouses and things like that and really hit them when they're -- where it hurts because otherwise Russia is - has been ranging Ukraine now for two-and-a-half years, striking both military and civilian targets.So, it's - it's a very, very reasonable proposition.

Although Russia continues to make - pick up a village here and there and they're zeroing in now on a major logistical hub in Donetsk. So, I think what - what Zelenskyy is trying to do, for a number of reasons, is to change the dynamic. And so he seized the initiative by authorizing this incursion into Kursk, which has been wildly successful. You know, they've seized about 100 settlements, captured 600 Russian soldiers, 500 square miles now occupied.And what he's done is embarrassed Putin, number one. Number two, he's reinvigorated his own troops, improved morale, and I think has signal to allies that Ukraine can take the fight to Russia. And now he's coming asking for more weapons. But I think the other one is, to your point now, is he know - he sees the U.S. elections coming up. He wants to be - make sure that Ukraine is in the best possible position should maybe Donald Trump get elected and want to move to some type of conclusion or withdraw some support from Ukraine. But I also think long-term he recognizes that the allies support for this conflict is only going to last so long. I mean over the past couple months, for example, Germany has cut its support to Ukraine by nearly a half in its future budget. So, I think he reads - sees the writing on the wall, is trying to gain leverage by - by occupying Russian ground. And maybe he sees at some point he'll be sitting across the table from the Russians and needs to be able to put something on the table.",

But sometimes ambition exceeds realism. And so I think, you know, I think he wants to get to a negotiating table at some point in the best possible position.
