      "sentences": "It does not mean that he is liable for his actions on January 6. What this means is that Capitol police officers, members of Congress, and others who have tried to sue Trump related to January 6, they will get their day in court. They will get the opportunity to litigate their claims.Now, the former president has tried to argue that these suits cannot be brought. They say that -- they're arguing that the actions he took that day, those were all part of his official duties as president. And federal officials from the president on down enjoy immunity from civil suits. But here the court do align around his actions that day saying these were not things that you did in your official capacity. These were more like campaign activities, and therefore he does not enjoy immunity from civil suits. But the bigger question, Kate, going forward is how this could impact the criminal cases that he is facing. Of course, next March, he will go to trial here in Washington, DC for his efforts around election subversion and January 6. And it is expected that some of the same questions will arise in this case. Now, again, this case had to do with civil suits there. That would be the question of whether he has any sort of immunity from criminal prosecution. But if this decision is any indication, that is not likely going to be a successful argument for him.",

      "sentences": "Well, two things, Kate, both of them very important. First of all, on most direct level, this means that the lawsuits against Donald Trump -- the civil lawsuits against Donald Trump relating to January 6 brought by Capitol police officers, those lawsuits can continue. They can go on. As Paula said correctly, it doesn't mean Donald Trump loses those lawsuits, but it means those lawsuits can happen.Secondly, and I think more importantly, this gives us an important preview into what might happen in criminal cases because Donald Trump already has argued that he should be given what we call criminal immunity. Now, the courts are going to have to answer two questions there. Number one, is there even such a thing as criminal immunity? We don't know the answer to that. The Supreme Court has said we don't know the answer to that. But even if the courts say yes, there can be such thing as criminal immunity for a federal public official acting within his job, was Donald Trump's conduct within the scope of his job as president? And here we see the Court of Appeals saying no. What he did was not within the scope of his job as president, therefore, he can be sued. And we'll see if the courts as it works its way through the federal courts make a similar determination that no, his conduct was not within his job as president and therefore he can be indicted and criminally prosecuted. Remains to be seen but this is an important indicator.",

So, on the civil case, Donald Trump surely is going to ask the Donald -- the Supreme Court to take the case. He's going to argue, yes, I was within the scope of what I was doing as president, therefore, I should be immune. We'll see if the Supreme Court takes that.On the criminal case. I think it -- right now, we're at the district court level -- the trial court level. We don't even have a ruling yet from the trial court judge. Then, it will come up to this same court that just ruled today. And then I think it's very likely to get up to the Supreme Court, where the Supreme Court will have to decide one, is there such thing as criminal immunity for a federal official?

So, the staff that put together the report is a nonpartisan staff. But the members of Congress who served on the ethics committee are equally represented among Democrats and Republicans.The report was voted out of committee unanimously. Meaning that it was a bipartisan unanimous vote. And so, I was disappointed this morning when I started to hear the rumblings that Republican leadership was encouraging its members to vote against this expulsion. To me, that was an indication that they weren't placing faith in their own Republican members who sit on the ethics committee, which I think is very unfortunate. It's not generally thought of as a sought-after Committee, and the fact that they serve on it is indeed a service to the American people. And I really was, frankly, kind of shocked by that. But obviously, rank and file members, as you say, saw fit to act on in -- on their own. And I think that's a really important thing to say about them. And it also is an indication to me that members really took the time to read this comprehensive report. I have to give a huge shout-out to the ethics staff that has just labored over this for nine months. And remember, there were calls from people in the media, from other members, that they weren't acting quickly enough. And yet, on the other side, we heard from Mr. Santos's team that they didn't feel like he had been given due process. He was clearly given due process. They worked around the clock in order to make this report fair and complete. And so, that's obviously been reflected in this vote today.",

I -- but I hope that they, you know, follow the same kind of rigorous process that we followed here.People need to be satisfied that it was careful consideration that was given that we didn't take this lightly. Certainly, expelling a member is not a small matter. And when you're talking about Senator Menendez, it's a Senator who has served for many, many years. So, I leave it up to the Senate Ethics Committee to make that determination and to that body. But I also want to stress that serving in Congress, whether it's a representative or a senator is a privilege. It is not a right. And that is -- and it is essential that we maintain good government and good ethics in government. So, I think both chambers of this body need to make sure that that happens.",

And the speaker, Danny Hastert, not only didn't vote, but the speaker so rarely votes that they're not listed as a non-vote when you look at the roll call vote.So, what we saw was Speaker Johnson, and then the other members of the Republican leadership minus Richard Hudson from North Carolina who voted for the expulsion was they didn't whip the vote. They said this is a vote of your conscience. But we think this is not a good idea and we think that this is precedent-setting.
