This, of course, comes after the judge found that Trump had violated the gag order for the 10th time this week, fined him a total of $10,000, and telling the former president that the next time he may be forced to put him in incarceration as any kind of sanction, saying that he seems that the $1,000 per violation fine is just not serving as a deterrent, guys.",

Remember, Trump's team had argued that Willis should be disqualified both because of a romantic relationship she had with a fellow prosecutor on the case, but also because of comments she made publicly regarding the case. And even though the lower court judge did not remove Willis, her fellow prosecutor, Nathan Wade, did step aside. Trump and other co- defendants saying that the judge got that wrong. Again, going to the Court of Appeals and saying, will you give this another revisit, and the Court of Appeals now saying yes.

In this one, there also isn't even a likelihood anytime soon of us getting a trial date because Judge Aileen Cannon has pulled the trial date off the calendar and says she has to work through eight substantive motions that are already before her. And then she is going to be setting a schedule out into July of dealing with issues in this case, primarily around the handling of classified documents and classified information that may be part of the case, especially part of the defense's review of the case, preparations for trial and what they might want to present to the jury.All of that is so complicated and so dense that Judge Cannon says she'll set a trial date once she gets through a bit more in the coming months. So there is no way that this case will be able to go to trial or even have a trial date set in the next couple of weeks.

Some of these NFTs, of course, being the mugshot photo of Donald Trump, and he had promised this in an email, but it turns out they are doing it. Now, as senior advisers say, that this was a dinner that had been planned weeks in advance. But I will tell you one thing. None of the money that he has made from these NFTs goes towards the campaign. This is all for personal gain. But again, that is how he is spending the day. He is, of course, going back to New York and then will be back in the courtroom. I will note he has a rally in New Jersey on Saturday.

Because if you talk to either the Biden campaign or the Trump campaign, both sides believe that this election is going to be chosen by a very narrow amount of voters in the middle, people who are not sure where they're going to go.

This was to be shipped to Israel effectively imminently for use in the war.The reason this was paused was because of U.S. concerns over Israel's promises that it will conduct a major ground operation in Rafah. Israel and the U.S. have been in touch over this. The U.S. has clearly stated its opposition to such an operation, and the U.S. has pressed Israel for answers on how it would handle the more than million Palestinians who are there and make sure it doesn't turn into a humanitarian catastrophe with civilian casualties. According to a U.S. official, the answers from Israel have not been satisfactory, and so this shipment of bombs has been put on hold because of the concerns over what a 2,000-pound bomb could do if dropped in a heavily populated area.

He's a CNN military analyst. He served as the commanding general of U.S. Army Europe and the 7th Army. All right. General, first, we know and we've seen the effects of it, of these 500- and 2,000-pound bombs that Israel has used, at least hundreds of them in Gaza. Tell us what these usually do, what the objective that can be achieved on the battlefield of these bombs is and what cannot be. LT. GEN. MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes. Well, first of all, Brianna, it's a great question because when you're conducting either a counter insurgency or a counterterrorism operation, you're not using the kind of weapon systems that would blow big holes in things or destroy big buildings. Now, Israel is put on a conundrum because a lot of the terrorists' headquarters and infrastructure is built underneath some of the big buildings that Israel has been going after. But these bombs, especially the thousand, 2,000 pounders and even the 500 pounders in some cases, will basically destroy a building. It will knock it down. It will eliminate it from the landscape. So when you're talking about going after individual terrorists or terrorist cells, you want precision in counterterrorism or counterinsurgency operation. And precision is something that the Biden administration and the secretary of defense has been asking Israel to do for about four months now, as they saw the initial implications of attacks into northern Gaza.   And it finally came to a point, I think, about a week ago, I was on a program with, I think, you and said that, yes, this is sending a signal. And then the Department of Defense said, well, wait a minute, not really. Now, Secretary of Defense Austin has said, indeed, it's sending a signal. We are not shipping you weapons that can basically knock down large buildings. You've got to be a little bit more precise and surgical than that.",
