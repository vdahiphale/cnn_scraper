We did get the 2We're already starting to see some of those outer bands begin to push some moisture into southern California, areas of western Arizona and southern Nevada as well. Here is a look, too. Again, you can see some of these, you're starting to see the orange and yellow indicating some of the more moderate rainfall pushing into some of these locations, also some thunder and lightning starting to occur in some of these thunderstorms. One thing to note is we do have a flash flood warning. It's in effect for two counties in southern California, again, just because of the amount of rain that has already fallen, and in anticipation of the amount that is expected to fall over the next 48 hours. We also have flood watches, all of the green you see here, for numerous states in anticipation of all of that rain that is expected to fall in the coming hours. The storm is expected to weaken further as it really pushes into colder waters in the next 24 to 48 hours. When it finally pushes into California, it will be a tropical storm. So, yes, the winds, the overall winds of the storm are going to weaken significantly, but the overall forecast in terms of rainfall really has not changed. We will really start to see a lot of the heavy rain really begin to filter into the area by tonight, especially overnight hours. This will continue off and on throughout the day on Sunday. And then finally we begin to see the bulk of that moisture retreat once we get to the latter half of the day Monday. So you're talking a 48-hour period for a lot of these areas to be dealing with moderate, if not even very heavy rainfall. So you have a potential for excessive rainfall, the flood threat here. We've got a moderate risk for Las Vegas, Los Angeles, and San Diego. And this pink area here, that high risk, that does include Death Valley stretching into areas like Palm Desert and Palm Springs. That's where you're going to have the highest concern for that flash flooding. Widespread these locations, you're looking at two to four inches. I know that may not sound like much, especially for folks east of the Rockies that are used to that in thunderstorms. But these areas are not. You're talking a year's worth of rain in just one day. Some of these locations could get six, eight, even 10 inches of rain. So now you're talking multiple years worth of rain in just a 24 to 48-hour time period. So that's why there's such a large concern for flooding in these areas, and that subsequent other things that come with it, not just the flooding itself, but mudslides. You have some of these areas that have been dealing with wildfires, you now have the burn scars, those turn into debris flows. So a lot of those concerns there, Toluse Olorunnipa And also, one other thing, too, Fred. We've got a lot of other potential systems out here we'll keep a close eye on. So we'll continue with more updates throughout the rest of the day.",

I hope it comes lower, but at this point we're over eight days, we're on our 10th day, and if we haven't found them yet, they're gone.(END VIDEO TAPE) WEIR (on camera): Especially upsetting to folks here is the idea that school was out when the fire broke out, and so the number of children that were in keike, as they call them in Hawaii, we don't know. We just hear from families that they never got back to see their children. So there hasn't been a list of the missing according to age. Most of those identified so far were over 70 years old. A lot of the seniors, obviously, weren't able to get out of the path of the fire. Those community leaders also yesterday held a press conference. Along with her was Archie Kalepa who was a hall of fame water man, sort of the de facto leader of the Hawaiian homes community which survived, and they have not yet met with the governor, who held an emotional press conference last night saying Lahaina will rise again. And that worries them that they're not being consulted at this level as to what is the sensitive way to reopen, how should the local community, especially native Hawaiians be at the table as they decide the future. Generationally, the Hawaiians here have been victimized and taken advantage of. They've lost land and water rights, which created the fire conditions of what used to be sugarcane plantations there in Lahaina. So a lot of trauma built in historically to obviously what they're going through right now, Fred.",
