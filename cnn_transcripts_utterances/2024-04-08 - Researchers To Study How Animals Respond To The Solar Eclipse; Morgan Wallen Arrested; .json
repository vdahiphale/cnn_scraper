During the last eclipse, they began moving much faster and some started mating.\" Joining me now is that researcher, Professor Adam Hartstone-Rose, professor of biological sciences at North Carolina State University. Professor, I know the question everyone wants an answer to is what made the tortoises so Randy? ADAM HARTSTONE-ROSE, PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY: We have no idea. It seems crazy. I like to think that potentially in a long lived species like this, a rare event like that, could be a signal for mating, but it's probably a one-off. We don't know, but we're going to find out because we're going to be watching more tortoises today.",

Animals will be animals after all, but we'll see what we see. We're going to be watching another fantastic group of gorillas. We're going to be watching a group of bonobos. Those animals can be pretty Randy as well. So who knows what we'll see from them? We're going to be watching giraffes. There's an amazing array of wonderful animals here at the Fort Worth Zoo, and I'm going to have researchers all over the place watching probably about 20 or 25 species.",

And how much of an advance before the eclipse begin? Will they start acting peculiarly? What do you know?HARTSTONE-ROSE: Those are really great questions and that's all things that we're trying to figure out. In 2017, when we were watching animals, most of them behaved as if it had become evening and nighttime. So we think that actually the effects of the sun going down is what they were noticing. But a lot of the animals exhibited behaviors that we associate with anxiety. We don't know if it's the eclipse itself that makes them anxious or the crazy behavior of the people around because we are so excited. And as you know, if you have a dog, you might be like, oh, my God, this is great. And your dog will be like, oh, my God, this is great. And the dog has no idea what's great. So that might be something that's happening as well.",

So we did a preliminary study during the annular eclipse that happens in October. And the closer people were to totality, the more likely it was that they would see differences in behavior in their dogs. But what's interesting is that half of them reported that the dogs became super quiet during the eclipse. And the other half reported that their dog started barking or howling during the eclipse. So we just need more data to figure out some of these questions.",

And we've been planning for about six months just to be here, putting people all over. It's costing so much money, so much time, so much investment, and then it's gone almost in a snap.",

      "sentences": "Do you need totality for it to work? Do you need -- not just totality, but do you need to be free from cloud cover?HARTSTONE-ROSE: That's a great question. So that's really two questions. Because one is, what's happening off of the path of totality? All of North America is going to be under at least a partial eclipse. And we actually have a citizen science project where anybody can watch animals during the eclipse from wherever they are and contribute data. Our project is called Solar Eclipse Safari, and anybody can learn about it on solareclipsesafari.org. And we have all the tools to take data. And if people are off of the path of totality, that will tell us whether animals behave interestingly when it's not 100 percent. Cloud cover, that's another question that we don't know the answer of. A lot of us came to Texas because the weather report, you know, six months ago, looks like Texas was the surest bet. And, of course, now it's looking like our friends up in Buffalo and Toronto and Montreal might have clearer weather. So we don't know, but that will help us answer those questions again. If there is cloud cover, do the animals react to the eclipse or not? Professor Adam Hartstone-Rose I got to say, I can't wait to see what you find out. Give the tortoises the privacy they need. That's my only request. Professor, thank you so much. HARTSTONE-ROSE: They're going to be very much overexposed, unfortunately. But we'll see cool things, that's for sure.",

We'll be right back. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [09:40:49] BOLDUAN: Country music star, Morgan Wallen has been arrested on felony charges after he allegedly threw a chair from a rooftop bar in Nashville, late last night. The chair fell six stories and landed near to police officers. Witnesses say Wallen was seen laughing afterward. He now is facing three charges of reckless endangerment. His lawyer says that he is cooperating with police. A man has been arrested after allegedly trying to set fire to the Vermont office of Senator Bernie Sanders. Investigators say the 35- year-old sprayed an accelerant on the office door before igniting it. Sanders put out a statement after this arrest saying that he's deeply grateful for the work of law enforcement. No one was hurt in the incident, thankfully. And crews in Baltimore have begun removing cargo containers from the ship that caused the Francis Scott Key Bridge to collapse. The goal now is to move enough containers so workers can access the front of the ship and begin deconstructing the tangled mess of debris, still stuck there now two weeks later only then can they move the ship to shore.

Hypeness was palpable. Iowa's Caitlin Clark, Dawn Staley's South Carolina facing off both driving forces behind the women's sports boom. Clark breaking another record in the final. Her 18 points in the first were the most in any quarter in NCAA tournament history. She finished with 30. But South Carolina was just too much. They're bench alone, scored 37 points while Iowa scored zero. The Gamecocks finish off their perfect season 38 and 0.
