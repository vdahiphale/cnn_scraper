It could happen tonight as he's scheduled to appear with Haley at a rally in Manchester.Now, the campaign for her rival, Ron DeSantis, is now trying to downplay this new boost for Haley putting out this statement saying in part, what happens in New Hampshire will significantly be impacted by the outcome in Iowa where the true Trump alternative will emerge. And clearly, Ron DeSantis is putting everything into being that alternative. He's in Iowa tonight appearing at a \"CNN Presidential Town Hall.\" Let's go there. CNN's Jessica Dean is standing by in Des Moines. Jessica, what does tonight mean for Ron DeSantis? What are you hearing?",

I mean, I was just listening to Jessica talk about DeSantis becoming the Trump alternative. He has been becoming for years and he's never become, OK? I mean, he announced six months ago that he had a shadow campaign for over a year. It's only 35 days until Iowa. When's he going to become Trump without the baggage, the Trump alternative? Nikki Haley is going up in the polls. DeSantis is either stagnant or even dropping in some of the polls.So, this invention really by, like the donor class, that DeSantis was going to be the Trump alternative just has not manifested. And pretending that suddenly on the day of the Iowa caucus, that's going to appear magically before us. I think it's kind of a fantasy.",

John, really?JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST &amp; ANCHOR: I mean, he's got a point. I -- the Iowa's caucuses can change a great deal in the final weeks left. Rick Santorum, who ultimately narrowly won in 2012 over Mitt Romney. He'd been in low single digits two months out. The caucuses are unlike anything else. It's neighborhood versus -- two neighborhoods trying to use persuasion. I think the issue is that Donald Trump's core supporters are so intensely in his corner. It leaves the other candidates, kind of fighting for some of the persuadable. Look. DeSantis is all-in in Iowa because he has to be. If he -- if he doesn't outperform expectations in Iowa, he's done. He's toast. Stick a fork in him. But he's got a lot of strong momentum on the ground in terms of organization. Momentum, maybe too strong a word. He got Kim Reynolds' endorsement, the popular and effective Governor of Iowa that was highly sought after. And evangelical leaders like Bob Vander Plaats. That should translate into support. If it doesn't, it's not going because of the lack of ground game and endorsements, it's going to because of Ron DeSantis. And the fact that he's just had a hard time connecting with actual humans in the retail politics -- (INAUDIBLE)",

And now, you're begging those same voters for your vote.The place should always have been, for people not named Trump, to go after the moderates, independents, and disaffected Republicans and Democrats.

And do so with a sense of humor while making a positive case for his own you know being president.And he's going to have to take some shots of Donald Trump for reasons of contrast. Campaigns are after all about contrast. Not simply related to his decision to abandon the debate stage. So, this is as high stakes as it gets for Ron DeSantis. He's been a talented politician in the past. I think S.E. Cupp raises a great point about the significance of his campaign for governor where he had his children playing with -- teaching them to spell with Trump and blocks.

Warning that if Ukraine falls, they would exacerbate a migrant crisis that provide -- lead to migrants surging to other European countries as well as the United States.But the migrant crisis here in the United States is the reason why things are stalled. Republicans are demanding changes on the U.S. border with Mexico -- policy changes in order to greenlight aid to Ukraine. Now, I'm told that Zelenskyy did not specifically address that debate as he pushed for more aid to Ukraine. But in talking to senators who have left that meeting, Republican Senators, in particular, they made clear that their minds were not changed, including Senator Markwayne Mullin, who I had just caught up with. And said that House Republicans and Senate Republicans are united on their push for immigration policy to be dealt with first before greenlighting aid to Ukraine. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARKWAYNE MULLIN (R-OK): There are zero chance that an aid package to Ukraine and to Israel will pass the House without real meaningful -- real meaningful Border Security. And I will tell you, Republicans alike. We all stand and step with the House Republicans in doing so. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
