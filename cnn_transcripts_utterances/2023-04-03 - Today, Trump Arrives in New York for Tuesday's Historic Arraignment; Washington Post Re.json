Two hours from now, former President Trump, he's going to leave Mar-a-Lago and fly to New York as he gets ready to face a judge.We can show you right now a live look at the plane on the tarmac at Palm Beach International Airport this morning. We were very familiar with that plane from the election cycle. It is the culmination of a years' long probe what we're looking at now, into a $130,000 money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels just before the 2016 election. The indictment is said to include more than 30 counts centering on how that payment was reflected in Trump's business records. It's expected that the indictment will be made public tomorrow when Trump appears in court. And take a look. Here is what he is like -- what will likely happen when he does make that court appearance and appears in that courthouse. Trump will be fingerprinted but still unclear if he's going to be photographed for a mug shot. Let's get straight to that courthouse. CNN's Kara Scannell is right outside. Kara, why is it still uncertain at this point if he will be photographed?",

There is not a concern of a flight risk, and if someone were to be unable to identify him or locate him. Another concerned, sources tell us, is that what if this mug shot was leaked, right? This is against -- that would be against New York state law, but there is a concern that the monk shot could be made public.So, there is uncertainty about whether that will be taken. We understand he is expected to be fingerprinted, but he won't be kept in a holding cell. He will likely have a shorter a time where he is in these -- in the building behind me, both being processed, and then when he goes into the courtroom because of the bigger security concerns around him and also around any potential protester, disturbances that could take place outside. Now, he will walk down the hallway. That is the hallway that drug dealers walk down. It is also the hallway that his former chief financial officer walked down when he pleaded guilty and that is former adviser Steve Bannon walked out when he was charged with fraud charges. And inside the courtroom, that proceeding is expected to take place pretty quickly. The judge will ask him if he wants the indictment read. He will likely wave that. And they ask to enter a plea. His lawyers say he's going to plead not guilty, Kate.",

They're also saying that this isn't a crime and that, in fact, they believe that he was being extorted.One of Trump's attorneys, Alina Habba, was on CNN This Morning. Here's what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ALINA HABBA, DONALD TRUMP'S ATTORNEY:  I think we do know what's in it. We know that this was based on Stormy Daniels. We know that this was dismissed by the FEC, and this was dismissed by federal prosecutor seven years ago. We know what's in it. It's a bunch of garbage. Even if Karen McDougal is in this, Don, that is also garbage. That is something that is Asia-old and that is garbage. This is an extortion situation that he had his lawyer handle. I don't even know if he knew about it at the time. I don't believe he did. So, a lawyer settles and extortion claims gets an NDA assigned and somehow he's getting indicted. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But, look, if he didn't surrender tomorrow, for some reason, he would likely be arrested. After he turns himself in, he will be processed, then arraigned, fingerprints, maybe mug shots. Now, for most defendants, one, you know, who had not been president before, he might be handcuffed and taken to a holding cell. But the consensus here is Trump will be released and then pre-trial hearings. After the pre-trial stuff, if Trump does not plead guilty, which no one expects, then would come the trial. The trial, of course, is where Trump would be found either guilty or not guilty. If he is found guilty, it would go to sentencing. Keep in mind, Trump's team has promised to file all kinds of motions to dismiss and will do whatever it can to delay or derail this process.

Part of the reason is Trump's own messaging to his supporters. Over the weekend, he called. He called this case, an active obstruction and blatant election interference. And also just a few weeks ago, you will remember that he encouraged supporters, the way he wrote it is to take our nation back.

I actually tried to do this live shot further down the street and we were kicked out. And that has been sort of the protocol is to keep pushing us further, further away, especially as we get closer to the former president arriving here in New York City. But you can see Trump Tower there in the distance, that street, 56th Street and 5th Avenue where we are about a half a block away from that, is completely shut down. And then across the street, directly across from Trump tower, there are a number of NYPD busses that are blocking that entire street. So, you can see traffic is moving through. There's pedestrians that are allowed to walk through here, but those measures are going to begin to get tightened again the closer we get to the former president arriving, so a massive security ever going on here at Trump Tower, Kate. And, of course, this is also going to be the case tomorrow as the motorcade not only helps them get to the airport today but tomorrow down to the courthouse, as you heard Kara, described what he is about to undergo. There are 35,000 officers on the ready. We also want to let you know, Kate, that the NYPD commissioner as well as the mayor, they're going to hold a news conference today at noon to just let the public know there are no credible threats against the city.

What happens if there's peaceful protest that actually turns into violence? What happens? It's consequence management. But the NYPD does this better than any other law enforcement entity in the world. They're prepared. Tomorrow, you'll see 35,000 uniformed NYPD officers in a 24-hour period, making sure that the city is safe and secure. They're going to play it extremely cautious. Why? Because law enforcement no longer has to anticipate whether or not domestic violence extremists will actually engage. We know from January 6th that they will. So, they have to over prepare tomorrow, prepare for the worst case scenario, hope for the best. Hopefully, it's peaceful protest, individuals expressing their First Amendment constitutional right, but it doesn't transcend into violence.",

They work with other law enforcement entities to ensure that the area is secure, but they are not coordinating any special accommodations for the president's side.

Back in May of 2021 is when DOJ and the Archives first started to negotiate with Trump's team to get back these documents. Now, about eight months later in January of 2022, Trump's team turned over 15 documents, but the negotiations continue because investigators thought he still has some documents. And that led to this key moment in May of 2022 when DOJ issued a subpoena. Now, a subpoena is mandatory. It is a command from the court from the grand jury, you have to turn over these documents. Now, that piece of information you just focused on Trump personally went through those documents happens here after the subpoena. That's why it's so important because now he knows there's a subpoena, and it shows he knew what was in those documents. After that, they send a certification falsely saying we've given you everything we have. And then, of course, finally, in August comes the search warrant. So, that is a crucial moment in time. It goes right to intent. BERMAN:  You got to give us the stuff. That's a subpoena right here is where he is doing things with that stuff. That might mean possible obstruction.

If you think back to that search warrant in August, in order to get a search warrant, prosecutors have to go to a judge and establish probable cause of at least one federal crime.

Now, General Milley, of course, became an outspoken critic of Trump. So, we seem to be very interested in that.
