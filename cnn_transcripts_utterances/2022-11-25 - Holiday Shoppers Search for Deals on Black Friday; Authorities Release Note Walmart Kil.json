Good to see you this morning, Jeanna. So, I'm just curious. What is the sense of how this weekend -- we are seeing more people out, Alison seeing people not just foot traffic, she was saying people with shopping bags -- what could the impact of this weekend and potential sales have on the overall economy? JEANNA SMIALEK, FEDERAL RESERVE AND ECONOMY REPORTER, THE NEW YORK TIMES:  I think it's amazingly uncertain, actually. This is a really interesting time for the economy because we do have, on one hand, really, really fast inflation, that is eroding consumer confidence, making things more difficult, making it much more difficult for people on limited incomes to afford presents, necessities, everything that they want to buy in their everyday lives. But on the other hand, it does seem like people are getting out, willing to shop, spending intentions were still really holding up going into the season, and it seems like people are willing to put things on credit cards when they aren't able to make ends meet. So, we have this weird split screen that we're trying to figure out. I think it's making everything very uncertain. But it does seem to be the case that, you know, we're seeing at least a decent holiday season. It may not be the kind of gangbusters growth we saw last year, and that should keep the overall economy growing in a reasonably quick clip.",

      "sentences": "It's interesting when you mentioned the credit cards, because you've written about it, you've talked about it. There is really a class divide when it comes to holiday spending and it may even be a little more acute this year. Wealthier folks, people with more money to spend, understandably, they're still spending. It doesn't hurt them this much. Lower income households, as you point out, putting more on credit cards. But if that is staying, if that balance is staying on their card for some time, those interest rates are up significantly. That's going to hurt.",

      "sentences": "Yes. We're at this very interesting transition moment for the economy, where a lot of people last year, if you remember, had savings in their savings accounts. You know, people got checks during the pandemic. They got unemployment insurance payments, some of them were just stuck at home for months and so they amassed big savings and that really helped to fuel the Christmas season last year.This year, at least among poorer Americans, those savings are really depleted. And so we're seeing people turn to credit cards, begin to run credit card balances back up. But the question is, how far can that trend go? Because, like you mentioned, interest rates are very high, it's very painful if you hold those balances and carry them. At the same time, consumer balance sheets do look so good. People have so much less debt than they had before the pandemic, that some economists are telling us this trend could have somewhere to run.",

And the reason I think that's so interesting is if we're seeing a situation where Americans are demanding really big cost cuts, really big discounts in order to keep spending, I think that bodes really positively for inflation. It suggests that people are not going to be able to just continue spending through relentless price increases forever, and that would be good news, I think.I think if we see a situation where Americans accept some pretty marginal discounts and kind of just spend right through no matter what retailers are doing. That bodes much more negatively. That's a situation where the Fed might have to engineer a harder landing to get inflation to come back down. And so I think everybody is going to be closely watching those kinds of trends to try and get a grasp on what happens next with price increases.",

One passage reads, quote, the associates gave me evil, twisted grins, mocked me and celebrated my downfall the last day. That's why they suffer the same fate as me. Here is another quote from that note. I wish I could have saved everyone from myself. My God forgive me for what I'm going to do.

There are certain things this community can and should be doing and wants to do on its own.And meantime, Rich Fierro, the hero who brought down that shooter in the club last weekend, well, he and his wife own a brewery, the Atrevida Brewery, and that is planning to open again this Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. Fierro says that they have had a huge influx of orders for T-shirts. He said it might take them a year to deliver them all, but they will try. And the legacy of this shooting, well, President Biden said it himself. If we have red flag laws, it's ridiculous that they are not enforced. Of course, a red flag law is supposed to flag a potential shooter before anything happens. It's preemptive. It only works if it's used.

Now, the government is saying that they should have most of the power structures back up and running even into Kherson, which is a city the Russians destroyed not only the generating capability but took down all the wires that connected it elsewhere in the country. But by Saturday, they are hoping to have the whole country in some kind of good order. Now, it won't be perfect.
