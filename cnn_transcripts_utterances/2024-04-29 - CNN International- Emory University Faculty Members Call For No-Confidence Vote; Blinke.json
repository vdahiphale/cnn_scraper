This is day five of this encampment here on GW's campus and on the street beside us, and it appears that the protest, for me at least having been here for days, is as big as it has been throughout. What you're seeing behind me here, these are barricades that overnight many of the protesters ripped up, pulled out from where they were surrounding a part of this camp, and then they were piled up here. And since then, what we have seen is so many more of these tents spreading around university yard here on GW's campus that is property of GW.But, we're also seeing a lot of those tents out there on H Street, which of course is just part of the District of Columbia. And the big question now has become, when if at all will D.C. police come in and potentially clear or even arrest these protesters, because having spoken to so many of them, they've said they are ready to stay here until their demands are met for the university to divest from Israel, or they're prepared to be arrested if police come in. They say they're going to stand their ground here. But, as of now, Erica, MPD has said, even as all of this is happening, they don't want to come in and arrest people, that they don't want the optics of that arresting protesters. And so, we are still waiting to see what Monday will bring. We know it's going to be very hot weather here. And we also know that the tensions as well have been rising. And so, the school seems to be mobilizing in some way.

But, they are using it to put more pressure on these negotiations, to put pressure on Hamas, of course, but it also has put significant pressure on the Egyptians. Rafah is right on their doorstep. They do not want to see this military offensive happen there. And so, they have kind of come up with this, what can only be described as a last-ditch effort to prevent that offensive, and to instead bring together Israel and Hamas in a new ceasefire agreement that would see dozens of hostages released.Now, this latest framework that they've put on the table with significant input from the Israeli government would see the release of some 20 to 33 Israeli hostages over the course of several weeks. And then, in a second phase, it would see a one-year restoration of sustainable calm, effectively diplomatic speak for a longer term ceasefire here, and one that would see the release of the remaining Israeli hostages, including the bodies of dead Israeli hostages and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza. Now, this latest proposal is now in the hands of Hamas officials who are in Cairo as well as the Hamas' leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar. His response to this latest proposal is expected over the course of the next several days, and his response may determine whether or not Israeli officials as well as the mediators see a way forward for these negotiations, or whether it's really officials are instead going to start to put those plans in motion for a major ground offensive in Rafah, which, as we've heard, the American officials are continuing to express serious concerns about even as Israeli and American officials have been holding multiple consultations over the possibility of that Rafah offensive over the course of the last several weeks.",

A new CNN polling shows some tough numbers for Joe Biden moving into the election. Looking at the number of respondents, you can see there, just 27 percent -- 28 percent of those polled say that they approve of Biden's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. Perhaps the most concerning number, 71 percent disapproving is high, but 81 percent of those between the ages of 18 and 34 disapprove of the way the U.S. President is handling this. When it comes to those two choices, the presumptive nominees for President, 43 percent, as you see there, going for Joe Biden versus 29 percent for Donald Trump. Eight say they are still at this point undecided. Margin there, they're just under four percent.Joining me now, Republican Strategist Rena Shah, and Democratic Strategist Chris Kofinis. Good to see both of you with us. Chris, let's start with you. When we look specifically at those numbers in terms of the handling of the war between Israel and Hamas, we know that those numbers have been trending, certainly not trending in Joe Biden's favor, the fact that 81 percent of 18 to 34-year-olds say they do not approve of the way that he is handling this, that is not just an issue for voting bloc based on one issue. There is a larger concern about 18 to 34-year-olds for Democrats. CHRIS KOFINIS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, &amp; FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF FOR U.S. SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: I mean, if you look at past elections, the 18 to 34 bloc was a critical voting group it helped elect Barack Obama. It helped elect Joe Biden. When you don't win them in a significant majority, you're going to have a problem. Right now -- put aside -- people are debating about the CNN poll. Oh, is it one snapshot, and other polls showing different picture? Put all that kind of debate aside. If this poll is reflective of let's say the reality, that's currently the race, the Democrats and the administration are in real trouble. You've got pressure on the youth demographic. You have other pressure amongst independents, moderates, when it comes to the economy, and other key issues. They're kind of hitting each other and almost in a perfect storm. And I think what's missing, and this is I think the part that as a Democrat I would say is frustrating, you're not hearing a very aggressive counter message by the White House. And when you have kind of a vacuum in message, it's either filled by noise, or it's filled by your opponents, and that's where we are kind of right now.",

But, it speaks to a larger issue.

These college campuses are approaching commencement graduation. Parents and -- are going to become incredibly upset and angry if their kid cannot walk for graduation. You already heard about one school, USC, doing that. If that becomes a norm, it will feed a lot of parental anxiety across the country, and that becomes a political problem.

Yes, that 2 p.m. deadline, 2 p.m. local time deadline for students to leave the encampment or face suspension, at the very least, ineligibility to finish the semester in good standing. And they have to sign a document committing essentially to follow the university's policies. It's some of the clearest direction we have heard from the university as far as any steps to quote \"resolve the encampment\" as many have been wanting them to do for quite some time now as they are going on almost two weeks of the encampment being at the university.That said, one of the suspended, now suspended student groups is encouraging students not to leave the encampment. They show up at noon to protect the encampment and not to sign anything that the university is putting before them. So, we're going to see how many students actually go with what the university is offering versus actually face the consequences here. And we got clues that this type of action might be actually happening this morning, actually, when the university president released a statement saying that negotiations between the students and the teachers failed to come to a resolution. So, what that means is that the university will not divest from Israel, and that they will continue that relationship which, of course, was the central theme of why this encampment began in the first place. But also, as part of that statement, they said that they are encouraging students to voluntarily leave, as they explore internal options to quote \"bring\" what they had called \"a crisis to a resolution\", and that internal word was key, because in the beginning stages of this, they called in the NYPD from the outside to clear out the encampment, and even now they've acknowledged that doing so again would be counterproductive to the process and likely raise the temperature, as we saw last time around. But, of course, all of this is happening in the context of today is the last day of classes. Graduation is in a little bit over two weeks. And the university stressed that they plan to have their commencement here, which at the very least infers that they're going to have the encampment resolved, whatever way they believe it gets to being resolved and whatever way they believe it looks like because they do plan to actually have that graduation ceremony moving forward, Erica.",

The world's largest penguin species, emperor penguins, are severely threatened by climate change.

But, with the ice melting away, the chicks may fall into the sea before they get their waterproof feathers, leaving them to freeze to death or drown. Despite the recent losses, 2023 wasn't as bad as 2022 for the emperor penguins. Scientists say it's because some colonies adapted to the worsening conditions by moving south to find better ice, or to more stable ice shelves or icebergs.",
