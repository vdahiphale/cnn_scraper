Hesounded optimistic for the most part, but U.S.-China relations, which has really reached a low point recently could be mended. He said that the two leaders had identified areas where the two countries could really work together. Issues like climate change, like ensuring that Russia does not resort to using nuclear weapons, and then, of course, notably on the issue of Taiwan. President Biden said that he emphasized to Xi Jinping that the U.S.' policy remains unchanged. That it continues to support the one China policy. He also went on to tell reporters that he doesn't think there's a need for a new cold war, and also that he doesn't see an imminent threat of China invading Taiwan. Now, the big goal that President Biden identified in this summit was to avoid misunderstanding, sort of all across the board, between the U.S. and China. He also said that he wants to make sure that there is an open line of communication between the two countries. And to that end, he committed for his Secretary of State Antony Blinken, to sometime in the near future visit China to continue the conversations that started and began earlier today, between the two leaders. We obviously know that U.S. officials, Chinese officials, spent months and months basically trying to put this summit together.

And you get that impression here, because we do hear a lot of outgoing artillery across the river, which creates the impression that the advance may well be continuing, out of sight at the moment. But there is no doubt President Zelenskyy here to try to tell the residents of the city that the government's here to help. That the government wants to help them to help them reconnect to the rest of the country.

There is still a very strong support for Trump in the Republican grassroots, but at the same time, you know, he's being blamed by many Republican leaders for the fact that many of the candidates that he pushed were actually responsible, especially for the Dems -- for the Republicans losing their chance to win the Senate. That's just -- you know, In Pennsylvania, for example, the candidate he picked lost to a Democrat, when another Republican candidate might have won. So he is being heavily criticized. At the same time, Trump has been down before. After the 2020 election, after the Capitol insurrection in 2021, he's always leveraged his strength among the Republican grassroots to rebuild his power.

We adhere to one China policy that undermines U.S. a little bit. Also, it's uncertain degree to which the United States will send troops to defend Taiwan, it probably will not. And I think President Xi knows that. No, each has, again, catered to his people back home. Big question here is what will President Biden do with a bill that's going through the Congress called the Taiwan Policy Act? Now that that statute, if it passes, a stage that Taiwan is an ally, it's a non-NATO ally, well, that just sends shivers down the spine of the Chinese.
