In hard-hit Louisiana, at least three people have died, as the scope of devastation now settles in. We're getting a look at heartbreaking scenes as the holidays fast approach. Look at this.

We will touch base with you as you get more information. We have some fresh economic numbers to share with you today. They showthe weight of these higher prices we have all been experiencing finally hitting the holiday shopping rush. Consumer spending in November saw its sharpest monthly decline of the year. And, remember, that was a month with those record online sales on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. You can see how the markets are reacting, stocks taking a plunge on that news, down more than 900 points right now, the Dow, combined with the Fed's latest indication, that rate hikes aren't going away anytime soon. So that's all different factors. That could be the reason we're seeing this happen right now in the markets. Let's bring in CNN's Matt Egan to walk us through the latest numbers. Matt, it seems like every time we get good news, we get bad news thrown right back at us.",

But this is not adjusted for inflation.And we know consumer prices were up by more than 7 percent. So that's adjusted real sales were actually negative. This, though, was the number that got everyone's attention. Month-over-month sales were down by 0.6 percent. That was unexpected. If you look on the chart, here we are. This is the worst number since the end of last year. It was weak across the board. We saw sales declines for autos, for apparel, clothing, building materials, even online shopping, all of them negative. So, the only positives were bars and restaurants and food and beverage. Ana, these numbers suggest that consumers are starting to crack under the pressure of high inflation. And that is bad news in an economy that is driven by consumer spending.",

You can see it's way down from the beginning of last year. That suggests that a lot of employers, they don't want to let go of the workers they have because we're in the middle of a worker shortage. But let's go back. The other figure here is continuing claims. This is the total number of people filing for unemployment benefits. It only went up by a little bit, but this is a 10-month high. And that suggests that people are staying unemployed for longer, that hiring has slowed down. And that is what the Fed is trying to get at. And if you look at the Fed forecast, yesterday, they put out new numbers. They see the unemployment rate going from -- up from a historically low level of 3.7 percent today to 4.6 percent next year. That is not high overall. In the last three recessions, we saw much higher levels of unemployment, but that still implies 1.6 million more people would be considered unemployed. None of this sitting well with the market. Let's check in on the Dow and the market. We see the Dow is down 950 points, almost 3 percent, S&amp;P. We're seeing even sharper losses here for the Nasdaq. And we look at the Big Board, almost 1,000 points now for the Dow. It's actually near session lows. I think the market is in kind of a weird place right now, Ana, where good news is bad and bad news is bad. And what I mean by that is, good news is bad because it means the Fed is going to have to be even more aggressive, more rate hikes. Bad news is bad because it raises the specter of a recession.",

And the U.S. made the calculation that the Ukrainians could hold on without the protection that is afforded them by the Patriot system. Now they see how critical the hits have been against the critical infrastructure, and putting Ukraine in the dark, with hitting the power, hitting the water supply, hitting the sewage systems. Those kinds of things really affect the ability of Ukraine to conduct this war. And the U.S.' main goal is to keep Ukraine in the war effort. You could make the argument that we should have done this a lot earlier. But that's the past, and now, looking toward the future, it's very clear that the U.S. needs to do this in order to help protect Ukraine and keep it in the position where it can safeguard its sovereignty.",

LEIGHTON:  Not really, just based on the way in which, Ana, they have gone and attacked civilian targets, both systematically and haphazardly. It's all part of their strategy. It would be nice if they did have a Christmas truce, because that is something that would bring a degree of civilization to something as terrible as this war. But we can't expect it to happen. We can't expect to go back to the truce that the soldiers put together in World War I, where the Germans and the Brits played soccer and made peace during that brief period in 1914.

We're seeing, obviously, we're in the middle of probably the worst flu season in a decade. And we have got a lot of RSV out there still. So what happens next is very much up to us, Ana.

If they don't, then we are going to have some very tough weeks and some very tough months ahead. Now, in terms of COVID tests, we paused it because we want -- we were running through our supplies. We wanted to make sure we had some tests available if -- in case there was an increase in the winter. This is the moment we were waiting for. We're seeing that increase now. We're opening up COVIDtests.gov, so people can go and get those tests. But if you test positive, I think everybody should be evaluated for treatment. If you're 50 or above or if you have any kind of chronic conditions, you should be seriously evaluated for treatment.
