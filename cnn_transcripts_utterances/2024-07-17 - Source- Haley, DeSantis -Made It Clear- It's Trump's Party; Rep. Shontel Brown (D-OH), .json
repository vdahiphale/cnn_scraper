Yes.Now, by all accounts, it was an evening defined, well, but really, these images on the screen. You had former rivals of Donald Trump and one by one walking on that stage deliver flattering speeches in full support, period, of a man they all use to insult. Donald Trump came out to watch them speak, making another UFC style entrance to another round of cheers. His ear still bandaged of the assassination attempt. One source says that Trump personally changed his schedule to make sure he was there to hear from these speakers, particularly Nikki Haley. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

This is featuring all the flavors that are welcomed party, trying to build a permission structure to come home in the fall and really appeal to maybe moderate voters or Republican leaning voters who have turned away from the party in the Donald Trump era. I think they've done a decent job. Nikki Haley hit the right tone. Whether Chris Christie speaks for a meaningful segment of the population, I'm skeptical of that. But it's all relative. This is a situation where Donald Trump is in the driver's seat. Republicans have not been in this position, again, in 20 years, and taking a step back. It's impressive how unified this ticket is.

I think that most people, a lot of people watching these speeches today believe that these former rivals of President Trump, A, are showing party unity. And that's what you would expect in a convention. But the other part is the ambition part that Chris Christie mentioned, is that we know that DeSantis, Nikki Haley, even Rick Scott, they all have ambitions to continue to be leaders in the party to possibly rise in higher leadership positions.

Law enforcement sources telling CNN that he requested off time from work to attend the Trump rally on Saturday, telling his boss he had set, quote, \"something to do\". Those sources all say the shooter first raised suspicion when he passed through a magnetometer at the rally carrying a rangefinder. Security personnel then kept an eye on him until he left the secure area. Now from there, investigators are unsure of where the shooter went, but the operating theory is that when he did that, he left, he went to his car, then retrieved the rifle.

Most sniper teams have a spotter and a person on the rifle, those two individuals could have at least called it out and moved in ground units to go interview him, go vet it -- the threat, figure out what the suspicious person is doing and seeing what their activity is and mitigate the threat.
