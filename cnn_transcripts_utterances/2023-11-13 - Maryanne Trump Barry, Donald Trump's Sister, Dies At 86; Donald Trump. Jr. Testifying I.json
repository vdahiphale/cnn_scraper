Plus, a surprise drop out, Senator Tim Scott calls it quits, putting an end to his 2024 presidential campaign.So, which of the seven remaining candidates will his voters go to or his donors? And sidestepping responsibility, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu refuses to answer our questions about whether he bears any blame for the Hamas terror attack inside Israel on October 7, the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines and inside politics. We're going to start in New York City where Donald Trump Jr. is on the stand as the first witness for the defense in the civil fraud case against his family and their businesses. CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the courthouse. Brynn, before we start about what's going on in that courthouse behind you, there is some sad news for the Trump family today.",

She was 86-years-old, a former federal judge and prosecutor appointed to the federal district court in New Jersey in 1983, and then the Third Court of Appeals appointed there by President Bill Clinton in 1999, before retiring from the bench in 2019.She had a very close relationship at times with her younger brother, President Donald Trump, taking -- often having guidance for him, but they did have a sort of a -- their relationship was impacted, I should say, when their niece released some audio recordings of Maryanne Trump Barry talking about her older brother in a bad way in his last year of his presidency. So, they did have a bit of a falling out. But still, the oldest sister of the former President dying today in New York at 86-years-old, Dana.",

So, it's been an interesting day there in the court, because we have been seeing a whole sort of summary of the assets of the Trump Organization playing out in a promotional video, and we're still going through that video with Don Jr. on the stand. He called his father an \"artist\" when it came to real estate, as they sort of go through each property that they own.And the -- actually state's attorney objected to this video, saying even jokingly that this was outside the statute of limitations in this case, but the judge did allow this video to continue to play, saying he is actually interested in it, but also he wants to make it clear that he is giving the defense enough time to present its case, because he doesn't want a reversal in this trial. He does not want to re- trial. He wants to have sort of fair on both sides. So, that's where we're at right now with Don Jr., the first witness in the defense on the stand. Prior to this video actually playing, though, we did hear about Don Jr.'s role within the Trump Organization. He said, when his father became President, he and his brother took on a role as sort of the asset managers. He took on the deal making of the -- the bigger picture deal making within the Trump Organization while his brother handled sort of the day to day. And it's been somewhat lighthearted inside that courtroom, Dana, was some jokes being made, not only by Don Jr., but also the judge. The judge saying to him, welcome back, and Don Jr. said he wouldn't say he is happy to be back. But, he was worried about being sued by the attorney general for being perjury. So, there has been some light hearted moments. So, listen, we haven't gotten into the nitty gritty of what this trial is about, those financial statements that the state says they manipulated to get better deals with banks and lenders. So, we're waiting to see that testimony. But, as of now, we're just learning more about the Trump Organization with Don Jr., the first witness for the defense on the stand. Dana.",

And we've just seen his rhetoric heighten and get worse throughout this cycle. There was a thought that maybe after January 6 he'd moderate. That is long gone. That is so very far in the past, and the politics of retribution are really a hallmark. And you've seen some of his political opponents, even on the right, tried to say, he is about the past.
