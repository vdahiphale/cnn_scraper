One week until the big debate between Vice President Harris and former President Trump. CNN's senior political commentator David Axelrod is with us now. David, you've seen a few post-Labor Day sprints. And there's an article in \"The Washington Post,\" you're actually quoted in it, which suggests that the Trump campaign sees a need to go even harder against Vice President Harris now, perhaps because some of the attacks they haven't - they've used so far haven't been working. And there's a blind quote in this article. It says, quote, \"if you think this race is going to be decided by likeability, you're making a grave error, because neither one of them is going to be liked at the end of this race.\" What do you think of that? Do you think they have to try to muddy it even more?",

And if this race is decided on popularity, he will lose that race.So, their mission is to try and tear Kamala Harris down. She's relatively new two people, John. The fact is, vice presidents are known, but they're not known. She's done a very good job in the first phase of filling in information about herself, and she's made up a lot of ground. But this is a neck and neck race. Trump doesn't have the option of selling a new Trump. He doesn't seem interested in selling a new Trump, in fact. One of the problems that campaign has is that he is the old Trump and he can't stay on a message. So, his preferred avenue is to rip down the opponent. That's what he does with great zeal and joy.

I think people were so despondent about the choice they had, and then here comes this fresh, new choice who has made a very good impression. And there is this sense of possibility, that maybe we don't have to vote our fears but our hopes. And that can have a lot of power.I agree with David on that, especially juxtaposed with the kind of grinding, negative nature of the Trump campaign, and particularly Trump. I mean, you know, the relentless grinding about how bad the country is and how awful everything is and so on weighs on people. And she - she has presented a counterpoint to that, a different vantage point about, yes, we have problems but we have so much going for us. I think there is a constituency for that. The question, John, is, this is a very close race and there's a relative handful of people who are going to decide this. What motivates them?

And Trump, as you point out, has played into that.There is a weariness with Trump and Trumpism and, frankly, a desire to turn the page on this whole era. And she has offered herself as the - as the way to do that, as the vehicle to do that. I think that's been a powerful driver behind her surge that has put her in the race. Yes, I think that, you know, Trump was changed in a race against Biden. Suddenly Trump is not changed. And when people start chanting, we're not going back, they're talking about Trump. So, this is a problem for them. And they've tried to link her to Biden. I think that was a reasonable strategy to try and make her a stand-in for Biden, but she has - she has established her own identity in this race and that's a problem for the Trump campaign.",

These are cases that are actually being reported. So, many of the cases are not being reported because people aren't developing significant symptoms. But you can see the darker the color, the more West Nile around the country. Texas, the northeast, that's where you're seeing a lot of these cases primarily.When it comes to EEE, the other one that you mentioned, you got six cases in five states right now. So, that is much more rare. Again, keeping in mind what I said, whenever you look at these maps, that you have to take into account that there may be many people who don't develop symptoms. They never report it. So, we don't always have clear tracking. I will say, when it comes to things like Dengue, we are seeing a lot more Dengue overall in the Americas, overall in this continent.
