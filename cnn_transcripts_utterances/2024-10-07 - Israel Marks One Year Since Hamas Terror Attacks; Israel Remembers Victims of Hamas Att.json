Israel marks one year since the Hamas terror attacks. And its military operations continue in Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon. You failed. Families of hostages hold their own ceremony in protest against the Israeli government. Evacuate now. Florida residents in the path of Category 5 Hurricane Milton are ordered to leave. It comes as the cleanup from Hurricane Helene has barely begun. Plus, the Satoshi suspects. A new documentary drills down on the mystery creator of Bitcoin. All that and much more coming up. But first, a somber day in Israel on the first anniversary of the October 7th attacks. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a monument to the victims in Jerusalem. Some 1,200 people were killed. Gaza officials say Israel's military response has killed 41,000 people. And Israel has entered into a new war with Hezbollah in Lebanon. It comes as critics accuse the government of not doing enough to save the 100 hostages still held by Hamas. This was the scene in Jerusalem earlier, families of Israeli hostages literally sounding the alarm outside Mr. Netanyahu's residence. They're urging authorities to bring their loved ones home. And the violence is continuing tonight. A short while ago, the Israeli military said five projectiles have been launched from Lebanon into Israel. Our Erin Burnett is in Tel Aviv and she joins us now live. Good to have you with us, Erin. So, as Israel marked the one-year anniversary of the Hamas terror attacks, it was under the blare of the air raid sirens once again. Hezbollah launching a new round of missiles and rockets.

Those missiles were coming from Hezbollah in Lebanon. There were about five of them, very close to where we are. And, in fact, this perhaps the busiest day for missile attacks on Tel Aviv from all fronts that we've seen since this war began because you had missiles coming today, three different times with sirens. We had them coming from Hamas in Gaza and then, as I mentioned, those ballistic missiles coming from Hezbollah in the north and then also from the east, missiles -- ballistic missiles coming from the Houthis in Yemen, at one point Lynda, the entire City of Tel Aviv was lit up in alerts for a possible incoming missile. So, that tension laid on top of what was such a somber day of grief here, where families, as you said, were grieving. And, of course, you mentioned those 97. Now, 97 hostages who were taken a year ago who are still in Gaza, some of them are dead, many of them are alive.

At times, it's looked a lot more like the United States has wanted an end to this war more than either of the two protagonists, Netanyahu and Hamas, and the great fears that the Biden administration has had about this proliferating into a much bigger regional war that the United States could get dragged into have been borne out somewhat by the extension of the war into Lebanon by Israel against Hezbollah.

For the first time, the Israeli-Palestinian issue has become a domestic concern in American politics. In the Democratic Party especially, there have been divides and splits in the party between progressives, young voters, as you mentioned, and some Arab American voters over the failure of the Biden administration to do more to mitigate the humanitarian crisis in Gaza under the Israeli assault on Hamas. This could have a great deal to say in the election that will take place next month. For example, Arab American voters are very important in the critical swing State of Michigan. You're talking about a state that could help decide the election and where perhaps tens of thousands of votes will be the difference between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. If some of those voters don't show up and vote for Harris as they would normally be expected to do, because they usually swing Democrat, that could have a big impact on the election, who wins the state, and that is one of perhaps three or four states that could decide the election. So, you can see how the reverberations of what happened a year ago in Israel having a real impact on American politics.",

I just want to pull up this Pew research. You can see there, 65 percent of Jewish voters say they would support Kamala Harris. That's against 34 percent for Donald Trump. Trump is already saying that he'll blame Jews, essentially, if he loses. Surely that won't help win over any undecided voters.",

The U.N. says more than 300 aid workers have been killed in Gaza since the October 7th terror attacks. And while the vast majority of them worked for the U.N., private organizations have suffered losses too. Back in April, seven people delivering food for the World's Health Organization Central Kitchen died when an Israeli drone fired upon their convoy. And just over one month ago, the aid organization, Anera, says one of its convoys was hit by an Israeli airstrike. Four Palestinians at the front of the convoy were killed. Anera says they were community members and not considered a threat by the group.

The amount of aid going in, Israel has now stopped the private aid going in, and the humanitarian aid is low. There's a need for about 600 truckloads to go in each day, and the latter half of September, we're seeing an average of about 45 aid trucks a day. So, it is a very, very dire bad situation in Gaza.",

Before October 7th, about two-thirds of the population lived in the northern half and a third in the southern half, and that proportion has been flipped around, and if everyone moves to the southern half, then you've got the entire population in a space that can't -- that cannot support that population, even if aid was getting in, and aid is not getting in, and infrastructure is destroyed, the health care system is largely destroyed, electricity and water and sewage systems have all collapsed or virtually collapsed.
