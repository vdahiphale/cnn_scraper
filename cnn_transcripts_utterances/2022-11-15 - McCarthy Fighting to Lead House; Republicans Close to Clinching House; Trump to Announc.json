He only needs a simple majority to do that. We are expecting that to happen. So the real test is going to come in January. That's when he needs a majority of the entire House.And as we first reported on CNN, Congressman Andy Biggs is planning to challenge him during that closed door leadership election today. Now, he's not a serious changer. It is not a real candidate. He's essentially just representing the anti-McCarthy vote. But there could be a significant number of Republicans in that camp. Take a listen to what Congressman Bob Good told us yesterday. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. BOB GOOD (R-VA): The country needs transformational change. And that's going to start with changing how Congress operate, how the Republican Party operates. Andy Biggs would be an outstanding speaker. And he would be among my two or three choices for speaker. He's a real candidate and a real choices for those who would be supporting him. That said, I don't think anyone has 218 votes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We've heard him slamming Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, as well as Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin. This just gives you an idea. And one thing to note is that the more Republicans who turn on him, the likely - likely that the personal attacks will continue because, as we've heard from aides and advisers, Trump is comparing this to 2015, saying that he's entering the race as the underdog here.But let's talk quickly about the former vice president and the former president because there's clearly no love lost between these two men. And in this interview with former Vice President Pence, he really used his most stark terms when talking about former President Trump. He said that his rhetoric actually caused him and his family to be put into danger. We had not heard this before. But this is not that surprising, particularly given that these two men appear to be on a collision course heading into 2024.
