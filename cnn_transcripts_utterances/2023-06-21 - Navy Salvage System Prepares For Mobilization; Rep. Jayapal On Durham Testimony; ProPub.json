Tonight, five people are missing, sealed inside a tiny sub, in a huge expanse of the North Atlantic Ocean. And they now have less than a day's worth of oxygen and no way to open the hatch, even if they do make it to the surface. As time is running short, a multinational search is growing, and deploying more resources, to try and locate them. That search is being fueled by banging noises that were heard, last night, but also again, today. Now, the race to find the sub, and those five people, is entering what could be the most crucial hours yet. CNN's Miguel Marquez joins us now, where a new piece of developing water salvage equipment has just arrived. Miguel, what can you tell us? As we know, they're working on getting new equipment, to this area. But also, they are examining these noises, trying to figure out if they are indeed coming from the missing vessel. Have they gotten anywhere with that analysis, tonight?",

And it has this very big, very big piece of equipment that they need to get out there, now. It's a deep ocean salvage system. Our Oren Liebermann, at the Pentagon, follows this stuff. And now, they're trying to figure out how to get it out there.There are several vessels, several Coast Guard vessels here, and other vessels that might work for it. So, they're apparently working out the contract, to get that piece of equipment, from the airport, to the harbor, here, and then out to the search site. But keep in mind it takes about 24 hours, to get it out to the search site. Plus, they have to get it, from the airport, to a ship here that is rigged to handle it. These are very, very big pieces of equipment. And they need some specialized ability, to get them into the water, basically, so they can do their job. That, as we're hearing about these banging noises. What were described as banging noises, at regular intervals, 24 hours ago, today, the Coast Guard's saying they're not quite sure what they are. But they are a sliver of hope, for the search and rescuers, out there, saying that this is very much still a search and rescue mission. They are directing resources, now, heavily to where they are hearing those sounds, hoping, they've heard sounds today and yesterday, they are hoping that they can find those individuals, in that submersible, and bring them to safety.

Now, they can get workers down here, and they can do that relatively quickly, within hours. But it is going to take time to get that piece of equipment, out there.On the air side of it? Because, I know a lot has been made, about how much air is left, and can they survive. There's a lot of discussion that there are very experienced people, in submersibles, on that submersible. And they believe that if they conserve their air, if they are calm, if they don't exert themselves, that they will be able to get past that 96-hour mark, for the air supply. And they may be able to last much longer. I can tell you, searchers here are acting like they will not stop, until they determine what has happened to the Titan.",

They were two experienced sailors on board. They went down, into the water. They were 120 miles out from shore, on Ireland, there. The Titan is 425 miles out. They had communications, the entire time. And even though they didn't know where this vessel was, for a while, it didn't take them that long, to locate it. We still have no contact with the Titan. There's no communication. And they have no idea where it is right now. And importantly, the Pisces was in 1,575 feet of water. So, that's a little bit larger than the Empire State Building. The Titan, whopping number, down here, look at this, this is so, so, so much harder, to work down here, than over here.

Now, you're down to the point, where you're at the maximum diving, and that's stretching it, to be as far as the sperm whale goes, some other smaller species may go further. The average depth of the ocean is here. And now, now, we're down to where the Titanic is. It is completely dark. At this level, the pressure is unbelievably immense. And I will point out, it's also cold. It's just barely above freezing. Some argue the only reason it's not frozen is because it's salt water.

Turned out to be from the ships that were looking out there, and not from -- certainly not from pinging from a plane. So but, so I did some checking in, and trying to figure out what was going on. And there're very, very credible sources, and multiple sources, multiple aircraft dropping multiple sonobuoys, recorders, listening devices and multiple days.

That's relatively easily than compared to some of the searches that will go on.And so, I do have a question about whether they pinged back. So, they heard the banging, over two days. Did they signal back to give a signal back to the sub? They would hear it that \"We acknowledged the sound you made,\" because that would lift the spirits, of the people, in the sub as well.

That could move, of course, we know. But tonight, there's a new court filing that reveals discovery is already underway. That is the process of each side, revealing the evidence that they might present at a trial. And crucially, that filing, tonight, also suggests that among the evidence, from the Special Counsel, Jack Smith, there could be multiple audio tapes, of the former President, not just the one CNN has reported on, where he seems to be discussing a classified document, and acknowledging his limits, on declassifying it, once he left office. Prosecutors, in this new filing, have used the plural, \"Interviews,\" to describe recordings of Trump, that were made, with his consent, they note, and have been obtained, by the Special Counsel. This is all now been turned over to the defense. What is unclear, so far, tonight, though, of course, what's on those recordings, or how relevant they might be? So, stay tuned, as we are reporting on that and what those could look like. All of this, though, is coming, as Democrats, are saying that Republicans are deflecting, from the former President's legal troubles, by focusing, instead, on their allegations that the Justice Department, and FBI, are being weaponized against them. Unfounded allegations, so far, I should note. That said, all of this was on display, today, on Capitol Hill, for about six hours, as the Special Counsel, John Durham, testified. Trump's Attorney General, of course, put Durham, in charge, of investigating the Russia investigation. And today, Durham defended that four-year probe that didn't even come close, to meeting GOP expectations. Durham's report though did accuse FBI officials, of confirmation bias, an assessment that Democrats have repeatedly criticized. And today, Democratic members, of the Judiciary Committee, continued with those attacks, at one point, pointing to Durham's poor track record, in his court, that his investigation produced.
