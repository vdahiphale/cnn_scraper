      "sentences": "Laura, that's the big takeaway from this report. So, it is 845 pages. The vast majority of that actually encapsulates eight chapters where they lay out the entire narrative surrounding up to and including January 6th. But the real meat of this is not until page 689, and it lays out about, let's see, 11 different recommendations this committee is making. I want to highlight a few for people.And, Laura, you were asking before where can people go to actually read this entire report. It is up on the committee's website. It's January6th.house.gov. The big takeaway from this is very interesting. They are outlining several steps that many different bodies, whether it's Congress, bar associations within different states or law enforcement agencies, the steps that they should take as a result of this comprehensive report from this committee. The biggest one that I'm seeing here is that this committee is recommending that there be steps taken to enforce the 14th Amendment Section 3. This committee says, of course, that that part of the Constitution says anyone that incites an insurrection should be barred from holding any future office. So, specifically, it says the committee believes that those who took an oath to protect and defend the Constitution on January 6th should be barred, disqualified and barred from holding government office. And if you read between the lines there, of course, they are pointing directly at the former president, Trump, who has already announced his candidacy for 2024. So, that's a big step for this committee saying that, look, it's right there in the Constitution. If you incite an insurrection, you are barred from holding future office. Unclear if that would be actually implemented, but the committee is urging that. And one other important thing here, Laura, they're talking about how law enforcement agencies, federal agencies, Secret Service really need to take a hard look at violent extremism, because, of course, that's part of what amplified and sort of fed into this mob movement that moved to the Capitol on January 6th, breached the Capitol, stormed inside, resulted in injuries, even a few deaths. So, they're saying that law enforcement, other agencies need to take a big look at that. And then, of course, they're also saying -- I'll end here, Laura -- they're talking about the Electoral Count Act. And, of course, they want to codify that no vice president, no other official can ever overthrow the electoral count, the electors that have been chosen via individual states. Of course, that was something that the former president was pushing Vice President Mike Pence to do. It's something ultimately the vice president refused to do. But the committee here pointing out that the House of Representatives has passed what's called the Presidential Election Reform Act. They're now urging the Senate to pass that as well, so that it is codified that the vice president does not have any power in this process, which, of course, sort of was one of the initial points that the former president tried to seize on and urged the vice president to overturn the election. But a lot in here, Laura, most of it, though, the narrative here, and really expounding upon everything they've shown in testimony, in public testimony, putting it in black and white and then in these appendices detailing the recommendations that they're making about what can be done now.",

So, even as they grumble about these RINOs that are dwelling in the past, they realized the past had holes that needed to be reformed and plugged up.

You don't want there to be volumes about case law that actually talks about people who were aiding and abetting or giving aid and comfort or actually inciting insurrections against our government. But because of that and in this case law and common law system that we're in when we look at former cases, and we decide how to go forward based on the former holdings of the court, it is a difficult thing to address.But in their criminal referrals, you remember, there was language about the incitement statute they were trying to articulate.

They want to do belt and suspenders, and there's all kinds of different reasons why it's tricky. I think you'll remember this is a qualification. There are only three or four in the Constitution. You have to be 35 years old, you can't be foreign-born, and you may not have done this.Now, the Supreme Court has made it clear you can't add to those qualifications. But if you're doing that insurrection, that's what tracks the 14th Amendment. And it's a hard charge, Laura, as you know. It's got a checkered history. We have Trump saying, be peaceful, there's no real agreement here. They have to go by aiding and abetting. That's why, though, I believe it showed up in this final list of four, and it was the surprise entry of the four. We're really going to see in subsequently weeks how this plays out.",

You're supposed to show up. But then in recent years, the subpoenas that have been issued by Congress, their noses have been thumbed at Congress for a variety of reasons.One of the recommendations in this very report deals with the House's civil subpoena enforcement authority. And they say the current authority on how to enforce their own subpoenas through civil litigation is unclear.

Well, some more details that the committee is releasing in this report is that John Eastman, it looks like might have first tried to make contact with President Trump at the White House on December 23rd, 2020, almost exactly two years ago. And the committee is documenting how John Eastman put in an e-mail to President Trump's assistant, Molly Michael at the time, at 1.32 p.m. that day, and then was eventually connected to the White House through the switchboard. It was a call that lasted 23 minutes, and John Eastman apparently talked about his memo to ensure that President Trump is reelected. And in it he talked about the way that Vice President Pence could potentially overturn the election, of course, something Pence refused to do. In addition to that, the committee's report also talks about a little- known Trump attorney named Kenneth Chesebro. And Kenneth Chesebro was actually, the architect of this fake elector plot coming up with these fake elect doors in battleground states who would be in favor of Trump, who they would try to insert as the actual electors in those states that Biden won instead. Of course, what's interesting about this is this is a key line of investigation for state prosecutors, particularly in Georgia, as well as federal prosecutors now with the special counsel's office. They're really homing into this idea that there was this broad conspiracy potentially to put forth this fraud with these fake electors. Trying to get these people together to present themselves as the real electors for President Trump in those states that President Biden actually won. So, Laura, just a few more threads that the committee maybe didn't necessarily get to with the public testimony that we saw throughout the summer and these numerous hearings, but a little bit more detail that is in this report that we continue to parse through here about just how detailed this plot was to overturn the election.",

Not everything was contained in those hearings. You had things that were obviously part of the transcripts, things that were almost the high level highline headlines that were going on.But this idea of the switchboards you talk about is so interesting. Because remember, there was a lot of conversation, Jessica, about the phone logs and about who was calling it the White House. Were these numbers traced in some meaningful way? Who was responsible? And also, the process by which people were instrumental on this broad conspiracy, as you say about the fake elector plot, about that Eastman memo. I mean, this cast a very wide net in this particular report. SCHNEIDER:  Yes. And they're also giving this roadmap to the investigators, the committee is saying we've gathered all this information. Investigators, whether you're the local D.A. like Fani Willis down in Georgia, who has been actively investigating this fake elector plot, or whether your prosecutors from the special counsel's office, Jack Smith, who's that position was created just a few weeks ago to take over this investigation. The committee has a lot more details that presumably state and federal prosecutors already have. They've been doing these investigations on simultaneous tracks. But you're right. And interestingly that note about John Eastman's call into the White House, that did come from John Eastman's phone logs, not the White House. So, it doesn't appear that the committee actually got White House phone logs, but they of course, were able to subpoena phone records from various people that they were targeting -- targeting. Notice -- notably here John Eastman did in fact go before the committee, but he pleaded the fifth for pretty much every question that he was asked and did not get to the heart of this. But they were able to glean this information from e-mails, phone records, and potentially other witnesses as well, Laura.",

You know, I want to go through this with you all, but there's a really interesting part that I think we want to focus on as well. And there's so much, again in this report. It's 845 pages. We got a lot going on here. I've -- I've read the entire thing. It's wonderful. But there's a part in here that really delves into Rudy Giuliani. And the reason it's important is because one other recommendation that they have outlined here is about accountability. And they reference disciplinary proceedings and boards that have, and bodies that are responsible for overseeing the legal profession. [22:39:52] Now remember, Vice President Mike Pence recently said, hey, I don't if you want to hold, I'm paraphrasing here, hold Donald Trump accountable for getting bad advice from a lawyer. Remember this moment? Well, you have now the conversation about what is at stake when they do. So reading from, this is page 608 for those following along. It's available right now. He's talking about Giuliani. And saying, he began frantically calling the White House line the very minute that the president's video went up on Twitter. Failing to get through he called back once every minute, 4.17 p.m., 4.18 p.m., 4.19 p.m., 4.20 p.m. He managed to get through briefly to Mark Meadows at 4.21 p.m. and then kept calling the White House line at 4.22 p.m. three times on two different phones at 4.23 and 4:24 p.m., and once more at 5.05 p.m. Now it goes on that he finally managed to speak with the president at 5.07 p.m. and the two spoke for almost 12 minutes. Now, what's important here as well is who he spoke to in Congress. After he spoke with President Trump, the report says, Giuliani's phone calls went nearly, without fail, to members of Congress, Senator Marsha Blackburn, and then Senator Mike Lee. He made three calls to Senator Bill Haggerty, then to representative Jim Jordan. He called Senator Lindsey Graham and he called Senator Josh Hawley and Senator Ted Cruz. Giuliani had two calls with Senator Dan Sullivan over the course of the evening, and there were another three calls to Congressman Jordan. None of which connected. After 8.06 p.m. when the joint session resumed, the calls to members of Congress finally stopped until the afterwards he had one final call of nine minutes with the president. And so, you think about that and remember that documentary footage that we saw of Speaker Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, and Congressman McCarthy and so many others who were in that room that day underneath the capitol in different areas. And all the calls that were being made, and yet there were calls being made and spoken with the -- with the president of the United States, but not from those who were in danger.

You can start with an e-mail from John Eastman on December 31st, 2000, where he writes to the other lawyers on the team, saying that they're about to file a federal lawsuit in Georgia federal court, but that they're concerned because they had initially filed a lawsuit in Georgia state court and that Donald Trump had submitted a declaration there, basically stating that so many dead people voted, that so many felons voted and that a certain number of people that didn't even live in the state of Georgia voted. But the problem was that Donald Trump now knew as this -- as of December 31st that this was all false, but yet, they had to file a federal action, basically reciting these same facts. And the concern was that this would come back to bite Donald Trump because he knew it was false. Well, what did they do? They still filed that federal lawsuit. Donald Trump swore under oath that these same facts occurred, but then on top of it all, two days later, January 2nd, Donald Trump makes this call to Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state of Georgia, which as it turns out, Mr. Raffensperger tape recorded unbeknownst to Donald Trump. And during that call, Donald Trump raised those specific issues.
