I mean there seem to be serious questions around a changing climate that - I mean insurance companies are seeing it, right? I mean they're refusing to insure some places in these areas now. It's a real problem for residents across the state of Florida.Do we need to be rethinking how we rebuild in the wake of some of these storms?",

      "sentences": "I - yes, absolutely. I think - you know, one of the problems with the disaster declaration process that Congress needs to rethink is, how do we build in incentives for states and communities that do the right thing? And what I mean by that is, states that are well advanced in land use planning, you know, implementing the latest international codes council building code standards, properly insuring their infrastructure, if it's insurable, those communities, in my opinion, should be rewarded for doing the right thing as we face a change climate and future hazards, you know, unknown hazards in the future, we've really got to have that - that understanding with Congress and start to build in those incentives.You know, I don't blame the insurance companies for moving out. We have to invite the insurance companies back to the table and figure out how to buy down the risk, you know, in the future and figure out a model that works. You know, right now one of the biggest problems with FEMA's ability to operate and fully execute its mission is that they're constantly having to operate off of disaster supplementals and to the disaster relief fund. And so for three months, unfortunately, FEMA has been forced to implement what's called immediate needs funding, which means they can only really spend money on life safety missions. They can't actually execute long-term mitigation and long-term recovery missions. And so when you look back, since 1992, FEMA, a third of FEMA's disaster relief funding has come in the form of disastrous supplementals. One, we've got to remove the politics away from FEMA and out of the disaster process, and we've got to come up with a more consistent funding process.  And then again, one of the things that I'm most proud of, and, you know, when I was in office is, we pass the building resilient infrastructure and communities, you know, you know, program. We were able to get that program up and running to really start, you know, having an honest conversation about what's got to be mitigated in the future so that we don't see our infrastructure going down as easily.",

So, let's talk about the rivers. You have the French Broad River and also the Swannanoa River. They're anticipated to crest tonight, overnight, into Saturday. River levels have been around ten feet. The level - and then expected another ten feet. And then let's talk about the rainfall. They've had eight inches of rain since Wednesday.

And so I think that if she continues to go on offense on that, I don't think that she's going to eliminate the gap between - because immigration is such a central issue for Trump. It really is the thing that has made him. You know, it's the thing that built his campaign in 2016.But she's got to do something to mitigate the fact that she is seen as just having an open border policy because voters really don't like that.",

The voters are right, the Biden-Harris  administration did not secure the border. It's the worst we've ever had.
