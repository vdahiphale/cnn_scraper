Residents locked down for weeks rushed to the streets, pushing kicking down red barriers and metal gates trapping them in buildings. Protesters cheering and shouting, demanding that they want to eat, they want to be unsealed as people struggle to get into food essentials and medical care on lock down. Beijing recently announced incremental changes to COVID restrictions, but said the country is sticking to its zero COVID policy. And for people who've lost their loved ones on lock down, these changes are all too little, too late. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They claim thatthey want to make the approach to COVID more scientific and more targeted. But the reality is that these local governments, they're still under pressure to keep COVID cases low and all they have to rely on are these brute force tactics. So as you say, as these COVID cases are rising, and winter time is coming, we're still seeing these lock downs. But in some places, including here in the capitol in Beijing, they're not calling it a lock down. They're urging people the largest district to stay at home. Even in my district where there is no official government announcement, the streets are quiet and the restaurants have all stopped in restaurant dining, many of the stores are closed. So there's general fear and there is a desire to keep those cases low, but they're still sticking to the same old tactics of lock downs, mass quarantine, and testing and those heartbreaking stories, Julia that I was just reporting on in that story. That is just the tip of the iceberg. That is what we're able to capture from social media before it's immediately censored by the authorities. There are so many cases of these tragic stories that go undocumented. Of course, there is the economic toll from zero COVID, the human toll and the mental health costs. The World Health Organization estimated that there's been a 25 percent jump globally from anxiety and depression in the first year of the pandemic. Now, those rates are likely much, much higher in China where the policy the restrictions that has been the most draconian and the most frequent. Now we're sitting here three years into the pandemic and it is still continuing and there's so much uncertainty because there's no knowledge of when all of this is going to end. Living in China is like constantly playing roulette. You never know if your city might go into lock down if you're going to be banned from leaving your home if you're going to struggle to get grocery struggle to get milk powder for your baby like the man in that story we mentioned or if you're going to be sent to a quarantine facility, Julia.",

This is what I've been telling people is that this is shocking, but not necessarily surprising. What do I mean by that? What I mean is that Iger for 15 years was the Head of Disney. Arguably, like I said, one of the most notable names in Disney's history. And if you talk to people in Hollywood, it's one of the greatest runs were his 10 years in a company's history. And they also Disney I mean, gave a contract to Bob Chapek. After all of the controversies and hiccups that we've been talking about, they gave him a contract that started in July that were supposed to run to 2025. Now let me read you what Susan Arnold, the Chairman of the Board at Disney said last night. She said we think Bob Chapek for his service to Disney over his long career, including navigating the company through the unprecedented challenges of the pandemic. The Board has concluded that as Disney embarks on an increasingly complex period of industry transformation. Bob Iger is uniquely situated to lead the company through this pivotal period. Another way of saying that is that thank you so much Chapek for getting us through one of the most tumultuous times in our nearly 100-year history.

They are just here on mass in the squeaky with their bands with their drums is very much what you would expect to be a normal World Cup evening in one of the host cities, the atmosphere is brilliant. They get their moment in the spotlight though tomorrow, but yes, as you rightly say, it's currently half time as England take on Iran in their opening match in Group B. And so much of the buildup was dominated by talk of politics and protests because of we've seen in recent time now into the third month, pretty much of these anti-government protests in Iran. We have seen more and more Iranian athletes using their platform to have their voice. The players build up was absolutely dominated. They were peppered with questions about Alireza Jahanbakhsh had said they were going to take a collective decision as a team as to what to do if anything and their coach Carlos Queiroz shot a man who knows the Iranian politics more than most outsiders. He's a Portuguese national, but this is his second stint in charge of the team leading them into a Third World Cup. He said he was open. He had said to the players they were allowed to take a stand make a protest as long as it felt within FIFA rules. So what happens as the players lined up for kickoff ahead of their match for the national anthems was that the Iranian players decided not to sing their anthem and it's seen as a show of support solidarity for the anti- government protesters. My colleague, Donner Adele is that inside the ground, he said on the way in.

If you remember, the argument that I was throwing out there was because Tesla's market cap is so wildly overvalued compared to other car companies. That differential is really high and its PR, and his ability to sort of command this huge following in a retail investor base. And the features maybe by owning Twitter, he can kind of own the hype machine, keep promoting Tesla promote SpaceX, once it goes public, as effectively a cost of doing business. I'm now starting to wonder if the risk is on the other foot, which is if Twitter truly collapses, and he is seen as someone who just made a terrible decision. This terrible mistake solely based on his need for attention solely based on his ego, that the same thing happened to certain extent to Tesla and Space X. Tesla is very much a real company, but as of this morning, had a market cap of over $560 billion. General Motors exactly 1/10, that at 56 billion, even though it has twice as many car sales itself.

And so ultimately, if Twitter reflects his other companies, it's not going to be great working environment.

That has worked really well for Facebook, for Instagram. But it really has never worked as well for Twitter, because the actual platform itself doesn't really lend itself nearly as well to advertising and so they may be able to attract a lot of attention, but Twitter has attracted a lot of attention before Donald Trump arguably ran his 2016 presidential campaign over Twitter and get their economics didn't improve all that much.

And that just starts to drive kind of a train where ultimately, things get out of control. Valuations are way too high. The companies aren't necessarily even real, like we saw with FTX and that all leads to a debacle. So one of the tricks I think, as a Venture Capitalist to say this trend is interesting, risky, but that's what being a Venture Capitalist is, let's invest in it. Or this trend is risky, and doesn't really make all that much sense, because if you look at crypto, specifically. Probably 1 percent of the people on there genuinely do love the idea of a sovereign as currency that has no borders, and no central banks, no central authorities and that's kind of great for those people. But again, that's less than 1 percent or less than 1 percent. The rest are people who are just riding along to try to ride that wave up that fat sustainable. So while my fun, we did invest in Coinbase, that worked out really well. We're in a few other crypto companies. We've been generally pretty conservative on our crypto investments, simply because I can't understand the value proposition.

And Vikas of course that caught your attention and made you want to add, what should we call it some Hollywood glitter perhaps you already had that your sparkle?",

But moreover, you know, Vikas is someone who I've gotten to form a really strong friendship with over the last couple of years. And I was also so intrigued by what I knew; his plans were for this film to really help, you know, so many young girls in India and have a huge impact there. And, you know, as a filmmaker myself who has a history of social impact filmmaking that was something that really, really spoke to me as well? So it was first and foremost Amma and who she is and what she represents in her story, but also the impact that a film like this can have.",

And think the word that you used was when a woman's widowed in India, she becomes in auspicious, she's seen as bad luck. And I think some part of the power of this movie too, is about breaking what can be a devastating lifecycle for women, and that they perhaps never achieve the things that they should.

And I'm glad that we have partners right now on grounds who are working towards mission, amazing - Amma's portrait in the classroom.

What she has done, especially when she says I'm not ashamed to sit in the classroom with my great grant children of age that showed courage of a woman when owned by social norms all your life, she's not ashamed.

It happened on the far side of the moon, meaning that they lost communications with the spacecraft for about 25 minutes. But we got to watch that approach live. And then Julia on the other side, we saw something that was just remarkable, something we've seen before but we're getting to see with a fresh set of eyes and that was us the earth truly just a pale blue speck in the vastness of outer space and the Orion Spacecraft, which was sitting on top of that rocket right there when it launched five days ago. It was beaming it back live to Earth. So we're seeing some images, beamed back live right now Julia, the other ones, the good ones, like you're waiting for where we're going to see those really crisp, clear images of all the craters on the moon, that's going to take a little bit of time to beam back to Earth. but I'm waiting for it.
