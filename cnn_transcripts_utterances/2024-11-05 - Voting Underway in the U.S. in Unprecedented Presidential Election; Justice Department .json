That's what it does. It separates the ballots physically from the envelope. But unique to today, election day, as of 9:00 a.m. , the tabulations could start, and this is what you're seeing right here behind me. This row of machines was exclusively used during early voting. And what you're seeing here are volunteers who will later be sequestered, who are actually pulling that data, that voting data, putting it onto memory cards. They then take those cards and transfer it about 90 yards down the hallway into the tabulation room. Those cards will then standby for 7:00 p.m. when they could officially start to upload those votes to the Secretary of State's office. And they are expecting by 8:00 p.m. to have about 60 percent to 65 percent of all of the votes here in the county tallied for, accounted for. And I want to bring in the guy that's in the middle of it all, the elections director here, Zach Manifold. Zach, you said you expect to eclipse the 2020 voter totals for the county.

They think they can win. Can that pull Harris over the line? Or will this be an issue where the economy, and perhaps some of those Republicans that the senator was talking about, McCain Republicans, kind of traditional GOP-establishment types, moving back towards Trump because of those economic issues. One other wild card I'd note here, Maricopa and Pinal Counties are now more of a Republican county, just in the course of 2020 and 2023, 219,000 new people cross a very diverse set of people. What does that do? Where do they go? Do they follow what we saw in 2020 or did they move in a different direction because of what we've seen?

Look, if you want to look back to 2020 when Joe Biden was able to flip the state of Georgia into Democratic hands in a presidential election for the first time since Bill Clinton in 1992, the story that everyone was following and everybody knows at this point happened right here.It's the Atlanta metro area, it's nine counties that just went so heavily towards Democrats that Biden was able to overcome, Trump's strength, particularly in the northwestern part of the state. And what are you talking about here? Well, you start with Cobb County. It's the third largest county in the state. This used to be a Republican county. It's part of that re-alignment- slash-transition in the suburbs that we've seen over the course of the last several cycles where Joe Biden won this by 14. 3 points. Back in 2016, Hillary Clinton narrowly won this, flipping it for the first time narrowly. Now, the question coming in to today is, can the Harris campaign at least match that margin? Can they match it or can they bump it up a little bit given the fact that there's been a pretty significant population growth in this area as well? Obviously, we've been talking about kind of the critical urban areas in all of the battleground states. Fulton County; the largest county in the state, 10 percent of the voting population is right here, not unlike Milwaukee or Wayne, these are critical areas for Democrats to run up huge vote. The question in Fulton is, does this margin hold? Bakari(ph) was addressing some of the things people have been talking about throughout the course of the last several months. Is Donald Trump making some in-roads here with black voters, particularly black men. This will be a telltale sign right now for later this afternoon or later this evening, I should say, in terms of where that vote is in these critical battlegrounds. One other issue I think you want to look at here, Cherokee County, this is a place that Trump is expecting to win and expecting to win by a lot. The question will be margins, can he run-up bigger margins here? They did in 2020. Can he match what he did in 2016 or can Kamala Harris make further in-roads to chip away at this. That will be one of the big questions coming into the night. Erin?",

And I think this is one, I think marker that's important here.The darker the county you see here, the higher the percentage of African-Americans that live in that county. And a good chunk of -- yes, obviously, it's Fulton County, it's the Atlanta metro area as well. Over here in Columbus, Georgia, Savannah and Chatham County, but through here, what's known as the black belt, one of the questions going in is there were some smaller counties, 15,000 votes maybe max, where Joe Biden underperformed what Hillary Clinton did in this part of the state. It's not a huge amount of vote. One of the big questions that I heard when I was down there a few weeks ago was, can we get out and show people that we care, show people we're engaged, actually show up for the first time when a lot of these people in these communities haven't heard from Democrats. They're just expected to vote that way if they vote at all. And I think one of the key questions going into the night will be, will that actually have an impact? You come down here to places like Dougherty or Calhoun, these are smaller counties and are going to change the game in and of themselves, particularly when compared to the Atlanta metro area, or even over into Chatham. I think what -- Chatham County where Savannah is. I think that's going to be one of the big questions coming in. The other two is pushing out into the rural areas, like Effingham outside of Savannah, Georgia. Bryan, Bullock County as well where you've seen Democrats make a push, not expecting, Erin, to change the game. If you look at this margin right here, Donald Trump winning by almost 24 points in Bullock County, there's no expectation that Kamala Harris is going to win Bullock County. But if you shave 2 percent off that, if you shave 3 percent off that and you meet your margins --",

Now, in Texas, the state has actually indicated that they have reached an agreement with the Justice Department where monitors will be allowed, but they will stay outside of polling places. Now, every election, the Justice Department sends monitors to observe the voting process in dozens of counties across the country. These monitors are specifically tasked with helping to monitor compliance with federal voting rights laws. And this year, monitors are slated to be sent to 27 states today, that's up from 18 states during the 2020 election. Erin?",
