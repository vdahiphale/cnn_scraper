But it has gone to 6 am in Morocco, so when dawn finally comes aroundand they assess the full extent of the damage, those numbers could very likely go higher. This has been felt in the region of the high Atlas mountains. But the closest city to this is Marrakech. It's a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It gets millions of tourists each year. The people in Marrakech and Casablanca had to spend the night outdoors after they heard the tremors and aftershocks. Some of them were afraid what would happen if they went back to sleep. So they spent the night essentially outside, awake and worried about their property. Some buildings completely collapsed near the epicenter and rescuers fear they cannot get to some of these places because the roads are either damaged or blocked. Again, it's still early morning, not quite sunlight yet. They haven't been able to assess how far exactly the damages are or if there are people that will be needing any rescue or pulling out from under the rubble.",

But actually the water itself is the big story, the physics of what it's doing. Life is woven through that engine.And it is the biggest store of energy on the planet. As we're starting to, as you just said we are, the climate is warming and really that means the water is warming. So that engine has -- it operates like an engine. It moves around; it's got components almost that move around and over each other. The ocean is not just one big pump. It is changing how it's moving and it's changing where heat energy is stored within the engine. And that changes the environment, the background for the whole planet basically. And that's why thinking about the physical engine of the ocean is important when it comes to how we thinking about climate and how it's changing.",

And of course, the ecosystems live within the sort of environment that the ocean engine provides. So the way the ocean engine moves provides places, which have lots of nutrients where lots of life can grow. Water temperature is different to different places so species can live in different places. We know some animals and organisms don't like warmer water. But it goes much further than that because the deep ocean, which is mostly where the nutrients are, and then the sunlight, mostly they're separate. But you need some places where the nutrients can come up to the surface and then they are in the sunlight and lots of life can grow and they're really productive. But as we warm the planet, the surface gets stronger and gets harder for the nutrients to come up from underneath. That affects how much fuel there is for life effectively. And so it is not just the conditions are different, the water temperature is different and water in different places, it is actually -- warming the oceans actually changes how nutrients get to the surface and how much oxygen there is in the deep ocean and the conditions that life needs to survive even before you worry about the life itself.",

But the ocean is a rich and interesting place that there is so much still to know. Obviously it is now changing as we look at it. So that means the urgency for doing that science is increasing. So we don't know everything that lives in the deep. We don't know how a lot of really famous species, like the colossal squid, how they reproduce, how they mate, where they travel. And we don't know exactly how all the intricacies of the engine fit together. It's like -- our body is a kind of complicated system, each of us has that.
