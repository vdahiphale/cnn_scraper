US regulators say Boeing has a plan to improve its safety culture and must now prove that that plan works before being allowed to increase production. The FAA administrator, Mike Whitaker has held a three-hour meeting with Boeing executives when they reviewed the so-called roadmap to safety. The administrators says the agency will be making sure Boeing follows through on all the key steps. The company was forced to develop this plan after the door plug blew out mid-air on a 737 MAX. The FAA has since halted expansion of the 737 assembly lines and put various restrictions on Boeing. David Soucie is a former FAA safety inspector and a CNN safety analyst. David is with me now. So I mean, you have a plan, you put it forward. The best of plans are useless if they're not executed properly, so is that what the FAA is really going to be looking at?",

I think it is just a matter of if they are at a good point in the day and a good point in their deliberations where they can stop or if they feel like they want to extend it a little bit more.

But now, we are in a situation where we are seeing these Russian forces make advances in Ukraine, particularly in the northeastern part of the country around the city of Kharkiv. And so what the US has now done, what President Joe Biden has now done is given key permission to use the weapons that the US has given to Ukraine to fire into Russian territory at troops that are either carrying out attacks on Kharkiv, who are preparing to carry out attacks on Kharkiv. So this is a significant shift after a fair bit of frustration from the Ukrainians who have felt that they have been quite hamstrung by these limitations. Of course, we've seen countless attacks by Ukraine inside Russia, but that has been almost entirely with Ukrainian weaponry. And now, what we are hearing from the Biden administration is that in a limited basis, when it comes to this offensive against Kharkiv, that the Ukrainians will be able to use rockets and artillery against those Russian forces. But we should note, Richard, not the most formidable missiles. The ATACMS, as they're known, that the US has given to Ukraine, so there are still limitations.",

As you noted, the French, the Germans, the Secretary General of NATO has said that it is time for the US and other NATO allies to allow those weapons to be used on a broader basis inside Russia, so that remains to be seen.

They're deliberating in private as it was intended. What we know is what they're asking for. And this morning they asked for a few things.

And the New York state prosecutors have presented that second crime as a New York election law crime, i.e., that the underlying false business records were in -- were pursued as a part of other unlawful means. It's very complicated, nuanced point of law. But what the prosecutors have gotten and what the New York law allows is that those other unlawful means, the elevating of the underlying falsification of business records charges, become a felony but in this second instance, the elevation, the jurors don't need to be unanimous as to what the specific unlawful means was.

We're waiting to see what this verdict is, but I willsay the Trump defense team that has been waiting along with their client, Trump, inside of this room and Trump's allies and his entourage, they thought they were about to go home for the day. They thought because, you know, they got back from that lunch break, that's about 1:00 to 2:00 p.m. that's when there's no activity in the court, there was no note afterwards. There had been radio silence from the jury and they had been expecting that they were about to be home for the day and deliberations were going to resume tomorrow. And so of course no one knows what is happening inside that jury room except for the jury itself. But now that there is word of a verdict, this comes as Trump himself has been sitting inside the courtroom for a few minutes. He's been chatting with his lead attorney here, Todd Blanche. They were kind of talking back and forth. Kara Scannell in the room said that they were sitting so close their shoulders were almost touching. But really they've just been hanging out inside of this room across the hall from the courtroom where Trump is about to have this verdict read to him from this jury. They were eating pizza earlier. They were for watching TV and just kind of waiting to see what this jury was going to decide, Jake. So, obviously, this is a remarkable moment. You heard Elie there saying it's clearly not a hung jury since they do have a verdict here. The Trump team had been hoping that there would be a hung jury in this case. It seemed unlikely since the likelihood of those is not very high when you look at the percentages of how many hung juries there have been in the past. But now they are waiting to find out what this is going to look like. Obviously, they've been planning on the political side for the outcome of this verdict, whether it is going to be a guilty or not guilty verdict, and how that's going to influence Trump on what he just mentioned when he was going inside the courtroom there, Jake. And he was saying, I want to campaign as Trump was walking in there. And so quite a remarkable moment as they are waiting along with the rest of us to see what this verdict is going to be. And I should note, you know, Trump has been attending this trial every single day, it's required for him to be here. It's also required for him to be at the courthouse for this very reason that we are experiencing right now, which is that the verdict does have a jury. I should note Eric Trump is sitting in the courtroom behind his father. He is the only member of the Trump family that we have seen in court with Donald Trump today. North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum was also here earlier. It's not even clear if he's still here. Other members of Trump Trump's defense team. Stacy Schneider is also joining us. And Stacy, I mean, obviously we're just getting this breaking news that the jury does in fact have a verdict. We've got about 30 minutes or so while we are waiting for them to fill out this form. What does this process look like now that the jury has reached this verdict as they're filling out these forms where I know obviously, as we heard in the jury instructions, they'll come into the room, the jury foreman, foreperson, juror number one will be the one who kind of verbalizes this, but the judge will go through the list and ask each juror to confirm yes, this is your verdict, whether it's guilty or not guilty?",

Just find some sort of decision to avoid a mistrial. And that would be what potentially prompted them to convict him on some counts, but it appears that the jury, when you think about 12 different people across 34 different counts, even just this morning repeating the instructions, this historic task, they have reached some sort of consensus. Now the Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg is now in the courtroom. He of course the man who brought this case to some controversy. Some have argued that he bowed to political pressure. He's kept a very low profile, though, throughout these proceedings. We rarely see him in the courtroom except for key moments. Unlike other prosecutors who have gone after Trump, he has said almost nothing about this case over the past year or so.
