What did you see last night, Miguel? What did you take away from that one and only debate? MIGUEL MARQUEZ, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, look, Tom Suozzi is a very good retail politician and she has a great resume but is untested in this world. Mazi Pilip was on the defensive for much of the night. I think Suozzi -- if you had to say somebody won, he probably did better at keeping her on the defensive. But she must have tied him to Joe Biden and the Squad 50 times throughout the night while he tried to keep, sort of, the ghost of George Santos alive throughout the entire debate. But there was no bigger issue -- there was abortion, gun control, Israel -- all came up. They fought and discussed the SALT tax -- the state and local tax deduction and reinstating that was the biggest moment where they really got into the most intense fighting. Of course, it's about taxes. But immigration, more than anything. The debate started about that. Here's a little taste of what they discussed on the immigration issue. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He, on the other hand, kept trying to bring in specifics and urge people to sort of take a more moderate position.One indication of how Suozzi really tried to sort of steer to the center is that Joe Biden was in town -- in New York City a few days ago. Suozzi specifically said do not come to this district. Do not campaign with me. This is a district that Joe Biden won by eight points just a couple of years ago.

Now, these ads take one to two days, so not bad work if you can get it, right? Now, for the advertisers who are putting on these commercials, the talent fees are just one piece of that. So if you're spending up to $10 million on one star -- well, then to produce the whole ad can cost anywhere from $15 million to $50 million. Now, we all remember Ben Affleck in that Dunkin' Donuts commercial last year. It was genius, right? Well, I have reporting that says that Ben Affleck made close to $10 million for that ad. Now, he also served as director and producer behind it. But he's not the only one. Larry David, who in 2022 appeared in an ad for FTX -- he also received around $10 million. Now, that extreme number is rare but if you are a household name, I have learned from my sources that you are not going to be appearing in a Super Bowl ad for less than $1 million.
