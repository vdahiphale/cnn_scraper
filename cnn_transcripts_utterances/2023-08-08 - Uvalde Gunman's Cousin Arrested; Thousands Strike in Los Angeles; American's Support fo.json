I made sure that she got a therapist to talk to about this because it was also the day that we were traveling to my brother's funeral, so she could deal with the grief of that. And, fortunately, she is doing great.She knows that I'm speaking to the media. She supports that.

According to the arrest warrant affidavit for Nathan James Cruz, San Antonio Police were called by his mother yesterday morning where she went on to describe that her son had, quote, \"planned to do the same thing as his cousin,\" who carried out the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, which is just west of San Antonio, where 19 children and two teachers were killed in May of 2022. And in the conversation that the mother and sister had with police, that was documented in this arrest warrant affidavit.Investigators also say that the sister had been driving with Cruz in a car and that he threatened her, saying that he would shoot the school. Now, this family and the mother were concerned because she says her son is on probation, lived near a school, although the documents do not identify which school it is there in San Antonio. And that she had also overheard a conversation that her son had with someone as he was trying to make an illegal purchase for an AR-15 firearm. Now, investigators took Nathan James Cruz into custody. In these court documents, Cruz denied making these threats. But investigators there in San Antonio have charged the 17-year-old with a felony count of making terroristic threats to a public place, as well as a misdemeanor charge for making terroristic threats of his family. And right now he's being held on a $160,000 bond in the Bexar County Jail in San Antonio.",

The SEIU Local 721 union said its members voted to authorize this walkout because they say the city has failed to bargained in good faith and also, they say, engaged in unfair labor practices that restricted employee and union rights. Here is the union president, David Green. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DAVID GREEN, PRESIDENT, SEIU LOCAL 721: Angelenos can't go about their daily life without our workers, right? Whether you're flying in and out of LAX, or it's animal services or street services or filling in potholes, that's the work that our members do. We're the fabric of the community.

My office is implementing a plan to ensure -- ensuring no public safety or housing and homelessness emergency operations are impacted by this action. Like I said over the weekend, the city will always be available to make progress with SEIU 721 and we will continue bargaining in good faith.\"And this is, Poppy, as you pointed out, just the latest strike to take over Los Angeles. We saw Hollywood writers protesting, striking since May, actors joining them last month. Los Angeles hotel workers have been staging walk-outs all summer. A lot of these cumulatively are in response to wages that haven't kept up with inflation. Also the sky- high cost of living here in Los Angeles. But in terms of folks who are going to be directly impacted by these strikes today, at least here at LAX Airport, you know, when they say to get to the airport early, definitely something you want to take seriously on a day like this.

And it could be the most workers on strike in a year this entire century. And, you know, you mentioned how Americans are feeling about labor unions. And one thing that's really interesting is the Americans who approve of labor unions, look at where we are in 2022, last year, the latest figure available, 71 percent. That is significantly higher than where we were back in 2012 a decade ago when it was just 52 percent. And, in fact, this 71 percent, get this, you go back to 2002, 1991, 1981, it is the highest figure of labor approval in this country since 1965.

You just see this trend line where it's going down, down, down. Look at where we were 51 years ago, 27 percent of U.S. workers were ina union. We are down 17 points. Nearly only about a third of as many U.S. workers are in a union. And more than that, look at the face of unions. Who are the people who are in our unions? How many workers are in a union?

That's a key swing vote for him there as well. So, this makes good on promises. Deb Haaland, the first Native American interior secretary, says they finally have a seat at the table. What's interesting is, there's other fights over other lands around minerals needed for electrification. Thacker Pass, up on the Nevada- Oregon border. A lot of lithium there. Tribes are resistant to exploiting that. There's a big copper mine in Arizona that's meeting some tribal resistance.
