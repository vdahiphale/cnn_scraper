New reporting in \"The Washington Post\" that court documents now reveal the teen's parents were divorced and remarried multiple times, and that a custody agreement sometimes, quote, \"forced her to move between their homes every two to three days.\"Also, an alarming photo of the shooter posted in August by her father has now surfaced. It shows her at a shooting range, but she's wearing a t-shirt of a band whose lyrics were cited by the Columbine killers in 1999. Those two killers also wore the shirts with the band's name on them as well. And moments ago, John spoke with a lawmaker about what his grand niece and nephew saw and heard during the school shooting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JERRY L. O'CONNOR (R), WISCONSIN STATE ASSEMBLY: My nephew could hear bodies hitting the floor. My great niece, across the hall, could hear gunshots. And as I understand it, there were nine people in the room and the shooter shot eight of them, and the final shot was to her own head. So it's a terribly sad situation. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

MARY ELLEN O'TOOLE, FORMER SENIOR PROFILER AND SPECIAL AGENT, FBI: Well, there's really never one - one factor in a child's life, a student's life, that - that is the primary cause for what we saw the other day. But I'd be looking at both external and internal factors that contributed to her state of mind. So, clearly having a very contentious home life would have contributed to it. And - and that's what we know so far. So, the details of that home life are going to become really important. Was she the victim of some kind of physical abuse? What was - what were the factors that were going into that? But also, what becomes important is - are other things that would have contributed to her state of mind. And that could have been how she felt about being in a new school, her own self-image. It's very likely that she was going through depression. So, it's really an accumulation of factors that contributed to what we saw the other day. And that's why I think the chief said, it's not just one thing, it's multiple - multiple issues.

Of course, the Manhattan DA officially announcing that 11 count indictment, which included, as you noted, that very rare first degree murder charge. And it's rare, in part, because it requires special elements related to the crime and really can only come from a narrow list of aggravating factors. Furthermore, Mangione, also indicted by a grand jury, for murder in the second degree as a crime of terrorism. The DA, Alvin Bragg, saying clearly yesterday, this was a killing intended to invoke terror. Meanwhile, Kate, we're learning more information about Mangione's interactions with the outside world since he's been behind bars here in Pennsylvania, or better said, perhaps, the outside world's attempts to interact with him since he's been in prison. Per a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, as of yesterday, Mangione has received 157 deposits into his prison commissary account. Also, as of yesterday morning, he'd received 33 emails, six pieces of mail. And that was up from the two pieces of hard mail that we reported that he received back on Monday evening. Though still, the only visitors that he's had in jail has been, as of now, his attorneys. But, Kate, I want to play some sound from that press conference yesterday that happened in New York. You'll hear a little bit from DA Bragg about the severity of this crime, and also from the NYPD commissioner about why Luigi Mangione, in their eyes, should not be lionized. Take a listen.

But is Elon Musk a national security risk? \"The New York Times\" is reporting that the feds are reviewing Elon Musk and his rocket company. SpaceX, for possibly violating national security reporting rules. SpaceX is a major government contractor, winning contracts worth at least $10 billion since 2019. As its CEO, Elon Musk has some top-secret security clearance. Joining me now from Washington, \"New York Times\" investigative reporter Eric Lipton. You and your colleagues, Kirsten Grind and Sheera Frenkel, wrote this very in-depth and interesting piece. You wrote that Musk's own employees have complained to the Defense Department's office of inspector general and other agencies about failing to report information that is required. What are the details of the information that they say was not reported, and what are they concerned about? ERIC LIPTON, INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER, \"THE NEW YORK TIMES\": If you get top secret security clearance from the federal government, you have been given the privilege to have classified information that is potentially a national security threat if it's shared with, you know, rivals or enemies of the United States. So, once you have that status, there's this process that's called continuous vetting. And so, while you have the clearance, you're supposed to be reporting engagements with foreign leaders or business meetings with foreign leaders or even prescription drug use or any illegal drug use. You're not supposed to be using illegal drugs. But there's this process that's called continuous vetting, in which you're supposed to notify the federal government of any potential reason that they should be reconsidering that security clearance. And that's a requirement once you have it. And so, the concern by some of these folks that are close to SpaceX is that Elon Musk and others around him were not necessarily complying with those requirements.",
