The world is a tinderbox under Joe Biden, from the Russian invasion of Ukraine to the terrorist attack on Israel, to the threats emanating in the Indo-Pacific from China.

But the question is, how do you maintain that until November? Obviously, it's still July? What does that look like, over the next several months that can make races like yours better and stronger for you? REP. NICK LALOTA (R-NY): Yes, I'm looking forward to the continued positive, policy-oriented patriotic message, coming from President Trump, to provide solutions on the border and the economy. He's the one Long Islanders want, New Yorkers want, Americans want. Americans want the president to be inclusive, to be a good communicator, to bring us all together.

And at least from a Republican convention perspective, maybe 2004. But this is something that I just haven't seen in several cycles. And the delegates keep saying the same thing, delegates that have been here for cycle after cycle, convention after convention, that the energy level is just different. And it's not happening in isolation. Obviously, guys, they've been building to this moment throughout the course of this week. And the next group of speakers, as Scott Jennings so eloquently and energetically identified, particularly with Hulk Hogan coming up, are part of that build to the biggest moment of the night, with the former President, giving his third convention speech. But I think it just underscores right now that yes, the unity is there. Yes, the reality of this moment in terms of the energy is very real. But also what's going to set this place on fire, and that's literally what a delegate told me, just a little bit ago, is that family box, right behind me. You'll notice that there are still senators up there. But there are several seats that are now empty. The former President left about an hour ago. He's obviously going to be speaking tonight. But everybody's waiting for those seats to be filled by Trump family members. We have seen Eric Trump. We've seen Don Jr. And tonight, we will see Melania Trump, for the first time.

Masculine versus hyper masculinity. And you'd say, well, they've got a problem with women. The interesting gender gap that you see in the polls, right now, is not among women. They are -- Biden and Trump run relatively close among women. Biden's ahead, but only by about a half dozen points.

But I'd like us all to stand, as we call upon the name of the God of heaven.Our Heavenly Father, we come before you this evening, with grateful hearts. Thank you for saving the life of President Donald J. Trump. In his own words, it was you, and you alone, who saved him. We pray for the others that were injured on Saturday. For the family who lost their loved one, put your loving arms around them, comfort them, and may they sense your presence. We stand before you tonight, we say thank you, for the provisions you have given to the United States of America. You have blessed this country more than any country in the world. Sadly, as a nation, we have forgotten who is responsible for all the freedoms, the liberties and the bounty that we enjoy. It has all come for you. Thank you. This evening, our nation is in trouble. We're divided politically, racially, economically, with millions of people seeking refuge, and hope in our dry and thirsty land. You're the only one, who can fix the complexity of the problems that we face today. We pray for President Trump, that you would give him wisdom, strength, and a clear vision for the future of this nation, and the task that is at hand. Continue to protect him from his enemies. I pray that you would surround him with men and women, who will give him sound counsel and guidance. We pray for Melania, for Barron, and for all the President Trump's children and grandchildren. We pray for Senator J.D. Vance, his wife, Usha, along with their young family. We're thankful for his strong stand for defending life. As your word instructs, we also pray for the leaders of our nation, whether they're Republican, Democrat or Independent. We know that all authority comes from you. You are a great God. And we ask that if it be thy will, that you will make America great, once again. And we ask that you'll unite our hearts, bring us together, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. And we pray this in the mighty name of my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. Amen. (CHEERS &amp; APPLAUSE)",
