Tens of thousands are people have now fled northern Gaza after Israel warned it could begin soon a new phase of its assault including, quote, \"significant ground operations,\" while diplomats are racing to stop this crisis getting any worse. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Jordan today. Speaking after meetings in Cairo, he swore that the crucial Rafah border crossing will soon be open and that progress is being made. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: I had very good conversations both with the crown prince in Saudi Arabia and here in Egypt, with President El-Sissi, and also heard I think a lot of good ideas about some of the things we need to do moving forward including practical ideas on getting assistance to Palestinians in Gaza who are in need. But also good and important conversations about the future and where we hope ultimately together we can bring this in a much more positive way. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And I can tell you that as of this morning, at least earlier today, there was no water in southern Gaza. The people were still filling jerrycans from water trucks wherever they could find them. As you mentioned, there are also aid groups warning of food and supplies that are in short supply. You have Israeli military strikes showing no signs of letting up either.

Most of those kibbutz have been emptied of their civilian populations. I mean, many of them were overrun by Hamas and people fled and left because they were traumatized. But also the government has been helping bus people away over the past week. And those homes, those communities now, a lot of them that are close to the border are quite literally turning into military bases. And they are in a military zone. Sderot perhaps, it slightly falls outside of some of that. But what we've seen of our travels along the border today and to some of the training camps where the IDF are doing their training they are getting ready for the possibility of an incursion. We have been with the IDF troops while they've been in fields lining up in their vehicles with their integrated forces, their tanks, their infantry, their combat engineers, rehearsing for a movement of when they get that order, you know, to go through the fence, through the wire, into Gaza. So the preparations for that are underway. And we've seen preparations as well for the IDF troops training in a simulated, in a large concrete village modeled town, modeled on a Palestinian town with mosques, with houses, with shops, with traffic intersections.

I really want to get your insight first of all in terms of what you are hearing from those inside Gaza. Just tell us what conditions are like. Paint a picture if you will. FRANCESCA ALBANESE, U.N. SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON OCCUPIED TERRITORIES: Sure. Thanks for having me back. I have to confess that I have not been able to reach out to the people I know I'm normally in contact with. The humanitarian operators who are still active and frantically working to cope with the inferno that has beholden them, nor with my usual partners who are human rights organizations on the ground. And the situation I see is -- pictures of which I get from the United Nations and others who are there is very grim. As I said, it's an inferno on earth because we -- in response to the heinous attack that Israel received, and I truly understand and empathize with all the victims, that I know no Israeli was not suffered the loss of a family member or a friend. So no question about that. But the response has not been -- has clearly been disproportionate, unproportional, because it has resulted already in 2,600 people killed, 700 of whom are kids, 500 of whom are women. And the Israel carpet bombing the Gaza Strip has turned it into rubble. On top of it, it has closed. They already closed the Gaza Strip. There's been a blockade for 16 years now. But depriving people of water, food, and electricity at the time of this severe bombing and also bombing hospitals, targeting ambulances, because this has happened. Is this a proportional response? How on earth can this be proportional? But also, Becky, you know that this argument of going after Hamas and wiping off Hamas, eradicate Hamas from the Gaza Strip, we have heard it before. It doesn't -- I mean, it has happened. There have been five major wars which have made 4,200 --",

But now it's spreading along the border and that certainly does not portend well. And for instance, we're hearing from the Iranian foreign minister who's been in Beirut, and Damascus, and Baghdad, who's basically said -- he said in a statement today that the situation in the region is like gun powder where there's a possibility of a huge explosion at any hour. Now the Israelis have been sending messages that they don't want a two-front war, they want to avoid escalation.

So it's complete confusion and nobody seems to know. And I've been in contact with them well over 30 times in the last couple of days. And there isn't a real sense of direction. SOARES: A sense of direction. How are they doing? I mean, and have you critically heard -- Mo, have you heard from the Foreign Office? Has anyone given you any sort of advice? EL-DEEB: So this is (INAUDIBLE). So I've been consistently calling the Foreign Office, the CDO. And their advice is to keep an eye on the advice, which whenever it comes in it's turned out to be inaccurate. The first time that they went on a Tuesday they were there for no longer than 10 minutes, and the border itself was bombed. So they essentially have to go back to a war zone for half an hour endangering their life. The second update that we got was this -- one that I mentioned, the window of opportunity between one and five which also didn't work out. So that's another risk to their live. And had they had taken the opportunity, and farm lot which they came today from them actually was that they should shelter in a place called Khan Younis. Now within half an hour from receiving this message there was a barrage of bombs which had dropped in that same area. So all three updates that we had could have potentially endanger their lives. So the position that I have at the moment is I no longer trust the advice, and I'm no longer taking it on board.",

I also know from what you told our team that your father, I believed, your mother, I believed, pardon me, had suffered a stroke since arriving as well. So I am sorry for what you're going through, Mo. Please keep us posted. And hope that you'll be with them safely and shortly.Thank you very much, Mo. Appreciate it. EL-DEEB: Thank you, Isa.",

An Israeli newspapers is doing just that today by featuring pictures of children on its front page. The paper says they are believed to be missing or held hostage in Gaza.The headline as you could see there reads, \"This is How Hell Feels.\" Important to point out here that CNN cannot independently verify the fate of these child featured on that front page. But I want to bring in our Becky Anderson who's on the ground and has been covering this conflict, and is an expert of course in the region. And Becky, as we look at this front page and of course we are reminded of what we brought our viewers at the top of the show, that message from the IDF, the 155 hostages have been brutally taken by Hamas. Just speak here to the despair and the anger that so many families are facing right now.",
