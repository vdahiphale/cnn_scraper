But Mitch McConnell certainly does not see it that way. And you heard his assessment of what happened in these midterm elections about moderates and independents, about candidate quality. These are things he's been touching on, you know, that we've heard leading up to these elections. He said back in August he was concerned about candidate quality. But really more -- also - also too about being united in their messaging. And that was not what we were getting from Scott versus McConnell. And now you're really seeing that play out.
