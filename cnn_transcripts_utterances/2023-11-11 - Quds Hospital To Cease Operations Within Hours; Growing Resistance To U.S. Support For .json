      "sentences": "Well, President Biden is grappling with his growing frustration around the globe and here at home over the U.S. support for Israel at a time when the civilian death toll in Gaza has been mounting.But we have seen this subtle but notable shift in language from the administration over the course of the last day. Secretary of State Antony Blinken speaking in his most blunt terms yet against the number of Palestinians who have been killed in this conflict. He told reporters traveling yesterday that there are far too many Palestinians who have been killed and that more needs to be done to protect them. Now this comes as the administration has long talked about Israel's right to defend itself, its ability to make its own decisions about its military campaign. But the White House has really been grappling with this growing discontent over that civilian death toll and the way that the U.S. has supported the Israeli decisions. Now this comes as the U.S. has been pushing for those humanitarian pauses. The White House said on Thursday that they had secured an agreement from Israel to allow for a four-hour humanitarian pause to move civilians, get more aid in. That is something that we have seen play out over the course of the past few days. But the administration is also receiving very stark warnings about the discontent in the Arab world. There was a diplomatic cable obtained by CNN that was sent by a U.S. official, American diplomat in the embassy in Oman, that warned about the Arab world frustration with the fact that the U.S. continues to support Israel even as these death tolls are mounting. That cable said, quote -- that the administration is, quote, losing U.S.-Arab publics for generations. They also said that there is this view in the Arab world that this U.S. support for Israel is seen as, quote, material and moral culpability in what they consider to be possible war crimes. These officials really warning of the long-term impact that this could have with the Arab world as this campaign continues. But the president is also seeing this frustration firsthand here at home, traveling out in the country. Earlier in the week, he was at an event in Illinois interrupted by an audience member calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. There are pro-Palestinian protesters lining the streets outside of his events. The White House has been trying to make clear that they have been pushing for more to be done, pushing for those humanitarian pauses. The question is how much longer it will take to try to get some steps put in place to try to prevent these civilian casualties from piling up even more.",

Under the laws of war, you're supposed to be proportionate, indiscriminate in engaging these kinds of targets that might kill civilians, and there's a moral imperative to reduce civilian casualties. Finally, I think the administrations are looking beyond the military face, and they probably think it's going to be hard to establish an enduring peace in Gaza, with so many civilians have been killed, not removing the conditions that have made them Hamas flourish in the past.",

My surgeon colleague reported from Al-Shifa Hospital that yesterday, he did 25 surgical interventions, but they're doing these interventions without painkillers for post-operative care, without anesthetics, without the proper instruments.In many cases, they're doing these surgeries just in the hallways because the hospitals are so inundated with injured people. There are still hundreds of injured people who are coming into these facilities every day. Some of the rooms are collapsing, being hit by the bombs. And there are still thousands of people in these facilities.",

That was the pattern that we've seen so consistently since October 7 is a complete disregard for those basic fundamental rules.So many civilians have been killed and injured. We lost a colleague on Monday, this past Monday, he was in his home with his family. A bomb hit that -- hit his home and he was killed with his family. So we've seen so egregiously the violations of international humanitarian law, including now that direct bombardment of medical facilities which is explicitly prohibited in IHL, that we, as Doctors Without Borders are taking a very unusual step for us to step out and call for a total ceasefire. We would normally say, please, respect medical space. Please respect humanity within the context of war. In this case, that has -- that has completely been completely obliterated. And doctors cannot stop bombs. So we are stepping out now and calling on the authorities and anybody with influence to have a total ceasefire.",
