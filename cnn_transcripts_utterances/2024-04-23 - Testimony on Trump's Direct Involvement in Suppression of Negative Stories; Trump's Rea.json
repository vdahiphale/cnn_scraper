He just emerged from the courtroom after listening to David Pecker, the tabloid king of the National Enquirer, testify in length about efforts that they took to suppress negative stories about Donald Trump as he was running for the White House. Trump came out there and notice he was speaking to the camera, speaking to the media. He says that his gag order that is in place violates him from doing that and from defending himself. It doesn't. It does prevent him, though, from going after witnesses in this case, including Michael Cohen and people like David Pecker and others who are expected to take that stand. He was armed with a stack of papers. He said that they are positive articles that he wanted to enter into the record. And Daniel Dale is here with us, was listening to all of that statement, CNN's resident fact checker.And Daniel Dale, you know, aside from what, Trump is trying to enter into the evidence, it's not clear that his attorneys wanted to enter that into the evidence. Can you just walk us through what he said about the gag order here and what's true and what's not true?",

So I don't know what was in those specific articles, but he said he had an article saying this case is a sham. It shouldn't have been brought. And he's not sure if he could even say that. Well, he can say that, that is clearly not prohibited by the gag order. I have the text of the gag order in front of me. What it does, Kaitlan, is bar him from three specific kinds of speech. Number one is speaking publicly or directing others to speak publicly about known or reasonably foreseeable witnesses in the case, specifically about their potential participation in the case. Number two is speaking publicly, directing others to speak publicly about prosecutors other than DA Bragg, staff members in Bragg's office and the court and the family members of prosecutors, staff members of the court.And it qualifies that if those statements are made with the intent to material interfere, then the court will not be able to speak publicly about the case. And then number three, he's barred from speaking publicly about or directing others to speak publicly about jurors or prospective jurors. So if he just wants to say this case is a sham, as he has pretty much every time he's appeared before those cameras, he's perfectly allowed to. He's not barred. And I'll just add, Kaitlan, I've heard you fact check this. Others on our team fact checked this. He said this case is all Biden. There is zero, precisely zero evidence that President Biden had anything to do with bringing, orchestrating, running this case. So he says that pretty much every time. It's completely out of thin air.",

What you see in the testimony from Mr. Pecker, and there's not a coincidence that he's also the first witness, is that what the prosecutors are trying to build brick by little brick, ultimately building, hopefully for themselves, a wall for this prosecution, is this idea that this does not rise and fall on Cohen. If that's the case, the prosecution is going to have a problem. So very intentionally, you see the prosecution calling a different witness. In this case, Mr Pecker, who serves as that introductory narrator to lay the framework for this story that then later is corroborated by Michael Cohen. And why are they doing this? Because they know fundamentally the biggest issue they're going to have in convincing this jury beyond a reasonable doubt is whether or not Cohen is believable. If he's not, the case is in trouble. The way they try to do this is to show that certain facts and circumstances, stories, vignettes are all backed up by other people.",

Government attorneys also signposting how David Pecker operated as something of a hatchet man for the 2016 Trump campaign, publishing blatantly false stories about his then-campaign rivals from Ted Cruz to Hillary Clinton. Pecker was also asked about Karen McDougal, the former Playboy Playmate of the Year, who allegedly had a 10-month to a year- long relationship with Mr. Trump. The name we've yet to get to in Pecker's testimony, Stormy Daniels. Stormy Daniels is the woman who silenced Trump, allegedly tried to buy, and who is actually at the center of the 34 criminal counts Mr. Trump is charged with in this case.

But what he's also doing, what prosecutors are doing, they're setting the table for key witnesses who are going to come later, including, most of all, Michael Cohen. Now, David Pecker's testimony established Michael Cohen was Donald Trump's fixer. We hear that expression all the time. It's hard to remember now sometimes because Michael Cohen is so anti-Trump now. But boy, oh, boy, in vivid detail, David Pecker is showing us that communications with Donald Trump almost always ran through Michael Cohen. He also mentioned, and we will hear from this witness as well, interactions with Hope Hicks, how concerned the campaign was after that Access Hollywood tape came out in the closing days of the 2016 election.The other thing that we really saw is the buildup here, the sequence of this catch and kill. That's such a key phrase from today, catch and kill. What Donald Trump, David Pecker, and Michael Cohen would do is they would hear about potentially damaging stories, and they would get the rights to them, and they would kill those. We heard in detail about the way that they purchased the story from the doorman, Guido Sejudin, about a story that turned out to be untrue about a child Donald Trump had out of wedlock. We ended the day with David Pecker talking about the effort to catch and kill, the story from Karen McDougal, and where we're building up to that they'll resume on Thursday is any involvement that David Pecker has or knows about with the payoffs to silence Stormy Daniels. So the prosecutors are building their story here sort of brick by brick up to the most important allegation.",

Karen McDougal and Dino as well, really important here in terms of what the catch and kill and checkbook journalism was about. But the biggest thing here is that it has to be for Trump's benefit and the why. This date's so important to think about, August 2015. Remember, it was June 2015 when Donald Trump came back down that escalator in that famous moment. Before this, David Pecker talked about he really didn't have any moment or did anything to catch and kill stories about Trump before that. The timeline will be very important, Jake, thinking about why now and why this time. Remember, there was an election in 2016.",
