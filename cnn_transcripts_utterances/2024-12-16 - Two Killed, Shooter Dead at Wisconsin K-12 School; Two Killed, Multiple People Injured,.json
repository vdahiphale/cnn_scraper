We understand that this is a relatively small Christian school. I counted about 55 staff members on their website, just a few hundred students. Here is what a neighbor and a parent had to say about this tragedy. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOHN DIAZ DE LEON, NEIGHBOR &amp; FORMER PARENT AT SCHOOL: I mean, the tragedy of all what the other kids have seen. The kids saw this and heard this. I mean, right before Christmas. How tough is that to live? And the parents, the parents, where are my kids? Where are my -- you know, maybe they still don't know if their kid has survived.

But remember, you can just -- in a lot of times in these situations, people start running and they get injured while running and hiding and just trying to get away from the danger zone. And just the trauma also, right? We never really -- you can't see that. But many of these kids that are now going to have to deal with the trauma of hearing gunshots while they're in their classrooms learning, you know, in some cases probably just having a good school day. So there's a lot of that that they're dealing with and for the families there and having to deal with all of that and really trying to make sure this community is aware of what happened and making sure that they are doing this in a very appropriate. The police, they're making sure that they're doing this in a very appropriate and mindful way in thinking of this community and thinking of the family members before they start releasing any more information.",

MICHAEL ALCAZAR, RETIRED NYPD DETECTIVESo we have to go to his residence, find out where he got his weapon, also identify if there's any other bad actors that might be associated with this active shooter. Check his background, check any criminal history, school history. We have to go to his social media to see again to see if he made any statements, any manifestos before this shooting.

That's one thing that the FBI maybe be able to help with. They have victim assistance folks that can come in and deal with this because it's going to be tremendous. It's a small school, it's a small community. It's just before Christmas. The kids were probably getting ready for Christmas break anyhow, and then this happened. So I think it's going to be devastating. You have to get the right counselors in for the victims families and then all the other students and the witnesses to this. So it's going to be a tough time.

They might need their parents with them. But key is we have to separate them so that their recollection of what happened or what they saw is their own recollection.We don't want the witnesses all commingling and sharing information, and then it might get muddled. So we like to interview them separately so we get their information as they recollect, and hopefully they can give us better information to identify the suspect. If they knew the suspect. Did he say anything, were there words, what kind of weapon he used? These are all good information. We'd like to interview the students, but preferably the adults are probably make better witnesses, especially with such a traumatic incident.",

To what end will this investigation yield useful information?The goal, I think everyone wants to know why there's -- it seems like an important part of the process.

People that work in schools have to be quick to identify an active shooter. They have to have established protocols. Run, hide, fight. I know it's more difficult, of course, with a school, with students.I've done active shooter training for citizens, and most people, unfortunately, right away, their instinct is to hide. And I hate to say that, you know, you don't want to really wait if there's a possibility for you to escape the location. Hopefully an adult in a school can identify where the shooter's coming from, where the sound is coming from, and guide the students out there as quick as possible. Of course, if you can't escape, and the shooting's happening right outside, like a room. Then you have to hide, you have to barricade, and you might have to fight. Schools are having this training now. You know, it's just a fact of life for us. I hate to say that. People don't want to believe that, but we have to be prepared for it. And it's, again, it's happening a lot. And I'm sure Rob would agree with that.",
