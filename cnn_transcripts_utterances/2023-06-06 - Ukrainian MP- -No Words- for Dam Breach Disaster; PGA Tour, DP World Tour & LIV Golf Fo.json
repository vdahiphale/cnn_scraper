We'll be speaking with a Ukrainian lawmaker who witnessed the flooding for him. Also in your headlines this hour breaking news from the world of golf, the PGA Tour, DP World Tour and LIV Golf forming a commercial partnership ending a bitter feud between the organizations but leaving major questions over how golf will be organized going forward. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken expected to meet the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman later today the latest play in Washington's quest to improve relations with the Gulf state that is after the Kingdom made voluntary cuts to oil production at the weekend. And it is the 14th day of protests across France over pension reforms. Unions making a last ditch effort to prevent the government raising the retirement age from 62 to 64. And also this hour, crucial talks are ongoing in Germany drawing a roadmap for climate change action. We will be speaking with one of the key decision makers and negotiators. Welcome back to \"Connect the World\". This is the second hour of the show. Echoes side that is the word being used by Ukrainian officials to describe the destruction of a major dam on the Dnipro River people in the Kherson area are evacuating as floodwaters raise fears also that the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant can be at risk. Nuclear safety officials do say there is no immediate risk there. Well, Kyiv blames Russian forces for blowing up the Nova Kakhovka Dam in a panic, while Moscow says it was destroyed in a serious terrorist attack. Either way, a torrential flow of water spilling right on to the front lines so tonight we ask how will this burst dam affect the people of Ukraine and affect the war? Well, one Ukrainian MP who got a look at the flooding in the Kherson region today tweeting, there are no words to describe the scale of this disaster. Oleksiy Goncharenko has now moved on from Kherson. He joins us live from neighboring Mykolaiv. Sir, it's good to have you with us as you understand it what happened?",

The third thing, the dam was not shot there was no shelling on the dam from Ukrainian side. But just in the night, it collapsed. So the explosion was inside the dam. So it's absolutely clear. And the dam is controlled by Russians today. It was controlled before it collapsed. So I'm sorry, but I can speak absolutely, directly and for hundred percent, that it was destroyed by Russians.

So unfortunately, it's absolutely in Russian playbook what they did today. They don't care about nature. They don't care about people. They act as barbarians. And why they did it. And probably they are afraid of Ukraine offensive. And they tried to destroy the only way the only bridge because this dam was also the bridge which connected the right bank, which is controlled by Ukraine and the left bank, which is today controlled by Russia. And probably they are aware afraid that Ukraine can use this dam as a breach in order to repel them from the left bank and to liberate our territories. And they didn't find anything better than to just destroy. And I want to remind you that according to Geneva Convention, to destroy such hydro -- such hydroelectric station, it equals their usage of mass destruction weaponry, so it equals of using nukes because it's absolutely non selective.

Andmore significantly, I think the players are still learning some of the details, I think everybody has been completely taken by surprise by these developments. And it would appear on the surface to end what has been a really, really unpleasant and prolonged civil war within the game of men's professional golf. And it has got pretty ugly between the tours between some of the players and the tours over the last 12 months as you say, with all this litigation, so many people and organizations all suing each other. It's been a complete mess, and it has robbed the game of some of the biggest names and certainly some of the biggest personalities. Guys like Brooks Koepka, Bryson DeChambeau, and Phil Mickelson, who kind of largely disappeared from view over the last 12 months. But now it seems as though they're all getting back together, kind of sort of, we don't exactly know yet how this is going to work out. But as I think you just said all litigation will now end. I've been learning that after this season, players who were ostracized by the PGA Tour and the European Tour sorry the DP World Tour as it's now known, will be allowed to reapply to the tours they were originally on if they would like to do so. And I guess we're at a point where we might have been a year ago, because there was talk last summer that perhaps something could all be worked out. And perhaps this new tour could coexist with the legacy established tools. But that didn't happen. Perhaps now that can happen. It's going to be really interesting to see how it all plays out, to be honest; we don't know exactly how it's going to work out. This story literally broke about an hour and 10 minutes ago.

Just very briefly I have to ask you, because you talk to golfers all the time, how destructive was this for relationships between golfers who are after all, I mean, they sort of grow up on the tour, they tend to know each other really, really well?

It seemed as though it was quite destructive. And you had guys like Rory McIlroy and Gerry McIlroy in particular, really calling out the players who were moving to LIV. And then you had some of those LIV players suing the tours. And it kind of got personal between some of them. Behind the scenes who knows what was really going on but it was noticeable at the Masters this year that a lot of the players who'd taken a principled stand a moral stand on this, they didn't want to talk about it anymore. Some of them like McIlroy even admitted that it had been impacting their performance on the golf course. And what was also interesting at the Masters, having had several months for this all to shake out, a lot of the golfers were saying look, we're still friends, we will still live in Florida in the same neighborhoods, we still see each other all the time, you know, none of that's really changed. And a lot of them are saying it's frankly nice to see each other again, because there was a period where they would only run into each other at the majors because at all other times they were on different tours. So I think for most of them, it will probably be quite easy to move on. I think most of them will be quite glad, frankly, that this is all over and they can now just get back to playing and talking about golf. I think there were some players in all of this who ruffled feathers anyway, and they ruffled even more feathers by doing this. I don't think those relationships can be repaired quite as easily. But I think in the main, I think everybody's just glad this is over. And I suspect a lot of these friendships were never really that badly damaged anyway.",

But the government the executive has already found a way past that a mechanism that allows it to get it passed. So this reform will become law. And the main union has said that they believe this will be the last big day of protests. I think this was much more about showing that six, these last six months again, the anger is still out there. And probably what these unions are likely to do is regroup in September because of course, Emmanuel Macron, for his last four years, has a lot of other reforms planned.

There they pause, then charge. Through the flares in the smoke that engulf the building lobby the sound of anger at the French president, shocking scenes but for Paris, nothing new.

Questions over what evidence there is to support Prince Harry's claim and the claim of dozens more people suing MGN over the questions around unlawful information gathering namely phone hacking the interception of voicemails, as well as the use of private investigators. And other unlawful means to glean private intimate details released in articles published by MGN publications between the early 1990s and 2011. Over the course of the last few hours, we've seen the defense lawyers running through a number of articles listed as part of Prince Harry's play. Questioning depends on which exact aspects he believes led him and his lawyers to believe that these were gleaned unlawfully including details around of course his travel, his relationships conversations. Prince Harry has been speaking in court. It has been interesting to hear his response to seeing those details that come to light around conversations he's had with other senior members of the royal family. The ups and downs of his relationship with a former girlfriend Chelsy Davy, events around his childhood as well events surrounding his late mother Diana, the Princess of Wales. These are all of course, deeply personal matters to Prince Harry. He has spoken openly about this in the past about his wish to reform the media landscape. He's spoken in the court about his difficult relationship with Britain's tabloid press. And he did, of course speak about the impact this has had on his life both as a child and a teenager, but also presently he spoke about this leading him to feel a sense of paranoia his circle of friends growing smaller and smaller over the years. As a result of private information being shared in these tabloid papers as well as the bouts of depression he suffered as a result of the comments being made in these papers. Now according to the lawyers representing MGN, they have brought into question some of Prince Harry's claims they questioned why he is taking issue with the Mirror Group Newspapers as opposed to other newspaper publications, which released similar articles. They have cited even quotes from the palace statements released from the palace at the time questioning whether or not some of this information was in fact already in the public eye as opposed to the claims being made by Prince Harry that they were obtained via unlawful practices. And also, of course, questions around the impact that's really hard on Prince Harry. Some of the articles of course, were released when he was very young. Andrew Green, the lawyer representing him -- question whether he'd even had read these articles before this claim was brought to the court this year. So this is a significant trial. And Jen, of course maintained that it's contesting of this claim they believe that no wrongdoing occurred at this time of the publication of these articles. They also believe there simply isn't any evidence that Prince Harry was directly hacked. But of course, this is a deeply personal matter for Prince Harry. He has spoken vocally in the past in his memoir spare in his Netflix Docu series, this is something he wants to pursue in order to transform reform, the media landscape here in Britain, Becky.",

A shorttime from now U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will arrive in Saudi Arabia and normalization between the Gulf giant and Israel is top of his agenda. The U.S. has been doggedly pursuing a deal hoping to build a bridge between two of its key Middle Eastern allies. But it is a hard road ahead. Saudi has been very public in its reservations about Israel, which is now being led by the most right wing government in the country's history. Violence between the Palestinians and the Israelis is at its highest level in decades. And the kingdom is unlikely to come to the table without steep security assurances from the United States. Well, CNN's Alex Marquardt is in Washington. We heard from Antony Blinken, talking about the importance to his mind and to the Biden Administration of deepening ties between Arab States and Israel.

And they're going to make progress by easing the tension that we have seen growing over the past few months between the Biden Administration and Saudi Arabia, most notably the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman or MBS, who the Biden Administration squarely accuses of being behind the murder of Jamal Khashoggi at the same time, the Biden Administration has given MBS immunity from prosecution. So Becky, among the topics that they're going to be discussing, of course, directly this normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia, but also more generally, security cooperation, economic cooperation, and nuclear cooperation. Becky, this comes at a time when China is also trying to have more of a say, in the region. Of course, they brokered that agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia, arch enemies in the region, to reestablish relations for each country to among other things, reopen their embassies in each country. That is something that Iranian state media said Iran would be doing this week in Saudi Arabia.
