And tonight, the breaking news, the former president's defiance. That is how one of Donald Trump's attorneys describes the former president's mood tonight after pleading not guilty to 37 felony counts in Miami. We are awaiting Trump's first public comment since he was formally arrested today. He is expected to land shortly at Newark airport, then head to his New Jersey golf club where he's expected to address a waiting crowd of his most loyal supporters and hold a fundraiser. He stopped at a Cuban restaurant in Miami before leaving. He wanted that photo-op. He was greeted by cheers there, a crowd even singing \"happy birthday\" to the former president on the eve, Wolf, of his 77th birthday.",

He's someone who has been at the core of Trump's inner circle, his body man for years now.And one of the biggest questions tonight is whether he will flip on Trump and how this case will affect the race for president. It has come now to frankly define the race at this moment. All angles covered tonight here as Wolf and I are with you. And I want to begin with Evan Perez in Miami. Evan, you were inside the courthouse for the arraignment Wolf mentioning that you saw the scowl, the slumping. Tell us more. EVAN PEREZ, CNN SENIOR JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, that's right, Erin. Certainly, the defiant tone that his attorneys are describing or people around him are describing is not what we saw from the former president inside the courtroom today. He was glum, he had his arms folded, slumped over in his chair. There were a few times where he clasped his hand and was twiddling his thumbs, not looking around. He did talk to his attorney Todd Blanche a few times. But then, you know, this was supposed to be like a perfunctory hearing. Sometimes these things take 15, 20 minutes at most. This one stretched about 50 minutes in part because of a little bit of the drama that you're alluded to, which is the former president is accused of obstruction of justice. He's accused of essentially tampering with witnesses who are part of this investigation. And a judge initially was trying to limit some of his communications with the people around him, some of the witnesses, of course, everyone at Mar-a-Lago ended up being brought in as witnesses, pretty much everybody came in to provide testimony as part of this case. And in the end what the judge, in part, because of the objections of Donald Trump's attorneys, the judge settled on a system whereby Trump is not allowed to speak to Walt Nauta, his codefendant, about the case. He's not allowed to speak to other witnesses about the case. The Justice Department is going to come up, the special counsel is going to come up with a list of witnesses that this applies to, something that the former president's own legal team said was not necessary. But a judge was insisting, which is part of the usual system here in the southern district of Florida. One last thing that I'll note about this is the former president was never required to stand up and acknowledge these charges, which is usually the case in these proceedings. He never stood up. Todd Blanche is the one that stood up and entered the not guilty plea as part of this proceeding. He was in the courthouse for just about two hours -- Wolf.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, we are expecting him to make this extremely political, like we have seen all day today, and really for the last several months, called this election interference a witch hunt.He really started this move when he stopped by Versailles. I was told by Trump advisers that part of this trip was to essentially meet with Cubans who are politically persecuted, something that he will be painting himself as, as well. [19:05:13] Obviously, those are two very different situations, but that is in part why they chose to go to Versailles. Now, behind me, we are going to see some of Trump's biggest supporters and biggest donors. I've already seen Mike Lindell. He's actually right in front of me taking a selfie of himself on the golf course. We also have Kash Patel here, Taylor Budowich, a lot of his big supporters and big donors who will be meeting with him after he delivers those remarks. I am told that they tweaked the speech on the plane. They were still going through it when I talked to them recently. And they should be landing in roughly the next half hour. Now, I do want to note one thing that Evan said because I think this is really important. Talk about this list of potential witnesses that he can't communicate with. Former President Trump has kept a tight- knit group around him since he left office. And most of those people are still there. So, it will be interesting to see how that plays out. Of course, we've noted the only person we know that he is not supposed to communicate about the case with is Walt Nauta, who was not only by his side at Versailles moments after he was arraigned, but then rode in the plane home with him. And we are likely to see him tonight. The other people who could potentially be witnesses are expected to be people who are very close to him still. So we have to watch how that exactly plays out. And keep in mind, even if lawyers are telling people not to communicate about the case, it is not easy for low-level staffers to talk to Donald Trump and say they can't communicate about a case. So, this is making a very complicated and messy piece of this puzzle here.",

And they want people to be adoring him and cheering for him and making him feel good so that later tonight he'll be in a good mood and not lashing out and hopefully be able to get money from the donors. And then also, I'll say you say, you know, it's interesting, you see Mike Lindell, as Kristen said, Seb Gorka, Ric Grenell, those people, they may have already been invited to this thing, but I guarantee there's a lot of people there tonight simply to keep the boss happy.

That's the judge's domain and her decision as to what to do without evidence. If she makes a ruling on that, that gets appealed. It could take months for the appeals court to decide. This question of what happens with the testimony of Trump's lawyer, which is somewhat, I don't miss a controversial legally, but a rare decision. You don't see these decisions where attorney's testimonies will come into court. She'd rule on that, that could get appealed, that could slow the whole thing down.

He recently made the decision not to run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. Governor, thanks so much for joining us. As you know, Trump was arrested today 37 federal charges. He's pleaded not guilty. What's your reaction to his decision to turn today into what he's about to do now, another campaign event? GOV. CHRIS SUNUNU (R), NEW HAMPSHIRE: Well, it's expected. There is no doubt, every time the guy gets indicted, he goes out and he raises money. So, I think with a lot of his base support, which is strong, as we all know, he loves it. He loves playing this victim card, he loves kind of making a political scene out of the whole thing. It really has nothing to do with where America is going to go in the future or what you should be running on in 2024, in terms of fiscal responsibility and draining the swamp, that management, border security, all these things that really actually matter. The fear is that all of this entire campaign is going to get wrapped up into Trump's indictments. That's what all of these candidates on the Republican stage should be worried about, which is why all of them should be quite loquacious in their pushing back on this indictment. I mean, the indictment is very real. I think he's going to be found guilty. The fact that so many of them are kind of weak on it is astounding to me. When your 40 points down in the polls to somebody who gets indicted, you don't come out quasi-defending them, it's just absolutely baffling.

And make sure that we are putting forth a candidate and a message, and something that resonates with folks, that can win in November of '24. Trump could win the nomination, but the mathematically, we all know there is no way he can win in November of '24. In fact, this dividing line, these indictments just keep getting that gap a bigger, and a, bigger and bigger. If you want to fix the Department of Justice, if you want those reforms out there, it doesn't happen unless Republicans win. And Trump can't win. So, the best thing if you want to support the former president in fixing the Department of Justice is, put forth another candidate that can actually close the deal in November. I mean, the math is just quite that simple. People are heated, they are fired up, especially on a day like today, I get it. I don't think the support he sees today translates to votes seven or eight months from now. I think a lot of other candidates are going to have an opportunity to step up, but they have to be uniform in their message about the severity of this indictment, they have to push back on, it pushed back on Trump, himself, and let him deal with his issues. He doesn't care about the Republican Party. Donald Trump has never cared about the Republican Party. He cares about Donald Trump.
