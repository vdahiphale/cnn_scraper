And there's a new warning from Israel right now. The Israeli military says it's increasing airstrikes on Gaza from this day forward. An IDF spokesperson says that's intended to, quote, \"minimize the risk to Israeli troops\" in the next stages of the war. Keep in mind, we've been watching a steady buildup of Israeli forces, tanks, and military equipment along the border with Gaza, along with airstrikes and shelling since the Hamas terror attack on October 7th. The IDF saying today it will launch a ground operation in Gaza when the conditions are, quote, \"optimal.\" For the first time since the Israel-Hamas war began two weeks ago, 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid rolled into Gaza from Egypt earlier on today. But the Rafah Border Crossing is now closed once more and relief agencies warned more water, food, and medical supplies are much needed. CNN's Sara Sidner is in Jerusalem for us.",

Mass destruction but one small albeit very small glimmer of hope for those who are desperate for supplies, medical supplies, food, and water.Palestinian officials say that some of that aid has been let in to help out the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in need. But it is a fraction of what normally comes in when it is not during wartime. It represents about 3 percent of what it used to get into Gaza before this crisis. Our Salma Abdelaziz has more on the story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hospitals in Gaza are crumbling. Everything is running out, from surgical equipment to medicine. And the tiniest lives are left hanging in the balance. We need power, we need access to clean water, this doctor says. Without basic services, this will be a humanitarian catastrophe. Already seven hospitals and 21 primary health care facilities here are out of service, according to Palestinian officials, because of shortages. After intense diplomatic efforts, prayers of relief at the Rafah Border Crossing as a trickle of aid was allowed in from Egypt. But the 20-truck convoy is only a drop in the ocean of need here, equivalent to just 3 percent of what entered this enclave daily prior to the conflict. More than 200 additional trucks of assistance remain stalled on the Egyptian side according to the U.N., and every hour costs lives. And so far no civilians can leave the enclave. Ten-year-old Palestinian- American Aiden is among those trapped. AIDEN BSEISO, PALESTINIAN-AMERICAN IN GAZA: And we have no place to go. All the streets are bombed. They're literally gone.

And they have been, over the last two weeks, using the dwindling supplies that we have prepositioned to -- reprovision the health centers, keep the only desalination plant that is still working to provide water going.But nevertheless, as you have heard, as we have heard, over one million people have been displaced, 300,000 children, and that means that they are not in their homes. And the fundamental needs right now are water, food, and medicine, and fuel. So, for example, in order to live in health and dignity, you should have 50 liters of water a day for drinking and washing and cooking, et cetera. Right now people are down to less than three liters of water per day. The health center is running out of supplies. We have babies in incubators. And if the fuel runs out, those incubators stop working, you can imagine the consequences. We are very concerned. And yes, indeed, some trucks went over the border today. But we are calling very strongly for a sustained humanitarian corridor that brings supplies in every day. We want all the border points to be open. And if we're talking about Rafah, we want to be able to ship in the pipeline supplies that we have ready which are water, water system supplies, medicine, medical supplies, and of course other agencies have food and other badly needed commodities for these lifesaving humanitarian response.",

And that's because we don't know whether Hamas abducted them from their beds or simply turned them into the sort of human ash the world hasn't seen since the Holocaust because in the October 7th massacre Hamas cremated whole families alive. It invaded villages and used thermobaric weapons. And I remember your own reports on CNN describing them as the most terrifying weapons in the world after nuclear weapons. They used those weapons to burn whole families inside their homes and there are still 100 to 200 people, who are still missing. We don't know whether they are in the Gaza Strip, we don't know whether they have simply been burned to a cinder and charcoal. And that's part of the challenge now as we try to set about freeing those hostages. Part of the last two weeks has been trying to identify who exactly is in the Gaza Strip because the only information we have about their hostages is from the gruesome videos that Hamas has been releasing on Telegram revealing the horrible, horrible, awful fate inside the Gaza Strip.",

People are upset, we see it in the streets, we see lots of people in the Middle East. But they are upset about the humanitarian issue in Gaza, not so much supportive of anything that occurred.

So if you just look, you know, the -- look, things are happening. But to the extent that, you know, Israel is not really facing an existential threat up north with the Iranians and Hezbollah. You now have a border open in Egypt to get humanitarian relief.

If Israel can -- have evidence that they have taken out senior leadership of Hamas, then maybe President Biden's diplomacy will have worked. You're going to avoid the humanitarian crisis.The biggest concern, of course, is a refugee crisis for the Arab countries. I'll be honest with you, you know, it's sort of ironic to hear them worried about the Palestinians now when you haven't really seen much engagement by them, and they clearly do not want that kind of refugee crisis on their borders. And so part of this will be how long is that engagement by Israel. And strategic strikes are different than a full-on invasion.

But the public expression is different. And I think publicly we saw a lot of this and response to that misinformation about the Al-Ahli hospital bombing that initially this was blamed on Israeli strike. The AP has the support article today that goes through a lot of the reasons why it see not to have been an Israeli strike.But in the wake of that the explosion that killed tragically some number, hundreds of Palestinians, we had both the cancellation of the Arab meetings that Biden had wanted to make when he went to the Middle East. And we also saw statements from the leadership in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, two states that had been interested, in the case of Saudi Arabia, and had actively concluded normalization with Israel. Calling what happened in the hospital or of a massacre. I think as we look at the potential beginning of really significant ground operations by Israel in Gaza, it's not going to be miss apprehension. If there are a large number of civilian deaths, I think we're going to see an even stronger response by Arab leaders. And the things that we were thinking just two weeks ago about normalization, about Israel's place in the region, about what the regional security picture is going to be, could be profoundly different and profoundly different for a long time to come.",
