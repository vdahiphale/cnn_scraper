He will provide a brief statement and provide the opportunity for questions after. Please limit your questions to one per outlet.Following the briefing, the Joint Information Center staff and I will be here to help you with any of your further needs. May I now please introduce Rear Admiral John Mauger. REAR ADMIRAL JOHN MAUGER, U.S. COAST GUARD:  This morning, an ROV, or remote-operated vehicle, from the vessel, Horizon Arctic, discovered the tail cone of the Titan submersible approximately 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic on the seafloor. The ROV subsequently found additional debris. In consultation with experts from within the unified command, the debris is consistent with the catastrophic loss of the pressure chamber. Upon this determination, we immediately notified the families. On behalf of the United States Coast Guard and the entire unified command, I offer my deepest condolences to the families. I can only imagine what this has been like for them, and I hope that this discovery provides some solace during this difficult time. Additionally, we've been in close contact with the British and French consul general to ensure that they are fully apprised and that their concerns are being addressed. The outpouring of support in this highly complex search operation has been robust and immensely appreciated. We are grateful for the rapid mobilization of experts on the undersea search and rescue, and we thank all of the agencies and personnel for their role in the response. We are also incredibly grateful for the full spectrum of international assistance that's been provided. The ROVs will remain on scene and continue to gather information. Again, our most heartfelt condolences go out to the loved ones of the crew. We'll now take questions. (CROSSTALK))",

And in each debris field that they found on the ocean floor, they found pieces of that pressure haul no longer intact. The pressure haul containing the passenger compartment there and that leading to the conclusion that it was a loss of all five of those lives on board. Pictures there, Hamish Harding, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, Stockton Rush, as well as Suleman Dawood and Shahzada Dawood. Other updates, they said it's too early to tell the timeline of exactly when this catastrophic loss happened. Also, notably, the rear admiral there saying it does not appear to be any connection between those noises which had been interpreted as possibly banging noises, no connection between those noises and the location of where they found that debris field on the bottom of the ocean floor.

But in addition to that, as you heard the Rear Admiral said a short while ago, they will begin to de mobilize some of their assets over the next 48 hours.At one point during the briefing, I did specifically ask the Rear Admiral after he described this as a catastrophic implosion, about timing, because you remember, when the Titan began its descent early Sunday morning, it was about one hour and 45 minutes into its descent when all of a sudden it lost contact with the surface ship. And so I asked them, do they believe that this \"catastrophic implosion\" happened at that moment. He couldn't give a definitive answer. There needs to be more investigation into that. But what I can tell you is he also said that they had been - that they had dropped sonar buoys, all throughout that particular area. And the sonar buoys, he said, did not pick up - did not pick up, excuse me, did not pick up any sounds that would indicate some type of catastrophic implosion at least at that time. So that seems to suggest, again, I caution, the investigation now underway, but that seems to suggest that this catastrophic implosion may have occurred at that particular moment. A little bit more very quickly, if I may, about the debris that they found. And again, the debris found but by that ROV, that remotely operated vehicle, the tail cone found about 1,600 feet from the bow of the Titanic on the ocean floor. In addition to that, they also found five different pieces in what they described as a large debris field, including the front of the pressure haul, and then a second smaller debris field where they found the other end of the hall. And of course, there was the statement he made for the families. He said, I can only imagine what this has been like for them. And he also said that he hoped that this provided some sort of solace for those during this very, very difficult time. So now, the questions Begin, what happened? Could it have been prevented?
