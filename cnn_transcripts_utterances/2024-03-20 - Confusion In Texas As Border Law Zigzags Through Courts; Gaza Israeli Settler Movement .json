That's the same appeals court that we are waiting to hear a decision from now, at any moment after judges question lawyers from both sides today when exactly how the law would be implemented.

Are they prepared to enforce this law if the appeals court ultimately decides that is going back into effect? REP. HENRY CUELLAR (D-TX): Absolutely not. They're not ready. Look, whether its a police or a sheriffs office, there are there to enforce criminal law. There are out there to take criminals off the streets and keep them the community safe. They're not given the power to enforce immigration laws. So, if they have to decide, they're going to fight crime instead of an immigration law. Border Patrol is stretched out and they got a lot of resources. So imagine a sheriff and a small community or a police chief and a small community, they don't have the training, they don't have the resources. And what happens, are they pick up somebody, put it in in a county jail? And what happens if it's overloaded? And plus, and if they're going to take them over to the bridge and let's say some of those people are from another parts of the world, Mexico is not going to take him. So why are we doing this?

Lot of that -- a lot of Democrats assailing the credibility of that key Republican witness, but ultimately, Jake, the question is going to be how to Republicans want to proceed? Do they actually want to move forward with articles of impeachment? And speaking to a number of Republicans today, it's clear that allow them not sure yet about whether they have the votes to go there. Whether they're willing to vote to impeach Joe Biden and whether or whether this investigation should simply pull the plug. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE GALLAGHER (R-WI): My view is there should be a very high bar for impeachment. And like the reason I voted against to Trump impeachments is that there wasn't evidence supporting that a crime have been committed and therefore, we were lowering the bar for impeachment and opening up the Pandora's box of impeachment. That same was true for the Mayorkas impeachment. REP. ANTHONY D'ESPOSITO (R-NY): I'm still waiting to two hear everything as they lay it out. I know that there's been some hiccups me. REP. JOHN DUARTE (R-CA): We already said, if you look at the Foreign Agent Registration Act, we have an unregistered foreign agent as president.",

John Solomon is out there defending his reporting on social media.I guess the bigger question is, why should Americans believed Parnas? He's quite unreliable as a witness, isn't he? REP. DAN GOLDMAN (D-NY): Well, what's interesting is, first of all, he's speaking against his own self-interest. So it's inconsistent with what he had said previously, which is always something that bolsters credibility rather than undermines it. But what he is saying is very consistent with what every single other witness has said about the Burisma allegations and about the corruption that is alleged to have happened within it, which is that it is bogus. It is made up. It is factually incorrect. In fact, the prosecutor general in Ukraine was not prosecuting Burisma, was not prosecuting corruption. And so his removal was bad for Burisma because the next prosecutor general came in and then did get investigate Burisma. But what's also notable, Jake, is that what Lev Parnas said today is consistent with what the source the FBI confidential source has been charged with which is making a false statements that were planted by Russian intelligence to interfere in our election which is exactly the same thing that Parnas said he was doing back in 2019. And the remarkable thing is the Republicans are still talking about it. At this point, they know it is Russian disinformation designed to meddle and interfere in our elections. And if they continue pushing this bogus, debunked narrative, they are conspiring with Russia to interfere in our elections on behalf of Donald Trump.",

So, now, what I'm talking about is as we go forward, any allegations by any Congress members right now that the Burisma allegations are somehow corruption is complicit with Russia today, and going forward. And Russia is trying to interfere in our election in November for Donald Trump, just like it did in 2016, just like it tried to do with this confidential source in 2020 and now as it is continuing to do.",

While \"The Daily Mirror\" tabloid goes even further, reporting that the hospital wants to probe into allegations that Kate's confidentiality actually was breached.CNN's Max Foster takes a look at what we know.

This one alleging medical staff tried to illegally access her records while she was there to undergo surgery at this private London clinic? The country's data watchdog now says it's assessing a breach of confidentiality reported in \"The Daily Mirror\". The British tabloid reported that at least one hospital staffer allegedly tried to illegally access Kate's private and medical records, while she spent 13 nights at the London clinic hospital in January after planned abdominal surgery. The mirror says the hospital informed the palace, and launched a probe into the allegations and did a statement to CNN, the U.K.'s information commissioners office said we can confirm that we've received a breach report and are assessing the information provided. On Wednesday, the U.K.'s health minister, Maria Caulfield, warn that hospital staff could face prosecution. MARIA CAULFIELD, U.K. MINISTER FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND WOMEN'S HEALTH STRATEGY: So any allowed to access the patient that you're caring for and their permission and there's really strict was the information commissioner would take enforcement action against trusts or primary care practices, but also as individual practitioners, your regulatory body. So for me, the NMC (ph) would take action as well. So it's pretty severe.",
