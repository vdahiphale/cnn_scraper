And later, Kara Swisher is here with her take on the billionaires and heads of trillion dollar companies lining up to pay tribute to what critics say, just simply pay off Donald J. Trump. All right, John Berman here, in for Anderson and we do begin tonight with a place in our hearts for the students, staff and parents of the Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin. They are right now going through what people at 82 other schools and college campuses have gone through just this year. And yes, you heard that correctly. According to a CNN analysis of the data from the Gun Violence Archive, Education Week and the organization, Every Town For Gun Safety. As of today, there have been 83 school and college shootings in 2024, which have taken 38 lives, injured at least 115 others, and traumatized so many more. Tonight, the White House is expressing deep condolences to the families of the teacher and teenage student who were killed and six others hurt, two of them badly by a student with a pistol, who was also dead.

JOHN KIRBY (RET), COORDINATOR FOR STRATEGIC COMMUNICATIONS AT THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL: Just horrific news and news that no family, no parent, no sibling, no son or daughter ever wants to hear, so, just, just terrible.

They're going through all of that.One of the things that is happening and what is delaying some of this information from coming out, is that the parents of the alleged shooter are being interviewed by detectives, and so they're still in the process, literally 30, 40 minutes ago, when police last held a press conference, the parents were still being interviewed by investigators. They're cooperating. But obviously for investigators, they want to know what more do the parents know? And the other thing I want to note is that during the press conference, the Wisconsin DOJ official who spoke indicated that there was some information that people knew perhaps what was going on in this person's life and that they never reported it.

People don't snap. These things build and they plan, they prepare, they arm, they go through many steps, and they also have many tells, if you will. And one of the things the FBI has been working on is literally a campaign to get this out. And they say some of the indicators that you'll see in people and this will be detectable by friends, classmates, a guidance counselor, a boyfriend or girlfriend, a brother or sister, parents significantly reduced ability to cope with stress or setbacks, expressions of hopelessness, helplessness, lack of nonviolent options for solving problems, persistent fantasies about violence.

It was two days ago, the anniversary of Sandy Hook. And, you know, I spent it at home just quietly. And of course, I thought about it.And to have this happen, you know, two days after that, it really brings back all of those memories, you know, when you watch the coverage on the news and you see the police cars and the ambulances coming and, you know, this poor officers, what they went through, the poor families, what they're going through, it brings it all back. And I want to give credit to the Madison Police chief. He's doing a fantastic job in terms of putting out information. The Madison Police Department did a very fantastic job. The fact that they trained, they got in there quickly. That's step one. As far as the motive they're investigating, the motive is important. Of course, people want to know what would cause a person to do this. In my estimation, though, the motive doesn't really do much to justify anything. How do you justify what you did? It doesn't mean much to the parents. You know, if every kid that had a bad time at school or had a breakup or had an issue was the school shooter, we'd have a school shooting every single day, and that's just not the case. And so, what they have to do right now are two things. One, they have to see if this person had an accomplice. Was there anything else that they were going to do or anybody that helped them? The second thing they need to see if there was any, precipitating news or events. Was there a tell, as somebody had mentioned before, did anybody know that this was going to happen? Did this person post anything on social media indicating that they might take this action? How did they get the gun? Those are the types of questions that need to be answered.",

I think it's been 480 mass shootings this year alone, over 80 in schools. That's completely unacceptable.

He said it was logical, therefore, to think that any of the testimony that Trump's team was challenging, like Hope Hicks, Madeleine Westerhout, two White House aides, was also not official, writing, \"This court further finds that the evidence related to the preserved claims relate entirely to unofficial conduct and thus receive no immunity protections.\" And he said that if there were any mistakes in this case, it was harmless because the evidence presented by the prosecution, he said, was overwhelming.

Obviously, Trump's going to have a play here, but they did pass a law. And so he doesn't have to enforce it necessarily, I guess.It's really confusing. I think -- we'll wait to see what the Supreme Court does. I'm assuming they'll weigh in in some way because it's a big constitutional issue. But so far, TikTok keeps losing in court. And the Chinese government is not in the best position right now from an economic point of view. They may have to make a deal here. The other part that people don't realize is that many of the owners of TikTok are not, in fact, Chinese. They're American billionaires, including Jeff Yass, who is close to Trump and gave him a lot of money. Trump was the first person to be against TikTok before he was for TikTok. It's very John Kerry of him. But he -- and now because they love him and they're giving the warm digital hug, he likes them, I guess. I don't know.",

Dali sat in the back of the aircraft and was flanked by two French security officials the entire flight to JFK. A week and a half ago, Dali was charged in federal court with one count of being a stowaway on a vessel or aircraft without consent. Among other things, the judge ordered Dali to wear an ankle bracelet with a GPS monitor, surrender any travel documents and told her she cannot go to airports or leave the area where she is staying. That includes, of course, jumping on a Greyhound bus to Canada. Daly had been staying with a roommate. A law enforcement source told CNN her roommate reported her missing after he saw her GPS ankle bracelet on the floor. Randi Kaye, CNN, Palm Beach County, Florida. (END VIDEO TAPE)",
