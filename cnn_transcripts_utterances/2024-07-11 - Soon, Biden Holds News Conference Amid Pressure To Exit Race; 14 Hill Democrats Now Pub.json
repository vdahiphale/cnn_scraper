Anxious Democrats and the world watching very closely to see how the President does tonight. More and more members of his own party now going public with their fears that President Biden no longer has what it takes to defeat Donald Trump.Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. And let's get right to the breaking news this hour, a pivotal moment in President Biden's fight for political survival. We're standing by for the president's first extended solo news conference since his poor debate performance two weeks ago thrust his re-election campaign into crisis. You're going to see it live, of course, right here on CNN. Our Senior White House correspondent Kayla Tausche is attending the news conference over at the NATO Summit site right here in Washington, D.C. Kayla, just ahead of this news conference, President Biden only moments ago spoke at a NATO event on Ukraine.",

Take a listen.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: And now I want to hand it over to the president of Ukraine, who has as much courage as he has determination.

Although, I'm told that the president has been holding calls, his top advisers have been holding calls at least twice a day, 9And a senior administration official tells me that as of that call 9:00 A.M. this morning, there had been no change of heart and no change of decision for the president's inner circle and, by extension, for the president on whether to continue seeking re-election. That is a critical backdrop for what we are expected to hear from the president in just about an hour with that press conference running slightly behind with the rest of the NATO summit schedule here. The president's goal with this news conference is to go out on stage and to prove that he is up to the task of not only winning the election, but securing another four years. But it comes at a time as Democrats are incredibly frustrated, angry, sad, that they feel that the president's inner circle have betrayed him with bad judgment and bad strategy, and in particular, shielding them from what they say is an advanced age of President Biden and what they see as a steep decline in his faculties over the last year-plus. That is the vibe that we've gotten from Democrats. That's the consistent theme that we've heard from a dozens of people that my colleagues and I have spoken with, that there's a careful choreography around the president at all times to try to keep him from having moments like the ones that we just saw. But that's why today's press conference is so critical because it will be him in a freewheeling on relatively unscripted type of format. And so that's what we're going to be seeing later on this hour. Wolf?",

That level of scrutiny is going to be applied to every public utterance that Joe Biden has from now through November if he remains the candidate on the ballot. That is the world of a changed campaign and context for Joe Biden's candidacy. And that's just the reality.So, he and his team are never going to be able to do that.

I mean, you mentioned there, Wolf, that they have not done a solo news conference with President Biden since last November. I looked at the numbers yesterday. When you compare him not just to Donald Trump, but to Barack Obama and George Bush to date, at this point in their presidencies, they had done many more news conferences and availabilities. So, that speaks to the fact that they know that they have a lot of ground to make up with voters and that people are going to be watching this closely, not just the president's critics or Republicans, but also his allies and those Democrats who have not yet gotten up there to where they are calling on him to step aside.You just saw Colorado Senator Michael Bennet. He was telling me the other night that he doesn't believe that Biden can defeat Donald Trump, but he didn't yet call on him to drop out of the race. So, they're obviously watching that closely. The White House is not really sharing a lot about how they've been preparing for this press conference. Obviously, they know they're going to get questions on his acuity, his ability to not just serve right now, but also until he is age 86, which is what he would be at the end of a second term. So, there's a real question of how he handles this, how he deals with the concerns. Is he dismissive of them, which has really wrinkled some Democrats, or does he confront them head on?",

Should I do this press conference? Is this the right strategic message?But at the end of the day, the buck ultimately stops with the candidate, Wolf. In terms of electoral politics, if you're constantly having to defend your candidate against an issue, you are losing the race. To David's point, this issue is not going away anytime soon. And they have to deal with this between now and November, you're talking about four months technically versus being able to make the case against your opponent, that's not a good thing. You think about the coalition in 2020 that led President Biden to winning the election. If you look at those groups, young voters, suburban voters, African- American voters, you're seeing some real cracks in that foundation. So, mathematically, there's already questions among Democrats, can you win in November? Also, what will the implications be on our Senate candidates? What will the implications be on our House candidates? And so those are very serious questions that I think a lot of Democratic members are now facing the reality of, which is why many are starting to slowly come out and say, maybe it is time for this sea to change. [18:15:06] BLITZER: We'll go back to David Axelrod.

So, I've sort of kept a little bit of a distance from him, and so I don't know whether there's any truth to that or not. But, you know, I will say this. The people who are most vulnerable weary about Biden stepping off this ticket, if he does, are the Republicans because they built a message for two years that essentially was the world's out of control, Biden's not in command, he's weak, Trump is strong, elect Trump. That's the whole Republican message. That's what you're going to hear at the convention next week. And that's why there's some level of panic in the Republican Party that there might be a change here.As for the president, you know, Kaitlan said that Michael Bennet didn't call for him to step down. There is a lot of affection for the president. There's a lot of respect for the president. And I think people want to give him space to essentially contemplate everything that's going on and come to his own decision. But I wouldn't confuse that with a lack of concern among Democrats. I think that is widespread, and many people have held their tongues for most of this week and much of last. I'm not sure that's going to hold.",

You'll, of course, see the news conference live right here on CNN.Joining us now, Congressman Lloyd Doggett of Texas, the first House Democrat to publicly call for the president to step aside. Congressman, thanks very much for joining us. Just moments ago, you heard President Biden's gaffe that he quickly corrected calling President Zelenskyy President Putin. How much does that feed into Democrats concerns right now? And what do you want to hear from President Biden at his news conference just a short while from now? REP. LLOYD DOGGETT (D-TX): Well, I think it's the type of slight that would never have been noticed in earlier times. But if the focus from now until November is on these stumbles and fumbles, minor though they may be, rather than on Donald Trump's lies, then we will lose. And my concern, I hope tonight to see him strong in an international forum, I believe he will be because he was with the Ukraine event other than that one mishap, but however that event goes, I don't think it will change my view that's a strong one that he needs to step aside in favor of a stronger candidate. I felt that the moment that I heard that debate, that debate cannot be unseen. It's out there. And I believe that President Biden has a unique opportunity this Monday night in my hometown of Austin, Texas, when he will be presented an award quite justifiably which is held in the state library at the LBJ library. That would be a great time for him to follow the example of President Lyndon Johnson putting country ahead of self and make the difficult and painful decision after so many years of valued service to say that he will step aside, continue to do the duties of president, but let someone else take on Donald Trump and devote their full energy to protecting our democracy and saving our country from a takeover by a criminal and his gang who may never give it back.",

What will you be looking for from the president as he takes the stage just moments from now? DR. JONATHAN REINER, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, to start, Wolf, I'll be looking at his sort of subjective overall appearance. The first thing that was evident two weeks ago was that the president looked -- he looked ill. He looked pale and frail. His voice was low and, and halting. He had difficulty finishing his thoughts and his sentences, so that overall sort of gestalt of how he looks. And when we see patients in the clinic setting, when we watch them walk into the room, when we watch them walk out of the room, we often get a pretty good sense for how they're feeling.

But the president has now shown some symptoms, concerning symptoms, as manifest or as what was evident in the debate two weeks ago. And I think that should have prompted formal testing.And that's how you sort of tease out whether these are just sort of normal kind of changes. A lot of people mistake names, or you're thinking about someone else, and maybe you say that name, as opposed to the person's true name, ike perhaps we saw a little while ago with the president and President Zelenskyy, but that's where formal testing comes into play.

And they think this is an existential election.So, I think with all the affection and all the respect for the president, I think the number one priority of most Democrats is to win in November and defeat Donald Trump.

I don't think I've ever been more kind of disappointed at our inability to circle the wagons that are inability to have these conversations that are not aired publicly on CNN or in Politico or New York Times or Wall Street Journal. I think that we are highlighting one of our greatest faults as Democrats in this country, which is when you have an op-ed piece by George Clooney, for example. But George Clooney has never talked to LaTosha Brown or Cliff Albright. He probably doesn't even know who they are from Black Voters Matter, who are actually doing the real work, the people who are knocking on doors, who are registering voters.And what we're doing is we're highlighting that disconnect within our party. Something, and some -- that was -- it took someone like Barack Obama to bring those factions together and whomever, if President Biden is someone who steps aside when Kamala Harris assumes that role, if that's the case, then she may be somebody who can unify that. But my disappointment lies in the inability for us to lead this country at a time where we need to, to be able to keep our business outside of the tabloids, to want to run to Morning Joe in the morning and sit down across from him and continue to bastardize the president of the United States, to have these disconnects, like we saw yesterday from our former leader. I mean, I'm just disappointed from top down and what we're going to have to have between now and then is someone who comes in and is able to unify this party along that line, because all of us are working towards beating Donald Trump in November, whether or not it's Kamala Harris or Joe Biden.",

Get your act together. I do not want the chaos. And what we're about to bring on our own party, I'm afraid, it's chaos. And, hopefully, Kamala Harris can soothe that.",

But that's not enough for Joe Biden to win the election if he loses a substantial percent of white voters, a substantial percent of suburban voters, those folks in the middle, if they decide to stay home, because they have very serious questions about the president's cognitive abilities and overall health. I think the campaign had a matter of days to respond to this.The fact that they waited more than a week raises the question in the minds of people who are skeptical about the president's health. Why did they wait so long? Are they actually worried about the president's ability to stand before a pool of journalists? Are they hiding something from us? That's the worst thing you want for voters to formulate in their minds. And, again, if, if those are the questions that a campaign is wrestling with, as a strategist, I'm a Republican, I'm sort of stepping out of this, watching my Democratic friends try to figure this out, at some point, you have to make the decision, we need to change the captain of this ship because we're not headed in the right direction.

Just moments from now, at 7:00 p.m., he's set to meet with the prime minister of Hungary, Viktor Orban. And I find that meeting to be very notable comes right off the heels of Orban being in D.C. for this NATO summit, but also of Orban meeting with a series of foreign leaders in recent weeks. Earlier this month, he went -- he met with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, and then earlier this month as well, he met with Putin, Russia President Vladimir Putin in Russia. And just Monday, he met with Xi Jinping in China. So all of this coming out a very interesting time, I think it's worth noting one that Orban has said that he believes Donald Trump will win, but also, we know that Donald Trump has consistently touted his relationship with Orban on the trail. He's praised him, called him a boss at times, at a meeting when he met with him in March, praising his ties to him. And so, I think it's very notable that this is coming particularly on the sidelines of this NATO summit -- Wolf.",

Now, compare that to Donald Trump, who by the same point in his presidency, held, held almost twice as many news its conferences. According to data from the University of California at Santa Barbara's American presidency project, Trump at this point in his presidency, had held 64 news conferences, 16 of them were solo. Now with Trump's events though, there is a bit of a caveat. He held many news conferences in the context of a unique situation. Many of Donald Trump's news conferences like this one were called to update the public on efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. But President Biden's numbers are still stark compared to his other predecessors. Now, by this time, in his presidency, Barack Obama had held 72 news conferences, 32 of those were solo news conferences. George W. Bush at this time in his presidency, we're talking three- and-a-half years in, well, he had held 82 news conferences, 15 of those were solo. The recent presidents who held fewer news conferences than Joe Biden at this point in their terms, while those were two of them, Ronald Reagan with 25, Richard Nixon with 24 -- Wolf.",
