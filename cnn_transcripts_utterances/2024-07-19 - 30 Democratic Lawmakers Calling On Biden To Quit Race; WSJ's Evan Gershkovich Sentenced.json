      "sentences": "Calls from Democrats telling Joe Biden to step aside, you see here they are growing louder. They are growing more numerous. The number right now standing at 30 lawmakers.And there are other calls as well. And some of those calls are coming from inside the House, the White House, to be exact, in the Biden campaign where many senior officials believe the president, their boss, must abandon his reelection bid. But the Biden campaign has developed a case of selective deafness, and it is proceeding in a bit of a denial mode today with a new memo. Battleground state director, Dan Cannon, in writing this, that \"There is no plan for an alternative nominee.\" He says, \"We also have immense opportunity and a clear path to victory.\" And he goes on to say, \"I will not sugarcoat the state of the race. We have our work cut out for us this -- to win this November.\" But as we said, many Democrats believe that Biden has already lost. And here is why. A new CBS/YouGov poll from last night conducted after Saturday's assassination attempt, and you see it here, Trump up 52 to 47 percent over Biden nationally. Of course, this election is won or lost in battleground states. And the picture there is also bleak. Look at these seven key states. Trump is now ahead in four. He is ahead in the other three, but it is within the margin of error there. So that is a statistical tie in those states. Do note, though, Biden's doing worse than he was in the spring. So you see there, public polls flashing red. Well, so, too, are internal polls. CNN has obtained polling from Democratic donors that shows, post-debate, Biden is losing ground to Donald Trump in 14 key states across the country. That includes the five that Biden flipped against Trump in 2020, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. And we should note that partisan polling does not meet CNN standards, but it's important to look at this because this is the window into the alarming data that the party is looking at and certainly is putting stock in. There's a research firm, another research firm, well-respected in Democratic circles, and it has a warning. It is saying that \"Defending Biden's fitness for office is an untenable position for down-ballot Democrats.\" That they're worried that it will be viewed as dishonest because, quote, \"concerns about the -- about President Biden's fitness for office are pervasive among voters.\" And then look at this poll out this week. A 65 percent majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaning Independents say that Joe Biden should withdraw and allow his party to select a different candidate. It is a big and growing number, or as the Biden campaign calls it, quote, \"some slippage in support.\" (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAN O'MALLEY DILLION, BIDEN-HARRIS CAMPAIGN CHAIR: It has been a small movement. And -- and you know this. The reason is because so much of this race is hardened already. The American people know that the president is older. They -- they see that. They knew that before the debate. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Oh, absolutely not. But then they would, wouldn't they? There's only one person who can make this decision, and it's President Biden. And they're all going to deny that anything is going to happen or that decision will be made in the negative. That is, he will drop out.Until the moment he makes it and then they set up the announcement. And of course, he should be the one to announce it. So it's not surprising that they would all deny it. What is surprising is there appears to be no real movement under the cover as to what is going on and how this election can be revived for the Democratic Party. And let's remember, if this were a normal Republican, if this weren't Donald Trump, and you had one of the normal Republicans that used to get the Republican nomination, I think probably this election would be effectively over, in the Republican's direction. But because it's Donald Trump, it's easier for President Biden and his staff to convince themselves that, well, there's no way, in the end, that people will elect Donald Trump. And we're all reminded of other circumstances where -- I remember one in 1980 when Jimmy Carter was up for reelection and they all said, and his staff, no way will the country elect Ronald Reagan. He's too far to the right. And we know the ending of that. They did elect Ronald Reagan, quite handily. And then reelected him by more in 1984. So you can convince yourself with anything you want to. But the reality is Donald Trump, thanks to the Electoral College, at least, can win another term.",

JASON REZAIAN, \"WASHINGTON POST\" OPINION WRITER: Boris, when I hear the sentencing, if you swap out the name, Evan with Jason and Russia with Iran, it's exactly the same story that I was subjected to almost a decade ago. And, you know, it's heartbreaking, on the one hand, to get this news. On the other hand, the whole situation, the entire procedure was an absolute farce. Up until this point, we knew that a sentence would be coming. And I want to remind people that this is not a court like the sort of thing we recognize in the free world. And ultimately, there had to be a sentence to move the ball forward. So I'm hoping that there's some -- some action on a swap or some other kind of release very soon.",

And I think that although the circumstances in the relationship between Russia and the U.S. has maybe never been at a lower point than it is right now, as we've seen with the release of Brittney Griner or Trevor Reed and others, the conversations are ongoing. Things can still happen. I just hope that Evan and Paul Whelan, who's been held for more than five years, also, Kurmasheva, a Radio Free Europe journalist, and my colleague, Vladimir Kara-Murza, a political prisoner in Russia, also being arbitrarily detained by the state, I hope that they are all released very soon.

If you can't, you're lost. And the other thing -- and I think I can glean this from looking at images of Evan before and after, and myself before and after -- staying physically active, keeping your body in motion, getting exercise, even in those tightly cramped circumstances. And I'm also very heartened to hear that Evan has the opportunity to receive letters and write letters to the outside world, something that I didn't have the benefit of. But he also has books.
