JOHNSTON, PROSECUTOR: When someone plays, make believe with a real gun in a real-life workplace, and while playing make believe with that gun, violates the cardinal rules of firearms safety, people's lives are endangered and someone could be killed.

He knew that the armor, Hannah Gutierrez Reed, was inexperienced and that he should have been responsible for checking this gun. They said -- as we saw in that clip that you played, they said that even though this is a movie set, this isn't make believe. It's real life. Then if we go to the defense, in their opening statement, they are saying that this is a movie set and our client, Alec Baldwin, is an actor. It's not his job to check the gun. We have a clip. Let's take a look at what one of his lawyers had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That's why the gun has to be safe before it gets into the actor's hands.His mind is somewhere else, in the being of another a century away, an outlaw. He must be able to take that weapon and use it as the person he's acting would. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And that checking the gun would have been the responsibility of the armor and also of the assistant director.Now, you'll remember that earlier this week in a pretrial hearing, there was a big legal victory for Baldwin when the judge ruled that his role as a producer cannot come up. Now why this is significant is because the prosecution was intending to say that, as the producer, Baldwin did bear more responsibility for safety on that set. What we're seeing today is that direct result of that legal victory, which is that Baldwin's defense is really relying on the fact that he is an actor and that's what they're drilling into.",

      "sentences": "So Boris, that's important. Because it goes to the fact that you're acting and it distinguishes the issues the prosecution was raising in terms of the cardinal rules of a workplace.This is not a normal workplace, and you have to, I think, judge someone's conduct consistent with context, consistent with their environment, consistent with their role, consistent with their responsibilities. And what the defense is arguing, Boris, that he had every right, being an actor of another -- an actor of this era, right, mirroring or acting from someone from another era, to reasonably rely upon the gun safety measures of others. And if someone hands you a gun and says \"cold gun,\" right, why would you have any reason to believe that it was otherwise loaded, that it was otherwise operable, that it was otherwise capable of taking a life. So I think it's going to be critical as the jury evaluates this to determine whether he was responsible. And also the point to be made, he said repeatedly -- that is Alec Baldwin who is, of course, accused -- that he never put his -- his hand on the trigger, his finger on the trigger. I think, to the defense argument, if you buy it, it wouldn't matter. Because whether he put his finger on the trigger or not, he had the ability to believe and to know, as an actor from another generation, that he was simply acting. The gun was cold and that no projectile would come out of it, much less hit someone, much less kill them. Those are going to be the issues for the jury's determination.",

CNN's Alayna Treene is joining us now. Alayna, he's now -- look, they've -- Republicans have been going after Kamala Harris since the primary. But it really seems like he's doubling, even tripling down on that. ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTER: Yes. And I will note as well though that over the past year or so, Donald Trump's team has largely tried to ignore Kamala Harris. As soon as she became the vice president and they knew that Joe Biden is the person that will be at the top of the ticket that he would be fighting, they've really trained most of their attacks on him. So this is a change in posture. And it clearly shows, and I can tell you from my conversations with Trump's team, this is how they're feeling. They are monitoring this the situation very heavily, privately, and watching like the rest of the world to what's going to happen and whether Joe Biden will step aside. Now, he did have very harsh words for her. I want you to take a listen to exactly what he told the crowd last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE (R): But whatever else can be said about Crooked Joe Biden, you have to give him credit for one brilliant decision, probably the smartest decision he's ever made.

That's part of his -- his way of attacking her.But look, I can tell you from my conversations with the campaign that they really do want Joe Biden to continue on as the candidate. There are concerns about him stepping aside. And part of that is because they've spent millions of dollars on modeling, on gathering data, months of advertising focused mainly on one single person, and that's Joe Biden. And so if he does ultimately step aside or is forced to step down and someone else is at the top of the Democratic ticket, it really throws Trump's campaign into uncertainty for the next four months. And so whether they say that publicly or not is a different issue. But they are currently delighting in the fact that Joe Biden is hanging on and saying that he's not planning to step aside.",

Human spaceflight is not easy in any regime. And there have been multiple issues with every spacecraft that has ever been designed. And that's the nature of what we do. You know, that mantra you've heard that failure is not an option, that's why we are staying here now. We did have some degradation in our thrusters and we know that.

And that's used to orient and point the capsule in the right direction.They also have some large Omax (ph) engines that are used to actually de-orbit the capsule to get it back to earth. So when the capsule undocks, it'll turn around backwards, fire the larger thrusters, the Omax (ph) thrusters, and come back. The small thrusters, the RCS, failed during the docking. And the problem is, when it comes back to earth, the capsule with the crew on board is going to separate from the service module. The capsule will come back safely with the heat shield and a parachute. And the service module is going to burn up. So they won't have the thrusters to look at and analyze. They won't have the helium tanks that had some leaks to look at. They need to keep it on the space station for as long as they need to get the data they need for this separation and the service module burns up.",

So the next flight is supposed to be what we call an operationalflight. It'll have four astronauts. It'll be a normal rotation taking astronauts to and from the station. So they really want that big giant certification stamp so that they can consider the vehicle operational. So I think they're taking as long as they need to make sure they can get that certification. If there was an emergency, we just heard in the press conference, the crew would jump in, close the hatch and come back to earth. And I don't think there will be any -- no one expects any problems at all. But they do want that certification stamp.

But we didn't know how long we were going to be there. And we were kind of low on supplies because the cargo ships, several had blown up. So I was in a similar situation. We used the best of it. I helped film an IMAX movie called \"A Beautiful Planet.\" I just use it as some bonus time in space. And it was a little bit stressful and concerning for the family. You know, they had summer plans. But in the big picture, the big scheme of things, they want to make sure they're safe. And these two astronauts are going to be more than happy to get a few extra weeks in space.
