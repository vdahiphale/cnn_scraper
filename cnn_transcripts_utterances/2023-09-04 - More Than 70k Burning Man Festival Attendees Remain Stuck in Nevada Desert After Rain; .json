The search intensifying this morning after the convict was caught on a home surveillance camera.And Ukraine's Defense Minister fired. President Zelenskyy sacking him in the middle of a crucial counteroffensive. Hi there, welcome to a special holiday edition of EARLY START, I'm David Culver. We start with what is anything but a relaxing holiday weekend for tens of thousands of people at the Burning Man Festival in the Nevada desert. They are trapped in a sea of mud this morning. What a mess out there. They're waiting for organizers to give the all-clear to exit the site. That is expected to happen sometime today. A huge downpour Friday and Saturday transformed the dry desert dirt into thick clay-like mud that traps boots, bicycles and RVs alike. Organizers of the annual encampment asked attendees to shelter-in- place and to conserve food, water and fuel, and a banned travel by anything, but emergency vehicles. It also postponed plans to set fire to the iconic burning man effigy until tonight. Police out there also investigating one death at the festival. A 40-year-old man, but organizers say it was unrelated to the weather. Despite the tough conditions, many attendees, they are keeping positive. They say that they're coping with harsh conditions, and that's part of the point of Burning Man, and they came prepared. CNN's Camila Bernal is on the ground at Burning Man. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN NATIONAL REPORTER (on camera):  It is still muddy, it is still messy for thousands of people who are stranded here in Black Rock City. Where we are right now is the main entrance and exit point to the festival. So thousands are expected to exit here on Monday. We saw many cars trying to get out because this is the entrance of the playa. So here behind me is where people are getting stuck in that mud. And I want to show you what that mud, that cakey mud looks like. This is what a lot of people are walking hours in. And you're seeing it in their shoes, they're covered in this mud is what you're seeing on this bike. It makes it impossible for not just bikes, but also for cars and RVs. Here, behind me, this RV, they told me that they were stuck here for hours trying to get out of the mud. So it is difficult to get out, and the concern, of course, is for people who did not bring enough supplies, enough food, enough water and need to get out. Here's one person that I talked to, who told me, she just needed to get out today.",

Around I did get a little bit of a hitchhike into -- in the back of someone's truck. But yes, it's just really thick, dense mud. So wherever it's wet, it's just heavy and sticky and it's a real sloppy mess out there. Most everything's turned off, but there's still some people partying.",

Reznikov has been able to develop strong relationships with his western allies, he's been able to develop friendships with the United States. Now, dismissed at a very critical moment.You might remember that it was just a few days ago that Ukraine claimed a success on the battlefield. That says it's been able to pierce through the first line of defense along the southern front, south of Zaporizhzhia. But this dismissal is part of something, a trend we've seen for months now from President Zelenskyy who's been trying to clamp down on corruption. You may remember at the  beginning of the year, a slew of senior officials were fired after a scandal over the procurement of war-time supplies. In the wake of that, the deputy defense minister resigned in August of this year, the local heads, the regional heads of every single military recruitment office in Ukraine were fired. The important thing to remember is that Ukraine has long struggled with issues of corruption. In fact, President Zelenskyy campaigned, his presidential campaign was about rooting out corruption in Ukraine. And indeed, he believes it is important to root out corruption, in order to join the European community, the European Union and NATO. But again, this is coming at a super critical time on those frontlines. A major change in one of the most significant characters, the most significant post in the handling of this conflict, and the replacement for this defense minister is going to be very immediately, under pressure to ramp-up that counteroffensive, bring results as soon as possible, David.",

The August jobs report shows that the U.S. economy added 187,000 jobs in August, slightly more than expected, but a slowdown from the past two years of job growth. The unemployment rate also ticked up slightly, from 3.5 percent in July to 3.8 percent in August.Helping us break all of this down, Kayla Bruun; an economic analyst at the Morning Consult, hey, Kayla, good morning, thanks for being with us. So, how do you think the Fed interprets these numbers. When we look back over the past year and a half or so, we've seen eleven rate hikes.

Some of that may have been tied to discounting things like Amazon Prime, but still a positive for retailers to see that big boost in spending.And as you mentioned, the slower inflation I think really has helped purchasing power for some consumers, but in our data at Morning Consult, it has tended to be more younger consumers and wealthier consumers, those who are a little bit less price sensitive, who have been driving a lot of the strong spending recently. One concern with that is that, heading into the Fall, there are a lot of headwinds, no one had -- we have higher interest rates, we also have the student loan pause ending, so things like that, I think are going to start to tamp down spending. Not to mention the fact that many may have splurged a little bit more in the Summer. We may see that, that was a bit of a pull-forward that could potentially come at the cost of things like the holiday season.",

There's sort of a couple of ways, that I could see this adding a lot of strain on those households. When it comes to Gen Z, these are younger consumers, they haven't been working as long, they haven't had as much time to build up savings buffers.So them being hit by having to repay these debts, that just might change their monthly expenses quite a bit, and they don't have as much of a kind of a cushion to absorb that blow. When it comes to millennials, these are consumers who do more often tend to be in their prime working years, but because they haven't been paying their student debt loans or their student debt repayments for the past few years, and I believe they've been sort of living as if they don't have these debts taking on things like auto loans, mortgages, just adding more expenses to their life. Add on top of that, another payment, it might just be a lot of burdens coming from all directions.",

What are you going to do? You have to be that evidence. And Mark Meadows wants his evidence, and in some cases and very often, his own worst evidence. But you have to do it, it's a desperate, you know, attempt and effort to make something happen that otherwise, there is no chance of happening. Even now, it's very slim in my opinion.",

He needs to move this, because otherwise, what will happen is, he's going to get fingers pointed at him from the bottom, who are going to be sitting in those chairs next to him, saying that guy and that guy's team, meaning the president and his attorneys are the ones who told me to do these things.And why he also wants to server this is, he just wants to have his own trial. There's a lot that he may not directly have his hands on, that this evidence will come out, and he doesn't want to be -- court brought in that either. It's much easier for him to be separate. And I will just add as well, he also wants to have this removed from state court into federal court like Meadows, because he wants to avoid the cameras because of deniability. And I can get in front of my own camera later on to make my statements. But he wants to avoid the cameras in the courtroom to show the actual evidence, is one of the great reasons, and obviously, as we heard before, he wants to have greater, larger jury pool, not just Fulton County that's potential blue residents.",
