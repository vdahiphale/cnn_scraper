Trump's former Defense Secretary will react. Harris is also launching a major new campaign push, tonight, aimed at shoring up support from Black men, just days after former President Barack Obama sounded the alarm. And at least six new accusers, tonight, are filing lawsuits against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, claiming -- claims that are ranging from rape and sexual assault, to drugging drinks as well. One of the allegations even involving a then-16-year-old boy. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. We start with politics tonight, though, as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are holding dueling events, in what could be the place that decides it all, in just a few weeks from now. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. On stage, just a few moments ago, the Vice President just used the former President's words against him, after he suggested using the U.S. military, on Election Day, to go after what he called bad, sick and radical left lunatics. In other words, his political opponents. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He's talking about the enemy within Pennsylvania. That he considers anyone who doesn't support him, or who will not bend to his will, an enemy of our country. He is saying that he would use the military to go after them. We know who he would target, and we know who he would target, because he has attacked them before. Journalists, whose stories he doesn't like. Election officials, who refuse to cheat by filling extra votes and finding extra votes for him. Judges, who insist on following the law instead of bending to his will. This is among the reasons, I believe so strongly, that a second Trump term would be a huge risk for America and dangerous. (CHEERING) (APPLAUSE)",

When Trump was asked, yesterday morning, on Fox News if he thought that there would be chaos on Election Day. He said he wasn't worried about Eddie from his supporters or from bad foreign actors. But then he said this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within. Not even the people that have come in and destroying our country. By the way, totally destroying our country. The towns, the villages, they're being inundated. But I don't think they're the problem in terms of Election Day. I think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they're the -- and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or, if really necessary, by the military. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

So, that's what equally concerns me about his comment would be the use of the military in these types of things. Now, the good news is I don't believe he has the authority, under the law, to use the military, unless there was some type of civil disobedience or insurrection, in which case that would be used, the Insurrection Act. But otherwise, these other roles that he's described in the past are law enforcement, and that is prescribed under the Posse Comitatus Act. So, he would not be able to use it. Now, I'm not a lawyer. But this would be a good discussion to have. But my sense is his inclination is to use the military, in these situations. Whereas my view is that that's a bad role for the military. It should only be law -- it should only be law enforcement, taking those actions.",

And I think he's talked about that. His acolytes have talked about that. I think loyalty will be the first litmus test. So yes, of course, it concerns me on many levels, not least of which is, the impact it could have, on American citizens.

But this is where Donald Trump's consistency, over these years, is helpful. We know that he is very consistently tried and talked about, ginned up supporters around, jailing political opponents, targeting political opponents. We know that that's ratcheted up in the last couple years, as he has faced his own legal problems.I don't know if there's a political angle to this more than a person who feels aggrieved by a system. And that's made very clear that, to Sarah's point, in the next term, he would use that system to turn against his opponents. I think what Harris is doing makes a lot of sense. In isolation, it is an attempt for them to recast Donald Trump as extreme, to recreate that anti-Trump coalition that we've seen be strong in the midterms and other previous elections. And I think if you add up the light of -- the statement she's made over the last couple weeks, she's clearly making a play for those disaffected Republicans, the people who voted for Democrats in the midterms, and trying to make a case that she can be a home for them. I think that's a reversal from the kind of 2019, more liberal, progressive posturing that she was doing at that time, and trying to kind of reposition herself as someone who, I think is expecting an electorate that is going to try for Democrats, to recreate the what we have seen be the most consistent political coalition, over the last several years, an anti-Trump one. This is the reason why the Nikki Haleys of the world, the anti-Trump Republicans of the world, think they will be in a better position with a different type of candidate. Because when Donald Trump opens his mouth, on these issues, Americans are reminded of things like January 6, and his kind of extremism on that front.",

We've seen that now we have the lowest recorded unemployment rate amongst African Americans in recorded history. We've seen how Black wealth has increased by 60 percent, since the start of the pandemic. I think what the Vice President is doing right now is, A, we're going out there and reminding people that this is the Biden-Harris administration, and the policies that people saw, from President Biden, that increased Black wealth, that increased, that supported Black entrepreneurship, were policies that were being done by both of them, simultaneously.

And I think that reflects the candidate, who has a pretty difficult task in this election, turning those marginal, low-propensity voters that they need very clearly, to change the scope of this electorate, and activating them to come to the polls. Now, we know that the policy issues, the Trump campaign feels good. They think they win this election, on the economy, on immigration, on crime. When it comes to the personality of the two candidates, that's where he struggles. When it comes to chaos and competency, that's when he struggles. We should not take his kind of cause for a mental acuity test very seriously, because the biggest mental acuity test, I think, happens for candidates, is the type of debates he does not want to do again. And frankly, a lot of people, I think, were in agreement, he didn't perform very well at last time. That's the challenges of this version of the Trump candidacy. And it's honestly the bright spot for a Harris campaign that, frankly, is not on the issue set that it would best prefer.

She did not tell a consistent story about herself and what she believed in. And that is the huge thing that's hung over her, over those last several years. And I frankly, think it's what we've caught up to now. Policy is not just about what you are literally promising. I think most voters, most people, know that the policies a lot of politicians promise, during campaign season, don't really come to pass. What it is, is a signal about your values and what story you're telling about yourself. And this is the where she has struggled. Because I think when it's a bipartisan Council of Republicans, the bear hug of Nick Cheney -- of Liz Cheney and the Dick Cheney family, that's all well and good when it comes to individual targeting of Republicans.

People are probably wondering, Well, isn't that beyond the statute of limitations? Usually it's five years. But the catch here is RICO, the racketeering charges, which prosecutors have brought. And racketeering can enable you, as a prosecutor, to charge conduct that goes way farther back than five years. So, racketeering is a real powerful tool for prosecutors. I once charged a case, involving conduct that went back to 1987, based on racketeering. So, watch for prosecutors to use that here.",
