And it was interesting that President Biden did say in his speech today, when he was talking about the values of human rights, he said, the values of human rights essentially can't be ignored whether they're in Xinjiang, or Toronto. I mean, when does -- when do people start talking about human rights in Toronto?It seemed to me to be he gets what's going on. It seems we also know that the British prime minister as well has talked to the Canadians. And he is also concerned about the allegations that they're making about India. So, it does seem to me that John Kirby not able to speak publicly about what the Five Eyes shares. But I think we can understand that President Biden is aware. TAPPER: Yes, it seems to me that Trudeau wouldn't have said it publicly, unless he was pretty clear and sure of the charge, and that President Biden wouldn't have said that if he hadn't been at least a little familiar with the intelligence.

So, again, an indication there from Kirby that this is something that's important. We'll work with Saudi Arabia on their concerns.And the United States, the reality here is the United States is still the number one preferred choice for Saudi Arabia for security. They want a lot. And this is really seen as a time by MBS when he can get a good bargain from President Biden. President Biden, he assumes wants some sort of legacy, and that would be some sort of Middle East peace would be good. And it does seem that MBS sees this moment in time as an opportunity that he needs as well, because he needs that pat on the back, if you will, for the United States as support. He needs to show his country because his father is not well, and he will soon be king one day that he can deal with the United States effectively for the security of Saudi Arabia. There's a mutual interest there, and I think John Kirby was reflecting that interest. I think his language really spoke to the fact that the days of the President Biden's inaugural speech and what he said about Saudi Arabia then being a pariah, that was then, now is different.",

And it is not a problem of Ukraine that it is facing only today. This is a problem, which has existed in Ukraine for many years when can say for 10s of years. And it is my personal belief that Volodymyr Zelenskyy when only he was elected to the office of the president of Ukraine started right away to fight against it. But the situation is indeed extremely difficult. And it is going to be a very difficult process. It is not easy to defeat corruption. But referring to the previous question, lead everyone look at the history. And whenever there was war in Europe, whenever that war was growing, whenever it was spilling over Europe, the United States sooner or later had to intervene to put an answer to that war. Unfortunately, if the war spilled over too much that American soldiers were coming, I believe nobody wants to say that today in this war. The Russian aggression against your grain has to be stopped. It has to be thwarted, nipped in the bud because that will be the guarantee of pays for future winnings to help Ukraine. We need to help Ukraine to push Russians away from its territory, may they come back to their soil. That is number one.

This new surge of migrant crossings is once again putting a strain on border towns such as El Paso, Texas.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ED LAVANDERA, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Growing lines of migrants cross between official border checkpoints waiting to turn themselves into U.S. border authorities in El Paso. It's hard this mother says carrying a toddler she struggles to feed. This man holds his sign begging for work to buy a bus ticket. Please support me to complete my ticket. There's a growing number of migrants crossing into the United States raising concerns, this could be the early stages of a renewed surge of illegal immigration. In recent days, a crush of people flooded into Mexico southern border and continued north. Large migrant groups have been spotted on trains heading to the U.S. southern border.

Here at this border checkpoint, this border patrol agent just loaded up this van with women and children, they will then be taken to the processing center. And if they're not immediately expelled, they will be given paperwork to show up at a court date, sometime down the road and they move into other parts of the country.And the reasons for, Jake, why this is happening is not exactly clear at this point. We've spent all day speaking with migrants here. And there's a variety of reasons as to why migrants are choosing to cross like this now in a way that we haven't seen since the end of Title 42. A lot of it is disinformation. A lot of it is desperation just tired of waiting on the other side. Jake?",

She had a foundation that had been started by Vincent Astor, her husband, who she was married to and five and a half very unhappy years but he she inherited his, the entire Astor fortune and she devoted it to giving back to New York, which is the city which gave the Astor's their fortune because they own much the land upon which New York was built.I was 13. I didn't know who the Astor's were. I was eating lunch with my mom, this restaurant called Mortimer's, which was like this upper east side society restaurant there was always like a crazy circus of the show. And Brooke Astor walks in, and I thought to myself, who is this little old lady in a very big fur coat, not realizing that the Astor fortune was actually created by beaver fur initially in the 1700s with John Jacob Astor in the bloody trade of beaver pelts. That's how he made his millions initially, and then he funneled it into New York real estate, owning much of the land that New York was built on, as I said. My mom, it turned out didn't like Brooke Astor. And I could tell that instantly when Brooke Astor came over and was introduced to me. And I met her a couple of times over the years, and, you know, there's -- but there was a constant, more consequential meeting when I was working as a waiter at this restaurant years later, when I was 17. And we pass each other. And I said, hello, Mrs. Astor. And she looked at me and almost smiled. And then she saw me I was in my waiter outfit, and she didn't recognize me as Gloria Vanderbilt son, she just thought I was recognized me as a waiter. And she looked basically right through me. And she started to smile. When I said her name, she looked up and then, like, there was a slight curl to smile. And then she saw I was the waiter, and she, it jus -- it changed the expression. And it was a, for me, it was an insignificant moment. And maybe she was just having a bad day. So I don't mean to make her sound to be terrible, because she did remarkable things for the city. But to me, it was a really important moment because it was sort of a reminder of something which I already knew, which was the privilege that I had of being, you know, when I was in the company and my mother, I was treated one way when I was waiting tables, I was treated very differently by many of the people who I knew or had met, who just didn't recognize me as their waiter. And it made me really think about, you know, what side of the table I want it to be on or if I want it to be at those tables at all, which I chose not to be.",
