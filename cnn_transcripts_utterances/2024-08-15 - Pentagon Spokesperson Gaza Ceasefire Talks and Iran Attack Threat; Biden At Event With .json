A top Pentagon spokesperson joins us live this hour with an update on the talks and the ongoing threat of an Iranian attack on Israel.Also tonight, President Biden declares Kamala Harris will make one hell of a president, his words, as they team up on stage for the first time since he left the 2024 race. But sources reveal he's privately feeling some bitterness about his exit. And Donald Trump declares he's entitled to unleash personal attacks on Vice President Harris. We're breaking down his news conference and how far he veered off message or away from the facts. Welcome to our viewers in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv and you're in The Situation Room. We begin this hour with the urgent Gaza ceasefire and hostage talks underway here in the Middle East. A second round of negotiations now expected in the hours ahead. CNN's Chief National Security Correspondent Alex Marquardt is joining us from Washington. CNN's Jeremy Diamond is in Northern Israel, in Haifa for us. Jeremy, what do we know about what happened in the talks today and what can we expect tomorrow?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, the negotiations in Doha ended a few hours ago after several hours of negotiations, but we don't have many details about what kind of progress they made and certainly no announcements about any kind of imminent deal. But they are still talking and that perhaps is the biggest announcement that we can get out of these negotiations so far.The Israeli delegation that flew to Qatar earlier today is remaining in Doha overnight. They will resume negotiations tomorrow morning as they continue to try and push towards some kind of a deal that could bridge the difference between Israel's position and Hamas' position. And we do know, Wolf, that the differences between the two sides are indeed substantial. Now, despite the fact that Hamas is not in the room there, the Egyptian and Qatari mediators are continuing to engage with Hamas representatives in Doha as well. An Israeli source I spoke with tonight wouldn't provide many details on what happened inside of the room. And, frankly, Wolf, that speaks to the delicate moment that we are at. We have seen in previous rounds of negotiations, when things are close, when things are sensitive, there is a desire to try and keep as much as they can inside of that room. And that does appear to be what is happening tonight. In addition to that, I think another critical detail to keep in mind here is the Qatari prime minister, who is intimately involved in these negotiations. He is one of the men in the room. He spoke earlier today with the Iranian foreign minister. They spoke about the talks. He updated him on the status of the talks and they also spoke about what was described as, quote, tensions in the Middle East in that statement. I think that makes very clear, Wolf, that there is a clear connection between the ceasefire negotiations, the tensions in the region, and also the fact that if there is progress, if there is potentially a deal on the table to be had, it will have impacts far beyond Gaza in this region.

And I'll remind you, and as you know, since you're there in the region, we're really focused on lowering temperature in the region. We want to see de-escalation. That's why we've positioned a carrier strike group in the central command area of responsibility.

And that is because U.S. forces knitted together with Israeli forces and our partners and allies all came together to defend Israel. So, that's really a calculation that Iran is going to have to make and one that I certainly can't predict, but what I can tell you is what we're doing on our force posture. And that's why you're seeing the Lincoln coming in soon. You're seeing we have another carrier strike group already in the region. You're seeing our destroyers moving closer to Israel.

But if that were to happen -- that's why we are there. We are there to support in Israel's defense and everything that we're doing is defensive in nature.And it is sending a message to Iran, again, that we don't want to see this widen out to a regional conflict. We want to see tensions de- escalate, and most importantly, as we were talking about at the top, is to see that ceasefire deal really come into effect so we can also bring our hostages home.",

So, we'll see what happens on that front.On another issue, Sabrina, while I have you, the death toll in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, has crossed 40,000 people during the course of this war. As senior U.S. officials are telling The New York Times this, and I'm quoting now from The New York Times, Israel has achieved all that it can militarily in Gaza. Continued bombings are only increasing risks to civilians, while the possibility of further weakening Hamas has diminished. So, Sabrina, is that true what The New York Times is reporting, our continued Israeli operations in Gaza, putting civilians at risk with little military gain?",

So, the death toll is too high, Wolf.And so what we need to see to prevent that death toll from growing higher is we need to see the ceasefire deal put into place. And that's what you're seeing the team on the ground they're pushing for. That is the most important thing that we can do to prevent more innocent civilians from getting caught in this war, and also we want to see our hostages returned home. I have to remind you as well, and you know this, Israel does have a right to go after Hamas, but we are seeing a death toll that is too high, and that's something that we continue to engage our Israeli counterparts on.",

That up to this point has been a very successful message, one in which the former president has led, in terms of approval and support for economic plans, throughout the course of this general election campaign.

One argument is based on what they say is the possible interference with the 2024 election. The other argument focuses on the fact that they're still appealing the question of how exactly the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity could apply to this case.Now, when it comes to the election, they're pointing to the fact that early voting in some states happens even right before the sentencing, which is scheduled currently for September 18th. They said in a letter this morning, quote, setting aside naked election interference objectives, there is no valid countervailing reason for the court to keep the current sentencing date on the calendar. There is no basis for continuing to rush. And as you know, they've tried to paint really all four of his criminal cases as some sort of effort to interfere with the election. But they're also -- as I noted, they are still appealing the question of how the Supreme Court's ruling granting former President Trump some immunity in the January 6th case, how that could apply to his New York conviction. They have argued that certain pieces of evidence that were brought in at trial, specifically conversations that Hope Hicks testified about and tweets that he sent out, that under the Supreme Court's ruling, those should be tossed out. It's unclear if the case is going to be tossed out or what the judge will think, but right now, the judge said he will issue his opinion on that on September 16th, and then he's going to sentence Trump on the 18th. His lawyers argue here that it's just not enough time for them to exercise any appellate rights, which is why they're asking for the sentencing to be pushed back.",
