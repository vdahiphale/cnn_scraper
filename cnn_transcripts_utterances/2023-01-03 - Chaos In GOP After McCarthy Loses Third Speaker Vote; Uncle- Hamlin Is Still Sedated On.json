The record is 133 over two months in 1856. No one expects it to go that long this time, but today was still historic and unprecedented in the modern era. It was also a repudiation of McCarthy's powers of persuasion, limited though they are by his slim majority and rebellious membership. All that said, he was assuming it wasn't just putting on a brave face, he still seems to have misjudged his support. In a letter to colleagues over the weekend he signed it Speaker- Designate. The irony being that this was a letter making one concession after another to hardliners to win their votes, which he did not get today. And adding pathos to the irony, Kevin McCarthy had already moved into the Speaker's office, which is customary for any leader of the incoming majority. What is not customary is for that incoming leader to lose a bid for the speakership and then be obliged to move out, which in fairness has not happened yet.

In fact, a lot of those detractors came out of that very tense meeting and said that they were certain to oppose McCarthy and they expected the opposition to grow. At that meeting, McCarthy essentially browbeat these members, urging them to vote for him because he said he made all sorts of concessions, he earned his position and to become Speaker, and ultimately, they should have moved in his direction. They did not move in his direction, and the tension has just grown by the day. In talking to a number of McCarthy allies, they are going after those critics, urging them to be part of the team, but those members are not, at the moment, listening to them. Listen to what these members say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. DAN CRENSHAW (R-TX): They are enemies now. They have made it clear that they prefer a Democrat agenda than a Republican one.

So I absolutely believe it is personal. Look, I challenged John Boehner that when he tried to be Speaker in 2013. We did that because we felt like he was marginalizing the conservative wing of the party. Fast forward almost 10 years, and here is, you know, Kevin McCarthy, trying to make Jim Jordan one of the most conservative members of the Freedom Caucus, a Committee Chairman, something we never would have dreamed about with John Boehner being the Speaker of the House.

Maybe, but it was going to be a weak Speakership anyway, because of the nature of the margin. There is only a five-vote margin on every single piece of legislation. And that's what I think I don't understand are these folks who are opposing Kevin, is they are going to get their chance to be heard on every single rule vote, on every single piece of legislation, on every single House resolution.

And ultimately, you're forcing blood from the heart into the aorta, and that goes throughout the body. When the heart rhythm is abnormal, they call it fibrillation, instead of having normal pumping like this, it starts to fibrillate like this. And that's basically a very ineffective, inefficient amount of pumping. You're not really pumping blood through the body at all.That's the impact of an abnormal rhythm. In this case, something known as ventricular fibrillation. When you apply electricity, defibrillate, use a defibrillator, you can basically try and interrupt that and hopefully get a normal rhythm back to the heart. That's what it sounds like happened to him on the field. Again, as we just learned from Adrienne, that happened again at the hospital.",

But in this case, it sounds like he's still having a significant amount of cardiac dysfunction. His heart's simply not pumping enough blood. So, there's two options here. You want to try and increase the function of the heart, and you can give medicines to try and do that, which I'm sure they're doing.The other thing you can do, and probably it's happening, is you can decrease the demand of the body for that oxygenated blood. So, you want to improve the amount of circulation, but in the interim, you can also decrease the demand by sedating somebody, by keeping them on a breathing machine. Sometimes they'll even use cooling agents, you know, hypothermia, it's called, to basically almost put the body in more of a hibernation like state, so it's not demanding as much oxygenated blood. So that's part of the reason that he'd be on a breathing machine as well. And again, because the fluid is likely had been backing up into his body and including his lungs, it would be hard for him to breathe on his own, and the breathing machine can help facilitate that.",

To be honest, as we talked about last night, hadn't really heard about that happening in football as much.It's a little bit different. But it was there some underlying problem that he had that had not yet been diagnosed. I mean, there have been stories for decades of athletes who've had sudden cardiac arrest, and sometimes you may never really know why there's not an obvious underlying cause that really declares itself. So, you know, we'll see in his case, and we'll see when the doctors do finally give some updates on him, if there is an underlying obvious cause here. But it could be something like that.

The whole nation, or at least the portion of the nation that a football fan saw it because it's the only game. It's Monday Night Football.Something we might point out here, Anderson, is this. This could have happened in theory, rare as it is in any football game. Think of high school teams, almost none of which have the degree of sophisticated personnel and equipment that can be brought to bear at an NFL game with an ambulance on hand, and in a city not in some rural area, perhaps, where you can get him to the best possible medical care quickly.
