Now for the last two weeks, I've been talking to a number of people close to the former president, who said they were ready for this potential indictment. Essentially, they were on pins and needles. But recent media reports saying that the grand jury was going to go on hiatus, that they wouldn't be meeting about this hush money payments case. That made them believe that, one, they had some more time. But two, some of them, some advisers to the former president believed that maybe D.A. Alvin Bragg was actually reconsidering bringing an indictment. So right now, they are coming back out. They have been swinging. We can see that former president Trump is on the offense. He has said that this is a witch hunt a hoax. He has blamed Democrats. He has linked Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, to Joe Biden. This was something that we expected in something we expect to see more of. We also expect to hear from many of Trump's allies who will likely flood the airways attacking Democrats as well as attacking the grand jury and the DA himself. Important to note, of course, that a grand jury made this decision to indict not Alvin Bragg. But that is not going to stop Trump's team from attacking him as part of their plan. Now, the big question is how to get the former president to New York. We know there have been talks about making it some sort of media spectacle. But in reality, many of the aides and advisers we talked to said that it's really going to be up to the Secret Service and up to the NYPD what this looks like. This is an unprecedented event. You have a former U.S. president who has his own Secret Service detail coming into downtown New York. So that is what they're looking at now. How to get him in and out of the city and then what he's going to say afterwards. Who he's going to say it to and win. Kristen Holmes, CNN Washington. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Who believe in equal treatment before the law. And this appears to be just one more example, Wolf, of the kind of two-tiered justice system that the American people have had enough of.

And what are the documents? And what is the supporting information that really allows the grand jury to go forward with this indictment.But based on what we see right now, this is not right. This is unfair, and some have even called this un-American. I've spoken with many Republicans and reading our accounts by many Republicans, and they view this as an extreme overreach by political opponent of Donald Trump. And you can't get much more polar opposite in the Republican Party right now than former President Trump and his chief 2024 rival Ron DeSantis. And both of them have a similar take on this. Donald Trump, his response to this was this is a weaponization of the justice system in order to attack a political rival. Ron DeSantis, the Governor of Florida, says this is a weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda. That is how Republicans are seeing this and there is no way you're going to change their minds. This is what Donald Trump is saying. This is what his friends in the media are saying. And this trickles down to members of Congress are fully in step with this line of thinking. Because they are seeing it for what it is. And this is DA that ran and campaigned on saying that this case would be a top priority for him. And this case, which was passed over by the Federal Election Commission, as well as the Department of Justice, because they didn't see this was worth moving forward on. He take it -- took it upon himself to move forward and he is a strong Democrat. This will be in -- go before a jury and in a very liberal district in New York. And many Republicans view this as nothing more than an attempt to prevent Donald Trump from moving forward in 2024. I hate to say this to them. This is going to embolden his supporters. And look, as a Republican who would love nothing more than Donald Trump to leave the political arena so we can nominate someone that is less toxic than him. I would just love nothing more to see him leave. This is going to embolden him, and I fear it will help him in the primary process. But again, this will be detrimental in a general election.",

      "sentences": "Yes, this story is remarkable for its rarity, first and foremost. This is the first time that an American journalist in Russia has been arrested on espionage charges since 1986 since the Cold War, since before the breakup of the Soviet Union.And so, in that case, the journalists who was arrested his name was Nick Daniloff, he worked for \"U.S. News and World Report,\" and he actually spent only a matter of weeks behind bars rather than months or years. And he said after his release that were it not for the intervention and in his words, very deep and personal interest of then President Ronald Reagan, he would have spent a heck of a lot more time in there. And key to his release was the prisoner swamp of a Russian who had been recently arrested in New York on espionage -- on espionage charges there. The timing in this Gershkovich case is quite interesting because it was less than a week ago, actually, that the U.S. announced it had formally charged a Russian citizen with spying -- with espionage. He was using a fake Brazilian identity to attend university in Washington, D.C. One potential wrinkle there is that this man isn't actually in U.S. custody right now. He's actually in Brazilian custody where he had been arrested on fraud charges there. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, he was asked about this yesterday when he was asked whether this was a tit-for-tat or this was retaliation. He said he didn't have anything to say. But in previous answers, he had said that, look, in his view, Gershkovich had been caught red handed. The Russian foreign ministry also said that at this point it is far too early to talk about any kind of a prisoner swap, prisoner exchange. If you ask the family of Paul Whelan, of course, another American who has been arrested on espionage charges, he spent more than four years behind bars. And, frankly, a statement from his brother yesterday didn't seem all that optimistic about his prospects. Saying, quote, it doesn't seem that the White House does not seem to have found a way to resolve cases like Paul Whelan's of people who are arrested for spying.",
