Has the President eliminated the non-negotiating options? Right, this idea, for instance, of relying on the 14th Amendment. We heard him make some comments over the weekend.

And what's really clear is that it's going to have to come down to an agreement between the Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, and President Biden.And that is reflected in the fact that when you see these leaders sitting down today, it's going to be President Biden and the speaker and their teams. The other congressional leaders who were in the last two meetings this month, they will not be in the Oval Office with the President and the Speaker. And really, these talks come after a pretty turbulent weekend of start and stop negotiations that ultimately culminated in a phone call between President Biden and the Speaker yesterday as President Biden was making his way back on Air Force One, a call that both sides characterize as productive and moving things along. And today, they will now sit down. But as they sit down, Jim, they are still very, very far apart, not only on some of the policy details of what exactly goes into this bill, in terms of work requirements, permitting reform, but even just on that top line, number of how much spending to cut, where to cap spending, how long to cap spending for both sides, still very far apart on that notion. And it comes as the President over the weekend, as he was at this G7 summit being peppered with questions about this not only by reporters, but also by his fellow foreign leaders. He simply could not guarantee that the U.S. will not default. He laid that at the feet of House Republicans and whether or not they will be willing to come to a compromise. But it's certainly clear that any deal that emerges here is going to have to be bipartisan. It's going to have to involve votes from both House Democrats and House Republicans. And that is the tricky balancing act that these two sides are trying to manage. So we will see whether or not this meeting this afternoon leads to that kind of essential progress, but certainly things need to move along. We're just 10 days away from that potential. SCIUTTO: Yes. Listen, both the Speaker and the President have balancing acts within their own party, right, because there's a right- wing of the Republican Party may not agree to any sort of deal or compromise and there's certainly some things the President is considering the people on his left flank do not like. Jeremy Diamond at the White House. All right. So let's go to Capitol Hill with CNN's Melanie Zanona. And Melanie, the Speaker of course brushed off reminders that during Trump's time, they raised the debt ceiling three times without similar complaints. But when I listen to McCarthy there, what was clear to me was he was not given ground on some of these issues, right? Certain work requirements, et cetera. That's a public statement. In private, is there a middle ground that is sort of coming to be - coming in division here or not really?",

That is almost nothing given this ticking time bomb that is threatening to blow up the whole economy.And keep in mind, the Dow was up by like 1,300 points over the last two months. So it's been kind of amazing to see just how calm things on Wall Street are and this is probably because investors have seen this movie before, right? And they know how it ends or at least they think they do, right, with eventually Congress agreeing to raise the debt ceiling. But there is a growing sense from some of the experts in Washington and Wall Street that I'm talking to that some market turmoil might be needed to get something through Congress. And of course, no one wants to see investors panic. But the idea is that if there is some selling in the stock market that might cause lawmakers to take the difficult votes that they don't want to take. Recall in 2008, when the House of Representatives initially rejected tarp, only to come back days later after the market's panic and they went ahead and approved it. So I talked to Mark Zandi, the Moody's chief economist and he told me a selloff in stock and bond markets might be what's required to get donors and voters to pound on lawmakers' door to stop the drama and increase the limit. And remember, the problem isn't just getting Speaker McCarthy and President Biden to agree to a high level of deal. It's what Melanie was just talking about, trying to get the rank and file members from both parties to sign off and that may not be easy. But Boris, none of this is going to increase the popularity of Congress. I mean, this is a manufactured crisis. They waited until the last minute to address it. And even now, they might not actually take action until it does real damage to people's 401K plans first.",

So the interest rates that we pay on our mortgages, our credit card bills, that businesses borrow money and lend money with is all tied to the relative safety of treasury bills.A default is economically problematic, because they're no longer risk free, the government's not paying its bills. The same is true if you attempted to invoke the 14th Amendment, because all of a sudden, you would have the Treasury Department issuing debt that's technically not legally backed by the United States government. It doesn't have the full faith and credit. And a full reading of the 14th Amendment makes that clear. And so the economic consequences, uncertainty, rising interest rates, unemployment, the hit to the stock market would all be the same if you attempted to use the 14th Amendment.",

Today, what I'm worried about is that talks have really just started and they stopped and started, we're now down to 10 days. And you know what, if there were objections on each side, it could almost take a full 10 days for Congress to process it. So what I'm worried about is that one side or the other miscounts the days, miscounts the level of support that they have and that we stumble into a default just because this process didn't start soon enough.",

Now, I know this group, they are called the Freedom of Russia Legion. They are a formed group of some several hundred volunteers fighting under the Ukrainian flag inside the Ukrainian armed forces taking their orders from the Ukrainian Armed Forces. They're a formed unit of the military here and there is no doubt that they crossed the border and conducted this operation. As far as the Ukrainians are concerned, because they're Russian citizens, they can kind of keep them at arm's length with something of a nudge and a wink. [15:20:04] But this group went in, they claim to have and they've sent a drone video to try to prove their point to CNN that shows an attack they say was conducted against the FSB headquarters in a village eight kilometers into the country and indeed taking out a Russian tank there. They've posted other social media pictures of various other attempt claims that they captured a Russian armored personnel carrier, and a wide range of engagements with the Russians. The Russians say that eight people were injured during this process, but also, they say that the village or town eight kilometers in has now been evacuated of civilians, either under their own steam or part of the government's own efforts to get civilians out of the way.
