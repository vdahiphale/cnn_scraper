I want to start by asking you about, you talked a lot in the book about what it meant to be a woman in politics and your path to it had to be slightly complicated. I mean, I've looked this up, but when you went to Wellesley, ivy league colleges were not co-ed. When you went to Yale Law School, it was basically the first year that they had opened it up to women.And so in some ways, you became a political spouse and gained prominence that way. Kamala Harris has done it a different way. And probably benefited from your opening all those doors. Do you think she has a better chance at kind of breaking through that glass ceiling because of that?",

And it felt right. It felt exciting, exhilarating. I think she is not only absolutely equipped and ready to be president, I think we need somebody like her right now, Fareed.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, I write about and obviously I've talked and thought a lot about this. I think there are a number of reasons. I think that people have high expectations for their own lives and for the leaders that they invest themselves in and if you are disappointed or feel like you're falling short or worried that your children will not do better than you did, it's natural to be somewhat unmoored and leaders can appeal to you in one of two ways.And I've seen both. I've seen leaders who say, yes, you know what, we have problems. I want you to be involved in helping to fix them. I want to empower you. I want to create the tools you need to chart a better life for yourself and your family. Or you have leaders saying, you know what, it's rigged against, you deserve better, you've lost that job to name the minority groups or immigrant or minority of whatever kind that is getting an unfair advantage. So I'm giving you an explanation for why you feel stuck or disappointed. You know, historically, America has fallen in the first category. It's like, OK, go west if you're not happy where you are. You have mobility to go find a job. I was saying to you before we started. You know, my father hopped a freight train in Scranton, Pennsylvania, because he heard there might be a job in Chicago during the Great Depression. You know, there was an energy and an optimism that has really marked who we are but the combination of demagogic leaders like Trump who appeal to the fears, not the hopes, the fears and social media, which can spread all sorts of conspiracy theories, alternative explanations, alternative facts, about, you know, why things aren't going as well as you would like them to go, or what can be the explanation for that. So I think there's a social, political, cultural, and technological set of reasons that add up to the political differences. ZAKARIA: You're talking about how important it was for you to take on women's issues and by women's issues, I mean, helping women with their healthcare, with their childcare. And you were frustrated throughout your career that these were seen as women's issues and not society's issues. And yet they had a huge impact on society at large.",

They're society issues, economic issues, and a lot of these issues like childcare, paid family leave, have been dismissed for way too long as kind of, you know, side issues, women's issues. But the evidence is overwhelming that we are making it so difficult for families to balance their work life and their family responsibilities, and if you are concerned about the falling birth rate, if you're concerned about increasing productivity, if you are concerned about how we need to be supporting the most important job in society, which is raising children, then you should be in favor of things like paid family leave and early childhood education.",

And every marriage I'm aware of has ups and downs, not public hopefully for everyone else. And you have to make the decisions that are right for you. And I would never tell anybody else. Stay in a marriage, leave a marriage, whatever the easy answer is.And you know, for me and for us, I think it's fair to say we are so grateful that at this stage of our life, we have our grandchildren, we have our time together. You know, I write about how we start the morning playing spelling bee in bed, and you know, Bill is like such a great player. He gets to queen bee almost immediately, it feels like. We just have a good time. We have a good time sharing this life that we've lived together for now nearly 50 years of marriage. That's what is right for us and that's really my message. You know, I write in the book, how during one of the darkest periods, during the impeachment, I had to almost have a binary view of the world that I was living in, my reality. On the one hand, I was deeply hurt, deeply confused, really upset, angry. And on the other hand, I knew that this was a political ploy to try to drive, you know, Bill out of office. And I thought he'd been a really good president, and I resented that as an American citizen that these hypocrites who, you know, had all kinds of their own stories about, you know, marriage and everything else, were going after him because of a very unfortunate, you know, incident in his life. So on the one hand, I'm trying to make a decision about my life, my marriage, my future, my child, my family, which only I could make. On the other hand, I saw the hypocrisy and cruelty of what those Republican members of Congress were doing and that is a reality that people on the outside could never have understood. And, you know, obviously I got tons of unsolicited advice from all sorts of observers but my friends, and I have a whole chapter in there about how incredibly grateful I am to my friends, friends of a lifetime, friends, you know, that have stood with me, have supported me, who during that dark periods showed up at the White House to be with me. And I, you know, I had a different kind of set of challenges. I mean, it's always hard if there's a problem in your marriage, you feel like it's your entire world but in my case, it was the world. So I had to go through it at my own pace, on my own terms, according to my own values. And I'm very grateful that we are where we are.",

But then it triggered a military operation that has reached the level of deaths and destruction that I do not remember in any other in my lifetime.

Because, I mean, many people say the two-state solution is becoming not possible because you have the settlements that are moving on, more and more areas grabbed in the West Bank by both settlers and by the authorities.
