And you know, employees are going to have to keep up with him. He wakes up at 4 in the morning every day, has said that his work is his life, which is an interesting kind of sentiment coming at a time when more people are focused on work- life balance. He was also the CEO of PF Chang's and came in during the pandemic in 2020. And we see sales increase the last couple of years. So did a good job kind of turning around PF Chang's. But is going to have his work cut out for him here at Red Lobster.",

So last year, they had about 650 stores. Now they're down to about 540 stores, so nearly 100 store closures. And you know, Red Lobster is about double the size of PF Chang's, so it's going to be a more difficult challenge for Adamolekun.One thing, of course, though, he's going to have to avoid is the endless shrimp deal, that endless shrimp deal last year, which cost Red Lobster about $11 million in losses. So you know, Adamolekun is going to have to stay away from that. He's got a little playbook to work with. Customers love the all-you-can-eat shrimp, but certainly very difficult for the bottom line.",

This is promising news for anyone wanting to try the drug, but who can't afford it. Eli Lilly says the move to single vials will actually allow for much greater supply of Zepbound amid shortages brought on by its high popularity.We have CNN's Jacqueline Howard with us now on this story. All right, so how much is this going to cost and who would qualify for a discount here?",

      "sentences": "Well, Brianna, this is specifically for patients who are paying the full out-of-pocket cost. And these are for patients who did not qualify for Eli Lilly's assistance program. Now, how much these new starter doses will cost?We know that the four-week supply for a supply of 2.5 milligrams in each vial, that will be $399. A four-week supply of vials containing five milligrams will be $549. These costs are much lower than what the original list price was for Zepbound, which was $1,059.87. So these are the differences we're talking about here. And with these weight loss drugs, you typically start with a smaller dose. So the 2.5 milligrams would typically be the starter dose, and then you work your way up to a larger dosage. But Brianna, this is Eli Lilly's answer to try to meet that high demand that we're seeing among patients and to make their drug more accessible when it comes to costs specifically for those patients who, again, don't qualify for the assistance program. With similar weight loss drugs like semaglutides, you see on the screen here, prescriptions for semaglutides, they went up 40-fold in the past five years. That's the kind of demand that we're seeing when it comes to these popular diabetes and weight loss drugs -- Brianna.",

So the judge has determined there will be a retrial on all of the original charges, but the defense had asked to dismiss at least some of the charges because several of the jurors came up to them following the mistrial that was declared, saying, you know, when we were in that room, we voted as a unit for acquittal on second-degree murder and leaving the scene of a deadly accident. And she shouldn't be retried on this, these jurors told the defense.And so the defense says she shouldn't be retried, but the problem is the jurors never told the court. There was nothing in writing. They put nothing on the verdict form. No one, prosecution or defense, asked any questions when the jury came in saying we cannot reach a resolution of unanimity in this case. And so the judge has determined it will go forward with all three charges. Now, the defense can appeal this ruling and all odds are they will appeal this ruling to higher courts in Massachusetts. So whether the late January date will stand or not, or if it will be retried with all of the counts is left to be determined, but this is an aggressive defense team. And I don't think that they will just allow that trial court ruling to be the final one.",

And when you put them in sentences, look at some of the exact phrases that he has said about Donald Trump during this period of time, when he has really gone on the attack and said, this is not a man who's suited to be president -- I think we're going to bring those up. Everybody knows the difference between leadership and bullying. That's what he said back in 2018. And President Trump has a weakness for swamp creatures, especially corporate monopolies. They're lobbyists and they're money. He said that in June. What are you saying? Donald Trump has failed in his mission to drain the swamp and do all of these things. In fact, it is such an about face from where he is that you find yourself saying, yes, I understand the family. I understand anybody saying, how did you get here?

Her father heard about it. They rushed out to the beach where he chain sawed off the head of the whale, having some interest in skull formation or something, strapped it to the top of their van, and then went riding down the road with, as she described it, this disgusting whale juice running down the car while people rode by flipping them off. That's the story of the whale. He's got a bunch of peculiar animal stories in his background. Now there are groups out there saying, wait a minute, this should be prosecuted. You can't collect parts of whales and go carrying them around. The main thing about this is, main thing about this is, whatever Trump's team think they get out of pulling him as an ally and talking about him as maybe a cabinet member, that sort of thing, this does nothing to shoo away that cloud of weird that has been attached to their team.
