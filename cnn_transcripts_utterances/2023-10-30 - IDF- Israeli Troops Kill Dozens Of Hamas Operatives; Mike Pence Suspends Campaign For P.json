It says an Israeli aircraft guided by ground troops hit a Hamas staging post with more than 20 militants inside. The IDF says a guided fighter jet also struck near a university where troops have identified armed terrorists and an anti-tank missile launching post.Let's bring back CNN's Rafael Romo in Tel Aviv. Rafael, a CNN analysis has found Israeli troops have advanced more than two miles into Gaza as part of the second stage of this war against Hamas. What do you expect in the coming hours and days?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. What I can tell you is what the IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said just about 30 minutes ago. And what he said is that this is only going to intensify. They're going to bring in more troop -- more troops and additional forces that will enter the Gaza Strip, and they did so overnight. And the activity will only grow more intense in the coming hours and days.Let me read a statement of what he said. He said, \"We are operating an expanded ground operation moving toward the terrorists. While the terrorists were centralized at compounds and then we attack from the air. This is how we attack dozens of terrorists. We move from the ground and then we attack from the air.\" That's what he said. So that gives you a good idea of what they are talking about here. But let me tell you, over the last 24 hours or so, the IDF said that they have targeted over 600 terror targets, including weapon depots and dozens of anti-tank missile launching positions, as well as hideouts and staging grounds used by Hamas. Israeli troops have advanced more -- as you said before, more than two miles -- that's about three kilometers -- into Gaza in their expanding ground operation. This is according to a CNN analysis -- something that continued overnight. And the IDF said that they killed dozens of terrorists who had barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and who, at points, tried to attack Israeli soldiers in charge of the offensive. And just to give you an idea Kasie about how the offensive is being carried out on the ground, the Israel Defense Forces says aircraft guided by troops on land struck a staging post with over 20 Hamas militants inside. And did the same at Al-Aqsa University in Gaza where, according to the IDF, the militant Islamist organization had an anti-tank missile launching post. Over the last several days now, we have seen signs that instead of an all-out ground invasion, the Israel Defense Forces may have chosen to do targeted raids into Gaza followed by gradual incursions of troops. A big concern here in the Middle East, of course, is that this conflict may boil over. Earlier today, the Israeli military said that its aircraft struck military infrastructure in Syrian territory in response to launches toward Israel coming from the country. And national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in an interview on Sunday that the U.S. sees an elevated risk of a spillover conflict in the region as the Iranian proxies continue targeting American troops stationed here in the Middle East.

What we've seen in the past few weeks is a wave of anti-Semitism coursing through the world -- through European capitals, through American college campuses, and as you said, now in this airport in Russia.This is simply the manifestation of antizionism and anti-Semitism. That's what we've known was the truth all along that Israel is a pretext for efforts to attack Jews and their identity, and that's what we see happening in these places. When you have crowds -- mobs going to an airport and looking airplane- to-airplane and saying where are the Jews, as we have seen them being documented saying; when you have, as you said, a kosher dining hall in Cornell that was shut down with a police cordon because there death threats against Jewish students; when you have college campuses where Jews are simply afraid to leave their dorms and have been told to minimize their Jewish identifying characteristics and Jewish stars and like, this is an extremely worrisome situation. And, of course, we urge all authorities to do whatever they can to ensure that the Jewish communities are safe at this time.",

There have been a succession of military leaders, both present and past, who have said yes, we bear some responsibility for the tremendous failures that led to the October 7 Hamas massacre.But the prime minister has, thus far, refused to take responsibility. He was asked point-blank at that press conference two nights ago whether he would take responsibility. He said well, that's something that we'll deal with after this campaign is over. Then, of course, in the middle of the night, he put out this tweet basically, as you said, blaming the leaders of Israel's military intelligence for the failure. He then deleted that tweet and apologized for it. There's a lot of frustration in Israel that the prime minister, the leader of this country, has been the one individual who has failed to take responsibility for his role in October 7. I suspect that we're going to see a reckoning when all the warfare finally concludes.",

I mean, I think it's worth reminding everyone that the mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6 was chanting \"Hang Mike Pence\" -- and it says a lot about the state of the Republican Party, shall we say.But look, speaking of Trump, I want to ask you about a couple of things he has going -- namely, trials -- because that's occupying a lot of the former president's time right now. First, the gag order in the -- in the case here in Washington -- the federal case against him -- was reinstated over the weekend. We're still trying to get the details exactly of it. But we know that Trump has already reacted, saying it's unconstitutional. But it is there and we've seen some repercussions of his ignoring the gag order in the New York civil case. Do we expect him to actually follow this? And what might happen if he doesn't?",

But I would argue that where the gag orders exist, or in the case in Fulton County where there are limitations on what he can say as a -- as a condition of his bail release, it has at least caused the former president to consider the ramifications of some of the things he says. And I think there is evidence that he changes his tone somewhat when these orders are in place.Now, again, what we've seen is some of the courts -- particularly, the one in New York -- haven't always considered him 100 percent compliant. But I think, again, in the case of the federal case where when the gag order was suspended he wasn't saying some of the things, and then when there was a suspension for that week or so he kind of went back to his older way. Now we'll see what happens now that his attorneys have let him know it's back in place. Yes, he's criticized the order but will that cause him to stop some of the criticisms that could violate the gag order itself?",

I'm watching -- I actually covered something similar because there's a group that brought similar concerns about Marjorie Taylor Greene in hopes of keeping her off the ballot in 2022. The judge basically ruled that there wasn't enough evidence and threw the case out.So what we'll be looking for is whether the judge decides to engage. Because even before you get to whether what Trump's actions were -- could be considered aiding an insurrection -- the judges will decide if you can even apply the law in this way to Trump as a candidate. It's very interesting constitutional issues that were raised. A lot of people believe that ultimately, this will end up at the U.S. Supreme Court. But again, in Marjorie Taylor Greene's case, she made some of the same arguments Trump made -- that she was just challenging her thoughts on the election, her First Amendment rights, but that she, herself, did not contribute to the violence of that day. So we'll see the arguments that the former president makes and we'll see whether the court decides to engage on the issue at all.",

He told People magazine last year that he was surprised by his own resilience and that there are other people who -- he was -- he was almost amazed to be alive, is kind of how I think he put it.What do you think that meant to others who were struggling with similar challenges? GARBER-PAUL:  I mean, I think having somebody just being, like you said, so candid about his struggles was really inspirational, and to see him be so resilient and to go through rehab so many times. I think he joked that he spent $9 million trying to get sober. And the fact that he was able to be so honest about those struggles, I think for other people going through the same thing that meant a lot. And he -- you know, I think that will be part of his legacy is that he really wanted to help others and spent his time, his celebrity, his money trying to get others the same kind of help that he was able to get for himself.",
