They both went in expected to testify about a presentation that they received from former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani that was laden with conspiracy theories. These are all the witnesses that the District Attorney Fani Willis was expected to call to help present her case laying out this alleged conspiracy to overturn the election here in Georgia.Now Jake, we had anticipated this would take two days and at this point it's unclear if they're going to be able to move forward with possible indictments today or if they'll have to continue tomorrow.

ALAYNA TREENE, CNN REPORTERThey've had to respond to three previous indictments and they're planning to use the same playbook with this potential indictment. They are lining up surrogates and allies, having them ready to respond to potential charges if they are filed. They've also spoken to conservative media and had them write prewritten statements. And so, they're preparing a response ahead of time for when or if an indictment in Georgia does come. Now, I'm also told that Donald Trump's team does expect that a potential arraignment, if he is indicted, would be in person, that he would have to show up in person in Georgia and appear before the court.

I'm sure there'd be legal challenges to that. He also, of course, has his pardon power, likely for himself and certainly for others.

I guess the first thing is, I think in that scenario, President Trump and his lawyers would basically say to the judge, you need to exercise discretion and not sentence him to jail time. In other words, he's the duly elected new president of the United States, and you should either suspend the sentence, impose a fine, defer the sentence, allow him to serve as president.If that fails, I think the second argument the Trump team would make, at least I would make if I were in their shoes, is to say that it infringes on his constitutional duty to execute the laws of the United States. So that would be unconstitutional to force an incumbent president of the United States to serve jail time on a state charge. We're a long way away from that point. Those arguments have never succeeded. They've never been needed to be presented before in our nation's history, but I think that's the sort of argument that you would see if the scenario played out as you articulated it.",

But the former president not making that nuanced argument, right, instead calling people, quote, \"nasty disasters, Marxists, leftists,\" calling people names and launching these personal attacks while behind the scenes.

I think that ultimately, even if the former president signs it to get on the debate stage, that it doesn't mean there's enough evidence, we've seen this play out before. It doesn't mean he's going to actually hold true to it and support the eventual nominee if it isn't him.
