      "sentences": "So, practically, Erica, this decision, it will allow emergency abortions now to continue in Idaho. The Supreme Court released this opinion after inadvertently releasing it briefly on its website yesterday. But, what the decision does officially today is it holds an Idaho law that was a near-total ban on abortion. This law was actually in fact -- in effect for the past several months. But, I'll note what this opinion doesn't do is it does not definitively decide if this Idaho law is proper, meaning, if it properly or improperly conflicts with a federal law that requires doctors in emergency rooms to perform abortions, if necessary, to prevent serious injury to a woman.So, this is a bit of an incremental win for women and doctors in Idaho, who had voiced just how difficult medical care had become in the past few months with this Idaho law in effect. Women were being regularly airlifted out of the state when they were having problems with their pregnancies and potentially might need an abortion. This was regularly happening every other week, as opposed to before this law was in effect, just basically once a year women were being airlifted out. So, this decision, it delays any big decision about the legality of this near-total abortion ban in Idaho, and also what it does, much to the detriment of maybe pregnant women in other states, is it lets laws that exist in several other states, about a half dozen states that also have these near-total abortion bans. Those laws in those other states, not Idaho, they'll continue to be in place. So, it's an incremental win for women and doctors in Idaho who had complained about this near-total abortion ban and the detrimental effects. But, it doesn't settle, Erica, the broader issue here of whether or not the Idaho law and similar laws like it conflict with the federal law, and whether in the long run, doctors in emergency rooms will have to perform abortions if it's necessary to prevent serious injury to a woman.

Great to have you with us. And make sure you put us in your calendar for the next few days because we will not be done tomorrow with these decisions. Looking at what we did know, what we did see today, as Jessica was just walking us through some of those, there was so much focus on, of course, this case involving this incredibly restrictive law in the state of Ohio banning abortion in all cases, except if it involves the life of the pregnant mother. That is now on hold. We're waiting for it to play out. But, I found it remarkable that we really learned a lot here by the comments from both Justice Jackson and Justice Alito, which could not be more different except for the fact that they both think this should have been resolved, not dismissed. JEFF SWARTZ, FORMER MIAMI-DADE COUNTY COURT JUDGE: Right. And I think what we see is, unfortunately, the politicalization of the Supreme Court. I think that Justice Alito felt, if they went forward, he was going to prevail, and the idea that the federal law does not supersede or is not supreme over the Idaho law, and as a result of which the Idaho law would have been found to be enforceable. He felt that he had the votes. Somehow or another, he lost the votes. And he was very critical, I think, of those, like Amy Coney Barrett or Brett Kavanaugh or even Justice Roberts, who were not going along with what he wanted to do. Justice Jackson, on the other hand, was upset that they didn't make a decision, that they did not go forward, that they didn't do what they had to do, and she even used terms like kicking the can down the road. And are we going to -- we're going to read here and rehash things, I'm reading from the opinion. She was very frustrated. She thought she had the votes. So, what we're seeing is a court that I think is divided in three ways. I think there is those three, which is Alito and Thomas and Gorsuch. There is three that are the three liberal women. And then, there are the three in the middle that are trying to find their way through following Justice Roberts. That's kind of the way that I see it. And I think that's what happened here. And what it does is it just leaves in place the stay that was issued by the district court of the Idaho law and let it wean its way through all the way through the system through the circuit court. It really exposes them at this point.",

It may be Tuesday. It will go until the chief justice says we're going to go. And I have some concerns. I also think that there are three camps inside the Supreme Court on the immunity issue. And one says, no immunity. The other one says, absolute immunity. And then there is three in the middle. And the question is, which one is going to be the one that's going to be the opinion of the court, as opposed to a plurality opinion, which leaves us with no opinion?

As we look at where things stand, Justice Jackson saying in her note that she -- that -- as Jeff just alluded to, Jeff Swartz, this was kicking the can down the road, that this was a delay, certainly not a victory that this was dismissed. Justice Alito, in his dissent, saying it was baffling that this case should have been decided. What does this mean in terms of the questions that healthcare providers have moving forward in various states? We see places like Idaho where there is an obstetric desert in many areas.BONYEN LEE-GILMORE, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, &amp; VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, NIRH: Yeah. That's a great question. Well, first of all, I mean, I think we have to be very clear, continuing this case for months on end buys political time in an election year when most of America is outraged over abortion bans across party lines. And it's critical we do not forget what this case is about. If we take a giant step back and just remember what we're talking about, our country is at a point where a pregnant person's right to receive emergency stabilizing care is in question. That should be unacceptable on all levels. And I couldn't agree more. This is kicking the can down the road.

Joe Biden is pretty clear, I guess, where he stands, but Donald Trump has gone back and forth. Do you think he can nail down an answer on that? And if so, what do you think it would be?LEE-GILMORE: Well, so, look, we have two candidates who are going to be in a debate today -- tonight and one candidate who wants to reinstate Roe really wants to just ban abortion at 24 weeks. That's what Roe v. Wade did. And the other candidate can't decide because abortion bans are so desperately unpopular. But, we really know that Trump's ultimate goal here is to ban abortion. And the anti-abortion operatives have been very clear about this strategy, and it goes back to assigning fetal rights. If they can successfully enshrine fetal personhood, they will be able to continue giving governments an interest in pregnancies. So, what I want to hear, what I think most pro-abortion advocates want to hear from President Biden, is a complete denouncement of any abortion bans at any point in pregnancy. It needs to be that clear, that the government has no interest in pregnancy decision making for people across this country. And anything short of that leaves a lot of confusion and a lot of room for banning this critical care.",

They really viewed that emergency room care law as the last tool in their toolbox to protect some of those rights for women. Even so, we got a comment from a senior advisor to the Biden campaign in the immediate wake of that decision, calling out Donald Trump and still saying that there is urgency on that issue and that women's rights are still in peril.

We know they're talking through policy and facts. They are dealing with the reality of the situation. How much has abortion been a focus for Team Trump, as they're preparing the former President for tonight, when especially based on this ruling today, one would imagine it will come up and his position has been a little all over the map?",

And look, this is definitely one of the topics and one of the issues that Donald Trump's team has been advising him on, working with him to sharpen his rhetoric on over the past several weeks. Now, even though as you mentioned, Erica, Donald Trump's team doesn't like to use the term a debate prep, he has been preparing. He has been participating in more than a dozen, I'm told, policy discussions with VP contenders, his allies, former administration officials, policy experts, all of them to help him really formulate his response, particularly on a number of key issues, not just the ones that they want to talk about, the ones that he wants to talk about are immigration -- excuse me, immigration, the economy and crime, but also on the issues that he doesn't really want to go into, which is abortion.Now, this is an issue that Donald Trump has really struggled with for over a year now. And he really was weighing whether to -- for months whether to come out for a national ban, something he ultimately declined to do, instead saying he thinks that should be left up to the states. He is going to keep that position tonight, I'm told, and he is really committed to sticking with that through the rest of the election. But, of course, it's a difficult subject for him to talk about, especially when you think about many of the Conservatives and the Evangelical Christians who helped get him elected to office in the first place in 2016. They had been unhappy with his answer. And then, as I think you'll probably hear from the Biden campaign and Biden himself tonight, as Kayla was laying out, a lot of people on the left are also very frustrated with Donald Trump and worry about what him being in office could do to policies related to abortion. So, this is something that they have definitely spend time on behind the scenes. And you also talked to Kayla about an ad blitz. We're actually seeing ads as well being released from the Trump campaign today. And what I find really notable about this, Erica, is we really haven't seen many ads from the Trump campaign itself. This is one of the first ads we're seeing since he became the presumptive Republican nominee earlier this year. Take a listen to what one of those ads had to say.

Rina, great to see you today. When we look at sort of the strategy here for both candidates, for Donald Trump, I know you said he has three things he has to do tonight. There has been a lot of talk about what will his temperament be. Right? So, we've heard he needs to stay calm. But, you said what he really needs to do is to teach, convince and inspire, and he has to use data and facts. That is not always the former President's strong suit. How much do you think that will have changed coming into this debate? RINA SHAH, U.S. REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST, &amp; FMR. SENIOR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN ADVISOR: Well, any amount of prep would have helped Trump tonight, because what he needs is a realization that he can't take the version of himself that he has s been taking out on the road for four years to tonight's stage. Rallies are very different than debates. And Trump has shown that he doesn't quite get that. So, I'll be really interested to see what version of himself he brings tonight. And if I were advising him, which I am not, the one thing I would do is, again, tether him to the TCI. I love giving candidates an acronym that they need to have in their minds at any point in the night, that bring them back to what their job is. And for Trump, it's to teach the American public something that they may not have known that the Biden administration did over this past four years, and then to convince the public also that he is the better option. So, to continue to go back to that point that I'm better than him because, and then thirdly is to inspire people. We know that with this rematch that seemingly nobody really wanted, he has got to inspire people to turn out for him, not against Biden.",

Just like Trump is saying, we don't know what version of himself Biden is bringing tonight, it's similar for Biden to look at Trump as this person that is just going to be whoever he is, and may say something intended to get Joe off his game.But, what Biden has got to do, what Joe Biden's number one job is tonight is to bring the data points that speak to the success of his administration, and re-instill trust in every viewer about his capacity and about the people around him to serve the American public well in this next four years. The way in which he can do that, Erica, is by bringing the version of himself that he took to the State of the Union dais over at the House of Representatives when he was speaking to that joint session of Congress. He wasn't just vibrant and energetic. He was loaded full of substance, again, data points that are quick and easy for the viewer to remember about how good his administration has been.",

We've seen it in dialogue groups during the State of the Union, where voters emerge feeling they've moved from before and after the speech. And so, I think we should hope the President to replicate that tonight.And I think what's important is to show the real contrast between the two candidates at once. There are a lot of voters who have made up their mind, feel they know both of the candidates, and have been tuning out some of the news. They don't watch Trump's rambling (ph) speeches during his rally appearances. And now, he is going to have to be really focused. And the question that I hear in focus groups that people say they want to hear from candidates, any candidate is, why do you want to do this? What makes you want to go into public service? Why are you running for office? And the contrast on that couldn't be clearer between Joe Biden and President Trump. So, that's going to be part of what people, I think, will be listening for and will hear tonight.",

      "sentences": "Yeah. I think the voters that matter for this election are going to be what we call double doubters. These are voters who have negative views on both Joe Biden and Donald Trump. And what we hear in these focus groups is that many of these voters have not yet internalized, that they're ultimately are going to have to make a choice between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in November. They're still holding out hope for some miracle that one or both of them are not on the top of the ticket in November.And this has presented a real challenge for Joe Biden, because voters view Joe Biden as their number one concern right now, because he is the incumbent President. He is who is in charge of things like immigration and the economy right now, both issues that voters demand more from the President on. So, at this debate, I think it's really essential for Joe Biden to contrast himself, as Margie said, with Donald Trump, prove that he is up to the task of being President for four more years, because many of these swing voters and even some Democratic voters have concerns about Joe Biden's age. It's not something that he is going to be able to change, but he can prove that he can get past the dementia bar that Donald Trump and Republicans have put on him. And so, I think ultimately, what voters are going to want to expect and see is that there are two people that they're going to have to ultimately make a choice for in November. And this is going to be the first time that they're going to really have to wrestle with the fact that these are their choices.",

Obviously, this isn't going to happen.

So, how about we walk through how this debate will work? The campaigns knew about this. They looked at it ahead of time. Remember, all of these sort of rules and parameters, the campaigns both agreed to all of this when they agreed to do the debate. So, what did they agree to? Here is Phil Mattingly and Victor Blackwell to show you.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PHIL MATTINGLY, CNN CHIEF U.S. DOMESTIC CORRESPONDENT: Welcome to the set of the CNN presidential debate. We want to give our viewers a sense of the rules of the debate so that when they watch it, they can understand how President Biden and President Trump will be engaging with each other. Just after 9 p.m. Eastern, President Biden will enter from the right side of your screen. President Trump will enter from the left side of your screen. The podiums are eight feet apart. Directly across from them, the moderators, CNN's Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. Now, a reminder, this is a television studio. There is no audience. Candidates will have two minutes to answer questions and one minute for responses and rebuttals. At the moderators' discretion, there may be an additional minute for follow-ups, clarifications or responses. So, how does a candidate know how much time is left to speak? Attached to the cameras in the studio and in the candidates' field of view are the timing lights. When the lights show yellow, there are 15 seconds left in a candidate's answer or response. When the lights flash red, there are five seconds left. And when the display is solid red, the time is up. At that point, the candidates' microphone will be turned off and the other candidate will have their microphone turned on. My colleague Victor Blackwell has more on that.",

The CNN presidential debate airs live at 9 p.m. Eastern.(END VIDEOTAPE)",
