One day more than the original agreement to get hostages out and only one day -- now in only one day more before now fighting could resume. And with these two additional days more hostages will be released and more aid will get into Gaza. Fifty-one Israeli citizens and 18 foreign nationals have been released by Hamas since the pause began Friday.Just yesterday, among the hostages released was a mother and her three-year-old twin daughters. You see pictures of them there. But they are coming home without their father. He is still being held captive by Hamas in Gaza.",

In this case, tragic, 17-year-old Noam and his sister, 13-year-old Alma, survived 50 days as hostages in Gaza without knowing their mother had been murdered in the October 7th attack. They learned the tragic news after they were freed.Israel believes there are still 173 hostages being held in Gaza right now. And this morning, a major diplomatic push by the head of the CIA. Bill Burns is in Qatar to push for the Israel-Hamas truce to continue beyond the pause that we are in right now and expand it just to get out more women and children. Let's get straight to CNN's Kaitlan Collins who is in Tel Aviv. First off, what do we know about the 10 people who may be coming out now? Has there been a list? And do the families know at this point or have you heard any of that information?",

      "sentences": "We don't know much at this point, Kaitlan, about the circumstances of the death. But the IDF says Ravid Katz who is 51 years old, died. They just -- they confirmed his death inside of Gaza in captivity. He was taken from the kibbutz of Nir Oz in the terror attack on October 7th.And we don't understand or we don't know at this point exactly when he died. But the IDF announcement marks the death of the third hostage in captivity, that's after 19-year-old Corporal Noa Marciano and 65-year- old grandmother, Judith Weiss. It's also worth noting that Ravid Katz was not taken on his own. In fact, his sister, Doron Katz and her children were released at the beginning of the hostage exchange. They came out on Friday. So just learning now the horrible news that one member of their family died while in Gaza. As for what else is happening, we've just heard from the IDF that there has been an exchange of fire that threatens the ceasefire agreement here. I'll read you the statement which came out a short time ago. Over the last hour, three explosive devices were detonated adjacent to IDF troops in two different locations in the northern Gaza Strip violating the framework of the operational pause. They also say in one of those locations, they came under fire and returned fire. That's significant because it is clearly the largest violation of the pause in the fighting that we have seen thus far. Now, Kaitlan, we've gotten no indication that this threatens the overall agreement. We have a list of the hostages to be released tonight. And so far, at least, it appears that that process is continuing. But this is definitely worth keeping an eye on to see if it rattles what has already proven to be a fragile deal in more than one instance.",

We'll continue to monitor that, see if it does threaten this temporary extension that we're seeing play out.But Oren, you're also learning more about what these families are learning about their loved ones as they're coming home what they have just gone through in Gaza for the last 51 days.

It seems some has the hostages were held below ground. Some were held above ground and moved around repeatedly during 50 or so days of captivity.Meanwhile, from what we've heard from doctors who treated many of these freed hostages, as well as from the families of the hostages themselves, they barely got enough food subsisting mostly on pita bread, and sometimes some rice or other carbohydrates like that, clearly not enough. Doctors have said that some of the freed hostages lost a tremendous amount of weight, in fact, that threatened the life of one of the elderly hostages, who is at least as of a couple of days ago in critical condition, and doctors are monitoring her to try to get her to recover. So the nutrition was a big question. Of course, it's also a major issue of simply being in captivity. What that was like having to be quiet, not being able to communicate, obviously, with family members not having any idea what else had happened, not understanding the scope or the scale of the horror on October 7th. We have heard from the families of hostages who came out who had to tell a newly freed hostages, you have lost members of your family who are killed in the terror attack of October 7th. It is all in all a horrific picture of what they've endured over the course of the past seven weeks. And part of the challenge of the mental health process that they are just now beginning.",

[09One of those situations is Thomas Hand, who of course initially believed his nine year old daughter Emily had been killed on October 7th, something he said he was grateful for thinking about the conditions that hostages were likely living through in Gaza. He later found out that she was in fact alive and that she was being held as a hostage. And in a remarkable journey, the two of them were reunited this week. She was released in this group of hostages. And he's talking about their reunion, in an interview with our colleague, Clarissa Ward. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THOMAS HAND, 9-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER RELEASED BY HAMAS: She'd be here in a couple of minutes, like temporarily fair, and all of a sudden the door opened up and she just ran. It was beautiful. Just like in -- just like I imagined it, you know, running together. I squeezed, I probably squeezed too hard. And certainly when she stepped back a little, I could see her face was chiseled, like mine, whereas before she left there was, you know, chubby, curly, young kid face. Yes, she has lost a lot of body weight. And the color, I've never seen her so white. The other and the most shocking, disturbing part of meeting her was she was just whispering. I couldn't hear her. I had to put my ear on her lips like this close. And say, what did you say? (Inaudible).",

She turned nine while in captivity, what she has been through and also how to process that.And he himself as a dad was saying, you know, he's a bit lost on how to navigate this, how to handle this. And he's been speaking with the psychiatrist about what is the best path forward. And of course, Emily is just one of many children who were held for more than 50 days and more children that are still being held.

And it's just imagining my daughter, anyone's daughter going through in recounting anything like this is just gut, heart, soul crushing. But at least she is back in the arms of her family. Kaitlan, we're going to get right back to you. Thank you so much for bringing us that.

One of those hostages is Omri Miran. He was terrorized along with his family by Hamas for hours before he was kidnapped from their kibbutz Nahal Oz. His wife, Lishay Lavi, their two young daughters forced to watch as Omri was taken away, now seven weeks ago. Joining us now is Omar's wife, Lishay Lavi. Moshe, it's good to see you again.
