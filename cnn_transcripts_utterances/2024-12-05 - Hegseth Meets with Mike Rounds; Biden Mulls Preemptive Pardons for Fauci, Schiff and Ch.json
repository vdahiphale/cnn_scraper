But with all of these questions swirling around his nomination, I mean, what are your thoughts at this moment? He says he's staying in.REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D-CA):  Well, you know, it's up to the Senate really, the House doesn't have a role to play in this. But certainly, it looks like a big mess. You sort of wonder what kind of checking the Trump people did before they sent his name up here. And certainly, I'm sure the Senators will want to know everything about this. I mean, the allegations are pretty wild. And if true, not the sort of thing you'd want to associate with somebody who's running a trillion-dollar agency, the Department of Defense.",

And there's no coincidence that this milestone came just hours after President-Elect Trump announced plans to swap out one of the crypto industry's biggest enemies with a much friendlier face. Trump says that he wants Gary Gensler, the outgoing SEC chair, who's very tough on crypto, to be replaced by a conservative lawyer and crypto enthusiast Paul Atkins.Now, as you can see on that chart, the trend has been certainly higher and higher for Bitcoin. Much of that was actually before the election, but it's also true, it's been going basically straight up since November up 50 percent since Election Day. What's ironic is Trump used to bash Bitcoin. He said it was based on thin air, and it was scam against the dollar. But like many on Wall Street, he's completely turned around. He's promised to make America the crypto capital on the planet and to even launch a strategic Bitcoin reserve. And against all of that, we've seen Bitcoin go higher and higher, Jim.",
