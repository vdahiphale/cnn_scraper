Well, they are the markets and the main events. The economy: It's on the ballot in the United States and we are only hours away from the first exit polls in pivotal Midterm Elections. Call it a Shakespearean drama in the world of crypto. Binance is lining up an emergency bailout of its rival, FTX. If we want to take practical steps on climate change, then drop trade barriers. The Director-General of the World Trade Organization is with me on this program tonight. We are live in New York. It is Tuesday. It's November the 8th. I'm Richard Quest, I mean business. Good evening. Tonight economic anxiety is dominating the polls, as voting is now underway in the US Midterm Elections. High inflation and a potential recession, they are by far the biggest concerns on voters' minds about who found it increasingly difficult to pay for and to make ends meet. The country's economic direction over the next two years will be firmly determined by the election races over the next two years -- the races are tonight, of course, but the results will be -- the effects will be felt over the next few years. Rosa Flores is in a key battleground State of Las Vegas in Nevada. It is windy there, I hope you can hear me. But the State is important, and the votes have been pouring in.",

Now I am in Las Vegas, Nevada. It's in Clark County. I want to show you around because you'll see that there's a long line right now here outside of this polling place. So this is a Community Center in Las Vegas. Just to tell you a little bit about this community. Clark County is 71 percent of all 1.8 million voters in the State of Nevada, a very, very important State. Again, it could determine the balance of the US Senate. From talking to some of the voters here, some of the issues that are most impacted by, they say is the economy -- how much they pay for gas at the pump, how much they pay for food. Also, the border -- border issues, immigration issues. Even though this is not a Border State, it does not border Mexico, people here are still concerned about the border. One woman I talked to said that it was because of potentially individuals immigrants taking jobs from people in this community, her family members. They also spoke about crime. Those are some of the issues that they're worried about. And again, Richard, Nevada, we're going to be here, we're going to be watching it. We're going to be watching what is happening here in the State of Nevada.

So what will happen is that almost for certain the House will go Republican, it would be a miracle if it didn't, and so there will be a freeze on spending and taxes that couldn't be increased now under a Republican House. The question is, you know, what happens? What else happens with the Republican House? There is also going to be a lot of oversight of economic activity now coming from the House Oversight Committee, in particular to energy and healthcare provisions that were just passed with the so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which was mainly an energy and healthcare bill.

It's got all the ingredients -- a bitter rivalry that came to head in a spectacular fashion and there was somebody knifed, as Binance announced their plan to rescue FTX. It follows a run of one of the world's largest crypto exchanges. In a statement on Twitter, of course, Binance said: \"This afternoon FTX asked for us to help. There is a significant liquidity crunch.\" It's a stunning downfall for FTX. Of course, it was originally valued at $32 billion, and it is after a public clash between the CEOs of the two companies and that spurred a selloff in the crypto markets. Paul L. Monica -- Guru La Monica is with me. Paul, so this is interesting, fascinating, actually, because I'm not sure whether Binance actually sort of dug the dagger in when it tweeted that it was selling or reducing its stakes in the crypto held by, and therefore created what arguably was a liquidity run on FTX.",

So he has bailed out a couple of firms, but now, he has to go running to one of their biggest rivals in Binance, because there was a run on the FTX in-house currency and that created these liquidity concerns. And it just really shows, Richard, how rapidly things can unravel in crypto. This is not yet the present of money in the way that many crypto evangelists like to say, it's the future of money.

They are very complicated, and a quick straw poll in our office showed we all had a vague idea what they are, but none of us could really say with any certainty exactly how they worked, except somebody bought somebody else's carbon credits, and somebody got a benefit, and eventually, it all seemed to work somehow. OKONJO-IWEALA:   Well, you know, let me say yes, that I believe that carbon pricing, you know, and emissions trading, they are all part of the toolbox you need in order to decarbonize the way we live, to decarbonize production. And so, if you pollute somewhere, or you have released carbon emissions in the activity you're doing, you can go somewhere else and buy emissions reductions from someone else who is not polluting, you know, so you can trade. And that's what they're talking about. I'm trying to talk in very simple terms so you don't say I'm speaking a lot of jargon. But essentially, you can -- if you're doing something that is bad for the environment, perhaps someone else is doing something that is good. And you can trade between you, that's what is being talked about. In addition, I think that putting a price on carbon is also something else we need to talk about. So at the WTO, we are developing a framework for carbon global pricing of carbon emissions so that you can have a price put on them and then reduce these emissions. If you can't provide something, you know, then it's very difficult to get a solution, to get people to stop using it, and that's the kind of framework I'm trying to talk about in very simple terms.",

OKONJO-IWEALA:   But look, Richard, right now in the world, we have 70 fragmented carbon pricing and taxing systems and it is very difficult for business to go from one jurisdiction to the other and have to face a different price. So working with other institutions like the IMF and the OECD, if we can put together a global framework, which is what we're trying to do, that has one price for those who are low income and low polluters, another higher price for high income and high polluters, and somewhere along that range, you're solving a problem. And those who don't want to price carbon, but want to use regulation, we can do an equivalency so that that can also be made into a price.

It does not mean the medicine is not working, you just don't feel it yet. The concern remains that the Fed is going to be impatient with the very slow improvement on the inflation front.

They received a termination notice on Friday morning, just four days after the physical location opened. They have been working remotely for about a year; many of them had moved from other countries to be in Ghana for this dream job. This is the notice they received, it didn't address them by name, it just said see attached. The letter says, I want to read part of this for you, \"The company is reorganizing its operations as a result of a need to reduce costs. It is with regret that we are writing to inform you that your employment is terminating as a result of this exercise. \"Your last day of employment will be on 4 December. You'll be placed on garden leave until your termination date.\" Here is the inconsistency here which is grating on these employees. This tweet from Elon Musk, he says, everyone exited was offered three months of severance, which is 50 percent more than is legally required. But these employees in Africa are saying they didn't get that. They were not offered next steps or any severance at all. So they are in limbo.",

This facility in centralChina is Apple's largest iPhone assembly factory and it desperately needs more workers. After a COVID outbreak at Zhengzhou in mid-October, there has been chaos at the factory. Viral videos have shown masses of workers walking miles across highways, to flee the factory's COVID restrictions. Workers had complained about subpar living conditions and the poor quality of food. This has put huge strain on Apple right before the key holiday shopping season. Apple says that its latest products will be temporarily impacted and delayed because of these COVID-19 outbreaks and the factories operating at significantly reduced capacity. Foxconn said it is giving a one-time bonus equivalent to $US 69 for workers who have left and choose to return. It is offering new workers a wave equivalent to US$4 per hour. The factory is operating in a closed loop system, which means that workers have to live and work onsite. Apple is just the latest victim of China's harsh zero COVID policy. The country is stuck in this endless cycle of lockdowns, quarantines, and mass testing. It is taking a huge toll on the economy and on people's lives.
