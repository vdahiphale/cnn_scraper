Just ahead their final pitch Kamala Harris and Donald Trump prepare for a last campaign sprint before Tuesday's presidential election. Plus, angry flood survivors in Spain confront the country's King. We are live in Valencia with the details. And saying goodbye to a music legend like no other, Quincy Jones is dead at the age of 91.After months of wild twists and turns, the U.S. presidential election is in its final day. Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have a full day focused on the most important swing states. For Harris that means Pennsylvania, she will spend the entire day in the biggest of the battleground states, making stops in five different cities. Harris bringing her campaign to a close with a message of optimism. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE U.S., (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We have momentum. It is on our side. Can you feel it? And we have the momentum because our campaign is tapping into the ambitions, the aspirations and the dreams of the American people, because we are optimistic and excited about what we can do together.

They are fighting so hard to steal this damn thing. Look at what's going on. Look at what's going on in your state every day, talking about extending hours and stuff. What -- whoever heard of this stuff? We should have one day voting and paper ballots. (END VIDEO CLIP) WALKER: As they have shown for weeks the final polls over the weekend point to one of the tightest contests in U.S. election history. But the polling world was thrown for a loop with one very surprising result. The Iowa Poll, known for its uncanny accuracy in that state, finds Kamala Harris leading there by three points, although it is within the margin of error. So there really is no clear leader there, but it is turning the state that was supposed to be safely in Trump's corner into potentially a toss-up. And if Harris is able to challenge Trump in Iowa, it probably bodes well for her chances in other Midwest swing states. Sources tell CNN the poll was a gut punch to people inside the Trump campaign, and that Trump himself is fuming over it. Let's check in on both campaigns. We have CNN's Alayna Treene traveling with Donald Trump and Edward-Isaac Dovere tracking Kamala Harris. Alayna, let's start with you. What do you expect to hear from Former President Trump today as he is making his final pitch?",

So it is, as we see from the polls, tight, very, very tight going into the Election Day here. And she's going to be all over the state. There are three big rallies in Scranton, in Allentown and tonight, at 11:00 p.m. in Philadelphia, but also some other stops where she's going to be meeting with voters and trying to just be blanketing the state so that every voter who is making up their minds about who to vote for, and of course, even whether to vote in this last 24, 36 hours here, can see her. And they hope get a feeling from her that she's trying to give off, that she is sorry. The real new page, that she is turning America to a very different kind of forward looking, optimistic sense, versus Donald Trump. That made a big deal last night under the fact that Kamala Harris, for the first time since becoming the candidate, did not mention Donald Trump's name at her rally last night in East Lansing. That's what we're going to be getting a lot of in theme over the course of today from Harris as she looks to close this out.",

Both Trump and Harris will be doing multiple stops in Pennsylvania today, some in the same city. They'll both be in Pittsburgh at some point today. They'll both be in reading Pennsylvania, a smaller city in Pennsylvania.

The conversation about China has been almost entirely about Former President Trump's ideas about slapping 100 percent 200 percent 400 percent tariffs. China is a much more complex problem. It is the only power that could challenge the United States, militarily, economically, technologically over the next 30 or 40 years.It requires a sustained, deep U.S. approach. President Biden has taken some steps in this direction, building on things that were left from the Trump Administration. I think you have to give the Trump Administration credit for identifying the return of superpower conflict as the major challenge facing the United States. But there has been no discussion of it during the campaign, including the biggest change in the geopolitical landscape, which has been the coming together of Russia and China in a somewhat combined partnership now, including North Korea and Iran, of course, over Ukraine and other issues. I can't think of a bigger challenge for the next president. It has gotten basically not one word during this campaign.",

Of course, that is a nudge to that -- to those ballots being burned there. But in Oregon as well, we have the National Guard on stand-by.
