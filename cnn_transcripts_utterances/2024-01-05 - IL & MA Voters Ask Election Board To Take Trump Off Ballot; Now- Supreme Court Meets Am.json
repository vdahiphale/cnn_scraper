CNN's Joan Biskupic, who's been in Supreme Court all morning joins us and CNN's Paula Reid is here as well. Paula stand by for a moment. Joan, first, lay out what the justices are doing what we're expecting to hear from them and maybe when. JOAN BISKUPIC, CNN SENIOR SUPREME COURT ANALYSTAnd among those are the Trump disputes. Now, it's not an easy question, John, of just take a single case with a single question. There are several questions baked into these appeals that have landed on their doorstep. As a strong threshold matter, it's whether this question is too political for the justices to even handle if it's something that should be beyond the domain of the judiciary, something that's called a political question. But then there's an issue of whether President Trump would even be covered by this. As you know, the trial judge in Colorado had originally said, had said that the presidency is not covered by this provision that would bar anyone who engaged in an insurrection, it would cover other office holders. Now the Colorado Supreme Court rejected that. But that could be another question that could be a hurdle for the Supreme Court. So what they're deciding, John, is not just whether to take the cases, but on what specific issues, and then the timing. And let me just mention two final things on timing. The parties to the cases have all stressed urgency. That's Donald Trump, the original Colorado voters that have challenged him and the Colorado Republican party that's already also in this case. And the voters have said, Please decide by February 11th, which would be the day before the ballots in Colorado are set to be mailed out. The Colorado Republican Party has said, you know, just please decide it by March 5th, which is Super Tuesday, when about 15 states have primaries, and Colorado balloting would be completed then. So that's the kind of the broader timetable. But then for what might happen today or early next week. Today is the start of an in person discussion among the justices about whether and how to take up these cases. They could give us an order as soon as this afternoon, John. But when I step back and think of the complexity of these questions, they might want to take a little bit more time to refine what they would decide, you know, this is all about deciding what to decide, and also to set a briefing schedule, which would be the filings that would then come in, and then oral arguments, of course. But nothing is a given with this court. They have discretion on what cases they take up. But I think we all know that this is a question that only the justices can decide and it's in their lap now.

      "sentences": "Oh, well, they're proliferating until the Supreme Court weighs in here, we can expect more and more challenges to be filed. Now, these new challenges in Massachusetts and Illinois, they rely on the same argument that has been litigated in multiple states over the past several months. And that is the argument that Trump should be disqualified from appearing on the 2024 ballot under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. This is the post-Civil War provision that bars insurrectionists from holding future office.Now in Maine and Colorado, this was successful in removing him from the ballot. But in other states like Minnesota and Michigan, they never even got into the merits. They decided to keep them on the ballot just based on procedural grounds. So the door is still open for those to be reopened. Now, the other issue here, in addition to the question of how those -- that particular section applies to Trump, the other question is, well, who should be enforcing this? This is another question that has been proposed to the Supreme Court. And here they file these challenges to the Massachusetts ballot commission and the Illinois Board of Elections. Now, there are arguments from the Republicans in Colorado and former President Trump, that this should not be up to the states that there is a role for Congress to litigate these issues of who should and should not appear on the ballot. Now, both of these new challenges were filed by people for free speech for people, they have been behind many of these state challenges, and they've signaled they're not going to stop. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It's not just Democrats, you have a Republican, you have an unaffiliated, or an enrolled voter, to petition the court to say the things we've heard before a little bit of Groundhog Day, a little bit of Bill Murray, of he is not fit because, why, he is an officer.
