Ukraine officials say at least two people were killed, dozens more injured in Sloviansk. Several high-rise buildings, civilian buildings, that were targeted were reduced to rubble and ashes. Explosions also rocking the Russian-occupied city of Melitopol. This dash cam video capturing the billowing smoke.These strikes came less than 24 hours after Vladimir Putin announced plans to move and station tactical nuclear weapons, like the ones in this missile here we're showing you, in Belarus. Putin says he wants to store them there by summer, which means they could be closer to Ukraine but also the NATO's borders.
