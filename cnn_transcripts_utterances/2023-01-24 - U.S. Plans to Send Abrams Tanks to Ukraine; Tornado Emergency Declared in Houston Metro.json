      "sentences": "It is. Ukraine has been asking for these heavy Western tanks for months and months now, because they believe that these tanks made by Germany, made by the U.S., will essentially allow them to break through Russia's defensive lines and really carry out a significant offensive operation against Russia and take back importantly a lot of their territory.And of course, we have reported last week that there was kind of a diplomatic logjam happening between U.S. and Germany. Germany saying that they didn't want to send their tanks unless the U.S. sent their own tanks. Now we're seeing what appears to be some kind of effort to break that logjam with the U.S. preparing to announce we're told the commitment of significant number of Abrams tanks to Ukraine. Also, according to that German media report that you cited, coincidentally or not, Germany is also going to be announcing that they will be sending Leopard tanks as well this week. So, clearly something has move the needle here, but it remains to be seen, of course, when those Abrams tanks are actually going to be on the ground in Ukraine. It could be a while.",

Given that they are there in Europe and Poland borders Ukraine so they can easily send them that way.Natasha, I know you also have new reporting of how Western allies are encouraging Ukraine to now shift their focus geographically in terms of where they are fighting. What's the strategy there?",

And that is because this fight in Bakhmut that's really been grinding over for over six months now with Russian forces, just is not sustainable according to the U.S. for Ukraine. Just given the sheer amount of troops and ammunition that they're expanding there. An enormous amount of casualties on both sides.So, the advice that the U.S. has given, is kind of shift your tactics here. Focus less on that grinding war of attrition that we're seeing play out in kind of a World War I style situation in Bakhmut and focus more on U.S. provided training, the new weapons were given you and focus on a potential counteroffensive in the south in the spring -- Bianna.",

This is very dangerous situation. If you're in the line of these storms particularly right around the Baytown area, this is along I-10. It's going to cross I-10 in the next couple of minutes. Make sure you are in your safe place, get out of harm's way, because this is very dangerous storm.Look at the lightning associated with this line of showers and storms. Any one of these storms could produce a tornado especially within this tornado watch box we have right along the Gulf Coast, the deep South. It does include portions of southwest Louisiana in the coming hours. This area shadowed in orange, this is going to be your highest risk for severe weather, including tornadoes, damaging winds, also very large hail. We are going to see throughout the evening into the late evening overnight hours, New Orleans, Mobile, as these storms continue to track toward the east. So, again guys, very dangerous situation especially on the outside of Houston.",

No women directors got nominations and no black actors in the lead acting categories were nominated. So, you know, listen, the Oscars are never going to get it 100 percent right. Another movie \"RRR\" from India, everyone wanted to see that in the best picture race, it didn't. But it did get a best song nomination.

I bet chances are people are googling \"To Leslie\" and they are going to release -- be streaming it, whether they can go to movie theater and see it or not is another question because this movie came out a while ago.But I do -- every time you talk to a marketer or a publicity person in movies they say these nominations equal whether it's box office ticket or stream or some recognition and some more visibility, it definitely helps.",

Now, Attorney General Merrick Garland, he's the one who announced this antitrust lawsuit earlier today and he's saying that Google has been at it -- at these anti-competitive practices, for more than a decade.
