CNN senior national correspondent, Ryan Young, has the latest for us. So, Ryan, what are you learning about this suspect and whether there's any word on a potential motive?",

Let's bring in CNN's Jacqueline Howard. This seems kind of obvious, but clearly there's a reason why they're doing this with new guidance. What prompted this?",

      "sentences": "That's right. Brianna. The reason is we know that recently some media reports have surfaced that have detailed some cases where patients were subjected to these kinds of intimate exams without their consent.And in some cases, patients were under anesthesia. They did not previously discuss these exams with their medical care team. But the reason why some of these exams were performed were for teaching purposes. Some of the cases involved medical students or medical trainees watching an exam demonstration. But in a letter to teaching hospitals and to medical schools, HHS officials those wrote that \"informed consent is the law and essential to maintaining trust in the patient-provider relationship and respecting patients' autonomy.\" So moving forward, HHS is really cracking down here, Brianna, with saying that you need that written consent from a patient before performing any kind of exam. And especially if that patient will be under anesthesia during the exam. These requirements are not new, but that's the reason why they're being reiterated right now. And it's also interesting, in that same letter, officials wrote that the Office for Civil Rights investigates complaints alleging that patients' personal protected health information was either used or disclosed to medical trainees in violation of HIPAA. So we know that the Office for Civil Rights has also taken a close look at whether some of these cases where exams were performed without -- without consent also may have been in violation of HIPAA laws. So this is an area that's really getting a close examination here -- Brianna?",

In a statement, Cody Smiths says he is stepping down to focus on his health. The announcement does come just weeks after the city released a report defending the response from law enforcement during the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School, where 19 students and two teachers were killed. A city council meeting is scheduled for tonight. Also, were following jury selection and the Chad Daybell murder trial. Remember, he's accused of murdering his first wife. And conspiring with his current wife, Lori Vallow, to kill her two kids. Authorities say the remains of the two children were discovered in Daybell's back yard. Now, he's pleaded not guilty. He does face the death penalty if he is convicted. Brianna?",

But guess what? In a few hours, you're going to get another round on the backside of the storm system because the tornado watches go all the way back farther to your west. This is the area that we're concerned about. I just got a call from a friend in Cincinnati. He said, hey, it's beautiful here. The sun's out. How can it be better? Well, it couldn't be worse because the sun warmed your atmosphere, warmed what you're going to see, primed yourself almost like pushing the primer button on your mower. It doesn't start when you don't do that. But all of a sudden, you get some sunshine, you push the primer button and your mower starts. This is the area we're going to see the strong tornadoes again today. Last night, yesterday, they were over here. And we knew that they were moved over toward the east. And this is a very significant event for places like Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and later on tonight, all the way down to Atlanta, Georgia. Yes. We've had a lot of power outages, especially through West Virginia, over 100,000 because of the line of weather. We call it a squall line. The winds there were 70 to 80 miles per hour, knocking down trees and power lines. Move you ahead to 3:00, you can still see the bright colors here. More storms coming through places that have already had the storms. And so, yes, Boris, all the way to the east coast later on tonight. And behind this, yes, that color back there is snow, significant snow for parts of the Great Lakes. For tomorrow, things calm down quite a bit, but move over toward the populated areas of the Atlantic coast. There is your winter storm warning. Green Bay, eight to 12 inches of snow. And this is the rub. This is why we have the severe weather. The cold air is battling spring. Spring says, hey, come on, I want to get up there. Winter says, wait, not so fast. And all of a sudden, you get the flash flood threat and you certainly get the snow threat across parts of the north. We'll watch it for you here all day long. You should have a radio on or some way to get warnings today, if you live in the zones that I talked about.",

What we are working with partners in the region are two things. One is the logistics flow, getting -- getting them maritime materials to the pier.
