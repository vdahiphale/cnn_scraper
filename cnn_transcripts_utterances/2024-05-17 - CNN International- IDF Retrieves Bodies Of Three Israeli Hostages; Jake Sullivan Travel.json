But it was only her family of these three who had actually been informed prior to this latest operation that her -- that she was actually dead. The families of Amit Bouskila, a 28 year-old fashion stylists from southern Israel, Itshak Gelernter, a 58-year-old father and grandfather, it wasn't until today, it seems that they were actually informed that their loved ones had indeed been killed on October 7. And so two different types of closures, certainly being offered for those families, but also heartbreaking news as they learn of the deaths of their loved ones. That Nova Music Festival is what the three of them were attending that day when Hamas terrorists attacked on October 7, they then fled to a nearby kibbutz of Mefalsim, about ten miles down the road, and that the Israeli military says is where they were killed and their bodies then taken into Gaza, held hostage until today.",

The U.N. says nearly 640,000 people have been displaced from Rafah.

President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, is traveling to Israel and Saudi Arabia this weekend as the White House keeps a close eye on Israel's operation in Rafah.

First is the hostage negotiations is it possible to try to get those restarted in some fashion, or at least to make some progress as you point out. There were optimistic signs that there was real progress being made try to close some sort of deal that would allow hostages to come out, more humanitarian aid to go in and a ceasefire in the war after some eight months at this point.But that stalled. So, Sullivan will have that on his mind as he moves in. Also the U.S. and Sullivan are looking for some sort of clarity on what Israel's intentions are with their operation in Rafah. To this point, the Pentagon and others have called Israel's operation in Rafah limited, even as Israel has the forces surrounding the southern part of the Gaza Strip, where more than a million Palestinians have taken refuge to move in on large scale. The U.S. has been asking for, frankly, borderline demanding from Israel some sort of plan for what to do with all the Palestinians having taken refuge there. The U.S. is still looking for answers there. And then there's, of course the big picture question, one of the things the U.S. is trying to put on the table for Israel to end this war, is a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia, which would be enormous accomplishment for the region, the Israelis and the U.S. So, Sullivan will be looking to see where that stands. And if it's possible to make progress on that front, Omar.",

We know different states, again, different rules make that evidence sometimes more difficult to have introduced. But this is evidenced that I'm sure will be come the subject matter of motions and of efforts by those other warriors to have introduced cases that may move forward.And also, Omar, we should not underestimate that this video is very damaging, very damning, very explosive video could also motivate Diddy's team to enter into settlement agreements with some of the pending plaintiffs.",

So, joining me to discuss all of this is Malcolm Kenyatta. He's a Democratic state representative in Pennsylvania and a member of the Biden-Harris campaign national advisory board. Malcolm, really appreciate you being here. All right. Look, lots of debate over Biden's issue with Black voters. Polls that we've seen show him down double-digits from his margin with Black voters in 2020. So still up, but from his butt down, from his 2020 margin and polls also show he's losing ground with younger voters. So if these polls hold, obviously, there should be a pretty significant racial realignment. But do you believe these numbers are real? I mean, how big of a problem is this for the president? REP. MALCOLM KENYATTA (D), PENNSYLVANIA STATE HOUSE: You know, let me tell you what I believe. I believe that the president's record, Omar, of fighting for black Americans and for all Americans it is real and it is historic. He talked about today and his speech about the record investments that he's making an HBCUs, more than any other president. He talked about the historic increase in Pell Grants, which like myself, who need a Pell grants to go to college, you have a younger the person right now who's able to go to college in part because of this president's focus on making college more affordable and also making sure that when people leave college, you can actually start your life by that first home build your family. And so, like we've seen throughout this week and were going to continue to see throughout this campaign, there really is a split screen. Donald Trump is somebody who has dinner with white supremacists and neo-Nazis. This president and President Biden, you know, hosts the litigants of brown and all the other cases that pushed America and a direction that we need to never get tired hired of pushing toward to make this a country where no matter who you are, what you look like, you get a fair shot and a fair shake and that's what this president is focused on.",

Because look, the economy is doing well, adding jobs, we've seen markets at points hit record highs, but it -- there seems to be a gap between what some may see in the numbers versus some -- what people are actually feeling. So it's contrasting Donald Trump enough or what does President Biden have to do to sort of close that gap between what were seeing on paper and what people might actually be feeling? Listen, we're seeing, if you look at some numbers, we're seeing consumer confidence go up. You see inflation go down. Listen, every campaign, you have to do two things. First, you have to have a story to tell, and then you have to have a messenger who can go out and deliver that message. This president has a story to tell, appointed more African women to the bench than every other president combine, stood by his word and picking an incredible vice president in Kamala Harris and this administration is focused on getting the job done. And this is what's good. When you do the right thing, that also turns out to be good politics.

That was when Richard Nixon won the state. So it would be a huge upset if Donald Trump were able to clinch enough of vote here, votes here. Now, I will say, in 2016 Donald Trump nearly pulled off that type of upset when he was up against Hillary Clinton. He lost by less than two points in 2016. But again, he did lose by seven points in 2020. And so, they're going to be trying to make some sort of play here. Were seeing that lay out tonight. Now, I will also note that Donald Trump did actually campaign heavily in Minnesota in 2020 and he often said that he would not return to the state if he did not win it.

Some people are calling them flirt variants, that's just because its sort of the makeup of their mutations.But what you need to know is that together they comprise about 35 percent of cases in the U.S. So, KP.2 is now dominant, but these are all part of the omicron family. And so far, they're not showing any differences from the variants that we've had circulating already in terms of the symptoms they cause or the severity of disease. And so people are watching these very closely, but so far they are not particularly concerning except for the fact that they do seem to be more transmissible, probably because they can escape our antibody protections a bit from prior infection or vaccination. But vaccines are expected still to hold up a little bit, at least against them, Omar.",

It's such a competitive country, where people think that if they do nothing, that they are a little behind. So I think everyone has to have their own pace and sometimes just slow down.",
