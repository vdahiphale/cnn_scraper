My version is that the missile hit the building, because there's a thermal station across the river; meaning they tried to hit the thermal station, but the missile flew by and hit residential buildings.

More now from CNN's Vedika Sud. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) VEDIKA SUD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A video appears to show a passenger plane tilting to the side moments before it comes crashing into the ground in central Nepal. At least 68 people died when the Yeti-Airlines-operated flight crashed on Sunday, making it Nepal's deadliest plane crash in decades. Dozens of bodies were recovered by rescue workers, searching among the wreckage until darkness settled in Nepal. On Sunday morning, the aircraft embarked in a roughly 30-minute flight from the capital of Kathmandu to Pokhara, the country's second most populous city. But the flight was last in contact with the Pokhara Airport about 18 minutes after takeoff before it came crashing down in the nearby Seti River Gorge. The Himalayan country has a record of crashes due to its mountainous topography and sudden changes to the weather. The first (ph) prime minister announced an investigation would proceed to determine exactly what happened. PUSHPA KAMAL DAHAL, NEPALI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): The incident was tragic. All forces have been deployed for rescue operations. The investigation is going on now. I have called an emergency candidate meeting. SUD (voice-over): The passengers on board were mostly Nepali but included 15 foreign nationals, Nepal's civil aviation authority said. Yeti Airlines canceled all regular flights on Monday in mourning for the passengers who lost their lives.
