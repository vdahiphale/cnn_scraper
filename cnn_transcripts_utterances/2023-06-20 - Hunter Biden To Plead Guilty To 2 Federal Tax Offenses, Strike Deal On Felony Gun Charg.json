      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, a plea deal for the president's son. The Justice Department says, Hunter Biden will admit he broke federal tax and gun laws. A development already kicking up a hornet's nest of House Republicans.Plus, we have brand new CNN poll numbers. This hour they confirmed Donald Trump's big early lead but not as big as it was. And the former president walks into a trap of his own making. He goes on Fox News and talks a lot about the legal case against him. Did he accidentally confess to some of the crimes he's accused of committing? I am Dana Bash, let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, crimes and punishment. We learned this morning that Hunter Biden plans to plead guilty to tax crimes, not paying his taxes on time. We also learned that the president's son struck a deal to avoid prosecution on a gun charge. And we're told prosecutors will ask Mr. Biden be put on probation. I want to go straight to Delaware where this all went down. That's where CNN correspondent Kara Scannell is. So, Kara, is the case closed against Hunter Biden?",

      "sentences": "Well, Dana, that's a great question. I mean, we do see that this has been a five-year long investigation. They have looked at so many different areas of Hunter Biden's business dealings. They were, he was under investigation, one point for money laundering for potential foreign lobbying violations.And in the end, he pleaded he's agreed to plead guilty to those two tax misdemeanors for failing to pay taxes in 2017 and 2018, about more than $100,000 for each of those years. And then also striking a deal to essentially divert from pleading guilty to a federal gun possession charge because he was an addict at the time that he held the gun according to the court filings for about 11 days. Now, the Hunter Biden's attorneys have issued a statement in which they said, with the announcement of two agreements between my client Hunter Biden and the United States attorney's office for the District of Delaware. It is my understanding that the five-year investigation into Hunter is resolved. Now the U.S. attorney's office put out a statement from the U.S. attorney here in Delaware, David Weiss, who was a Trump appointee. And they said the investigation is ongoing. Now, it does remain a little bit murky here. Sometimes that is the type of boilerplate language that is in a press release until the case is ultimately resolved, which would be when Hunter Biden enters that guilty plea when a judge signs off on it. And then when he is ultimately sentenced. And, you know, according to our sources, this U.S. attorney has agreed to recommend to the judge that Biden receive a sentence of probation, so no jail for those tax misdemeanor charges. You know that it's something that the judge will ultimately have to sign off on. Dana?",

      "sentences": "So, what's interesting to me is how this is all concluded in the past several weeks. We know that this investigation has been going on for years. Last summer, CNN reported that prosecutors at that time had narrowed it down to a few possible tax charges and the question of a possible gun charge, then nothing for seven months.And at that time, as we reported Hunter's lawyers asked for a meeting. And back in April, they made their pitch to DOJ about why Hunter should not be charged. They said, look, he paid these taxes back with fees and penalties. You should not be charged in those. They also pointed to a recent Supreme Court decision sort of expanding Second Amendment rights and said, it's going to be hard for you to prove your case beyond a reasonable doubt. We know in recent weeks, negotiations have really ramped up between Biden's attorneys and the Justice Department calls back and forth, which finally resolved this deal with this deal. So, I think it's significant that even though it's taken years, right, for this investigation to play out, it really appeared to heat up in the past about eight to nine weeks since that DOJ meeting. And finally, they've been able to negotiate an agreement to resolve this.",

And so, the first thing to take away from this is that it's really nothing remarkable for any investigation to end this way as a dip. Now, this kind of agreement based on tax charges and gun possession charge, it's not uncommon. It's really pretty straightforward and basic.Now, the question is, where do you go from here? And I know a lot of people are reading into the use of the word ongoing in the statement, and maybe there's still an ongoing investigation on Hunter Biden, we shall see. Congress is certainly going to be investigating this. Look for a report from them. But just on the books of a federal investigation, this was a really, by the books, it's a straightforward deal.",

It was striking that the Hunter Biden legal team released a statement saying, that their understanding, is that case closed.And then David Weiss, who is -- we should remind people, the U.S. attorney who was a holdover from Donald Trump. He's a Trump appointed U.S. attorney. Biden kept him on in Delaware, pretty much for this reason, because this investigation was going on of his son. And he said that this is an on -- basically that it's not case closed. Have you read that with your legal glasses on? CARRIE CORDERO, CNN LEGAL &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: Yes. I mean, there's a couple different possibilities. This is obviously a really significant milestone, both for the Biden family and for the Justice Department's investigation. Five years is a long investigation. I think, to end up with fairly minor charges in terms of the plea that has been arranged misdemeanors. So, I think on one hand, if the defense attorneys are saying, our understanding is case closed, then then that is what they believe has been communicated from the Justice Department to them in their ongoing negotiations. And it seems like that would have factored in to Hunter Biden's decision to go forward with this plea agreement. The ongoing part from the U.S. attorney, it could be that he's saying that because there is this interim period of time before Hunter Biden actually is arraigned and an orally enters the guilty plea. And so, the case still needs to formally close. That could be part of it. I guess we have to hold out the possibility that there is some other aspects of it, but I think that's less likely than more or less.",

KEVIN MCCARTHY, (R-CA): It continues to show the two-tier system in America. If you are the president's meeting political opponent, the DOJ tries to literally put you in jail and give you prison time. If you are the president's son, you get a sweetheart deal.

If McCarthy is suggesting to me that perhaps that Hunter Biden should have gotten up to 10 years in prison, and although each case is different. McCarthy says, it is similar to other cases in which similar people who could face similar charges who could face up to 10 years in prison, no secured nodes. It's unclear exactly which cases he is referring to.

What is happening inside the right wing, Republican ecosphere, if you will, which is that one of the animating principles for the Republican electorate right now in the modern day Republican Party is this notion of a two tiered system of justice, the weaponization of the Justice Department, of not everyone being treated equally, and of course, of the elite versus you, the little guy, and all of that gets encompassed in this.And so, you see, across the board, no matter what kind of Republican presidential candidate, you are, Nikki Haley or Ron DeSantis, they're not exactly in the same camp on things, even Asa Hutchinson, who hasn't been like them on a bunch of other things. They're all singing from the same song sheet here of this is worthy of investigation. And this is evidence of not everyone being treated equally, and that will continue to fuel that animating force among Republicans. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: I mean, absolutely. And I think what's interesting is, it's almost like this is chapter two have a major theme of this election, which is going to be portraying when it comes to the Republican narrative, portraying the Justice Department as partisan, started out with the federal indictment of Trump. And now you're going to see them also seized on this deal to continue those accusations. And it's a difficult position for the White House because even in chapter one, if you will, with a federal indictment, you didn't really hear the White House forcefully come out and defend and try to rebut those statements because they also know that any statement they make will fuel a perception that the White House and the Justice Department aren't connected here. So, now you have another situation where you're going to have Republican candidates continue to make these accusations. The White House can't really come out and forcefully rebut them or defend the actions of the Justice Department, because there is a strategy to say, look, that institution is independent, we're not going to speak on behalf of them. The result may be Republicans controlling the narrative. BASH: Yes. And as much as we understand the politics, and we're explaining and giving context around the politics, we also should talk about the facts, which are that it was a Trump appointed U.S. attorney in in Delaware, intentionally kept there by Joe Biden, because he knew this investigation was going on. And that these cases are quite different. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes. They're absolutely different. And when Republicans talk about, they leave out a lot of facts in each instance, that kind of walk around and dance around to make it seem like these are similar, but these are obviously apples and oranges cases. You talked about chapter one and chapter two. I'm going to go to the preface. I guess, where John Durham is on the Hill, testifying today and tomorrow, and a public hearing tomorrow, where they're going to go in the way back machine and talk about the 2016 campaign and an investigation and talk about his report, where he found that there was no politicization, no criminal activity by the FBI when it came to Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign. But Republicans are going to use this also as a platform to talk about the two-tiered system of justice, and that everything is rigged against Donald Trump.",
