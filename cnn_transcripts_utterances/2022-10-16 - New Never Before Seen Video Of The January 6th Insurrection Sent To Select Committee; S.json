I mean, people seem to forget at this point, but Saudi Arabia and the United States have fought not just one, but two wars side by side. The first one was back in 1990 when we expelled Saddam Hussein's troops from Kuwait. More recently in 2014, again, our troops fought side by side to defeat the terrorist group known as ISIS in Iraq and Syria.So, I mean, if that's not the definition of an alliance, I don't know what is and we certainly consider the United States to be our strongest partner, it has been for the past 80 years and it is by far our most important strategic partnership and we certainly look forward to continue well into the future.",

When we went back that night, I indicated that on 9/11 we had an attack from the enemy without a foreign enemy.Sadly, on January 6th, we had the enemy within and even more sadly it was clear that the president of the United States and the Department of Defense were not acting in a way that one would expect when an attack was made on the capitol of the United States, trying to determine our constitutional responsibility of the counting the votes for president of the United States through the Electoral College. So, a lot of anger, a lot of shock, a lot of frustration that the -- as has been reported, that Mr. McCarthy had about this president, that he had excused and rationalized over the years, his actions, was doing something that -- at that point in time, he said was absolutely unacceptable. We all agreed with that. And as you saw on the video, we all were trying to contact officials -- and I talked to -- not only did I call Angela Alsobrooks, but I also talked to Governor Hogan about the National Guard and his deploying the National Guard, and his response to me was, we have -- we are ready to do that. We have called the Department of Defense. We called Secretary McCarthy, Secretary of the Army, and they have not given us authority to do that which apparently, he felt he needed. You know, ultimately that happened, but it happened way too late and it appears that it happened in a way that the acting secretary thought he was doing what Donald Trump wanted. And that is not to get in the way of those people he had invited to Washington, incited in a speech in front of the White House, and then deployed with the admonition to them to go down there and stop the steal. Of course, over 60 courts had decided there was no steal. There was no fraud that affected the outcome of the election, and then told them, instructed them fight like hell, which is exactly what they did, and some police died. Many, many, over 100 police officers were injured. The constitutional duty of the Congress was impeded and stopped just for a while. As you saw in the video, we were all very committed to going back that day, that night and finishing our business.",

And as Chuck Schumer pointed out, if the Pentagon had been under attack, there would have been an immediate response. Well, the capitol of the United States, democracy itself was under attack and there was a failure to respond in a timely, effective fashion. I was talking to people in my office, they were terrified. There were people milling about. They heard a gunshot. They heard cries of -- for the death of the Speaker and the death of the Vice President of the United States. This was a terrible, terrible event and we all agreed on that. And we all agreed that we need -- we were going to go back and finish our business. And Senator McConnell was very angry obviously.

The infrastructure bill, trying to get at supply lines because we know that the lack of supplies is one of the reasons costs have gone up. Unfortunately, we got very few Republicans voting for that bill and for the Rescue Plan, we got no Republicans. Then we passed an Inflation Reduction Act and a CHIPS bill. The Inflation Reduction Act directly is bringing costs down for medical -- health care, prescription drugs for seniors and others. And that is one of the major costs of many Americans. Groceries and gasoline, the president has acted to release supplies of petroleum products from off of the reserve that we have and as a country for emergencies. That did bring prices down, but they seem to be going back up. They're not as high as they were obviously by far. But I think the American people is going to look at what the Democrats have done in terms of legislation that -- not that we promised, but that in fact, we passed, has been signed into law and is helping them and helping our economy grow jobs, lowering costs, making sure the better-paying jobs and long-term security for our people and safe communities.

We dealt with health care costs. We've dealt with a plan to make sure people had money in their pockets, kids were in school and that shots were in arms. Most of the meetings I go to, people aren't wearing masks. They feel comfortable coming together. Why? Because we passed legislation. Not a single Republican voted for that legislation to get those shots in arms, over 200 million of them. So, I'm bullish. Pat Ryan won in New York. A district that we weren't supposed to win. Mary Peltola won a district in Alaska that hasn't been represented by a Democrat for 50 years, beating Sarah Palin in that jo, and then Kansas. One of the big issues is whether or not we're going to have freedom. Freedom of choice for women to (inaudible) on health care. So, I think that -- I think things -- as the American people analyzed and they analyzed also the rationalization of what happened on January 6th when they saw the violence in these hearings. They've seen police killed. They saw over 100 policemen, law enforcement officials injured by violent insurrection at the capitol, which the Republican National Committee called legitimate political discourse.
