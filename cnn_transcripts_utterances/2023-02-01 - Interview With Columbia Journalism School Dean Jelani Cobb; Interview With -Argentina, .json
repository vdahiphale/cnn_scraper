It's not only pervaded by white people. That there are black people who were exposed to these kinds of ideas and adopt the same sort of mindset as a result of them. There are many possible dynamics at play here. You know, the culture of the department, the psychology of the individual officers, the group dynamics of the five people who were abusing him, and a whole array of other things.

It's not impossible for a system to both have representation of people who are being exploited and used those people to further the exploitation, you know, particular communities. And so, you know, if we were just doing a quick survey of this, you know, Martin Luther King talked about the pernicious effects of internalized racism. W. E. B. Du Bois, the great scholar, talked about it in the Brown versus Board of Education case which outlawed segregation. The psychologists pointed to the kind of self-hating dynamic that racism and white supremacy tended to instill on the minds of people who were subjected to it. So, it's a very long history here.

And it isn't lost on most people, men and women, that we are well and significantly behind other countries, similar countries to ours in terms of the way we reached out and embrace our families.

There have been lots and lots of proposals given by lots of lots of people. But I am really hopeful now that we are in kind of an inflection point where honestly COVID, sort of, opened our eyes. Open the eyes of most people to understanding what was going on in people's homes, literally, as they were wrestling with the issues of taking care of their families. Not just our children but, frankly, themselves and their older parents and that, sort of, responsibility. And so, it's that anything changed with COVID, we were always doing these things, but I think it became much more visible and much more obvious to people. And now, I would also say with the Congress being as relatively speaking evenly divided, the Republicans in the majority, the Democrats in the minority in the House and the opposite in the Senate, maybe now is the time, really, to you know, put this stuff together and to figure out where the optimized solution will be on this.",

I'm not Pollyanna-ish enough to believe that somehow we are special or unique and that we will crack this problem open and solve for this problem where many, many people have not. But I do believe that we are in a unique time and that this is a unique opportunity. And I do also believe that in my limited time here in Congress, I've been here for four years, that fortune favors the bold. And that every once in a while, something miraculous happens in a place like Washington and things break open. You know, the reason why we have paid leave for federal employees, actually to Stephanie's point, came as a combination of rare Earth elements, and we can have a longer conversation about that. And the fact that we had an overabundance of tungsten in the stockpile combined with a very amenable chair, Chairman Smith on the NDA -- on the Armed Services Committee, combined with Ivanka Trump being very much an advocate for family leave. And that collision of weirdness ended up and being able to allow for more than 2 million federal employees to have leave. And so, I am just gung-ho enough to believe that there is that sort of opportunity. And if, for some reason, Stephanie and I and our group doesn't succeed in solving the entire problem, our mission is to try to make sure we allow for more people to have more leave -- more paid leave. And if we do that then we have, in many cases, succeeded.",
