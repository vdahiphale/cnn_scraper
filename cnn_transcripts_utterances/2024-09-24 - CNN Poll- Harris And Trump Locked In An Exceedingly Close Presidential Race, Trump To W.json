And I would just finally say, yes, reproductive rights do matter. Access to IVF, to the whole suite of care that women care about, whether it be abortion or so on.

And you're seeing both campaigns in different ways, begin to try to address that deficiency. And so, whether it is Donald Trump adding some language in about reaching out to women voters, whether you've got Kamala Harris now saying she's going to take out her gun and shoot anyone who's coming into our house. Both are adjusting their rhetoric because what you're seeing right now is that they've been trying to max out their strengths with types of voters and they're actually hitting the ceiling right now.

There are a lot of things that they didn't like about him, he kept showing up in the same way which was sometimes embarrassing, sometimes offensive -- all those things. Now, he's facing a candidate who is the new shiny thing, and people are sort of maybe willing to take a gamble on her. And he can't quite find a way to go after her. And as a portion of this electorate, since Dobbs, women in the electorate have shown that they're really interested in abortion. This is a very important issue for them. And he's the one responsible for taking away the right to abortion for American women, and I think he knows it's just very hard for him to get around that issue, which is why if he's trying to make this case, the case is, you've got to stop thinking about abortion because he knows if they're thinking about abortion, they're not voting for him.",

They're much more disciplined, they're much more focused on growing the economy, rebuilding the middle-class, and securing the border. He's not talking about taking legal Haitians out of the country and sending them back to their country. So, there is -- there is this question: Are voters going to see the campaign that is being run kind of behind his back and on the airwaves, or are they paying attention to what the principle is actually saying?

I mean, we're probably not the only ones tonight talking about the things that he's saying. Because of the things he's saying are so provocative and meant to be that you forget about the sort of basic issues that he was there ostensibly to talk about. I agree with Matt that he may think this energizes his base and at the end of the day, turnouts is going to be very important. This is close election, but in fact, in the CNN poll and other polls, there are voters who are still saying that they are willing to reconsider their decision. There's still voters who are on the bubble. There are voters who are voting for Donald Trump who don't like Donald Trump. They don't like the way he behaves. They don't like this, and they're voting for him because they think that on issues that are important to him, to them, that he may help them.

Donald Trump has an 11-point lead over the vice president United States on the issue of the economy. Now, the economy to many people means inflation, it means cost of living, it means housing affordability, but an 11-point lead. So take the glass half empty approach to that. You're the vice president, six weeks from tonight we count votes, you think, oh my God, that's a deep deficit. Now, let's take the glass half full approach. How is she still competitive when she's down 11 points on the number one issue? That tells you as, David Axelrod, said in the last segment, there are a lot of voters out there who might think Trump is better on the economy, but who don't really want to vote for him. So, this is the fight in the final six weeks of the campaign. Unlikely she could overcome that gap, but can she narrow it?

Let's start with President Biden, 37 percent of success, 63 percent of failure, right? Elections are about change. Donald Trump is not disciplined. You touched on that the first segment, there's no debate about that, but his advertising has been, about 90 percent of it, a great analysis by our David Wright today, about 90 percent of it negative ads. What a lot of those ads do? Tie Kamala Harris to this, the American people think the Biden presidency six in ten do, more than that is a failure. So let's look at the Trump presidency. It's a split verdict, but it's a little bit better, right, 51 success, 49 percent failure. So, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are in an election where voters want change. Donald Trump is trying to say this wasn't so bad. That's bad. And she's part of it. That's part of the dynamics she needs to wrestle. It's hard. She's an incumbent vice president. It's hard to win the presidency when you're the incumbent vice president. Al Gore won the popular vote, lost; George HW Bush did win. It's a very hard challenge, but I'd call it the tale of two presidencies. Right now, if Trump can continue to link her to that, it's a problem.",

So don't take these numbers as Bible or as gospel. But we've seen this in other data as well. Biden got 87 percent of the black vote in 2020 in the exit polls. Harris is getting 79 percent. So that's not way below, but in a close battleground, like a Pennsylvania, like a Michigan, like a Georgia, it could be absolutely critical. So let me slide this over and let's just pop-up Latino votes, and we'll look at this and then we can start the conversation. Among Latino voters, it's quite similar. Kamala Harris at 59 percent right now in our national poll. Again, give or take with the margin of error. Joe Biden got 65 percent on election day. Donald Trump got 32 percent. This is actually a more important number from my perspective. Donald Trump got 32 percent nationally among Latino voters in 2020. He's around 40 percent in our poll. Again, have a little give and take for the margin of error, but he is performing better. So among black voters, again, you know, that's Philadelphia, that's Detroit, that's Milwaukee, that's Atlanta and the suburbs around them.

She's not giving interviews. She's not telling anybody.My sense is this this, this move comes because two issues. One, immigration. People in the African American community, in the cities, I see and hear and read. You know, the immigrants who are coming across the border are being basically dumped in the cities and taking, you know, they're closing down, you know, community centers and they're getting benefits and members of the African American communities think that's unfair. Same with the Hispanic community. And I think the second is economics. You know, people want better jobs, they want the economy to go better, and they perceive that things are doing much better under former President Trump than they are in this current administration. You know, again, she is part of the current administration, she's hooked her wagon, for better or for worse, to Joe Biden. And since she's not been out there talking, Anderson, she's not been out there explaining her plan in any detail, whatsoever, people are left to kind of wonder how their lives are going to be better. When she was asked in a canned interview with Oprah, she knew the question was coming. What are you going to do to make the economy better? That young couple asked her. She couldn't provide a concise answer. Well, here are the three bullet points. She kind of wandered around. And so, I think, you know, these -- you know, groups aren't monolithic.

And I think the black community should be applauded.Listen, I -- Kamala Harris still has a lot of room to grow even with the black vote. She really does because, remember, she's only been running for president for a few weeks here, and she's been able to consolidate this party and she's been able to move forward. And so I agree with David. The more people hear from Kamala Harris, the more they like her.
