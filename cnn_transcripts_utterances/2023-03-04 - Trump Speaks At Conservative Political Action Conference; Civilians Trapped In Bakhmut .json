I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.Tonight former President Donald Trump is being showered with MAGA love at the annual CPAC gathering where his base has seemingly seized control. And the man who tried but failed to overturn the 2020 election results appears to be his party's frontrunner at least for now according to recent polls. Late this afternoon, CPAC released its very own nonscientific straw poll. Trump crushed the politician seen as the biggest rival for the nomination, at least at this point, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, 62 percent to 20 percent. CNN's Kristen Holmes joins us now from the CPAC gathering. Kristen, how's it been going so far? What's the former president saying?",

There's a mix of old and new. He talked about how he wants to take on the establishment, particularly the Republican establishment.He talked about how he got rid of political dynasties, he said the party would never go back to being the party of Karl Rove, Paul Ryan, and Jeb Bush. And he also separated himself from other Republicans by essentially calling for isolationism, to saying that we will no longer be -- excuse me, that they would no longer be the Republican Party, the party of giving money to endless wars.

You mentioned Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, even though he is not of course in the presidential race, he is largely seen as Trump's most formidable opponent should he run. Trump did take a veiled jab at DeSantis when he was talking about the Republican Party and not going back to the party of the past. He mentioned specifically not going back to a party that wanted to cut Medicare or Social Security. This is a veiled jab at DeSantis who, when he was in Congress, suggested changes to those programs.

Many individuals that I've spoken with, donors alike, aren't necessarily sure of that. Can he pull over swing voters, can he regain a movement and positioning with suburbanites? That doesn't appear to be the case if you look at the last presidential, it doesn't appear to be the case if you look at the most recent midterm election. And that is a concern that many in the party including donors, including other strategists, and even those working with some of the folks who are Trump supporters who's saying, you know, we want to win, and yes, we like Trump, but is he the best person to help us get across that finish line?",

Those guys really aren't activists and participants in the modern-day Republican Party.So there's this question, right, Jim, on what does it mean to be a conservative over the next four years. Who's going to be the individual or individuals to take that mantle and the charge of defining what conservative policies and positions will be as far as legislation goes. And I don't think the party has quite figured that out. The CPAC has had many CPAC versions, Florida, many other states across the country, for two years now. And if you look at the crowd, it's a very low, it's a dim crowd. And I think that's indicative of the fact that many in the party are trying to figure out where do we go after Trump. Do we stick with him or is it time to move on?

I think when you look at many of the struggles that a more diverse country is presently dealing with and facing, what's the conservative answer, Jim, to many of those questions? What's the conservative answer to police reform, the conservative answer to education, the conservative answer to infrastructure or climate change? Those things no longer intellectually exist the way they once did in the past.

And of course huge cost both to the Russians and to the Ukrainians of trying to fight for this town.That's been the Ukrainian strategy in the past, in towns like Severodonetsk. There's a chance holding on as long as they can to try and degrade Russia's ability to continue waging this war, whether it comes to fire power or manpower again. They say they have achieved this in Bakhmut and that every hour gained is important for them to try to obtain as they to prevent Russian forces from taking the next step which will inevitably be moving westward already.

And as Melissa was pointing out, this is street-to-street fighting. This is one of those times when things get rough really quickly. So urban warfare is a very difficult thing to predict. It could, you know, last a few hours for them in Bakhmut, or it could last several more days. I would give it about 12 to 24 hours before the Ukrainians really should consider withdrawing. I think it's, you know, high time that they do that in order to save as many of their troops as possible.

I know that's, you know, right now in the impossible realm because there's no air traffic going into Ukraine.

And since Bakhmut is part of the Donetsk Oblast which is part of the Donbas, it is really part of their effort to recapture all of that. Bakhmut was the scene of fighting back in 2014, and of course it's been -- we've been doing this for the last seven months now in that area. So the Russians will want to consolidate some of their gains, but then they'll try to move along that road and try to get into that western part and the northeastern part of the country as quickly as possible.

It's looking into January 6th and the efforts to overturn Trump's 2020 election loss. The sources say Trump is asking a federal court to block Pence's testimony on executive privilege grounds. And CNN's Jeremy Herb has the latest. JEREMY HERB, CNN POLITICS CORRESPONDENTfrom Trump's legal team is the latest roadblock for Special Counsel Jack Smith as he tries to compel testimony from Pence and others around Trump in the January 6th investigation. The new filing is still under seal. So we don't yet have specifics on the arguments that Trump's team is making. But sources tell CNN that Trump is asking a federal court to block Pence from speaking to the special counsel about certain matters related to January 6th on the grounds of executive privilege. Pence himself is also fighting Smith's subpoena. He said that he plans to try to block the subpoena by arguing he's shielded by the Constitution's Speech and Debate Clause which protects the legislative branch from certain law enforcement actions. Pence argues that he is covered because he was acting as president of the Senate when he presided over the January 6th certification of the 2020 election. Pence, of course, was at the center of Trump's efforts to overturn the election as the former president and his allies pressured the vice president to block Joe Biden's win when Congress certified the election on January 6th. The subpoena to Pence is one key sign that the special counsel's investigation into both January 6th and the Mar-a-Lago classified documents is accelerating. The fight over Pence's testimony is now expected to play out in court, but it's not yet clear how long that process will take. And any rulings could possibly be appealed all the way up to the Supreme Court. That means that the special counsel will now have to weigh how important Pence's testimony is with his desire to complete this investigation as the 2024 election gets closer and closer -- Jim.",

We've heard that there are other senior members of the White House group around Trump who have been into the grand jury and testify. They have put up the same sort of, you know, objections to whether or not this was subject to executive privilege, whether there is any sort of attorney-client privilege.So these arguments have been made by people in the White House prior to Mike Pence raising it, so for both -- and Donald Trump in this case -- so you have these two sort of overlapping privileges. They are logical, you know, arguments to make if you're trying to delay or prevent something. I don't think given the path that at least as has been reported that the Chief Judge has taken with this grand jury that they will ultimately succeed. But as Jeremy pointed out, you know, whatever, Chief Judge Howell decides, there is an appeal to the DC Circuit Court of Appeal, which is typically initially a three-judge panel that can be appealed to the full Circuit Court of Appeals, and then ultimately, that can be appealed to the Supreme Court.

Norfolk Southern, the owner of the train confirming that it was one of their freight trains, approximately 20 cars of the roughly 212 cars derailed while traveling south near Springfield, Ohio. That's several hundred miles west of East Palestine. And again no hazardous material believed to be on board though they do have representatives on their way to the scene to assess the situation and find out a little bit more. Ohio State Route 41 heavily impacted right now because of just an absolute just disastrous scene. Really, it's going to be more of a cleanup mess and a headache.
