His army records show the 40-year-old was a petroleum supply specialist in the Reserves, but never served in combat. A former Army Reservist who served with Card telling CNN that he is a skilled marksman, an outdoorsman who was among the best shooters in his unit. While he was training in upstate New York over the summer, Card reported hearing voices, and threatened to shoot up a National Guard base -- according to law enforcement sources. The National Guard saying he was, quote: Behaving erratically. He was transported to a hospital at the U.S. military academy for medical evaluation and stayed for two weeks. His family telling CNN he did not have a long history of mental health issues, quote: This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is. His sister-in-law said, quote: This is a good family. On his Twitter page, Card liked right wing posts including by Tucker Carlson, Donald Trump Jr., Republican members of Congress and multiple posts criticizing President Biden on the economy. His social media also shows photos of him fishing. Card's vehicle was found at a boat ramp less than 20 miles from the shooting scene, and public records show he also owned a boat. The Coast Guard is also part of the search. According to another former soldier who served with Card, he had extensive training, including land navigation, quote: So he would be very comfortable in the woods. The shooting was in Lewiston, Card's most recent address is in a rural area of a nearby town called Bowdoin, according to public records, which also show that his family owns a series of properties nearby. Law enforcement sources say Card recently split up with a longtime girlfriend, and they are pursuing a theory that he allegedly targeted the bowling alley and bar because he used to go there with her and was supposed to be at the bar that night. COL. WILLIAM ROSS, MAINE STATE POLICE: Based on our investigation, we believe this is someone that should not be approached. BROWN (voice-over): Card's brother telling CNN, they are trying to reach him, urging him to surrender. Quote: We have helped law enforcement in any way possible, and the police have been given anything that we can offer to facilitate their efforts.",

The Prime Minister said security will be the top priority as the communities are made whole again. Meanwhile, volunteers were at the site of one of the many massacres cleaning up the terrible aftermath. I'll warn you the video contains graphic content. The location is Kibbutz Holit near the Egyptian border. The cleaners are volunteers with Zaka, a group that gathers the bodies of Israelis who died from unnatural deaths.

      "sentences": "Well, exactly. I mean, I think one of the most frustrating thing for them is that they'd like to get humanitarian aid to the Gazans, basically because they know how they are suffering. And French are among those people who have in fact, taken it upon themselves. The government sent off a plane -- plane load of humanitarian aid to Egypt. It has been taken over by the Palestinian Red Crescent, which is a part with the Red Cross.But basically the question is, how does that aid then get into Gaza? Only a dozen trucks went into Gaza yesterday, and the Foreign Minister, Catherine Colonna was on the French radio this morning, saying in fact, you'd need to have hundreds of trucks going in every day in order to sustain, have any kind of a durability about sustaining the people in Gaza for their humanitarian needs. And of course, one of the big problems, she said, was this inspection that has to take place to make sure the trucks aren't loaded with contraband or with things that the -- that the Hamas could turn into weapons or use like fuel. So the process is just nowhere near being very efficient and nowhere near as efficient as is needed in this situation according to those that were there. I mean, as you mentioned, President Macron was there last week -- earlier this week, actually. And in fact, he visited all the leaders of the Palestinians, the Israelis and Egyptians. And in fact, came with this idea of, you know, some kind of a coalition to fight terrorism in the Middle East, the kind of coalition that came together for fighting ISIS. But there's absolutely no appetite that we can see that after that mission to put together something like that. So it's a real kind of a dead-end situation at the moment and it looks like the Israelis are going to go ahead with their military invasion -- Max.",

And that is to not have a ceasefire. They say they're not going to be restricted by any kind of international calls for a ceasefire. They're basically going to go ahead and do their military operation to get rid of Hamas once and for all, as they've always stated many, many times.So I think that, you know, if you say you're going to have a ceasefire, then you're kind of contradicting Israeli plans. And if you on the other hand, say you want a humanitarian pause, maybe you can get enough goods, humanitarian goods in to help support the Gazans. One of things the French did too -- and I should have this earlier -- is that they've sent out a ship. It's a helicopter carrier, but it does have a lot of hospital equipment on it. It has 60 hospital beds, as well as landing craft and other things. And if there was ever to be an evacuation, the French say they've got about 170 people in Gaza they'd like to get out. That includes 50 French citizens. If they ever were going to do an evacuation, this ship would be ideally suited to do that because it has landing craft and other kinds of things. But at the moment everything is at loggerheads. There's not -- there's no sign of any movement on anyone of the fronts -- Max.",

[04:40:00] The IDF says it was targeting Hamas infrastructure in the area were the man's family was sheltering. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz has more and a warning that parts of her report are graphic. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A journalist, some called the Voice of Gaza, mourns over the body of his teenage son. They're taking their revenge by killing our children, he cries. Al Jazeera says its bureau chief in Gaza, Wael Al Dahdouh, lost his wife, 15-year-old son, 7-year-old daughter and baby grandson, all killed in an Israeli airstrike, the network says. The reporter had moved his family south of Gaza City after an evacuation order by the IDF, believing it would keep them safe. This conflict is taking a severe toll on journalists, with at least 24 killed so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Reporters are also facing threats, arrests and censorship. No one and nowhere in this enclave is spared, Palestinians say. Death and funerals are constant. Anguish and agony are on every corner. Every 10 minutes, a child is killed, Save the Children estimates. Anywhere else in the world, it is sons who bury their father, this man says. Why is it different in Gaza? Why do we have to bury our children before they're even grown? Families desperate to keep their little ones safe are taking refuge anywhere they can find. Packed U.N. shelters are turning people away. We can't live like this. We're 17 people living in a school classroom, this woman says. How long are we supposed to live like this? Tell us world, how long? Eking out a living here is difficult and grim. Food, fuel, water, everything is running out. I don't even know what the point is of being here, she says. We're still terrified and we have nothing, no help. We can bear it. We're grownups. But how are these children supposed to handle this? There is no childhood left here for the more than one million kids now trapped in this hellscape. And no way, Gazans say, to keep the youngest safe. Salma Abdelaziz, CNN, London. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, you know the list is long, but the bar is low. And we haven't learned much from either side actually about what Wang Yi and Blinken talked about in detail. But the key take away here is it's now increasingly likely the likely that Xi Jinping, the Chinese leader, is going to be in the U.S. next month to attend the APEC Summit and also meeting with President Biden. Because Wang Yi's visit to the -- to DC is very much seen as time to hash out the final details to pave the way for the Chinese leader to go to San Francisco next month.Now the reason this is happening right now, I think both international and domestic, internationally there is expectation that the two superpowers need to put a floor on this freefall in their relationship. Because especially as mentioned, with global conflicts intensifying and expanding, they really need to work together on a lot of these things, and especially when it comes to Gaza at the United Nations. But domestically, of course, Xi Jinping is still facing strong economic headwinds and also of course, Chinese relations, not just with the U.S., but with many other Western nations and even many of its neighbors, are very strained. So he needs to show this domestic audience here that he is capable of managing and recalibrating relations with other countries, especially with Washington. But all of that though, Max, and I will say, it could be just tactical move because fundamentally the way China and Xi Jinping views the U.S. has really not changed. It's very much about the U.S. is out to contain China's rise and suppress China's interests. That's why he is still very much determined to reshape this U.S.-led world order -- Max.",

And this is something that we see not only on these nice, expensive areas, the resort areas. They -- more poor parts of the city are also suffering. The people are telling us they are not getting help, they're not getting water, they're not getting food. We saw looting in some streets, in some stores, people were coming out. In most cases they were just taking food, water, something to drink. There were some that took advantage of the situation and they walked away with big screen TVs, but mostly people were telling us they just needed something to get by. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
