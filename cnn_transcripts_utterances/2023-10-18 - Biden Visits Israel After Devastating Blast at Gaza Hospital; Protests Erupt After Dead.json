I'm Jake Tapper.President Biden arrived in Israel hours after a devastating explosion in the courtyard of a Baptist hospital in Gaza, a deadly tragedy that the U.S. is now asserting, the U.S. believes Israel is not responsible for. Rather, President Biden said earlier today, it was damage that the Palestinians may have caused. The images emerging are devastating and the descriptions of the deadly aftermath are rather graphic. Here's what a volunteer who went to help clear the remains said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLUNTEER (through translator):  I came at 8:00 a.m. as a volunteer thinking I would help with minor thing, but I was shocked to see unimaginable things like children's corpses, elderly corpses, bodies of dead women scattered, human hands, legs, intestines, and many human bodies.

The Israelis have said, echoing what President Biden announced, they are now willing to allow aid through the Rafah crossing, provided that it does not get diverted to Hamas. They said they will not open up any aid to come through this side of the border, until all of the hostages are released. We know there has been a flurry of diplomacy, desperate attempts to try to get these dozens of trucks that have been waiting now, Jake, on the Egyptian side of the border, since very early on Tuesday morning, to get some of that aid inside to the southern part of Gaza, where according to the U.N., some 600,000 more people have arrived, just in the past few days. But this is a very tricky, complex mechanism to put together, because there are so many different parties involved, because the tensions are so high, because the strikes continue. And as you mentioned, the situation inside Gaza, growing more dire by the minute, food running out, no water, no electricity.

And also, the news is moving so quickly, the continued strikes today, the images of President Biden hugging Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the news that the U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution to call for humanitarian pause. This all just continues to pour fuel on the fire.

They haven't issued any sort of sort of full confirmation saying yes, this is the agreement.There are still questions about the timing of that. That was something the White House had hoped they were going to figure out during this trip. When President Biden's meeting face to face with the president of Egypt, with the leader of Jordan, with these leaders in real life. And instead, he's settling for a phone call, because they canceled on him. And, Jake, that is just remarkable, that for the president to come over here to the Middle East to have this meeting in Israel and to have these other world leaders politely declined to meet with him is really remarkable in and of itself. And it certainly a setback for the White House, and it factors into what that humanitarian aid going into Gaza is going to look like if they are able to set up a safe zone corridor. But, also, you're right, Jake, what the future of this looks like because the White House said Biden had tough questions for Netanyahu about that plan. They didn't reveal those questions were publicly. But, certainly, having that conversation with these other world leaders, who have been more critical of Israel, or certainly, not outright condemning Hamas in the same way that you've seen some other nations do, that's all a big part of this.

Thank you so much for joining. So, earlier today, I spoke with the IDF's Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner and he told me last night that Israeli officials came to the conclusion the IDF was not responsible, that the final termination and evidence was presented several hours after the blast.

The village of Kerem Shalom as well was another village near the crossing where they went door to door, massacring, torturing and murdering people. And Israel have made very clear that we are at war with Hamas, we therefore will not allow our crossings to be used in order to conduct trade and business as usual while they are holding 200 of our people, men, women, children, some babies, elderly people, in captivity. We have no objection to Egypt allowing its border to be used to nourish deliver humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza. And we want humanitarian aid to reach the people of Gaza in the safe zone in the south. For the people who have heeded Israel's warning to temporarily evacuate from the north of Gaza to areas where it will be safer away from intense fighting. And we have a simple demand, that we make sure that the aid actually reach to the people of Gaza, and then it not be stolen requisition by Hamas. Just as we saw two days ago when the United Nations admitted that Hamas had stolen fuel and medicine that was intended for humanitarian purposes inside the Gaza Strip. They then quickly deleted that tweet, but Hamas stole 24,000 leaders a fuel, donated with taxpayer dollars, taxpayer years, taxpayer pounds, and we insist that if they aid is going to go into the Gaza strip, it should reach the people it is supposed to reach, and not reach the Hamas war and death machine as it continues to perpetrate atrocities and rockets to our cities.",

The House is set to vote again, that will be a third time, tomorrow at noon. This comes as CNN is learning that Jordan's opponents have been deploying an interesting strategy on how to pressure the Ohio Republicans to drop out. They are drawing straws for who will vote against Jordan on each ballot so that the opposition to his candidacy appears to grow. The house is now been without a speaker for two weeks after Kevin McCarthy was ousted. With us now to discuss, Republican Congressman Don Bacon of Nebraska. He voted against Jim Jordan for speaker on both ballots. Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. REP. DON BACON (R-NE):  Thank you, Jake.",

One of them read, quote, why is your husband causing chaos, by not supporting Jim Jordan? I thought he was a team player. Your wife responds, who is this? And, then oh, now you have nothing to. Say this person text again, your husband will not hold any political office ever again, what a disappointment and failure he is. People are really tough when they are anonymous.

It's angered my good friend Steve Womack who is a retired colonel, for example, and Mario Diaz-Balart, he's angered. The way to get to assist through intellectual discussion, and to work through the concerns that we have. But to threaten us with primaries, threaten us with the shenanigans and sending anonymous texts and phone calls, they were calling my wife anonymously, as she has recorded some of them.

A spokesman for Jordan said that he's not dropping out, we're going to keep, quote, going.Do you see Jordan getting to 217 anytime soon? Or do you think he's going to keep doing worse and worse? BACON:  I believe he's done. He needs to say -- he needs to withdraw from this. He is going to lose more votes tomorrow, I know it already have. I know who is going to cross over and change. He doesn't have any pathway for the 217. And there's two different reasons why. There's some groups that have worked with him going back ten years, and they've worked with him on appropriations. More senior folks are -- he's caught creating a lot of chaos. I am in the other camp where I don't like how he got here, right? He got here with a small number of Jordan backers who, eight of them, for example, seven of them backed him. There was eight total. That was vacated the chart Kevin McCarthy. Our rule state in the Republican conference, you're going to have 112, right? And they came in with eight. It violated our rules. They filed the rules, you have to have 112. And then we voted for Steve Scalise. He got the majority vote. And then we had five Jordan backers say they would never vote for Steve, right? But only would vote for Jim Jordan right after Steve won. And also at the same time, Jim Jordan told everybody that he would only get behind Steven if he had 217 votes. That is not our rules. What is, in our rules, if you get the majority, you get behind that person, whoever has the majority you vote together on the floor. And so, that was a straw that broke my camel's back there. When those five Jordan folks said they would never vote for Steve, right after the election. But voted for Jim. And Steve was there and he didn't speak up, which means that he is somewhat complicit. You can't play a game where I am the only guy playing by the rules and the other guy is not. It's not American, we believe in fairness and that the law applies to everybody.
