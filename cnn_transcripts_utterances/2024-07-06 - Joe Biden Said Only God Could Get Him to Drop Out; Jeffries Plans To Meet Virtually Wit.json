However, you do expect to do the president to do what he did, and that is to run the risk of this interview to get out there on the stump, as he did today and before and along the way continue to maintain a very busy schedule as president. As I've already said, talking to international leaders today, that's his daily schedule. He's doing it and he will continue to do it. Will he win this race? He will, because Trump is the opponent.

Because actually, when you look at the polling, when you look at other candidates going head to head against Trump, and I should mention that we don't have great polling here, but what we find is that Biden actually does better than some of the other candidates versus Trump, with the exception of Kamala Harris.

Industry analysts expect a 33 percent drop in profits, some $2 billion, when airlines report financial results for the April to June period this year.Now this, after losing nearly $800 million across the industry in the first quarter, airlines face numerous problems, labor costs and jet fuel prices, which are the two largest costs, are both sharply higher this year. This is partly due to better wages making up for years of stagnation. Pilot unions landed double digit pay hikes earlier this year, and flight attendant unions now want comparable raises. [02:45:00] All right. I want to bring in Simon Calder, travel correspondent for The Independent, and he joins us now live from Greece. Thanks so much for being here with us. So, I mean, it seems incredible to me that despite the fact that more people are traveling and prices don't seem to have come down that much, that airlines are losing money. So first, before we get to the why, just typically, how much do airlines make sort of per traveler perennial flights?",

But on average, of course, you are looking at probably wanting to make a profit of maybe on a domestic U.S. flight you'd be looking at 10 or $20 that you would like to make for the average passenger.As you say, first three months of 2024, there was actually a very considerable loss and profits are down. All sorts of things going on here. Partly, of course, it is that we have had since the pandemic, a really, really unstoppable growth in demand will be hitting, I imagine, in the next few days, quite possibly 3 million passengers a day going through TSA security checkpoints. But that demand is beginning to slow. And at the same time, the airlines having expanded their capacity in order to try to make more money, well, they are finding that actually capacity is slightly exceeding the growth in demand, as a result of which, in May, U.S. flights were actually slightly emptier than they were a year earlier, which is pointing in the wrong direction from the airline's point of view.",

Not sure that we're going to get to the same fare levels.Passengers have as they've come back to flying, got accustomed to paying typically 25, maybe 50 percent more than they did before. COVID and in particular, if you look at the North Atlantic routes, so from the U.S. and indeed Canada coming across to Europe, where actually a lot of U.S. travelers are going to get a real bargain this summer because the dollar is strong. Yes, those fares are high. You're looking at a kind of entry level of well over $1,000 for a round trip. But this demand from Europe is weakening because perceptions that, particularly the U.S. is very expensive for European travelers at the moment. And, yes, as you were mentioning, pilots are looking for more cash, big industrial dispute at a Lingus, the Irish airline at the moment, fuel costs going up.

We've seen lots of investigations, the NTSB, the FAA, looking very closely into what Boeing is doing, slowing the production rate to make sure that all those aircraft are coming off the production line safe.That is impacting the supply of aircraft. Certainly Ryanair, which is the biggest budget airline in Europe, has said that they're about 20 aircraft short of where they should be. Having said that hasn't yet fed into the higher fares they were predicting within Europe. It may simply be passengers have had enough yet. We're traveled out now.
