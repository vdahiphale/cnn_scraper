We are monitoring large-scale pro-Palestinian demonstrations across American college campuses driven by arrests at Columbia University's student anti-war encampment. Heavy law enforcement presence at the scene of these protests that so far have largely appear to be peaceful. We're going to read turn to the story later in the program as you see some pictures there coming into us. Also today, deep divisions visible at the U.S. Supreme Court, both outside and inside the chambers, as the nine justices heard the second major case on abortion since overturning Roe v. Wade two years ago. Today, the court weighs a near-total abortion ban in the state of Idaho with a narrow exception only to save the mother's life. The Biden administration says that Idaho law violates a federal law known as EMTALA, which requires that hospitals provide emergency medical care to stabilize patients even in non life-threatening situations. It was part oral argument, part grilling with the three liberal justices, as well as at times Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the four women on the bench, aggressively scrutinizing Idaho's claim. Here's Justice Elena Kagan sparring with Idaho's attorney, Joshua Turner. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN, U.S. SUPREME COURT: Your theory of EMTALA is that EMTALA preempts none of it, that a state tomorrow could say, even if death is around the corner, a state tomorrow could say even if there's an ectopic pregnancy, that still that's a -- that's a choice of the state and EMTALA has nothing to say about it.",

Some of this is tea leave reading, right? When you hear the questions and you cant know how justices is going to decide based on the questions that they ask, but you get some indication.

Of course, Amy Coney Barrett, though, she could be one of the deciding votes here along with the chief justice John Roberts. Both of them ask several questions about the implication of Idaho's law. In particular, they really homed in on who exactly is judging these doctors when they decide if a women's condition is life threatening enough to justify an abortion.Of course, that's a split-second decision many of these doctors are forced to make. And because they know the legal implications are just huge with up to five years in prison, loss of their medical license, most doctors in Idaho are actually hedging on the side of not performing these abortions, even if the woman's life is at risk. You know, we heard from the solicitor general. She said that many hospitals in the state of Idaho are now airlifting, at least one woman every other week out of Idaho, and into a state where they can get an abortion in the event that there's this emergency situation because the doctors there just aren't taking chances and that amount of airlifting is actually way up from previously year. So here's some of the questioning from Justice Amy Coney Barrett. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) JUSTICE SONIA SOTOMAYOR, U.S. SUPREME COURT: What you are saying is that there is no federal law on the book that prohibits any state from saying even if a woman will die, you can't perform an abortion.",

So there was a lot of tension inside the courtroom today. I'll tell you my read on it. Although we heard some skepticism from the chief justice and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, I really do think that, you know, Idaho could quite likely prevail here.You know, EMTALA says nothing about abortion and it might just be vague enough that the conservative justices who often look very closely at the text of a statute and the intent of Congress, they might say that the statute was never really meant to prohibit states from enforcing abortion laws after the overturning of Roe v.

The doctors are so terrified that if another provider says, well, you could have done one other thing and then there'll be prosecuted.And in Texas, 99 years in jail, you know? So it's not -- it's not even about these fine lines that we keep trying to divide. The care isn't happening after the birth of my daughter. I was having a postpartum hemorrhage and I needed the D&amp;C procedure to clear the tissue from my uterus and it might procedure was delayed for over an hour and a half. I went into shock. I started violently throwing up. I was coming in and out of consciousness and I lost over half of my blood volume because for some reason the procedure was delayed.

Students at several colleges have set up encampments protesting civilian casualties in Israel's war against Hamas. There had been arrests, reports, as well of some antisemitic incidents. Some Jewish students have said they are now afraid to walk across campus during those demonstrations. At Columbia, classes have now gone hybrid with a mix of in-person and remote options. Now, that hybrid model will extend to final exams, which began in just a few weeks.

In addition, the U.S. announcing that $1 billion package you just mentioned, it's our understanding that there will be more of these long range ATACMS as well.

And all of these sounds incredibly just went up this morning around 6We've seen over 100 demonstrators gathered here at times singing, chanting, saying things like from Columbia to Brown, Gaza, we will not let you down. And what's interesting is that this is all happening right in front of this building right here. That is the administrative building. That's where school officials are. They can see from these windows this growing encampment here, those chants. So what are these protestors want? We spoke with organizers and they tell me they have to major demands. One is for the school to divest. So when talking about the financials of portfolio, they want them to cut any ties with companies that are somehow connected to the Israeli government. And two, they want them to protect free speech on campus, specifically with 41 students that did a sit-in back in December and they are currently facing charges for that. They want those charges to be dropped. But here in the last hour or so, they've gotten their first real taste of disciplinary action. And organizer forwarding to CNN and email that they got from the student conduct office saying that they are processing a case against them, and we know from the school that it can be anything from suspension up to an expulsion, depending on their level of involvement here. The school Brown tells us that they have also checked IDs and in fact, we saw this in the last couple of hours, university police escorting a school employee with a machine, and we saw them scanning student ID after student ID after student ID. The school tells us that that's to verify that these are not outsiders, and for school safety as well. Now, in terms of police action that you asked us about, the school tells us that an encampment is not grounds. It's not an arrestable offense, but say that if this does escalate too laws being broken or to the need of them dispersing this encampment, that police could be involved, brought on campus, and arrests may happen.",

Trump himself will once again be sitting in a Manhattan courtroom for his criminal hush money trial. Here in Washington, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear his appeal for immunity, quite broad immunity in his federal trials. The nine justices, three of whom were appointed by Trump, will take up the question of whether the former president should be exempt from prosecution for virtually anything related to the presidency. That question has delayed special counsel Jack Smith's prosecution of Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. CNN senior political analyst and senior editor at The Atlantic, Ron Brownstein wrote about the role, the enormous role the Supreme Court has taken on in the U.S. Great piece, it's such an important point, a quote from you here. You're right. Indeed, rulings by the GOP-appointed majority have delivered conservatives victories on issues that Republicans had virtually no chance to achieve through congressional or presidential actions, from retrenching federal voting rights laws, limiting federal and state gun regulation to ending the constitutional right to abortion. I might add to that list, money in politics going back to Citizens United. I just wonder given, I mean, we've certainly seen on abortion rights pushback from Democrats and voters really of all stripes. Given that these are issues that are deeply unpopular, right? The Supreme Court positions why not more pushback --",
