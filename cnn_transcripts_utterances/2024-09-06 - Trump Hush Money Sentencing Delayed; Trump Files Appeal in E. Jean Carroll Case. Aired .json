      "sentences": "Yes, Boris, so Donald Trump appeared in court today.The whole session was less than 30 minutes. And he was not required to attend, but he chose to show up for this oral argument. This was him appealing the verdict where the jury awarded E. Jean Carroll $5 million and found that Trump sexually abused her and then defamed her when he denied that she that he raped her, said he didn't know her and suggested that she made up the whole story to sell copies of a book. So he walked into the courtroom today. It's a small courtroom, pretty narrow. He walked right past E. Jean Carroll sitting in the front seat of a table. There was a seat across the aisle that was empty at Trump's table. He chose not to sit there and walked to the other end to take the seat furthest from E. Jean Carroll. At no point that I see any eye contact between the two. The focus, though, was on the attorneys in this relatively quick court hearing. Now, his lawyer John Sauer began by telling the judges that this was a quintessential case of he said/she said and that this was funded by Trump's political enemies. So one of the appeals court judges cut him off then and said, this case is about your arguments here about the evidence. So let's focus on those arguments. And he also reminded Trump's lawyer that it is very difficult to overturn a jury's verdict and asking him to really focus in on that. And what Trump's lawyers argued is that a testimony from two other women who both accused Trump in the past of sexual assault should not have gone before the jury, arguing that it wasn't even a crime when one of these women testified that in the 1970s Trump groped her on an airplane. He said that wasn't even illegal then. It shouldn't have come in into this trial to -- last year. Now, Carroll's attorney got up and said in fact it was a crime to assault anybody on an airplane, even if it wasn't a sexual assault. So that was one of the technical legal arguments they were making. Another one was that they said the \"Access Hollywood\" tape should not have come in. That was Trump's lawyer saying that he shouldn't have been able to play that before the jury. Carroll's lawyer said it was essentially a confession when Trump said on that tape caught on that mic about how he would just grab women because he's a celebrity. He said they let him do it. Now, no decision today. Trump left without answering questions from reporters. Of course, he went then to Trump Tower and spoke a lot about this court hearing today and what he thinks of the trial and the allegations by Carroll -- Boris.",

They also are saying that the judge has to rule on their claims that Trump should not have -- this trial, this verdict should have been thrown out because of presidential immunity. The judge said he will issue that decision the 16th. Trump's lawyers say they need more than two days in order to go to the appeals court if they're going to appeal that. Now, the DA's office, they have not opposed delaying the sentencing. Instead, they're leaving it to the judge. And we're waiting to see what he says -- Boris.",

We know that in many of these legal battles, Donald Trump always sees himself as his own best defender. And he took to the podium today to really air some of his grievances, specifically about the Carroll case, but he also went into a litany of other cases against him as well. And one notable thing is that he actually went into explicit detail about some of the allegations against him made by multiple women about sexual misconduct, not just E. Jean Carroll, but other people as well. He called them all scams. And, of course, we heard many of the language that Donald Trump likes to use when he's talking about his legal cases. He attacked the judges. He attacked and demeaned the women who have made these allegations. He argued that the Justice Department was behind these cases. Of course, we know that the E. Jean Carroll case has nothing to do with the Justice Department. It is a civil case, but he made that claim anyway. And he really went on to just argue that all of these were false and that they were election interference. But one very notable moment that I took away from this, Brianna, was when he was standing up there. He had many of his legal attorneys and legal advisers behind him, and he noted that he's actually very disappointed with them. I want you to take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (R) AND CURRENT U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:  I feel sad that I have to come up here and explain it. I have all this legal talent, but legal talent cannot overcome rigged judges. They can't overcome a 4 percent Republican area. And I'm disappointed in my legal talent, I will be honest with you.

Of course, we are closer to the election now than when we went through a lot of his legal battles in the past few months. But part of this is because he recognized that many people fund-raise for him, donate to his campaign, and it can energize some of them when they hear him talk about these cases.

And partly -- you're partly correct there in that, as you may recall, if we press the way, way back machine, Donald Trump was struggling way before Alvin Bragg filed those first charges. And when Bragg filed the charges against Trump, it kind of galvanized the Republican Party against him, saying like, wow, this is really lawfare. Many commentators, some on this network and others, said that if his name wasn't Donald Trump, the charges wouldn't have been brought. And so -- and these cases wouldn't have been tried. And so I think he's just reminding people of that. But I'm not quite sure that's exactly his motivation for doing it today, other than that he's very angry and he feels he's his own best defense.",

That's Trump's challenge to this whole case after the Supreme Court said that certain evidence of official acts could not come in before a trial. That decision was expected on September 16, a judge saying that he will now do that also in November and not sentence former President Donald Trump until November 26. So now this whole question of whether this verdict stands, where Trump was convicted of 34 counts of falsifying business records in connection with that hush money scheme, and whether he will be sentenced, and, if so, too have time in prison or not time in prison, that is all now pushed off until after the election.

And this is the second time that Judge Juan Merchan, the judge who oversaw that seven-week trial in New York earlier this year, the second time he's delayed the sentencing. The sentencing was originally scheduled for July 11. It was then pushed back to September 18, so that the court could consider the Supreme Court's historic ruling on presidential immunity and how that factored into this case. Now it has been delayed again. And this is -- this could have gone either way, but it is somewhat surprising because, over the course of this entire case, Judge Merchan has not always been sympathetic to many of the arguments that the Trump legal team has made about how a certain aspect of this case could impact the election. But, here, this is an enormous win, again, for the Trump legal team. This is something they were trying everything imaginable to avoid. They did not want to have the sentencing before the election.

He wrote -- quote -- \"There should be no sentencing in the Manhattan DA's election interference witch-hunt. As mandated by the United States Supreme Court, this case, along with all the other Harris-Biden hoaxes, should be dismissed.\" Now, let's unpack that a little bit. Of course, they have tried to frame all of the criminal cases, all four of them that the former president has faced, as part of some sort of larger conspiracy, and here they are also adding in his new opponent, right, Vice President Kamala Harris. Her name has not previously over the past few years been appearing in these statements. But now they are trying to tie her to what they argue are politically motivated prosecutions. But, of course, in this case, the former president was convicted by a jury of his peers on these 34 counts. Now, there is sort of a more eloquent explanation of their case and the argument that they were making that they made in a filing. And I want to I want to read this, because this is what the Trump team argued to a different judge about why they believed that this sentencing should be stayed. They said -- quote -- or should be delayed. They said: \"This is to prevent irreparable harm to President Trump,\" of course former President Trump, \"voters across the country and the integrity of the imminent presidential election, because the potential impact on the election includes continued infringement on President Trump's political advocacy and the public's reciprocal right to receive and engage with that advocacy and damages -- it includes a reputable First Amendment violations.\" So what they were trying to argue over the past few months as they tried to get this delayed is that this was a violation of Trump's rights. They said that, after the Supreme Court's decision in July on presidential immunity, that they had the right to litigate exactly how that case could potentially impact the verdict in the New York criminal hush money case. And they said that they were not being given a fair opportunity to allow those appeals to play out before sentencing him in this case. And this is actually similar to the argument that they made throughout this case. They were constantly arguing that this was politically motivated, that this was somehow preventing his ability to be on a campaign trail. But once the Supreme Court issued their historic decision in July really handing him on this enormous opportunity to revisit this conviction, that has really been how they have framed their arguments. Now, most legal experts do not expect the Supreme Court's decision on presidential immunity will result in this conviction being overturned. But, again, the former president and his lawyers, they do have the right to continue, as they have been vigorously doing so, to litigate those questions.",

Second, just to amplify on Paula's point, if he is sentenced after November, she's absolutely right. A president can't pardon a state crime, but I think it's likely that the Supreme Court would see a principle in the federal Constitution saying you can't impose a criminal penalty on a sitting president. And they would, a little bit similar as they did in the Clinton case, say see you in four years or when his term is over, and then it would follow through. Of course, four years is an eon in Trump time. But I think it's likely that the consequences of the sentence would be stayed during his presidency if he's elected.",
