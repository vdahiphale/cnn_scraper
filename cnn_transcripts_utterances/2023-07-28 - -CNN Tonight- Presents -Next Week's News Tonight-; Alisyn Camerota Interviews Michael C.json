But when the last indictment was released, that specific document was not included even though the recording was featured very prominently in the indictment.So, in the superseding indictment, it was notable to see that they had added this document suggesting that the government is in possession of it and it's a top-secret document. But, Alisyn why wasn't this included in the first one? It's an outstanding question because CNN has learned that this was one of the documents that was actually returned to the archives and that is significant because it makes it harder to argue successfully in court that he willfully retained this. Now, it could be that the intelligence community had some concern about this that has been resolved. It also could be that after prosecutors saw the former president on Fox News insisting there was no document, they wanted to prove that he was lying.",

And so, they're feeding more.But what the sharks ultimately end up doing is leaving these stagnant warm water zones and traveling to new areas. Some of those areas are deeper in the sea where the water is cooler. And some of them, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere, are further North. So, it is really changing the behavior and the dynamic of the sharks so that they can continue to survive and thrive. They're moving location and they're changing how they eat and what they eat more so than just eating more in general.

Often that's in low visibility areas, high turbidity areas, near to river mouths, near to where people are fishing or cutting bait. And so, the sharks are in a feeding mode and they make a mistake.But unfortunately, when a shark makes a mistake, it makes an investigative bite, and then goes, yuck, I don't want to eat that. They don't have hands to go and feel and figure out, is that something I want to eat? They have to taste it. And that's why a lot of these bites that we've seen this summer are not fatal. They're terrible accidents nonetheless, but they're not fatal attacks because the sharks aren't actually trying to eat people.
