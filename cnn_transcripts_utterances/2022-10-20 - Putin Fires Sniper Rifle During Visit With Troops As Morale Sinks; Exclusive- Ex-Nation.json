Just in to OUTFRONT, the words of a newly-drafted Russian soldier sharing incredible details to his sister, talking about firing rusty rifles and worse -- the harsh reality in stark contrast to what we saw from Putin today.Plus, breaking news, a top Trump ally appearing before the grand jury investigating the Mar-a-Lago classified documents, as we learn tonight that Trump's former White House counsel testifies in another major investigation involving the former president. And a couple trying to vote in Arizona allegedly filmed and photographed by a group accusing them of being a, quote, mule. Is this the beginning of a terrible and ugly election? Let's go OUTFRONT. And, tonight, I wouldn't let any of us out there. Those are the brutally honest words from a newly drafted Russian soldier sent to the frontlines in Ukraine. In a phone call with his sister, a soldier revealing the pathetic state of Vladimir Putin's army. We feel it's important for you to hear his voice and to play this for you. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) RUSSIAN SOLDIER (through translator):  Whatever we wear here, we bought ourselves. They are forcing us to go on camera to encourage the mobilized not to be afraid to come out here and fight. We are spending up to 60,000 to 70,000 rubles on our own gear, and what they are giving us, the ammunition, cartridges, et cetera, are all rusty. I repainted the rifle they gave me just so you couldn't see the rust. We are buying everything. Soon, they'll ask us to buy our own grenades. No one is supporting us. To be honest, I wouldn't let any of us out there. They give you blank ammo cartridges which, when shot, simply fall to the ground. They trained us how to handle weapons, artillery, but they took the whole group just once to demonstrate how to use them. Half the group didn't understand, some did. Whatever knowledge we have is thanks to what we've learned on our own. (END AUDIO CLIP)",

And I want to note something else the soldiers that because it's important in this context, because we had the whole conversation. He said that he is not declining to fight. In fact, at some point he says, quote, I am happy to fight. This is not some anti-war dissenter who tried to flee mobilization. This makes his words, how damning and specific they are perhaps even more damning because the harsh reality he details is the polar opposite of the propaganda image and the lies that Putin puts out. Today, Putin making a rare visit to a military center in Russia, with his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, by his side. Putin met with soldiers, they visited a shooting range to do this. Putin firing a sniper rifle for show, for a photo. As the young Russian men he sends into battle are painting their guns to cover the rust, there is, having a good time. Putin putting on the show as he's on the verge of broadening his war in two major ways, one, another possible invasion. There's increasing fear tonight from Ukraine that Russian soldiers were soon reinvade from the north through Belarus. A senior Ukrainian military official warns that Russia made fighter jets capable of carrying cruise missiles have been spotted on airfields in Belarus, and 10,000 Russian troops are in the country for training exercise. I want to note, the last time the country held joint exercises was in February and the days before the invasion. You're looking at an exclusive video that our Fred Pleitgen filmed at the time. Many of the Russian troops there went to invade Ukraine from the north to try to seize Kyiv. Now, the second wave Putin is expanding his way tonight is bringing another country into it. Tonight, we learned that Putin isn't just buying drones from Iran but he may soon get Iranian missiles, say U.S. sources. And while Russia is denying using Iranian made drones in recent attacks, the U.S. says there's abundant evidence there from Iran, but the country putting military members, Iranians, on the ground in Crimea to train Russian pilots.

Again, the Ukrainians are saying they are not going to allow this to hold them back. In fact, they continue to push back the counteroffensive in the south. Here's what we're learning. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PLEITGEN (voice-over):  As Ukrainian forces pressed their counter offensive in the country south, Russia is resorting to what appeared to be increasingly desperate measures in the areas they control in the Kherson region. Thousands of people waiting to be evacuated by boat. The puppet authorities installed by Moscow claiming they've already taken some 15,000 out of Kherson City. Why did you decide to evacuate, the reporter asked. I've a small child to take care of, you see, the woman answers. Russia says it's ferrying these people to safety. The Ukrainians say these are little more than deportations. Russia has imposed martial law in this and other areas of Ukraine, controlled by its forces. The Russians say they are increasingly intensity of their mobilization effort. Russian president Vladimir Putin visiting soldiers outside of Moscow, and himself firing a sniper rifle. Putin's continued aerial assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure is starting to take a toll.

But he wouldn't have the same network among the ground forces folks, who have the tanks, who have the guns.I mean, typically, in Russian history, it's about storming the castle, right, if they're going to launch a coup.

Doug, thank you very much. And as Russia puts soldiers and weaponry inside Belarus, I want to talk to retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. So, Colonel Leighton, this comes from a senior Ukrainian military official who is saying publicly today that a Russian attack on Ukraine from Belarus, that they believe it can happen. They think it's likely and that this time it would originate in the West, which is obviously different from Russia's attack at the start of the war, which was on Kyiv. The West would be all the way by Poland. That senior Ukrainian official says this all could be targeted at NATO supplies coming over those two main border crossings with Poland, and that obviously risks great escalation in this war.

This is where the volume of all the materiel that the Ukrainians get from the NATO countries, from the United States, from other countries, that all goes through that crossing point and a couple other crossing points. But that is one of the main ones right there.So when we dealt with the earlier invasion, we were talking about something that came down this way. But if we're dealing with something that would go into the west, which would basically be designed to cut things off, it would be coming in this way and it would potentially serve to isolate Medyka from the rest of Ukraine. It would also cut them off from Poland, potentially if it gets down far enough, Slovakia and Romania. So, those are the kind of areas that they would interject, which means cut them off, and it would prevent possibly the effort to resupply the Ukrainian armed forces at the most critical juncture of their fight against the Russians.",

As a former commander and a former leader of soldiers and airmen and marines and sailors, I looked at that particular tape and said this would never fly in anything that I was a part of. So, what it shows us is the Russians are really not taking care of their troops. They're not resupplying them. They have a major problem with actually getting all of the things that they need to the front. If those kinds of soldiers are coming to the front, they are definitely not ready to conduct movements like this, either the one they did before which targeted Kyiv, or the one they're planning to do now, allegedly, which could potentially cut the west of Ukraine off from the rest of Europe.",
