      "sentences": "A warm welcome to FIRST MOVE. Fantastic to have you with us for a special, should he stay or should he goedition of the program? Elon Musk running a twitter poll asking if he should step down is CEO. The poll results said 57 percent yes, 42 percent no. So basically they're saying yes, go love him or hate him must always create a Twitter show. Tesla investors meanwhile, clearly fixated on the blow by blow the stock off its highs but still up more than 2 percent pre market and set to bounce off a 52-week low. I think the hope there is that Musk steps down from Twitter and spends more of his time on that Evie firm. It depends a lot on who replaces him at Twitter of course too. Tesla tumbled more than 16 percent over the past week. It's actually down more than 57 percent year to date on both a broader tech turn let's be clear, but also selling pressure as Musk used Tesla stock to finance Twitter stick with me. This comic is third largest shareholder also suggesting last week that Musk stepped down at Tesla too. Oh my goodness, even I'm getting confused. We'll discuss the latest Musk machinations with Tech Analysts Dan Ives later in the show. He's been a Twitter deal skeptic from day one and says the poll gives Musk a graceful way out of what he calls a nightmare few months. Musk's poll followed his attendance and reporting too on the World Cup face-off in Qatar. Yes, he tweeted it throughout the game too. Musk like the rest of us, I think full of praise for a game for the ages. It was too exciting. We'll have all the post-match reaction and live reports from both Paris and Buenos Aires coming right up and from World Cup celebrations and consolidations, constellations. Oh my goodness, it is Monday morning to the stock market's wild holiday gyrations. U.S. investors trying to get into the Christmas spirit after two consecutive weeks of declines, driven by fears that ongoing rate hikes by global central banks will push the United States and others perhaps into recession. U.S. features little changed in European stocks are higher after a softer handover during the Asian session, but the big Monday market story clearly belongs to Musk. And Paul R LA Monica is here quick poll; take it away from me because I can't get my words out clearly this morning. I know that he just still with me. Of course he put out this poll. Yes, we've seen this in the past, though and he'd already made a decision. We think because we saw the filings before he put out the poll. Do you think the same was true in this case? PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN REPORTER: It's possible it's easier to justify having made or making a decision and laying the blame, if you will, at the feet of the Twitter users who voted in the poll. I'm interested to see whether or not he does abide by it as he said he would. Is he going to claim now all of a sudden that the bots are a problem again and that maybe there were too many Elon Musk haters potentially among liberals that were stacking the deck against him? I don't know, but since you quoted the clash in your intro, this indecisions bugging me.",

CNN's Patrick Oppmann joins us live now from the Bahamas. Patrick, we know what he faces if found guilty of all these charges in the United States, and it's at risk of what 115 years in prison?

This is a prison that is got very tough conditions and for a billionaire who is used to living in Penthouse apartments and he has a vegan diet and needs certain medications. And we hear that the prospect of fighting extradition from a prison cell the Bahamas, understandably, was just not that inviting. He had tried to get bail here was continuing to seek bail, but it'd become a drawn out process and he knew that if he stays in the Bahamas, that his home would be this prison. So that appears to have had a lot to do with the fact that he's now apparently. Sources close to the case, tell us ready to leave the Bahamas and we expect within perhaps the next hour or so. Sam Bankman-Fried to arrive here and say that he's giving up his fight against extradition ready to go back to United States on a U.S. government plan accompanied by U.S. Marshals. And begin the new legal process a new in the United States and you're very right facing eight serious charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and other federal crimes that can lead to more than a century in prison if he is convicted. Of course, SPF as he's known, he has said all along that he was not responsible that he perhaps wasn't up on all the details that he should have. But of course, for the people who've lost their savings lost over a billion dollars here. Those explanations just don't wash and certainly the United States government is calling it's one of the greatest cases of financial fraud in U.S. history. And they're looking for other people in his company in his now defunct FTX Crypto exchange to essentially testify against him.

So this going forward is something that we did with a rebranding. But in terms of inflation affecting the things that we're doing, we see that inflation has been teaching since about the middle of this year and declining continuously. Hopefully, the central banks of the world are ahead of this so that we can avoid unnecessary re-spikes in this inflation. But because Fashion and Retail have to plan out things a year in advance, we have to take action now. And because of our re-transformation, what we did was we became basically debt free.

I know whenyou've got a really busy six to 12 month coming up. I'm looking forward to chatting again soon and tracking progress. Great to have you on, thank you, William Pak there, the CEO of Esprit. Still to come here on FIRST MOVE fighting food waste with a fruit candy, yes, you heard me right. The CEO of Climate Candy joining us now with a sweet way to tackle climate change. That's next.

Wemake 2 billion Dum Dums every year, along with many of the other Daljit candies, you know, I got to witness the power candy has the abilities to fun into any moment. And I wanted to push it further extended beyond simply our individual moments into something with even more lasting impact. Like my partner's Kevin Wall and Dr. Seuss Molly did for Live Earth with Al Gore. So my worlds collided when we were in Svalbard, Norway, visiting the Global Seed Bank to learn about food security. I witnessed the United Nations installing generators due to climate change to keep the glacier refrigerated for all the backup seeds of the world. So while on this trip, I was reading draw down by Paul Hawken. And learn that 40 percent of food grown globally is wasted. So I wrote the company business plan in the Arctic Circle for Climate Candy to create Faves candy from imperfect fruits and vegetables for the health of people on the planet.",

Now, I couldn't agree more with you. And as you said, you came from a sort of sweet candy producing family and a pretty big one. Very few people, I think would say they do eat candies, because they're healthy. They eat them because they're naughty. They taste great. And there is a difference, I think because I've tried many of them. And I've tested it on a lot of people as well between Faves and between something like a DUM DUM. Who's the customer here? I guess is the question that I'm asking. And I do think it's an important one. Is it someone who's climate conscious and looking for sort of a relatively healthy alternative to candy?",

So companies are talking about sustainability efforts in a time when consumers expect brands and retailers to do more related to carbon and climate. So with that rising demand, it's a way for shoppers to say we are prepared to stop buying our favorite brands if you don't commit to measuring the product's carbon footprint. So it's high time for people to realize the solution to heal ourselves and the planet is what we choose to eat. And that includes all of us. So we use Faves as an educational moment around one, what is in your food and the need for people to get five to eight servings of fruits and vegetables per day and two, to discuss climate change in an accessible way through candy. So with 25 percent of perfectly imperfect produce going on harvested on farms and these on harvested for produce waste, vital energy and contributed to high end climate change. Climate Candy rescues on harvested fruits and vegetables from farms and gives them new life as Faves candy.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, I think that people are starting to learn about the products that are going to waste and their understanding that climatechange is escalating, while people are going hungry. And this is unacceptable, wasting that much food, all while running out of land, water and healthy soil. So when they look at food loss, starting at the production level and the low market prices and high harvest costs, often that are uneconomical to farmers, it's almost a way for consumers to give back to be involved with those that are making our food. So by cutting food waste by half in the U.S., we would actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 75 million metric tons each year. And that generates an economic return of $75 billion. So I think when we look at the importance of reducing food waste, it leads to several key co- benefits that get it critical issues, climate justice, climate adaptation, water scarcity and biodiversity loss. And that's why we work side by side with the non-profit 501CTHREE, and the founder Drew Fitzgerald. So when I look at what we're doing, you know, in this side of despite Farm to Food Bank, efforts to recover this on harvest of food, the vast majority is left and fields are going to waste. And with food service closing during COVID farms, the typically sold those markets found themselves with huge surpluses. So I think that there's just all this news and people are starting to be more conscious about it.",

And through that, we ended up with Angel Investors that truly believe about what we're doing for health of people and the planet. In regards to where we're going out this year, obviously direct to consumer and E-commerce. So we found that that works through that outlet. But now people are starting to go back into stores. So you're seeing us in the Urban Outfitters, you're starting to see us out there in the markets. And I think that's super important too, is to see us at the retail level, not just seeing us at events at Flippers Roller Boogie Palace where you are there in New York City at Rockefeller Center, or seeing us that those type of things that you would normally see something that's a little alternative, right? So I really want to see us someday in school vending machines. And seeing as in places where it's that educational moment, science centers, aquariums, you know places where families go and they'll remember that they learn this lesson about climate change.",

Callit if you will, a messy open and not in a good way. U.S. stocks softer after last week's more than 2 percent drop for both in NASDAQ and for the S&amp;P 500. And checking in once again on Tesla shares, they are some 2.4 percent higher after the results of a Musk commissioned Twitter poll showed a majority of those who voted wanted him out is the CEO of Twitter, Musk saying he will abide by the results but he has yet to comment on the final poll results. And before we bid farewell to World Cup 2022 let's take a second to toot our own horns here on FIRST MOVE, the Chatterley Cup is accurately predicting the winner of the tournament with Argentina stock market up almost 100 percent so far this year and the French CAC Quarante down some 10 percent. The Chatterley cup pitted World Cup teams against each other to see which country stock markets came up on top on the stock market pitch. I think it was a complete accident. But anyway, we won't mention that again. There'll be many ups and downs since the World Cup began four weeks ago. Our Don Riddell runs us through some of the highlights and some of the lowlights too, take a look at this. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) DON RIDDELL, CNN WORLD SPORT (voice over): It was 12 years in the making arguably the most controversial World Cup of all time. Allegations of corruption and criticism of Qatar civil and human rights records dominated the build-up. But on the eve of the tournament, the FIFA president deflected all of the criticism.",

Saudi Arabia's sensational win against Argentina set the tone for a tournament of upsets, Japan came from behind just on Germany the next day. In the background, the controversy lingered protests about Qatar's domestic policies were brief, but impactful in saying that they were silenced. Germany found their voices and in refusing to sing Iran signaled their empathy for the bloody uprising back home. For some it was a painful World Cup.
