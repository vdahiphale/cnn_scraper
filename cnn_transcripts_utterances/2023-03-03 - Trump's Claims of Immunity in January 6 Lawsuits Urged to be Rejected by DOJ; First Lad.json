Thank you.Also, with us to discuss, our own Norm Eisen, he's a CNN legal analyst and a former house judiciary special counsel in Trump's first impeachment trial. So, as we look at this, what it means moving forward. You did tweet last night that this signals a weakness for his likely defenses as we're looking further forward for it in the coming criminal case in Georgia. Is there something between the two that we can be looking at here? What did you mean by that? NORM EISEN, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, FORMER HOUSE JUDICIARY SPECIAL COUNSEL IN TRUMP'S FIRST IMPEACHMENT TRIAL AND SENIOR FELLOW, BROOKINGS:  I'm not ready to reach the bottom line, but it seems to me that Trump allegedly participating in an insurrection and an attempted coup cannot be within his presidential duties. So, if that is right, and I'm think that is where we are headed, and I appreciate that DOJ wanted to be as narrow possible. That means that he won't have a legal defense if charges are filed for similar alleged attempted coup activity as they Georgia with asking for fake votes and fake electors in that state. So, it's a bad sign for Trump even though we have not reached that exact issue yet.",

That, she would probably bring using the Georgia RICO Statute, that's the broader case. She has a (INAUDIBLE) in the past for using RICO.

And the source told me that, look, you know, the FBI doesn't keep a database of the political affiliations of politicians.
