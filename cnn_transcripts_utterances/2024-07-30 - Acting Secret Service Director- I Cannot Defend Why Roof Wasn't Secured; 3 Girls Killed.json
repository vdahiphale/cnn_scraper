And just everything is going to change at his next rally, especially if he does another outdoor rally in Butler.But what we heard from his secret service director is that they're doing everything from making sure that there are drones covering these sites. They make sure that they bring their own cell phone signals so that they can operate counter drone technology to protect these people. And also, obviously, RFK Jr. has protection. There's increased protection for Kamala Harris, who's now the presumed Democratic nominee. Everything has changed as a result of what happened on July 13th.",

Jonathan, I think one of the things that really stood out in this hearing was that, you know, we look at these moments that could have made the difference. One was if the perimeter had been bigger. But one was clearly the communications. Now that we've learned that they were playing telephone. And Senator Ossoff asked the acting director, you know, why can't you have local law enforcement and Secret Service on the same frequency talking to each other? And he said that it would take months of planning for them to be able to do that. Explain that if you can.",

      "sentences": "Well, yes, I'm a little lost for words on exactly what the acting director meant by that. But Brianna, you're exactly correct. There were multiple points of intervention throughout the precipitating events prior to the shooting that local law enforcement could have been involved.They could have directly engaged with this individual who is exhibiting, you know, suspicious behavior, anomalous behavior. I mean, going back hours, right? This isn't just the immediate moments. This is going back hours he raised suspicion to local law enforcement. So the communication breakdown, the failure of communication. I mean, there is a solution there. And I think what maybe the acting director was talking about is a more formalized communication system that could be applied. But real simply, the Secret Service can bring more radios. They can bring more equipment, more radios to hand to at least supervisory law enforcement officers that are working on the perimeter and put them on one channel and monitor. So there is a solution here. There's probably a stopgap solution until there's a permanent one. But I was a little bit lost on where the acting director was going in his response.",

But it wasn't deployed until much later. And the reason had to do with available cell phone reception signals and local law enforcement not providing some kind of equipment.I'm just curious what you make of that being the reason for not having this capability.",

We are in a small community called Cohasset near Chico.The flames tore through here on Thursday, devouring, destroying almost everything in sight. Today, the air is still thick with smoke, and residents have not been able to return to this area. This was an antique store. You can see rows of antique cars behind me. A lot of the items here just pulverized, really nothing left behind. This is just one of nearly 200 structures that's been damaged by the Park Fire so far. Thousands of people remain under evacuation orders. We're sort of seeing vehicles and crews drive through here, but residents have not been able to return. The fire is growing. That is the bad news. The good news is that a lot of the blaze has been now contained to largely forested canyon areas. But, of course, all of this could change at a moment's notice. We did hear from the man accused of starting the fire, 42-year-old Ronnie Stout. He appeared in court yesterday. Prosecutors say he pushed a burning car down a cliff starting the fire. He says that it was an accident, but the Butte County District Attorney, Mike Ramsey, said that he has a previous criminal record and was denied bail. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
