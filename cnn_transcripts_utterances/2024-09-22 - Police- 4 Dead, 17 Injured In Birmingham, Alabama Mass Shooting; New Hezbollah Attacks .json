Now, Hezbollah claimed that they were targeting the Ramat David Israeli air base as well as the but Rafael advanced defense weapons systems factory in Haifa. However, what they struck apart from, of course, those missiles that were intercepted, seemed to be areas away from there, perhaps purposely designed to avoid hitting any targets that might precipitate a serious is Israeli response. Now, according to the Israeli medical service, several people were hospitalized as a result of these strikes. And we did see damage to homes and cars and other civilian infrastructure. What we also saw in the 24-hour period were as many as 300 Israeli airstrikes not just on southern Lebanon, but on the eastern part of the country as well. Now, we were at that funeral for Ibrahim Aqil, who was killed last Friday along with 15 other members of Hezbollah. But also about three times as many civilians were also killed in that strike on southern Beirut. Now at the funeral, we saw Naim Qassem who's the number two on the political side of Hezbollah, who came out and said that what happened last night, referring to Hezbollah's airstrikes on Israel is the first blow in a battle without limits. A battle without limits are the words he used. For their part. The Israelis are also talking escalation. Herzi Halevi, who is the Israeli army's chief of staff, came out and said that \"our strikes will intensify\". Now, all of this and all of this talk is certainly raising serious concerns.

So, all of the areas behind it have starting to see the temperatures drop dramatically. Take a look at this. Oklahoma City topping out at 97 degrees yesterday, today, likely only to make it into the low to mid 80s. Chicago topped out at 92 yesterday, today, only going to see those temperatures into the 70s. And is that cold front continues to slide south and east more and more cities are going to see that drop in temperatures. Now another thing that were keeping a close eye on the tropics, especially this area right here in the western Caribbean, because it has the potential to develop into a tropical system as it moves into the Gulf of Mexico, as we go through the next several days. Now, one thing to keep an eye on is a lot of the models aren't really in great agreement in terms its of where this storm ends up going, or the intensity of the storm. Both of them, however, do anticipate having this system become more of a tropical development as we get into the middle portion of the upcoming week before finally continuing on. One of the things to note is regardless of what type of system this becomes, whether its a tropical system, tropical storm, or even a hurricane, it is likely to bring an influx of moisture to a lot of areas along the Gulf Coast specifically. So areas of Florida all the way back through Louisiana will have to keep a close eye on this potential system. One other thing that bodes well for development of this particular system is how warm the waters are in the Gulf of Mexico as it moves from the Western Caribbean up into the Gulf of Mexico. Its going to be going through temperatures that are in the mid to even some spots, upper 80s which will really help make this system develop rather quickly as it moves through that area.

For decades, it has been devouring mountains of coal in Minnesota and belching out gigatons of planet cooking gases, making this power plant the state's biggest climate polluter. But in a vivid example of energy transition, Sherco's owners are changing its diet, swapping out coal for renewables, until the last fire goes out in 2030.
