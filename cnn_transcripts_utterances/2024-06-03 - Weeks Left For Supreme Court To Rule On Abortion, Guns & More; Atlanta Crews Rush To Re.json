The drafting process has already started.But on June 1st, that's the traditional deadline for everyone to have finished up at least their majority opinions. And they circulate them around their colleagues. And this is a process now that is referred to as Holding Five, because you know, everybody took an initial vote, but now they want to see how it's written, what the legal reasoning is. And, you know, individual justices might say, I'll -- I'll still be with you if you change this. But the opinion author will say, OK, I'll change that, but I don't want to alienate this other justice just to keep the majority. And it's June when the rubber really meets the road, when all these important cases really come -- come down to the wire here. And, you know, it's crunch time. And I think, right now, they're aiming for to be out by June 28th. That's a Friday. They almost always finished by the end of June. But this time, with those Trump cases, especially, there's a chance it might over to Monday, July 1st.",

      "sentences": "So let's -- BISKUPICour audience. And the main one is whether Donald Trump can claim absolute immunity from criminal trial. This is -- this involves the charges that we're brought by Special Counsel Jack Smith, four counts of election subversion. And Donald Trump said, I shouldn't be -- as a former president, I should not be subject to trial. I should be shielded as a former president. Lower courts ruled against him, but the Supreme Court said, the trial can't go on until we've decided in this case. And that's the one lots of people are waiting for. And I have to say, Jessica, as close as we already are to the November election, it's doubtful that no matter how the justices rule, we will actually see a trial on Jack Smith's charges before the election. But the other one that could also affect Donald Trump is one that was brought by some January 6th defendants, who say that of all the charges that the government leveled at them, they should not be subject to a charge that makes it a crime to corruptly obstruct an official proceeding. What these defendants are saying is that this doesn't -- can't cover us unless there was actual destruction of evidence. Now, Donald Trump is in part of that case. But Jack Smith has actually charged Donald Trump under that statute also. So those are the two big Trump ones. And then you mentioned abortion and the cases that the justices have now really bring us back to 2022 when the Supreme Court narrowly struck down all constitutional abortion rights nationwide, reversing nearly 50 years of precedent. And two important cases that will be tested there, one involves the Food and Drug Administration's expansion of accessibility for the abortion medication, Mifepristone. And that one involves not just abortion drugs, but all kinds of drugs and the FDAs authority to decide what kinds of drugs are safe and effective. The other abortion-related case goes to where states have banned abortion since 2022. And whether a federal law that requires emergency treatment for women who go to emergency rooms and, maybe because of their health situation, they need an abortion, there's some complications. Whether even in those states, the emergency rooms that -- that receive federal funding would be required to allow a woman to have an abortion just because that would be the care that would be needed in those dire situations -- Jessica?",

The cost of keeping cool is expected to rise nearly 8 percent, to $719 for the bills running June through September, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.In some areas of the country, like the Pacific and the mid-Atlantic and parts of the Midwest, may see even a higher increase, a higher share of increase. And that's up from $527 in 2019. The numbers have been rising steadily year-to-year. Utility prices skyrocketed in recent years, making it harder for people to keep up with both their cooling bills in the summer and their heating bills in the winter. This summer, electric prices should be going down a little bit. So that's a good thing. But the bills that you end up paying are both the prices and your usage. And the summer is expected to be above average in terms of temperatures. So people will have to run the A.C. more likely to keep cool this summer. And that means they're going to see bigger bills.",

So this year, there's only $4.1 billion to distribute to help people who are behind on their bills, down from $6.1 billion in the last fiscal year. Which means fewer people are going to get help, especially with their cooling bills. Because most LIHEAP money actually goes to help people with their heating bills. Experts say that the U.S. lacks a comprehensive policy to address summer cooling costs. And it's becoming a much more serious situation as summers get hotter. You know, we're having more heatwaves that are hotter temperatures lasting longer. They're more frequent. And this has some pretty serious ramifications, including death. Heat- related deaths are actually on the rise. You've had just over 2,300 people last year who succumbed to heat. And that's up from just over 1,600 in 2021.",
