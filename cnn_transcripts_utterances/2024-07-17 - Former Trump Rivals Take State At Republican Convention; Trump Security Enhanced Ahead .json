J.D. Vance, another great example. Someone who was, you know, more of an -- more of a Trump critic than Nikki Haley in 2016 and is now the vice president. I look at this convention and the choice of Vance as a real indication that win or lose Trump has reset the direction of the Republican Party for the foreseeable future.

Role of Trump the peacemaker comes amid concerns that if president, he might try and force Kyiv to cede territory to Moscow in return to some kind of peace deal. European Council President Charles Michel hit back with a letter to Viktor Orban saying this, \"The most direct way to peace is for Russia to withdraw all of its forces from Ukraine and respect Ukraine's territorial integrity and the U.N. Charter.\"Meantime, Ukraine and dozens of other nations accused Russia of hypocrisy on Tuesday, presiding over a U.N. meeting on global cooperation. CNN has learned that U.S. authorities obtained intelligence in recent weeks, about alleged plot by Iran to try to assassinate Donald Trump. There's no sign of any link between Iran and Saturday's shooting at the Trump rally in Pennsylvania. Iran is denying the allegations altogether. CNN's Fareed Zakaria sat down with Iran's foreign -- acting foreign minister on Tuesday and pressed him about those claims. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST, \"FAREED ZAKARIA GPS\": My first question to you is relating to the news that CNN has broken about information that the U.S. government received, the national security council and passed on to the secret service, of a plot, an Iranian plot to assassinate the former President Donald Trump in retaliation for the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the senior Iranian general that happened during the Trump Administration. What can you tell us about this? ALI BAGHERI KANI, ACTING IRANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): As you know, the Islamic Republic of Iran immediately following the assassination of General Soleimani tried to judicially and legally follow the assassination at Iranian courts and at the same time, we have tried to make use of the international judicial and legal procedures in order to prosecute the perpetrator and advisers who helped this assassination. Accordingly, the Islamic Republic of Iran will make use of all legal potentials inside the country or at the international level in order to bring the perpetrators to the justice.",

And the Americans openly said that they assassinated the senior Iranian military commander, so it is our natural right in order to follow these issues and those who are accused in this case, they should be brought to justice in a just court.

Elon Musk was supposed to be this big crusader for fighting climate change. But just in December, we could see that he has been changing his tune a bit, talking about not demonizing oil and gas, and claiming that climate change is a little bit more of an exaggerated threat, at least in the short term.I don't think he has liked the fact that Biden has offered subsidies for other car companies to support making electronic vehicles and he feels that he has a better chance of doing well under Trump. He has other friends in high places in the tech world that are getting on board with this, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and other financial leads, and so he's going to likely support Trump threw this big Super PAC and the main goal of the Super PACs, of course, are to provide political ads that could be damaging to Biden who's already facing trying to the tacks from both sides.",
