Thank you so much for being with us this morning.We begin in the Middle East where the U.S. carried out more than more strikes against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. U.S. Central Command says it conducted a strike in self-defense and destroyed a Houthi anti-ship cruise missile that was prepared to launch. Now, earlier Saturday, the U.S. and U.K. jointly launched airstrikes targeting Houthi rebels in Yemen in response to the group's continued attacks in the Red Sea.",

So this was the third time that the U.S. and the U.K. conducted joint strikes on Houthi targets inside Yemen, including command and control centers, underground storage facilities, as well as other weaponry and equipment, including radars and helicopters that the Houthis have been using to carry out.There are dozens of attacks on Red Sea shipping since November. And we are told that the strikes hit 36 different targets in 13 locations. And the U.S. used FA-18 fighter jets from the Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft carrier that is stationed in the Red Sea, as well as Tomahawk missiles from USS -- from U.S. destroyers, including the USS Kearny and the USS Gravely to launch these attacks. Now, these attacks are separate from the strikes that the U.S. carried out in Iraq and Syria just one day prior, which were in retaliation for that drone attack earlier this month that killed three U.S. service members and wounded dozens others. These are part of a broader plan and strategy to attack Houthis inside Yemen, who have been launching these strikes on commercial shipping and a part of a broader strategy to try to deter them and degrade their capabilities. And the U.S. is framing these strikes as in self- defense because the Houthis have been targeting commercial shipping as well as U.S. naval vessels in the Red Sea, including a missile, we should note, that came extremely close to a U.S. warship just last week. And so, the U.S. strategy right now is to try to degrade as much of the Houthis capabilities as possible. But as we noted in our reporting last week, the U.S. doesn't have a great idea of even how much capabilities the Houthis actually have. And so, when they're looking at how much they have destroyed, for example, a percentage of the weapons that they have destroyed, it is difficult to gauge just how much -- many capabilities the Houthis actually have left and how long they could continue to launch these attacks on the Red Sea.",

The Friday strikes were in retaliation for the drone strike in Jordan that killed three Americans and injured dozens of more. Separate groups here responsible. But I wonder when we're talking about their motivations and their sponsor, are we having one conversation about what success is and strategy or are these two separate conversations because we're talking about two different groups? MAJ. GENERAL JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, Victor, great question. No, there are two different groups, but there's a common thread and that's Iran and the backing from Iran. So this is very much what I would call a campaign that's being prosecuted by the -- not only this administration, but specifically the central command. Look, tactically, these are independent of each other. But the success that's going to be achieved, both in the Red Sea against the Houthis in Yemen and elsewhere in Syria and Iraq against the proxies that exist there, and then the greater fight that's taking place in Gaza, are all connected in terms of the administration's capacity to wage this fight against Iran and its proxies.

And it's also worth recalling that the Saudis got involved in the war in 2015 and dropped a very large amount of ordinance on the Houthis.25,000 bombing raids, which killed around 28,000 people, 9,000 of them civilians. So when the Houthis say they're willing to keep fighting, I think you have to take that seriously. Obviously, the United States and U.K. have better, more precise bombing capabilities than the Saudis and will certainly degrade their ability to carry out these attacks. But will they deter them from carrying out the attacks in future -- in the future, I sort of doubt it because the Houthis have been at war now for two decades and they control the capital, they control the major port in Yemen.

These terror attacks will continue only because the Houthis have got some -- they've got some capacity here. And the United States, again, as Peter indicated, has done a significant effort -- has taken on a significant effort and has done some damage against the Houthis. But you have to evaluate where that was relative to the starting point and what's going to happen going forward. That's going to take some time. And when you describe is -- I'm trying to describe a campaign here. The only way to campaign works is if you can achieve some level of deterrence.

And then of course, this long-awaited border security legislation which has been the subject of high-stakes negotiations for months. Schumer said that would come out by the end of the weekend. We are still waiting for text.I will note anxiously, awaiting. I will add, there's a lot of anticipation ahead of this text release. But then yesterday, Speaker Johnson, in a letter to colleagues, said that he would put a standalone Israel aid bill on the floor. And there are a couple interesting factors here. A, it comes after the House, last year, passed an Israel aid bill but it included $14.3 billion in cuts to the IRS. The GOP saw that as a way to offset the emergency foreign aid spending. That was a nonstarter among most Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer who said it would not come to the floor. They did not like the idea of including offsets in a foreign aid bill. So, now as we're seeing that issue be held up, Speaker Johnson is going to put the standalone bill on the floor. But you mentioned it perfectly there. It's going to put pressure on these senators to support that standalone legislation, something that a lot of Democrats said that they wanted. They said, take out the offsets and we'll support aid to Israel. But that could muddy their situation with the supplemental which includes Israel aid and which is packaged with the other foreign aid and the border security that could jeopardize being able to have that passed. So, you mentioned, how will the Senate handle this? That is really the key question here. I think a lot of it depends on how Republican senators take to the supplemental and the border security legislation that's been under negotiation for months. So, we're just going to have to see but absolutely, this is going to put a lot of pressure on the Senate and it's the House's way of saying, hey, we really do not like this national security supplemental.",
