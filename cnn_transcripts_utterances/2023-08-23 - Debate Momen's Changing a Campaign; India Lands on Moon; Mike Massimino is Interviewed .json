He was already -- had dropped significantly from where he was two months before this moment occurred.But this was seen as sort of the last gasp sort of moment where maybe Rick Perry could turn his campaign around. And, obviously, it just didn't work out for him. He ended up winning no caucuses, no primaries and fell further in the polls after that moment. But there's another moment that, to me, just jumps out as the seminal sort of moment where a campaign that looked like it was on the rise was coming to an end. It was from the 2016 campaign.

And if you look at the polling in New Hampshire, what you saw was, after he came in third in Iowa, he completed the first successfully, his polling was on the rise, and then what we saw, we saw that moment crushed his campaign into smithereens. He ended up finishing not second - I don't even finish - he didn't finish even third in New Hampshire. I think he finished fourth, if I recall correctly. And it basically ended his campaign. Chris Christie, of course, took Marco Rubio out and, therefore, basically gave Trump the nomination. And now I think it's so interesting, of course, that Christie is running as the anti-Trump.

And what a moment it was. You could see the emotional scenes inside the mission control center. And if you just go four years back approximately, those very hearts were broken, not only inside the control room, but across India. Millions of hearts broke when the Chandrayaan-2 failed to make that soft landing on the moon. But, well, that's the past. Now look at what's happened today. India's not only, like you pointed out, Victor, the fourth country in the world to make this soft landing on the moon. It's also the first country in the world to make this soft landing in the south pole region. A big accomplishment for India. Just the first in many in terms of its space ambitions. It wants to send a mission to space very soon a manned mission. It also wants a place in the international space center there. So, a lot happening -- at the International Space Station, rather.

So was taken to a Milwaukee area hospital emergency room. Our colleague, Dana Bash, is reporting that the governor's attendance tonight at the debate is very much in question if he will be able to stand on the debate stage for that two-hour debate. Now, we are going to see all of the candidates at a walk through thisafternoon on stage, sort of seeing what this format is like. And it's unclear if he will be able to go through that. But this is just coming into us this morning. And Dana will have more on this on \"INSIDE POLITICS\" later. But the governor, of course, 67 years old. He is one of the later joiners into this Republican presidential campaign, but has been actively campaigning, is very physically fit. I saw him at the Iowa State Fair just a week or so ago. But yesterday he was playing basketball and we're told that he was injured. The extent of the injuries are not quite clear. But the question is, will he be able to stand for the duration of the debate. So, this is certainly something that his staff is assessing today, as well as the impact it could have on the rest of the program. Again, eight candidates will be on stage. And he was, frankly, thrilled to be included in them. He made the threshold of those 40,000 donors through some unique processes, essentially enticed people to donate to his campaign. So, he has been here in Milwaukee preparing for the debate. But that basketball game yesterday landed him in the hospital and is putting his debate attendance in question. Victor.",

These repeat near collisions are a really big problem the FAA is trying to get its arms around. There's been a safety summit, memos to pilots and controller, new review board. But all of this now is the kind of stuff that you'll actually be able to see. Shovels in the ground at airports. Here are the airports where taxiways and runways are getting afacelift in the same of safety. Boston Logan, Reagan National Airport in D.C., Richmond, Jackson Hole, Toledo, Naples and Anchorage. In some cases, tricky blind corners will be removed. In other places, new taxi ways will be built so planes don't have to use the runway to taxi back to take off at the end. The biggest outlay of cash, and this is significant, $44 million, is going to Boston Logan to remove parts of problem front taxiways. And that's significant because Boston was the scene of one of these incidents earlier this year. A JetBlue flight, full of passengers, had to abort its landing when a Learjet, operated by a charter company, took off from an intersecting runway in front of it. A very close call. This is the image taken by an off-duty pilot in the jump seat of that JetBlue flight. That streak there of the dashboard, that's the Learjet. We're talking only hundreds of feet from tragedy. This is the kind of thing this money is going to try and avoid. $121 million. It all comes from FAA grants and the bipartisan infrastructure law, Poppy.",

But rescuers were able to get some medical supplies to them after some of the children got sick. And finally a special forces officer was able to carry one of the students to safety while, look at this, dangling from the helicopter. The crews worked well into the night when the zip liner snapped to get two children down. And, finally, after 14 hours, this huge team of officials and locals on the ground, they pulled together.
