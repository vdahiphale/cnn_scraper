And for Israel to stop his bombardment, the greater the pressure on that will grow and incursion kind of draws a new line and moves forward from there.",

Or is this a sneak preview of coming attractions? What do you think? GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: I think this is the next phase. This is the start of the ground operation. Now whether it's going to be you know, 300,000 troops squeezing in from every direction, whether it's going to be a penetration a slice in to seize what is considered key or decisive terrain inside Gaza.

So let's get in and get it done.Now, in the defense of what the Israelis said, it's possible this operation will uncover intelligence. It'll stir up communications, it'll make the Hamas leadership talk to each other. They're going to get tips, they may be able to go in on the ground and rescues hostages in a special operation, in addition to what's going on. So, there are reasons to believe that there was the defense minister said about going after the hostages and doing this simultaneous not necessarily in conflict. ACOSTA: And Juliette, Israel saying they're hitting these underground targets going after the tunnel network, I suppose. What does that mean in terms of trying to get these hostages out?

This is a, you know, Netanyahu is not only the military leader of Israel. He's also the political leader of Israel. And he is facing a lot of criticisms about how could this happen? How could that many people have planned and attack in Israel, without us -- without Israel knowing what the intelligence was or having a response capacity?So what Netanyahu, I suspect is hoping is that Israel has been able to rebuild its intelligence apparatus in a short period since the attack by Hamas, and be able to save hostages get more intelligence about Hamas, kill the leadership. But I think the question remains is what is the defense minister mean by saying we're in there until there's a new order? And that's the question -- it's worth asking. I don't think it's is anti-Israel to ask just we have the same challenge in Afghanistan. What is that new order? And are their partners willing to take on that responsibility. Before -- it should be noted before the attack by Hamas, Hamas was in polling that is done by Palestinians because they are a population. Hamas was exceptionally unpopular. And so Israel needs to thread that needle and ensure that the Palestinians who may not want to join forces with Hamas have an alternative. And that's the question I think the White House is also asking.",

How do we ensure that people are not victimized, who are not members of Hamas, civilians. And then the second and most important is, how do we also ensure that this does not radicalize populations that were not radicalized before? This is the quintessential question of counterterrorism efforts is if you go after terrorists, and you do not think about civilian losses, people will be angry if they lose their son, their father, their daughter, and that anger tends to be manipulated by terror groups to continue the targeting. This is not deep analysis. It is just something that we need to keep talking about because of the humanitarian crisis.",

Really appreciate it.And we are following more breaking news as our former Vice President Mike Pence is suspending his campaign for president what led to that decision. That's next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [15:22:04] ACOSTA: Breaking news former Vice President Mike Pence says just suspended his campaign for presidency. CNN's Kristen Holmes joins me now from Las Vegas. Talk about a very big surprise coming out of that conference. I'm guessing nobody saw that coming. KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN CORRESPONDENT Yes, Jim, this was a huge surprise. I talked to some of the event planners who said they had no idea that this was coming. I saw some of Pence's top aides here wondered why they had come to this event. But obviously now that is clear. Now one thing you're really watching here is why, we're talking about why he decided to drop out. And part of that reason is the fact that he hadn't qualified yet for that third Republican debate and sources tell our colleague Jeff Zeleny, that this was a principal reason behind the decision to drop out of this race. But I did speak to another Pence advisor who also said that Pence just saw the writing on the wall saw that there really wasn't room for him a lane that he thought that was there in this primary just didn't exist. So take a listen to what Pence had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MIKE PENCE, FORMER U.S. VICE PRESIDENT: Traveling across the country over the past six months. I came here to say it's become clear to me. This is not my time. So after much prayer and deliberation, I have decided to suspend my campaign for president effective today. Now I'm leaving this campaign but let me promise you, I will never leave the fight for conservative values. And I will never stop fighting to elect principled Republican leaders to every office in the land. So help me God. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

For the last several months, he has been campaigning aggressively trying to find that lane, trying to find a way in the Republican Party. And the reality is his audiences were small. They were generally respectful. But there simply was not the opening for him.So, I'm told by his advisers that he wanted to end his campaign, suspend his campaign and announced this in a public forum. And today's event in Las Vegas was one of the last best chances to do that. He was not likely to qualify for that third debate in Miami because he simply had not reached the number of donors. So he's spent the last week I'm told, calling around to a lot of donors. He had some fundraising success, but not the broad base that he needed. So the question is, what does this do to the race? Several of his rivals have come out and praised him. Of course, the former president has not, but some of his rivals, of course, will be looking for an endorsement if he gives one. So that's the central question right now. We've asked his advisors if he plans to do so. And he only said in his speech that he plans to stay involved and help elect principled Republican leaders. So that would be an indication that he might plan to weigh in with an endorsement. The question is, would any of that actually matter? I'm told he was planning to come to Iowa next week in the coming weeks to campaign because this, of course, is the place that opens the presidential nominating contest early next year, he needed to do well here, but he simply was not getting the support and traction on the ground. He was having a hard time raising money. And again, not making the debate stage, which his advisors thought he would struggle to do. Certainly would be the end. So he wanted to end this on his own terms and a public speech. And that's what we saw earlier today in Las Vegas, Jim.",

And Olivia, I mean, I was just mentioning with Kristen Holmes a few moments ago, this turn of events, just a Shakespearean turn of events, really, for Mike Pence throughout all of this. I remember being inside the White House, when they would have those cabinet meetings and it was always Mike Pence, who has sort of the, you know, those moments going around the Cabinet Room praising the president, you know, you remember praising the Dear Leader those kinds of moments that would take place inside the White House. And juxtaposing that with what took place on January 6, we have some video. Not that we need to remind our viewers but to show it one more time is what was happening. And Olivia so I guess one of my questions has always been regarding this this run from Mike Pence. Why did he ever think he had a chance given what took place on January 6?",
