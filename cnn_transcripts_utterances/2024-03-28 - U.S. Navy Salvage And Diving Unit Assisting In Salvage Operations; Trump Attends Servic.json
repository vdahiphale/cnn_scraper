Thanks so much.And I want to talk more about that salvage operation with retired Navy captain and diver Bobbie Scholley. Captain, thanks so much for being here with us. We just heard that report from Brian. This mission has been shifted to a salvage operation. It is apparently no longer safe for the divers to navigate around that debris. Help us understand what that means, a salvage operation and how it changes the approach here. BOBBIE SCHOLLEY, U.S. NAVY DIVER (RET.): Well, it makes a big difference that it's a salvage operation, obviously. The divers are going to have to change their mindset. Although I know that in the back of their mind, their priority is still those families and trying to bring their loved ones back so they can get closure. But the whole scope of the operation has gotten much larger. And the unified command has now, it sounds like, brought in some of the very best, and I say that because I'm a retired Navy diver, but the Navy's mission is harbor clearance. And whether it's peacetime or wartime, that is something they train to do all the time. And that's one of the units that I had command of. That is what we did. We cleared out harbors and they are trained, they have the equipment, they will come in with surface-supplied hard hat diving equipment, which is much safer for the divers than the scuba equipment that they would have been using earlier. And that way they can work around all that heavy debris, the steel structures, the concrete that is very dangerous for divers to be swimming around. And they can get in there and work in the - that environment with the low visibility, the cold water, and the debris that is unstable, much safer than they were before. It's still a very complex operation. They'll have their engineers and their other experts helping them. And it's going to still take a long time to get this done. But the experts will be on scene and that's very reassuring.",

They'll still have their remote-operated vehicles that'll go down and do some evaluation with cameras and much better lighting. And they'll have the divers that'll get in the water as well.The Navy also has divers that are engineers that will evaluate the stability. And I'm sure there'll be some additional commercial experts that'll be part of the team. But they will come up with a plan. That's always the first thing. Evaluate the situation, come up with a plan before they even put divers in the water. And I'm sure part of that plan is also going to include evaluating how to remove the Dali from the situation. They've got to get the ship out of the way first before they can start connecting to the debris and with the cranes and start pulling large pieces of the bridge out of the way in order to start clearing the channel. So the planning is key before they can start even putting divers into the water and start with the process of removing pieces of the bridge to get it out of the channel.",

And when he left, did he make it about himself.And the answer is within his comments, he didn't do politics, really. He didn't talk about himself. He talked about the tragedy. He talked about the family and he talked about the injustice and his concerns about the justice system and left it there.

And even though crime in New York City is higher than it was, say, before the pandemic, when you compare it to the crime rise you've seen in all the other cities, New York is still the safest big city in America.Part of the issue that New York is suffering and part of what police are especially hurt by is the fact that the criminal justice system has changed. There's a great resistance to holding people on bail in jail, resistance to sentencing them to prison. Laws have been reconfigured to stop that. And what you've seen as a partial result of that has been recidivism rates that have spiked. So, if you look at 2017 versus now in burglary, in shoplifting, auto theft, grand larceny, you'll see recidivism rates that were 6 percent, 7 percent. Now, you're looking at 24 percent, 25 percent. So, police feel that they're seeing the same suspects committing the same crimes over and over again and not doing time. In the case of the death of Officer Diller, one of those suspects was arrested less than a year ago with a loaded gun and is out on the street again, while that case is still somewhere in the system.",
