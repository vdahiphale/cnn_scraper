When you hear UFO and even UAP to some extent, your mind goes to that cultural conversation about aliens and things of that nature. We don't have enough information to say where these objects are originating from. That's part of what we're trying to do. Gather more information and take a hard look at the data in a serious way so we can determine if there are national security concerns that will pop out.As we saw, if there is a part of the sky that we're not paying that much attention to, our adversaries will take advantage of that.",

If they see a UAP their only instruction if they should like to report it is to funnel that information to local law enforcement or some UAP/UFO organizations that are out in the public sector.",

But the fact of the matter is with such claims, the only way we're going to be able to get to the bottom and believe those, I think, is with further transparency from the government.
