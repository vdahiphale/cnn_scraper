Under his leadership, Japan plans to boost its defense spending to 2% of its GDP by 2027 and purchase weapons, including U.S. made Tomahawk cruise missiles acquiring counterstrike capabilities for the first time in decades. (On camera): So if Japan has a security pact with the United States, why does it need counterstrike capabilities? KISHIDA (through translator): Missile related technology is evolving year by year. As missiles become more sophisticated, Japan must constantly consider what kind of technology is needed to protect the lives and livelihood of its citizens.",

      "sentences": "Ten second trivia.Which one of these categories is considered a worst-case scenario when it comes to hurricanes? Category 3, Category 1, Category 5, or Category 4? Correct answer is Category 5. Meteorologists use a scale called the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale to classify hurricanes into categories one through five. Categories three to five are considered major hurricanes, but a category five is catastrophic. Next up, this coming hurricane season may be less than ideal. That`s according to Colorado State University. The school has been putting out yearly forecast since 1995, and they say this year they`re predicting more hurricanes and major storms than ever coming out of the Atlantic Ocean. The university says that from June through November, there could be 23 big storms, including 11 hurricanes and five category three or higher major hurricanes. These storms are likely to hit the eastern part of the U.S. and the Caribbean. In the typical season, there are 14 big storms, including seven hurricanes. A big reason for more hurricanes this year is a weather phenomenon known as La Nina, which basically means that the temperature of the surface water is cooler than normal in a particular area, and certain wind patterns are stronger in that same area. Unfortunately, that combination creates the ideal conditions for some major storms. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Well, indeed, our water temperatures here in the Atlantic are 3 to 5 degrees warmer than they should be at this time ofyear, indicative of really late April, not early April. And so our hurricane season will likely start earlier than usually more active season changing to La Nina. And I`ll tell you what that means in a second. And obviously the warm ocean temperatures from the record-breaking year of 2023 globally. So Colorado State 23, 11, and 5. Those are the numbers for storms with names, hurricanes and majors. Now, last year they had 13, 6, and 2, and it turned out to be 20, 7, and 3. So they`re not overestimating in April just in case. What they see is what they get here in the warm temperatures with an early start, maybe a late end. That`s how we get to these numbers here. Landfall anywhere across the U.S. is never a certainty. And even this year, with all of those storms in the water, we`re still only about 63% on average right now, compared to what we should be in the 40s for any landfall hurricane for any given season. Of course, across the Gulf Coast here to a 42% chance of something in the Gulf getting to major category. That doesn`t mean that storms aren`t going to landfall. It just means it was a major storm making landfall there. So what does La Nina do? Well, kind of the opposite of what El Nino did last year. El Nino made a lot of disturbances here. A lot of what we call sheer in the atmosphere. Well, now the jet stream is going to be farther to the north, and that means that there`s going to be less sheer. Less sheer down here means the storms aren`t going to be torn apart. If you have storms that aren`t torn apart, you`re going to get more storms to continue. And so, therefore, more storms forming and more storms moving up toward the West. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
