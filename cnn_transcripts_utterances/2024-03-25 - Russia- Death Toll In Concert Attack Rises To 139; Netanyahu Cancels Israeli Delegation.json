But he said he doesn't just want to know -- he wants to know who carried it out. He wants to know who ordered it. And so he's, again, sort of like implying that it was Kyiv, it was the Ukrainian government that had something to do with orchestrating this attack. Something, certainly, of course, the authorities in Kyiv have categorically denied.",

Security Council approving a draft resolution for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. Now the U.S. abstained from that vote, paving the way for it to pass. In a response is really Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled a planned Israeli delegation trip set for this week in Washington. I'm joined now by Evelyn Farkas. She's a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, also, the executive director of the McCain Institute. Evelyn, thank you so much for being with us. The U.S., through John Kirby at the National Security Council, responded to this news of the canceled delegation by saying that the United States is \"perplexed by it.\" How do you read the state of U.S.- Israel relations right now?",

And to a long-term diplomatic solution that would result in a two- state outcome. And this is something that Netanyahu has been resisting. And the United States, reportedly behind the scenes, has been trying very hard. But people like me have been and urging now for months that, that our government get out from behind the scenes and put the pressure on publicly. And that's what they did today.",

And the thing is that he probably was planning on ramping up the feeling of insecurity in Russia anyway.Because it sounds like -- I just came back from Ukraine, so I literally flew back yesterday not from Ukraine, because obviously you can't fly in and out of Ukraine crane yet safely. But I was in Ukraine last week for almost the whole week. And all the Ukrainian officials think that the Russians are going to plan a new offensive in the spring, which is coming soon, or the summer. Either way, the Russians need more forces. And so in order to mobilize more manpower, Putin has to he needs a rationale. So you probably was going to be looking for one anyway. And this sort of fell into his lap. Plus, this shows that he actually can't keep the people in Moscow as safe as he has been pretending he's been keeping them. Because, of course, this horrible attack happened under his watch. The last thing he wants to do is admit that, on top of having this war that he launched with Ukraine, making Russia less secure, he's also got a terrorist threat domestically. So he's trying to link the two so at least there's only one threat that the people are fully aware of. And he can use that threat to his political advantage to call up more for men to fight the war against Ukraine.",

These self-managed abortions, which often include medication abortion, many times gotten via telemedicine or through the mail, for example. What they found using various data sources is that there's an estimated 26,000 abortions obtained this way outside the formal health care system through medication abortion. And so you're seeing that really large proportion of the decline in those abortions gotten through the formal health care system. Perhaps where instead obtained this way through self-managed abortion.
