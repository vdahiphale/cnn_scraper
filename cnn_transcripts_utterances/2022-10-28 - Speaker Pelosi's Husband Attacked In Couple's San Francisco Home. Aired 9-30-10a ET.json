In these closing days though, really, the focus is on getting the vote out. What I'm hearing from voters in these closing days is a realization of just what it would mean if Republicans were to take over control in the Senate or the House, particularly in our Senate race, the extreme agenda of putting Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block every year, the idea that our senior Senator Ron Johnson supports a criminal ban on abortion nationwide. That - excuse me, that the agenda is quite concerning, the actions we just took to lower prescription drug prices by allowing Medicare to negotiate with the criminal - with the pharmaceutical companies. They're already talking about how to repeal that. And I think voters in Wisconsin are realizing just how extreme that agenda is. And gravitating back to Democrats and getting the vote out is our top priority in these closing days.",

Those who say party control as a top consideration favor Mandela Barnes 54 percent to 45 percent. But when it comes to specific issues, Ron Johnson has a much larger advantage there, 58 percent to 41 percent.So yes, you're saying that you're hearing from voters basically, that they want to make sure they have control in Washington. But if more Republicans are motivated rather by the issues, as we saw in some of that polling specifically about the Senate race, how do you counter that?",

Trump's defense team and federal prosecutors we've learned met in a sealed court hearing on Thursday in Washington, DC. Now CNN has learned this was related, at least in part to the Justice Department's ongoing demand that all documents marked classified be returned to the federal government. As we know this is just one of several developments that we're following in different legal issues involving the former president.CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig is here. So, Elie, specifically looking at this meeting? What is it to tell you that this meeting happened in DC and that it was a sealed hearing? ELIE HONIG, FORMER ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEY, SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK: Erica, so sealed means that it was confidential that it was not open to the public. All trials and court proceedings typically are open to the public, you can go watch, we can sometimes broadcast them on TV. The fact that this was done under seal tells me that it was very likely connected to a grand jury, because grand jury proceedings by law are conducted confidentially, secretly under seal. And I think if you look at the fact that this happened in DC, that further suggests that it could be related to a grand jury. We know there is a grand jury seated in Washington, DC looking at this case, and it went in front of Chief Judge Howell who is the judge in DC who oversees grand jury proceeding. So, it looks like this was likely connected to grand jury, could be a dispute about a subpoena or the scope of somebody's testimony.",

We also know as you point out, Erica, the special master is still going through these documents is supposed to be done with that by the end of November, perhaps into early December.But once we get there, I think and I hope the Justice Department understands that they need to move quickly, one way or the other. This has already dragged out for well over a year. DOJ has been negotiating, going back and forth subpoenas, search warrant to try to get these documents, one way or another DOJ has to bring this thing to a conclusion either they have to conclude there's no criminal charges to be had here and put an end to it. Or if they're going to bring criminal charges, they need to do it quickly, because once these midterms are over, we're going to be heading into 2024 season, Donald Trump may announce his candidacy and things just get more complex for DOJ at that point.",

Because the law is quite clear. It says that if the House Ways and Means Committee requests an individual's tax returns, then the IRS shall furnish them and all the courts so far, the trial court, the Court of Appeals have said shall furnish means shall furnish, you have to.So, Trump has lost so far, he's likely to lose again. But if he tries to get it to the Supreme Court, and he has the right to ask the Supreme Court to take this case, then you're looking at the calendar because on January 3, 2023, a new Congress takes over, that subpoena will lose its effect, and certainly if Republicans take Congress, they will withdraw that subpoena. So, as often happens with Donald Trump, Erica, this will be really a game of delay and a race against the calendar.",

We are concerned about what we're seeing around calls for vigilance, watching drop boxes watching the polls, but I think vigilance is really the keyword. Folks should exercise vigilance, but they shouldn't feel paranoid. Because what social media does is show us a lot of the vitriol and a lot of what we do need to worry about. But at the same time, that doesn't show us all the people who are passing those things up and are really turned off by it.So, it's important to try and remain vigilant but not let this have a suppression effect by - and not have people go out to the polls as a result of this.",

      "sentences": "You know, you mentioned anxiety Erica, more than anxiety here I think for the passengers, terror. I think that was probably going through their head on LATAM flight 1325 between Chile and Paraguay. Now think of this in two episodes. The flight actually hit bad weather going to Paraguay, but then diverted to Brazil. There on the ground, the crew decided to wait it out for about three hours, 48 passengers on board then took off again trying to complete the flight. And that is when they went through this monster of a thunderstorm.Look at the video from inside the plane, the lightning so bright, it lit up the inside bright as day in some instances, you can see the bumps so severe there that bags, things on people's laps going up to the ceiling. Also, if you listen closely, you can hear what sounds like hail hitting the airplane. That is what I think explains this really severe damage to the outside of the plane. You can see the nose cone caved in there of this Airbus A320. The windshield shattered. This was so incredible, because not only - from this turn from a severe weather event into an emergency landing after this, but you have to question the judgment of the pilots here. Why did they decide to go into this weather when they have so much data about what is in front of them, not only onboard the airplane, but also from air traffic control. Now we have heard from LATAM, the airline here, they say they're supporting these passengers and they'll comply with this investigation by civil aviation authorities in Paraguay Of course, they will look into why the pilots made this call. There's some conjecture out there that says they didn't want to deal with the bureaucratic mess of emptying the airplane out in Brazil. They also were maybe running up against their duty time, how much time they could stay on the clock. It'd be a really interesting investigation here, Erica, about why these passengers were put through such a horrible experience.",
