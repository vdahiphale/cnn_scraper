It's no longer considered an active storm but its effects are still being felt around Acapulco. Flooding and landslides have destroyed homes and sent about a thousand people to shelters in the region. Floods and landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rains have killed at least 192 people in Nepal. And as rescue workers reach more remote areas, officials warn the death toll will likely rise. 96 people have been injured since Friday and dozens more are missing.

      "sentences": "Yeah, where I was going with that is where I see the polls going over the year of this war. For the first six months immediately after October 7th through April, Netanyahu and his government were suffering in public opinion. People blamed them for the failures to detect and prevent and cope with October 7th and everything that happened afterwards, and their polling numbers were very poor.But from around early April, beginning with the assassination of Senior Al-Quds commander in Damascus. And the fact that there was an exchange of fire with Iran that did not escalate out of control, there began an incremental recovery of polling. We saw another inflection point in August after the double assassination of Fu'ad Shukr, senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut, and assassination attributed to Israel of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran. And that also did not fully escalate into a regional war. It looked like Netanyahu had some sort of strategic control over the events in the regional dimension, and the polling got better for the government. Now, the government has regained, at this point, all of what it lost in those first six months of the war. And I can, you know, my assessment is that it's because of the regional dimension there's no evidence that Gaza is playing out well in the Israeli public. People are still devastated by the fact that there hasn't been a hostage release deal. They consistently prefer a hostage release deal, including the concessions that would mean on Israel's part to the government's position, but everybody feels like the regional threat is kind of above politics, and that does play well for the government. However, it should be said, the government has not been able to regain the majority that it had in the November 2022 elections in surveys. So if elections were held today, they still wouldn't win, but elections will not be held today, they haven't even been called yet, and the government could also last the full term.",

And, you know, it's hard to say for sure what's going on inside his head, but just reading the actions of the last number of days, it looks very much like he is pushing the U.S. to a situation where there could very well be a severe escalation in the Middle East, including possibly attacks on U.S. forces that would drag the U.S. in. And so it's almost as if he's not really going to give his allies a choice about international isolation or not. He's trying to pull them in and create the kind of binary divide that he described in his U.N. speech. The good guys and the bad guys, it's how he sees the world, or at least it's how he wants the world to see Israel. The problem is that Israel behaves like the bad guys in many ways with its undemocratic and conquest-oriented positions of this government. And yet feels like it legitimately can expect the support of what it calls the good guys who advance peace and democracy.

I think all of us are nervous that potentially, if things aren't done right, This could be the election that does break this republic, or at least break the system that we've had for elections.It will drag on, as you said. There are almost 90 lawsuits that have been filed mainly by the Trump people in one variety or another, sometimes state parties, sometimes national, prior to the election. I mean, we're not even at the election, but they're preparing the way for challenges if Trump should lose a close election. CHURCH: And Larry, we mentioned that immigration is one of the top issues for likely voters. And that, of course, is one of the reasons we just saw Harris visit the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump claims he can end the trouble there at the border. But of course, a bipartisan bill could have done that, right? And he torpedoed that this year because he wanted to run on the issue. Why don't most voters know about that? They don't appear to understand that particular detail. Why is that?",

And maybe people will learn a bit more as the election approaches or as the day that they're going to vote approaches. They do tend to do a little research. They pay attention a little bit more carefully. I don't know whether this can be solved on Trump's first day, should he get back in, because as you know, he can end the war in Ukraine in one day. So I just don't know which comes first.There are a lot of days early in the term, and he talked about one day of chaos, one day of domineering leadership, dictatorship. So there are a lot of things coming in the beginning of the Trump term, if there is a second Trump term.",

People vote for president, not vice president. I still think people should tune in. And here's the reason why. Vice presidents have a way of turning into presidents. We've had approximately 14 vice presidents get elected or succeed to the office.So people should pay attention and it should if you're really undecided, as I said, I don't think there are many, but if you're really undecided, this could be the tiebreaker.",
