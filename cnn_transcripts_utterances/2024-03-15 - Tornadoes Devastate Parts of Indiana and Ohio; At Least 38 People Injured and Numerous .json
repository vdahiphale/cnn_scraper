We heard from a passenger who said that when they asked the pilot what happened as they were leaving, that he said that the controls just went blank. Is that something that could happen with this when you are pushed into the control panel?MILES O'BRIEN, CNN AVIATION ANALYST:  Investigators I've talked to don't know what to make of that one, and I don't think that is being actively pursued as a top issue potentially in all this. That might have been something that kind of got put through the rumor mill in the wake of something like this. So we'll see. I find that particular issue, the blackening of the entire panel as related to this, to be hard to figure out. So I'm going to put that in the category of a kind of a bad piece of data that came out of the wake of this.",

I mean, it's fascinating to see what little can happen to cause a plane to nosedive. So again, seatbelts always, that's what I learned from this. Right?O'BRIEN:  Absolutely. Now, in the past there have been situations where drinks have spilled on consoles shutting down engines, cameras have gotten stuck in seats causing nose dives as well. I think we can safely say when you're in a flight deck, in a cockpit, you should move rather gingerly. Theres a lot of buttons there and you just don't know which one might cause trouble.

The Palestinian Ministry of Health saying that 20 people were killedand 155 wounded, they say that this attack was carried out by the Israeli military. They blame Israeli shelling for the death toll here, but Israel is denying having targeted this aid distribution point in Northern Gaza. They say instead that it was Palestinian gunmen who opened fire on this aid distribution point about an hour before an aid convoy was set to roll through. They said that the gunfire continued as that convoy arrived and as crowds of desperate people began looting those trucks. They also say that they carried out an initial review that showed that no Israeli tank fire, airstrikes or gunfire were carried out there. But the Palestinian Ministry of Health, as well as eyewitnesses on the ground tell a very different story. People on the ground tell us that they heard what sounded like tank or artillery shelling and certainly the images on the ground of the destruction indicates something far more serious, far more deadly than simply gunfire with rubble all around, dust covering bodies, pools of blood, and many people obviously killed and wounded in this attack. What is clear though, is that all of this is amplified and made worse by the desperate humanitarian situation, particularly in Northern Gaza and as we look for some kind of relief for that humanitarian situation, the entry of much, much more aid which could only be provided by a temporary ceasefire, we are now getting indications that things are trending, at least in a positive direction with Hamas apparently submitting a latest counterproposal that has at least one US official cautiously optimistic.
