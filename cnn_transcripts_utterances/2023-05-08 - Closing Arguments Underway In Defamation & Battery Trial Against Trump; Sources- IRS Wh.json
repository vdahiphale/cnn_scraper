Jean Carroll, is accusing Trump of raping her and defaming her after he denied the rape, which she said took place in a department store dressing room some 27 years ago. CNN correspondent, Kara Scannell, is outside the New York courthouse. She has been tracking all of this for us. Kara, walk us through the closing arguments for both sides.",

The fact is that this is an investigation that has spanned three attorneys general. It started off during Jeff Sessions' era. It is still ongoing. So the big question has been, what is the delay? What is causing the problem? The IRS whistleblower informed his lawyer, and his lawyer then told these committees what he is prepared to say when he comes in for an interview. Among the things that he's saying is that the promises that Attorney General Merrick Garland made to make sure no political interference was involved in this investigation, he's saying is not so. And that's part of what we expect he is going to be able to tell the committees once he comes in in the next couple of weeks.",

He's been essentially pushing back at the Republicans.And the reason for that change, according to people close to Hunter Biden, is that, you know, they stood quietly while they were getting attacked for years so he's decided to go on the offensive. At the White House, obviously the president is now launching a reelection campaign. This was met with, let's just say, disfavor. They did not want this because they thought it was going to end up causing problems for the president. So far, it appears to be working. At least according -- according to Hunter Biden's team. And, you know, one of the things that is still -- they are still weighing is whether Hunter Biden can launch a defense fund, which would raise a lot of really difficult legal questions for the White House and for Hunter Biden himself. KEILAR: Certainly would, right? But this is not cheap what he has going, the number of lawyers we're talking about.",

We have reported on states passing controversial laws to ban public camping. This was different. This is a lawsuit brought by Phoenix residents and business owners that sued the city arguing that this encampment is a public nuisance. And they won. The judge sided with them and ordered the city to clear the camp. Now some think that this type of lawsuit could become a model, a template for those in other parts of the country looking to try to force cities to clear encampments. But that gets to your question, the important question of, what happens to the 900 or so people living there, where can they go where they can be safe? The Phoenix area only has half as many shelter beds as people experiencing homelessness. Take a listen to a young woman we met who is living in a tent. Her name is Stefanie Powell.

But we don't know when that's going to be operational. It could cost a lot of money. And there are a lot of people who are concerned that many of the folks living in this encampment instead will wind up going down the road to other neighborhoods where they will be more isolated potentially in more dangerous situations.",
