He's said that you know, Israel and the United States have a very longstanding allegiance and they will always have an unshakable bond, that he is trying to reach genuine compromise. But then he says that Israel is a sovereign country, which makes its decisions by the will of its people and not based on pressures from abroad, including from the best of friends. That was echoed to the 10th degree by some other members of his government, who said things like \"Israel is not a star on the American flag\" and some others, who went even further, that said the Americans were being fed fake news about this massive overhaul. But clearly the frustrations blowing out into the open. Now senior Israeli officials have been briefing reporters all day today, saying that this is not as big of a deal as the media is making it out to seem. The relationship is fine, even saying that they expect some sort of comments from the White House or from the State Department. Sort of ratcheting things down.

As you mentioned, authorities outhere in Nashville, Tennessee, are still looking into the fact that this 28 year old shooter was being treated for this mental disorder. Now according to the chief of police out here, law enforcement was not aware that the shooter was being looked after by the doctors. And the chief of police said that right now, based on what they know, it's unclear if there was anything that would have even prevented the 28 year old shooter from buying these guns. Again, all of them were purchased legally over the last several years. We're talking about seven guns in all. Three of them were used at this school shooting. Two of them were removed from the family's home earlier this week, one they believe may have been sold. And that seventh gun is still unaccounted for. Again, the chief of police says, right now, even if this person had been deemed a threat to themselves or others, there is not a law in place that would have allowed them to go ahead and try to restrict some of this gun purchasing ability, at least. In Tennessee, there are no red flag laws. A red flag law in the U.S. essentially allows for law enforcement or a family member to petition a judge in court to say, look, this person is showing some disturbing behavior, poses a threat to themselves or others. And because of that, we believe that the court should step in and take away some of these guns or restrict that person's ability to by a weapon.

His six years in charge have coincided with crises of unprecedented proportions. In April 2020, here's an example, the world was shut down as the COVID 19 virus spread, prompting Beasley to warn of the hunger pandemic that would follow millions of people in nations already scarred by conflict, were pushed to the brink of starvation. Fast forward to August of 2021, when a withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan precipitated a Taliban takeover, sending the country into freefall. At the time, the WFP estimated nearly 23 million could face acute hunger. And it was described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis. Then in February of last year, Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, creating a fresh hunger catastrophe as the breadbasket of the world was cut off. A precarious U.N.  brokered deal does mean Ukraine's exports of grain can go through the Black Sea but it hangs in the balance as the war rages on. And just last month, a devastating earthquake struck Turkiye and Syria, the latter a country that the U.N. already described as reaching the point of no return. Well, during his time at the WFP, Beasley has dealt with other natural disasters, conflicts impacting Pakistan, Mozambique, Yemen, Ethiopia and Sudan. Those challenges have been immense but there have been victories for David Beasley, two under his leadership. The World Food Programme won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020 for its fight against hunger as a weapon of war. Last year, the WFP raised $14.2 billion, providing food and other assistance to people affected by conflict, drought, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and crop failures.

The world is really speaking to us right now and we've got to respond and particularly you get into the poorest of the poor countries and we've got solutions there, Becky. And this is what we want the donors to do, give us the flexibility with the funding to not just get without food but actually build resilience programs by putting down water wells and capturing water systems so that people can take care of themselves. And when we do that, Becky, it's amazing what happens. It's a lot cheaper. They don't migrate. They don't starve to death and nations don't destabilize. So we've got these solutions. But the leaders in the world have got to be more strategic and, Becky, particularly now, because there's not enough money to address all the humanitarian needs around the world.

And I tweeted to Putin saying, do you want to bring famine to the rest of the world? If not, open up these ports. Fortunately, we were able to negotiate the Black Sea grain initiative, moving grains because, as you know, Ukraine alone grows enough food to feed 400 million people.

You know, I say a few months. My wife said, yes, maybe two weeks. You know, we laugh about it because you know me. I'm going to be engaged, no matter what. But I am worried about the world and I'm available to help resolve some of the issues around the world because the world is in trouble. And leadership is needed now more than ever. We got to bring people together. The world is so divided and, you know, we use food as a weapon of peace. And you know if we can do in the United States Senate with Republicans and Democrats, why, we can do that all over the world.",

You could, I guess, frame it as aultimate David and Goliath struggle between a tiny little island nation, beautiful little atoll of 82 islands between Hawaii and Australia, versus the Saudi Arabias of the world, the United States, the Chinas, the mega oil producers and polluters. And it would hold some weight. It would -- it would -- if there is a actual clear opinion on the responsibilities of governments to stop the climate crisis and to take care of those who are suffering by it and show the consequences of exactly what would happen to those countries that don't, that would carry some weight. That would chip away at the social license of big oil companies like Saudi Aramco, which last year made incredible $161 billion profit, it tripled the record set by Exxon, the U.S.' top oil producer. So when you talk about profits of that size, you can -- it's easy to see why about 120 nations are rallying around Vanuatu, who's now in a six month state of emergency after two back to back category 4 cyclones wiped through their islands there. It should pass unless China and the United States objects. It will take about 18 months for an opinion to be formed. Countries can chime in on this. But we'll see if it carries any weight ultimately.",
