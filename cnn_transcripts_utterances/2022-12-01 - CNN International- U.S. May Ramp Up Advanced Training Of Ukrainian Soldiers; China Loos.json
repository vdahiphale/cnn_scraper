Max Foster is out on assignment today.Just ahead this hour, as Ukraine struggles to keep the lights on, assign from U.S. officials that more help could be on the way. We'll have the latest from Washington. Plus, wining, dining and diplomacy. French President Emmanuel Macron and his wise get a warm welcome in the United States. And it's a do or die for powerhouse Germany at the Qatar World Cup. We're live in Doha with a preview of all the actions. We begin in Ukraine where punishing Russian airstrikes on critical infrastructure continues. They've left millions of people in the dark even as the brutal winter sets in. Kyiv says the southern city of Kherson is without power after heavy Russian shelling, while in the Zaporizhzhia region, emergency power outages are even being implemented now after heavy electricity consumption. Meanwhile, Ukraine is calling on NATO and its allies to supply the country with everything it needs as fast as possible. Here's Ukraine's Foreign Minister. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's bring in Katie Bo Lillis for more on this now. She's joining us from Washington, D.C. Katie, what are we learning about what the White House is considering here? KATIE BO LILLIS, CNN REPORTERUnder this new proposal, the U.S. could be training as many as 2,400 Ukrainian soldiers a month in larger groups on how to perform more sophisticated battle maneuvers, what's known in the military as combined arms training. Now, what do I mean by that? Combined arms training means that the United States could potentially be training the Ukrainians on how to better integrate their artillery support with their infantry maneuvers, for example, or how to better perform command and control or logistics for larger, more complex military operations. Now, it is important to note that this is still a proposal. It's still under interagency review. It hasn't been approved yet. But we are told by our sources that this is a serious consideration as the U.S. and the Biden administration looks towards how to best equip Ukraine to push back on this Russian invasion over the long term. I also spoke to one military analyst who pointed out that up until now, this war has primarily been fought as this kind of grinding war of attrition between two artillery armies. And one of the decisive factors, if not the decisive factor, is the availability of artillery ammunition. Essentially, who has enough bullets, right? And so that raises some questions, I think, about how useful combined arms training is going to be to Ukraine if the United States and the west can't come up with a way to continue to provide Ukraine with the amount of artillery ammunition that it needs over the long run to prosecute this fight. So that's really the big debate right now, Bianca.",

Video that emerged filmed on Wednesday. On Tuesday night in that same city, you had some residents battling riot police in that city over the COVID restrictions.So you've really had just a startling shift there. And some of that is echoed by a top official in China, a vice premier named Sun Chunlan, who has been kind of the face of the COVID restrictions in the country. As a top official, she said, quote, \"With the decreasing toxicity of the Omicron variant, the increasing vaccination rate and the accumulating experience of outbreak control and prevention, China's pandemic containment faces a new stage and mission.\" And in her statement, no mention whatsoever of zero-COVID or dynamic zero-COVID, which is how the government has phrased its strategy, a people's war led by the leader Xi Jinping against this virus. There seems to be a shift in the narrative and the tone coming from top down in the government about how to deal with the virus. Some restrictions lifted in some cities. One city actually Jinzhou in the northeast, saying it's not going to lift its lockdowns because it thinks it's on the verge of wiping the virus out. So keep watching this space. In the meantime, there is another important political development, and that is the aftermath of the death of the former Chinese leader Jiang Zemin. He is being afforded all of the kind of respect and pomp and circumstances of a former Chinese leader. His body flown to Beijing from Shanghai, where he passed away at the age of 96. His coffin was taken through the streets of Shanghai. People were lining the streets. Xi Jinping himself was at the airport to meet the coffin, where Jiang Zemin was actually wearing his trademark spectacles before -- while also lying-in state. And this is going to be an important kind of political development in the days of head preparing for this state funeral. And we're seeing some reactions not only in person with people laying flowers in honor of this man, but also online where we're seeing kind of a wave of nostalgia. The internet is heavily censored, Bianca, in China, but there are people that are kind of making digs at the current system and the restrictions in China and arguing that under Jiang Zemin, there was more openness and actually more freedom in China. Bianca? NOBILO: Ivan Watson in Hong Kong, thank you. In less than an hour, a big day of diplomacy begins for two major NATO allies. French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte, are set to arrive at the White House for a start of an official state visit. This will be U.S. President Joe Biden's first time hosting a state visit since he took office nearly two years ago now. Bilateral meeting and state dinner will follow. The Bidens and Macrons had a more informal get together Wednesday night meeting for dinner in Washington. CNN's MJ Lee is live at the White House. MJ, what can you tell us about what's on the two leaders' agenda today?",

After losing to Japan and salvaging a draw against Spain, the Germans need this win. Not only that, they also need Spain to beat Japan if they want to make it to the knockout stage. No matter who wins, the match will make history. That's because for the first time in World Cup history, an all-female refereeing team will be on the pitch. Amanda Davies is at the World Cup for us and joins us from Doha. Amanda, what can we expect today?",

Their fans are very much able to enjoy the fact their team have already booked their place in the last 16 gearing up for their tie against England on Sunday.But yes, for Germany, this is very much a crunch time. They have been here before, though, don't forget. It was back in Russia in 2018, they headed into their final group game against South Korea needing a win. They were beaten two nil. So today, very much looking to avoid that embarrassment, the four-time world champions of heading out at the group stage for a second straight tournament. But they've got a tough test. They're up against a 2014 quarterfinalist Costa Rica, whose coach, Luis Fernando Suarez, has said his sides are loving the facts, that they are being seen as the disruptors and have the chance to spoil this party. Germany's boss, Hansi Flick, though, saying he is setting out his battle plan early, that is that his team wants to kill off the game in the opening moment. So that could very much be an interesting prospect for French female referee Stephanie Frappart. As you mentioned, the first ever female to referee a Men's World Cup match. I mean, she has very much made a career blazing a trail for female officials. She was the first woman to officiate a match in France's top flight league and she was also the first woman to take charge of a UEFA Men's Champions League tie. And from what I've spoken to her about in the past, she is an incredibly proficient, efficient, lowkey referee. She will not want this to be about her. She will want it to be the football making the headlines. But just quickly, in terms of some of the other matches, Spain will be hoping they will be writing the headlines for the right reasons. They just need a point in their match against Japan. Croatia are looking to maybe cause some upset to Belgium's golden generation. They absolutely could be heading out of this tournament if they don't record a win. Morocco looking -- they only need a point against Canada as well. So very much all to play for. I have to tell you, I'm going to hand back, Bianca, because I'm slightly struggling to hear myself think.",

      "sentences": "Does the British royal family have a racism problem? An incident at a recent event at Buckingham Palace has raised that question yet again. It all began when this woman, Ngozi Fulani, attended a reception at the palace on Tuesday evening. She says a senior member of the royal household grilled her repeatedly about her British heritage, asking her, quote, \"Where are you from?\"That senior household member has since been revealed to be this woman, Lady Susan Hussey. The 83-year-old has been in service to the royal family for decades and Lady Hussey has since resigned. But that hasn't stopped the controversy. As you can see here, all the British newspapers are leading with this story today. And it all comes an awkward time for the Prince and Princess of Wales. They're on a visit to the United States right now and attended a basketball game in Boston on Wednesday. So let's bring in CNN Anchor and Royal Correspondent and anchor of this show, Max Foster. He's live in Boston for us today. Max, this controversy isn't dying down. We just saw the headlines on all the newspapers in this country. What's the reaction being from the royal family? MAX FOSTER, CNN ANCHOR &amp; ROYAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's interesting here. I mean, it's making headlines and it plays into the concerns that Meghan expressed. And actually, we've just had a trailer drop for the Meghan and Harry documentary on Netflix. And again, that's going to no doubt go into this issue of racism within the British monarchy, this white institution that is Buckingham Palace. And I think it's not surprising to many people that there might be some racism within the monarchy. And this conversation, when you see the transcript of it is, you know, it's horrible sort of language and it does make you wonder why there aren't more diverse people working within Buckingham Palace. I think that's what a lot of people are questioning right now. Susan Hussey is who they say it was in this conversation. She was the closest aides to the late Queen. She's been in the palace for decades. She absolutely epitomizes what many of the people in the palace look and sound like. So there's a huge amount of concern, but at the same time, Princess -- Prince William's team have expressed horror at this conversation and they've said that it's good that she stepped down straight away and there is no place for racism in society. So I think there's different views within the palace, but no doubt there are some issues there.",

And when he became King, one of the first things he did was meet religious leaders and said he sees the vault role of monarch to be -- to defend Britain's diversity.So it's something that he's trying to address and I'm sure he's very concerned about this latest incident and he would have been behind the quick action behind it. So I think coming up to the coronation, which is in June, I think he's going to be putting a greater emphasis on this. And I think when we see the coronation, it's going to look more diverse. That's going to be very much what Prince Charles, now King Charles is going to try to do going forward. But it's a huge challenge when many of his own staff just don't reflect what we see in modern society.",
