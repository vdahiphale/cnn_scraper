And it gives me no joy to say this, but President Biden's performance was the worst by a major party nominee for president in that entire time period.Now, having said that, I'd add a proviso to your poll there. Donald Trump did not win that debate. Joe Biden lost it. Donald Trump lied his way through it. Your own fact-checker has documented that as other fact-checkers have. So, you have to balance these things. And obviously, the Biden team has a lot of repair work to do. It's not just the Democrats who are privately calling for a replacement on Biden. I think he has lost the confidence of a lot of just rank and file citizens who watched the whole thing or part of it. It was disturbing.",

He's also the author of \"Joe BidenTim, great to see you. Evan, I'm glad here with you in the studio. Evan, let me start with you. I remember back in 2015 when then-Vice President Biden was thinking about running and he was caught on this DNC conference call saying, I don't have the emotional fuel to run. And this was after his son Beau Biden died. I'm wondering if he's at that moment right now where he's going to have to try to decide in these coming days, based on last night's performance, does he have the fuel to run? Does he have the fuel to make it to the finish line this time? EVAN OSNOS, CNN CONTRIBUTOR, STAFF WRITER, THE NEW YORKER AND AUTHOR, \"JOE BIDEN\":  This is one of those crucible moments. This is a moment when he is making that decision, and it's a combination of his personal chemistry and the cues he gets from the people around him, which is different, I have to say, than the -- you know, the whole chatter that's out there in the country. He relies, as you know, Jim, on a small circle of people who he deeply trusts. He trusts their instincts. It's almost sort of beyond having to talk about it. He can read their faces. And it was that moment -- you know, there was also a moment back in 1987 after he had a plagiarism scandal in that race, when he was trying to figure out if he could ride it out. And it was his friend Ted Kaufman who said, look, the only way you escape the sharks here, I'm paraphrasing, is to get out of this race. But there have been other moments -- and this is the central mythology of Joe Biden's life, is there are times when you get knocked down that you have to get back up. And I think it's those two instincts, to read the room or to believe in your capacity to rise above and to be resilient, that are competing within him right now.",

Now, that is incredibly significant because -- especially during Former President Trump's tenure and even now, so much discussion about the power of the courts, the federal judiciary.

Now, DOJ charged several hundred of the Capitol rioters under a statute called Obstruction of an Official Proceeding.What the court has said today is that statute does not apply to physical efforts to interfere with Congress. There has to be some element of falsifying documents or forging documents or destroying documents. It's a deep statutory construction, but that's how they came out. Worth noting, by the way, this is a 6-3 opinion, but it's not your traditional six conservatives, three liberals. Justice Amy Coney Barrett actually dissents. She joins with Sotomayor and Kagan. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson joins with the majority, including the chief and Alito and Thomas and Gorsuch and Kavanaugh. Now -- so, this means, first of all, hundreds of DOJ's cases in which they've charged this statute are now likely going to have to be vacated. Now, most of those cases involve other charges too, but there are about 50 or so where the defendant was only charged with this law. How it relates to Donald Trump? Donald Trump is facing four counts in the Jack Smith indictment. Two of those counts are this count, are obstruction. So, the question for Jack Smith now is, does he try to keep those counts in his case? His argument would be, well, we have these false slates of electors, that's false documents, maybe I'll be OK under this. But he's taking a risk.

Some of them actually pleaded guilty, and some of these charges might now have to be removed. AUDIE CORNISH, CNN ANCHOR AND CORRESPONDENT AND CNN HOST, THE ASSIGNMENT WITH AUDIE CORNISH PODCASTNow, it's worth reading Justice Jackson's concurring opinion, because she basically says, look, it does not appear that Congress intended for this law to encompass so many different things. This was originally passed, as we talked about, in context of the Enron scandal, where there was a shredding of documents. So, to say that kind of rushing a building during an official ceremony is the same didn't really hold water with the justices. So, I also think -- and Andy McCabe and others can weigh in on this, Jack Smith sort of knew he didn't want to create a scenario where his entire case rested on this particular charge. And while he was watching it closely, I don't think the things he's trying to charge the former president with are dependent on this ruling in the same way that, say, the presidential immunity case could be.",

It would not be more significant, however, than a ruling that could come that says, what an official act is for a president and delineates what is and is not immune in those actions. That's really going to have far-reaching consequences. Justice Gorsuch said as much during arguments where he said, this is not just about this president. So, I think that's still the one to watch.But what this does do is sort of bolster the argument of critics who said, look, the January 6th rioters were somehow sort of over prosecuted or -- I mean, I won't go as far as some people have said in terms of them being persecuted.
