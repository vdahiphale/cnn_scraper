They were confusing it with early voting locations, something that has been quite common across the Atlanta area here.We spoke with many of the voters who said that they showed up today because they try to vote early during that compressed five-day mandated early voting period, but the lines were just too long. So they said they took a gamble to vote on Election Day. Now, according to the secretary of state's office, more than 800,000 Georgians have already cast their ballots. That is probably a conservative estimate and we should be hearing from the secretary of state soon with another update on those numbers.

      "sentences": "One last time, Erin. This is the final chapter of the 2022. Midterms you see Walker versus Warnock, two person race in the runoff now. This will start to fill about three hours from now.Let's go back four weeks ago, just to remind people of why we are here. We are here because Senator Warnock got 49.4 percent, could not get above 50 percent. Herschel Walker right behind him at 48.5, libertarian candidate is no more. He got more than 2 percent of the vote right here. So, now, you have the two-way race. So, what are you looking for? Number one, most of the states population is right up here, Atlanta and the suburbs around it. So that is the most important place to look at the votes tonight. And again, going back to the race, going back, staying here a month ago is instructed in the sense that for Senator Warnock, your base is Fulton County. That's Atlanta. It's the Black face of the Democratic Party. It is the number one county in the state by far. You see he got nearly 74 percent of the vote there a month ago. He needs to match that number may be even juiced up a little bit tonight if he wants to get to victory. If you are Herschel Walker, I am going over to Cobb County. You say why are you going there for Herschel Walker? Warnock got nearly 60 percent of the vote, 57 percent of the vote a month ago. This is what is key for Herschel Walker. Can he perform better in the suburbs this time that he did a month ago. Here is the comparison. You see Herschel Walker with 40 percent, 41 percent if you want to write that up in Cobb County. Look at Brian Kemp, the governor, the Republican governor. He got 40 percent in the same county. Republicans don't have to win these suburban counties around Atlanta. They just have to run competitively. Kemp gets 47, Walker gets 40. This is Fulton County, you come through here. Then you go to one of the big suburban counties, north and east of Atlanta. This is Gwinnett County, it's the second largest county in the state. Again, Herschel Walker got 39 percent a month ago, Governor Kemp 44 percent. The margins matter. Can Herschel Walker get more of those votes in the suburbs? Can Brian Kemp who has endorsed Walker in the runoff, was nowhere near Walker in the general election, can his turnout operation help? So you look at the blue suburbs around Atlanta, then, Erin, let me just get rid of that so it is not distraction. Then you look more of into the exurban counties. These are absolutely critical for Republicans. Take Cherokee County, for example, seventh largest county in the state. Brian Kemp gets 47 percent a month ago, Herschel Walker gets 67 percent. So, even in the red county, Herschel Walker was underperforming Brian Kemp. It's the simple math tonight. Can Herschel Walker improve his performance? We know the Democrats have the advantage in the early vote, now we see if today, Herschel Walker not only has to win the election today, needs to win it big.",

The jury of eight men and four women came back with counts of finding the Trump Organization companies guilty across all counts. So there were two entities charged and the jury found them each guilty of the following. A scheme to defraud, conspiracy, three counts of tax fraud and multiple counts of falsifying business records.This all relates to a 15-year tax fraud scheme where the company is now found guilty of doling out of the books compensation to a number of its top executives. That was company paid-for apartments, car leases and in a case for former chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg, the private school tuition of his grandchildren. Now according to prosecutors, this was a win-win. The company was able to pay less in taxes and lessen salary to its employees and those employees, they paid less in their own taxes. So this was a trial that has lasted, we're in our seventh week, prosecution called five witnesses. Star witness for them was really Allen Weisselberg. He had pleaded guilty to 15 counts admitting to his crimes in his 50 New York tax fraud scheme. But he walked a fine line in his testimony. He told the prosecutors and the jury that he had conducted this scheme with other people at the Trump Organization, but he said he did not scheme or conspire with any members of the Trump family. Of course, the former president was not charged in this case, but prosecutors say keep they believe he actually solicited some of this fraud -- Erin. BURNETT:  Kira, thank you very much with the breaking details here. Joining me now, Elliot Williams, CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutors. Okay, Elliot, I understand that there's going to be fins here. Maybe $1.6 million, we'll get to the sentencing.

That is just not happening here. Most Americans don't ever see one $1.6 million in their lives, but this is certainly not a significant financial hit for the Trump Organization.

And the most -- I guess for those watching, I think the thing that I can say that is disenchanting the most about these Republicans is when you have someone like Donald Trump talk about Mitch McConnell's wife, or Ted Cruz's wife, and they won't even fight back, then you know that those individuals are either beaten by Trump or don't have the fortitude or courage to be a leader because if that was me, they'd be some furniture moving.",

Democrat Raphael Warnock versus Republican Herschel Walker and whoever wins this race, will make history becoming the first black person from the state of Georgia to win a full term in the U.S. Senate. I want to go now to Ralph Reed. He is the founder and chair of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. He's a Herschel Walker supporter and also the former chair of the Georgia Republican Party. So, you have a horse in this race and you know the state as well as anyone can know it. Ralph, I really appreciate this time, I am glad to speak with you. So back on November 8th, of course, no one got over 50 percent. So we are at this runoff. Walker trailed Warnock on that date right, he trailed him by about nine tenths of a percentage point. You know the Georgia electorate. Why do you believe that Walker can do better this time, that he can pull this out on election night?",

That is based on hard data.There is about 200,000 more are likely Republican voters than Democrats that had not yet voted for the early vote. And there is about, you know, roughly 330,000 more very high propensity, almost guaranteed Republican voters, base voters. These are what consultants refer to as four by fours. They have voted in four out of four elections. So, there's about 330,000 vote advantage there for the Republicans. So, you know, look, Erin, I would've preferred when I was party chairman here, and when you look at the campaigns that are running in Florida, by the party there, you would much rather have a closer gap in the early vote. But the data is there. The math is there. But it is all going to blow out to turn out. If the Republican voters turnout today on the level that they are capable of and preliminary -- based on what the secretary of state is projecting, they are today, this is going to be an nail biter. I mean, it could be a very late night BURNETT:  Right. All right. So, we're going to see what happens. You know, look, the reality of it is and what you are seeing mangy may come to pass but the reality of it is we are in the situation because a lot of Republicans who voted for Brian Kemp, the Republican at the top of the ticket did not vote for Herschel Walker a month ago, right? If they had done that, he would've won. But they didn't. So he has to turn this around. And some Republicans in your state come forward to say Walker was just the wrong candidate for the GOP in Georgia and it is the candidate that is the problem. One of them is the current Republican lieutenant governor of the state, Geoff Duncan. I asked him about Herschel Walker the other day, here's what he told me. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GOV.

What did the electorate look like on November 8th that prevented either of the candidates, Warnock or Walker, getting to 50 percent and therefore we are in this runoff.So this is not today's lecture, I want to make that clear. This is from the November 8th election. We see here among young voters, we see that that was a big Warnock area of strength. Eighteen to 29 year olds, Warnock, that is 63 percent of them, Walker at 34. Look at the other end of the age spectrum. With senior voters 65 an older, this was a Walker block of voters. 58 percent voted for Walker, 41 percent for Warnock. So obviously Herschel Walker, dependent on Election Day turnout today, hopes that there are going to be a lot of seniors in the Election Day electorate today. We also took a look at black voters. A key component of the electorate on November 8th, they made up 28 percent of the overall Georgia electorate that day, 90 percent of African-American voters went for Warnock, 8 percent for Walker. And perhaps the most critical bloc of voters in that November election were independent voters wolf. Look at how they split here. Warnock won them by double digits, 53 percent to Walker's 42 percent. That important middle block, those independents, helped give Warnock that edge, helped keep Warnock and Walker below 50. And put us in this runoff portion for today.",
