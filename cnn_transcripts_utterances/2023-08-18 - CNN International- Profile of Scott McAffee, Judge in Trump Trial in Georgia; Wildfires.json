If you're just joining us, let you bring you up to date with our top stories this hour.In the coming hours, the leaders of South Korea and Japan will arrive at Camp David for their first ever trilateral summit with the U.S. president. Both allies are among America's most strategic relationships in the Indo Pacific. And Donald Trump is reacting to his fourth criminal indictment for the first time on camera. He's dismissing the charges brought against him in Georgia as a witch-hunt in the 41-count indictment. Trump is accused of being the head of a criminal enterprise to overturn the 2020 election in the states. And we're learning more about the Georgia judge who will preside over Donald Trump's racketeering trial in Fulton County. Our Gary Tuchman has that.

He's 34 years old and was appointed to a seat just six months ago by Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp to fill a vacancy. Before that he served as the State Inspector General, and both a state and federal prosecutor after graduating from the University of Georgia law school in 2013. Classmates and professional acquaintances say he is politically conservative. Notably, McAfee was a state prosecutor in the complex trial division in Fulton County, which was led at the time by the woman who is now the Fulton County D.A., Fani Willis. Esther Panitch is a democratic Georgia State Representative and a defense lawyers handled two cases where McAfee was the prosecutor. ESTHER PANITCH, (D) GEORGIA STATE REPRESENTATIVE, DEFENSE ATTORNEY: In the cases I had with him, he made reasonable decisions related to pleas or discovery requests and he was fair. Politics never came into it. TUCHMAN (voice over): University of Georgia record show he was the treasurer of the Law Republicans, a group that serves libertarian members of the law school community and provide support for Republican political candidates. He was also treasurer of the law school's Federalist Society, an influential conservative and libertarian organization in the US. Just a few months ago, he presided over a case involving L. Lin Wood, an outspoken Trump supporting conspiracy touting lawyer. L. LIN WOOD, LAWYER: I have political views. I believe our country has been taken over by communists. TUCHMAN (voice over): This case though did not directly involve politics or Trump. It was a contempt case for allegedly making derogatory comments about his former legal associates.",

But they ultimately failed to deliver on that threat.That has emboldened the junta. Who are saying, on one hand, we want to dialogue. But they are continuing -- they're forming governments. They held the President Bazoum captive. They've charged him for high treason. So they are effectively continuing their chart -- their plan of government. Whilst ECOWAS is having meetings and releasing contradicted statements. What is key is that no one wants a war. No one wants military intervention. And that tough talking has effectively put them in a weaken position, if you like. But they have to walk it back. They have to dialogue. They have to go to the very end, as Fattah said there. They have to consider dialogue until the very end. But the defense chiefs are planning to deploy -- how they can deploy this standby force, and that is ongoing in Accra currently. We'll know a bit more perhaps later today on that. But the Nigerian Senate has already declined approval for this war. African Union has declined it. What is clear is that no one wants this military intervention -- Bianca.",
