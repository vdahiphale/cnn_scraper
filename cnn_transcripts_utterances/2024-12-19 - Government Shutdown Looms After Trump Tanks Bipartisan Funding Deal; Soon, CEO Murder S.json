The possibility of a government shutdown in your stocking, the possibility that Mike Johnson could be tweeted out of the speakership, Merry freaking Christmas, everyone.Just to bring you up to speed, this is what happened. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, forged a deal, his deal, a Republican-led deal, to keep the government operating, to fund things like disaster relief and to avoid a shutdown and to do it before the holidays. But Elon Musk did not like it. He called it one of the worst bills ever written. Then, perhaps relatedly, President-elect Trump announced he did not like it, calling it a nasty trap. Now he says he wants a new deal, in some ways with less, in some ways with more, but in all ways, not done. And the clock is ticking. And as far as we can tell, no one knows where this is headed.

And all of this is unfolding, all this drama and chaos unfolding on Capitol Hill just one day before a potential government shutdown on Friday night when the clock strikes 12So, that only adding to the tension up here, and certainly leaders today will be attempting to navigate themselves out of what one lawmaker described as a mess up here on Capitol Hill after President- elect Trump really dropped a bomb on the deal, blew it up in the last minute, at the 11th hour, making many demands, including tying the debt limit to government funding, no small task, many lawmakers up here freely admit. Now, the leaders were huddling with J.D. Vance late into the evening last night and emerged from that meeting. Very clear that there is no agreement yet, no clarity on the way forward.

On this normally sleepy street in Hollidaysburg Pennsylvania, it is absolutely teeming with press this morning, really, as far as the eye can see in both directions. There's also a large law enforcement presence. We've seen state police troopers, we've seen local police, they've started closing down streets, again, all in anticipation of those two hearings in just over an hour for Luigi Mangione here in the courthouse behind me.So, let's go through what we're expecting to see this morning. The first hearing is at 8:30. That's a preliminary hearing for those lesser Pennsylvania charges. To remind folks, it's two felonies, including a gun charge and then three misdemeanors stemming from when they picked up Mangione at that Altoona McDonald's not far from here. Then he's on to face that much more serious extradition hearing right after that first one. Now, this hearing is still on as of now. But as you noted, Sara, CNN's Kara Scannell reporting that his defense attorney said that he is anticipating not to fight this extradition, which means, like you noted, he could be on his way back to New York as soon as this morning or perhaps later this afternoon. Sara, I do want to note that we actually have some updated information when it comes to the outside world's attempts to interact with Mangione behind bars. Yesterday, we told you that as of, I guess, on Tuesday evening, he had received a few dozen emails and about six handwritten letters. Well, we got more information yesterday afternoon that, as of yesterday afternoon, Mangione has received upwards of 53 letters since he's been in prison. Still about 158 deposits into his prison commissary account. But this is interesting, Sara, still no visitors except for his attorneys. However, we also learned last night through sources that the Mangione family are the ones who actually hired that high powered New York defense attorney to represent him again in those New York charges that he ultimately will likely face. So, again, Sara, quite a scene here as we have New York press, Pennsylvania press and national media all over this courthouse. This is the line to get into court at 8:00 A.M. behind me, which I'll be on in just a little bit of time. This chapter of the Pennsylvania story might be over soon, but, again, the next step potentially heading to New York after this extradition hearing. Sara?",

He's under a gun violence protective order, and what that allows law enforcement in California to do is take away his guns as they continue to investigate this case, Kate.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Sara. So, I mean, it's concerning on multiple levels from California. They declared that state of emergency really because of the spread and dairy cattle. They've had it really widespread across herds in the state, but it was essentially confined to Central California. We read in the emergency order from Governor Gavin Newsom yesterday, and he noted that a couple weeks ago that was now detected in Southern California herds as well. So, that's spreading sort of regionally across the state. They're very concerned there. So, this emergency order in California, they say, really freeze up resources and flexibility to try to better address that faster.But, of course, we do have this now first severe human case of bird flu reported in Louisiana. This is a patient who has been hospitalized with severe respiratory illness. They are in critical condition. They were exposed through a backyard flock of sick and dead birds. And this is really the first exposure we know about, the first case that was gotten that way in the United States. We also know this patient is over the age of 65 and does have underlying medical conditions that increase their risk of being vulnerable to complications from flu. We also know something about this case. This is a strain that has been found in wild birds mostly. It's different from the strain that's found in dairy cattle. So, that's something folks are paying close attention to as well. This is one of 61 human cases that have been confirmed in the U.S., and as noted, it's the first severe case that's been found here in the United States, Sara.",

This is not escalating the risk level for the general population.They do note, though, that the first time we're seeing somebody get infected from a backyard flock, that really reinforces the need to be careful if you have backyard flocks or if you're otherwise a bird enthusiast or a hunter, if you're coming into contact with wild animals, this is really something folks should be aware of. In addition, when we think about raw milk, for example, that is not something that public health authorities recommend people drink. Pasteurization inactivates the virus.
