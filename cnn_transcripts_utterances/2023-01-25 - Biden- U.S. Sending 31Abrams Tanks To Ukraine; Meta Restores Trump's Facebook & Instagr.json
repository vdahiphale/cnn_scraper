Officials warn it could take months to deliver the equipment but Ukraine is already making plans to use the new weapons as a so called iron fist to smash Russian defenses.Also tonight, new developments in the Biden classified documents probe. We're getting a behind the scenes look at measures the U.S. Justice Department was prepared to take if the President had refused to cooperate with an FBI search of his Delaware home. And Congressman George Santos is dodging questions about yet another controversy half a million dollars in mysterious campaign payments he once claimed were personal loans. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. Let's get straight to our top story this hour, the United States formally pledging Abrams battle tanks to Ukraine. Our Pentagon Correspondent Oren Liebermann is joining us. He's got details on this major, major boost to the war effort on behalf of the United States for Ukraine. Oren, what are you hearing about how all of this will unfold?",

And Peskov then later, on a call with journalists, said that the tanks that would be sent, specifically the Abrams tanks, will burn once they get sent here to Ukraine. Of course the Russians have said that about many other weapons systems that the U.S. has sent here to Ukraine. So far, that has not been the case.And just a word here from the battlefield as well, Wolf, right now Bakhmut certainly extremely tough for the Ukrainians. They say the Russians are gaining some ground but at huge own losses, essentially sending waves of people towards the front line to try and storm Ukrainian positions. The Ukrainians say they're trying to hold those positions, but it is extremely tough going.

      "sentences": "Well, let's start with the tanks themselves. This is the German Leopard, very similar to the Abrams, highly capable, certainly more capable than the Russian made T72s, which the Ukrainians have tended to rely on. But here's a key point, also an offensive weapon. With Ukrainians, as you heard from the defense minister, they're hoping that this will help them retake territory that Russia has occupied since the start of this invasion.So let's look at the numbers though. Here are the tanks by country so far. Any disunity clearly has dissolved. You got America, you got Germany, the U.K., also Poland sending tanks in. But look at these numbers here. That total from these three countries is 59 tanks, with others you get closer to 100. How does that fit into the broader picture in Ukraine? We don't know how many tanks exactly Russia and Ukraine are using, we just don't trust their numbers. We do know or have a good sense of how many have been lost since the start of the war. These are numbers compiled by Oryx, and they base this on open source, the only what they could confirm via video, seeing tanks destroyed. And so far, more than 1,600 Russian tanks, close to 500 Ukrainian tanks, that's more than 2,000 tanks lost gives you a sense of how many are on the battlefield there. And then you compare that 59, perhaps it gets up to 100 over the next several months, as even the President granted there. It's going to take time to get them in there. The math doesn't add up in terms of leveling the playing field between what Russia has, what Ukraine has. And here's one more point I would make. When I speak to US military officials there is a school of thought among U.S. officials that Ukraine is not ideally equipped for a big tank battle. It's much better equipped for smaller, more mobile units. That's where they had all the success destroying Russian tanks in the early stages of the war around Kyiv. That's why this weapon system, which the U.S. has also sanded the Bradley fighting vehicle, which, by the way, has antitank capabilities with the TOW missile mounted here just on the left side of its turret, there are many in the U.S. that believe that's the better path for Ukraine, smaller, lighter, more mobile, requiring less support than trying to beat the Russians at tank warfare in the east.",

Ukraine obviously is not planning on stopping fighting. And I spoke to a senior Western intelligence official last week who said, look, all the indications that we have is that Putin is convinced -- that is still convinced that he can defeat Ukraine militarily on the battlefield.So, at this point, U.S. officials don't believe that there is a negotiated settlement on cards anytime soon. They also don't believe that there is a decisive military resolution coming anytime soon, which is exactly what you heard from Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Mark Milley last week telling reporters that he believed it would be incredibly difficult for Ukraine to eject Russia from all of its territory within the next year.

They had enormous success just a few months ago around Kharkiv, surprising everybody, really, with the speed of their advance there. But the fact is, the battlefield in the east is different now. It's more dug in, it's flatlands, there are trenches, there are artillery pieces, there are tank divisions there, and that's one reason we've seen the casualty count, the daily casualty count there so horrific. So, those are -- Ukrainian hopes, they hope this will make a difference. But as Katie Bo said, from the U.S. perspective, they don't expect this to be winding down anytime soon.

For more on that, I want to bring in CNN's Donie O'Sullivan, CNN's Kristen Holmes, and CNN Media Analyst Sara Fischer, she's a senior media reporter over at Axios.Donie, let me start with you. First of all, give us the specifics. What are you learning? DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Wolf, this is the most politically consequential decision Meta, Facebook's parent company, has ever made. In the past few minutes, Meta announcing that it is going to allow former President Donald Trump back on its platforms, which of course, include Facebook and Instagram. Trump was kicked off both of those platforms in the days following the Capitol attack. Facebook saying at the time that having him there was a risk to public safety. Facebook said that they would reassess this decision after two years, which they did this month. And they decided, I guess, that the risk to public safety is not what it was in their view in January 2021 and now are putting him back on the platform. He's going to get his accounts back in the coming weeks. But Wolf, the really, really important thing here for the Trump campaign, particularly as we go into 2024, is in previous campaigns, Trump has spent hundreds of millions on targeted Facebook advertising. That is going to be a very important tool as we go into 2024.",

But we have yet to have a formal statement from Trump world because they are learning about this in real time. We know that no one in Trump's team was contacted early, given an early heads up. They're actually contacted for a meeting just before 5They're still, as what I'm hearing in that meeting, are still trying to understand the details of what this means for them. On their end, what are these restrictions exactly? What exactly does this timeline look like? But they are very excited. As we reported last week, they sent a letter to Facebook trying to expedite this process. As Donie said, a lot of this is about financing. They need that money going into 2024 and they have complained privately that being off Facebook has stopped them from getting new donors, from picking up donors, from advertising in Trump's voice, which, again, leads to more money, leads to donors, et cetera. So this is something that they are very much looking forward to. And the other thing I do want to point out here, we know that he has already been reinstated on Twitter, but it is likely that you are actually going to see him tweet in the near future. We know, and this is from sources around Trump world, that he has been workshopping what his first tweet might be, even members of the campaign asking outside advisers, what do you think it would look like if Trump got back on Twitter? Now, of course, he still has his own platform Truth Social, and there are legal implications there, but it does sound more and more likely that we're going to see him active on Twitter as well.",

O'SULLIVAN: Yes, Wolf. Like many things with Facebook and their explanation, it's a bit wishy-washy. They claim that they were put in place a kind of framework that we've reported on the past few weeks where they considered quite a subjective issue, which was, is Donald Trump on our platforms a threat to public safety? We're still going through Meta's exact reasonings on all of that yet, but it doesn't seem to be particularly clear. Look, obviously there are other considerations as they made this decision as well. I also think what is quite notable here is, you know, we -- Sara just mentioned once the name Mark Zuckerberg, the person who runs this company, has kind of given Nick Clegg, the former Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who lost his election in the U.K. in 2017, a failed politician, this huge power, kind of to be the fall guy to take this decision.

And so, what this means is that moving forward, Facebook is not going to be the same type of public square that maybe Twitter is, which has much more relaxed content policies under Elon Musk. They're going to take a much more cautious approach.The other really important thing about this decision is that they're going to change the way that they think about content that's considered newsworthy. So in the past, a criticism of silencing Donald Trump has been, well, doesn't the public deserve to know if he says something crazy, even if it's crazy, now they're saying, yes, we do think that they should know about it, we might just not promote it as much as we used to in algorithms.",

They were not satisfied with that.That's why they went -- they talked to the Biden team and worked out what we call the second option a consent search. Meaning, you agree, we'll come in and search.

They have not really explained why they did a first search in November and then waited, you know, six weeks or so to do a second search and to search other properties.I think some of that could be explained in a lot of different ways. You could explain it by looking at the political calendar at the time. You could explain it by, you know, some people in the Biden world believing that perhaps they didn't need to do searches of other areas and then realizing it too late, but that's the part that doesn't make a lot of sense. But on the question of are they cooperating? I mean, they are reaching out to the DOJ when documents are found, they're giving those documents back expeditiously, and that is from the perspective, I think, of whether they are obstructing this investigation.

So they're negotiating with the Biden team.Getting a search warrant is always the ultimate step. That's always going to be under consideration. But you don't go there if you get consent that satisfies -- in a way that satisfies your concerns about the documents. I have conducted investigations of high level political officials in the past in which search warrants and looking in computers and in locations were hotly contested. And I can tell you that not until the actual threat of a search warrant is communicated to the other side are you really at the brink of doing that.

Listen to Kevin Ritz make the point, not just to the family, but to the public, that the feds are taking this seriously.

And to that point, official details have been very murky. Those details that have been released so far, we do know that Tyre Nichols was transported from the scene of his arrest in critical condition to the hospital where he died three days later.The family saying that they hired their own pathologist to do an independent autopsy, saying that these are preliminary findings, but so far this is what they had to say in a statement. We can state that \"preliminary findings indicate Tyre suffered extensive bleeding caused by severe bleeding\" and that his observed injuries are consistent with what the family and attorney's witness on the video of his fatal encounter with police on January 7, 2023. And just very quickly, Wolf, it is worth noting that CNN has not seen a copy of this independent autopsy. Ben Crump, the family attorney, says that they are still actively working on it. Wolf.",
