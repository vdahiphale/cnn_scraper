      "sentences": "Hello, everyone. I'm Zain Asher in New York and this is ONE WORLD. Turkey will hold round two as anail-biting presidential election results in a runoff and leading candidates are now trying to re-energize voters for the next ballot less than two weeks away. Sunday's poll came down to the wire, pushing the country into uncharted territory. Turkey's current President Recep Tayyip Erdogan did better than expected and received just below the 50 percent threshold lead to secure outright victory, but his main rival, opposition leader, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, is vowing not to give up and swears he will fight until the end. Turkey is an important NATO ally, and the vote is being closely watched around the world. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh is live for us now in Istanbul. So, essentially, both candidates are here being given a second chance to appeal to voters. What will the next two weeks look like, Jomana, in terms of campaigning? Jomana Karadsheh, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, look Zain, there has been a lot of concern. The scenario of a second round has been something people have considered before going into this election and the concern was that the opposition that went into this first round really galvanized, really united that, you know, they might not have that same kind of enthusiasm amongst their supporters after really campaigning on this platform of bringing change to this country saying now is the time for change, and that they will transform this country and take it back to being a real democracy and really people. So many people believed in that vision, believed in that promise. And I mean, you look at the turnout yesterday, Turkey does historically have a high turnout but again this is a record high turnout for this country at nearly 90 percent of eligible voters. I mean we were at the polling centers and you saw the elderly coming in on stretchers and wheelchairs. And people really feeling and even first time voters feeling that they need to have their say in what they felt is this most consequential of elections for their country, that this will determine the direction that Turkey is going to be taking the future, that this is not just about the next five years who will rule this country, it is about these two different visions, these two different countries that people envision themselves living in. And this is what they presented with. And if you look at the results of this, and you can see that this is a polarized country. This is a divided nation as we have known all along and the results would tell you that despite the fact that President Erdogan's ratings have suffered losses over the past couple of years especially because of the state of the economy. And then you had all the criticism that he faced in the early days following the devastating earthquake in February, following what many would describe as that disastrous initial response, the lack of preparedness. And there was all this speculation about how much this was going to cost him at the polls. And then you look at these results and you can still see that despite that it does appear while he didn't come out of this victorious, this is still a win for President Erdogan that he still has the support of about fifty percent of this country nearly that he still has the support of his base. And so, we have to wait and see whether the opposition, again, as you mentioned, still vowing, still saying that they will continue, they will fight until the end, that they're going nowhere, promising that they can still win this. Will they be able to keep that sort of optimistic outlook amongst their supporters, still convince people to come out? Will they be able to get any undecided voters? I mean, there is just so much that can happen over the next couple of weeks in what will be the second round of an election like no other in the history of this country.",

Now the question is, is he going to come out and support either side in this race? Is he going to endorse either of these candidates? And does this mean that those who voted for him will vote for either of those candidates in the next round? That's still unclear. I mean, he spoke a short time ago with our Becky Anderson and he said that he hasn't decided that he is going to be in consultation with other members of his coalition. Because if you look at the votes, Zain, that he got, this five percent or so, this is a combination of disenchanted nationalists and also some of the protest votes, people who are unhappy with the choice of Kemal Kilicdaroglu as the opposition's main candidate. So, the question is, five percent, that is significant, that is going to be critical in the next round. Will he get into any sort of an agreement with any of the coalitions, any of the parties that are running? Are we going to see people who voted for him also switch and follow him in this, or are they going to do what they want to do and vote for whoever they believe should lead the country next. So, there's five percent for grabs. You've also got undecided voters. There's just so much that could happen in the next couple of weeks. We'll have to wait and see how it all plays out.",

Last Friday, the two parties signed what is called a declaration of intent to protect civilian lives, but that does not seem to be playing out. In this latest attack, the rapid support forces, this is the paramilitary group that's been fighting with the Sudanese army, claims that it was hit with airstrikes and caused significant damage to the building. They posted this video that shows some of that damage to the hospital and they say that this is a violation of international humanitarian law. Hospitals are supposed to be protected, the wounded are supposed to be going there, they're supposed to be able to operate even in times of war. But here's the thing that we've been seeing throughout the last 30 days of this conflict, the blame game back and forth, because the Sudanese army confirmed that it did attack this hospital, but it said that it targeted weapons, fuel, and ammunition that was stored nearby, and is also accusing the rapid support forces of essentially occupying this hospital from the beginning of the conflict in violation of international humanitarian law. So, both sides accusing the other of violating international humanitarian law. But zoom out here, because like I mentioned, on Friday, the two warring sides sent their representatives to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. They signed what is called a declaration of intent to protect civilian lives. It is not a ceasefire, but it is the first step. And after this, they were supposed to then work out a way to agree on a 10-day ceasefire so that people can get help. So many people who don't have food or medicines or water, basic necessities, can get that. But this flies in the face of that. Even as this conflict, Zain, has now marked 30 days, the U.N. saying 676 people have died, 936,000 people have been displaced, including 200,000 that have crossed over to neighboring countries like Chad and South Sudan and Egypt and Ethiopia.",

Now, to the tense situation at the U.S. southern border with Mexico, authoritiessay the expiration of a Trump era border policy known as Title 42 has actually not led to a surge in migrants as had been expected. In fact, the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary says that border authorities actually saw a 50% drop in the number of migrant encounters compared to earlier in the week. But Alejandro Mayorkas says it's too early to say whether the surge has peaked but border towns, of course, still on high alert. CNN's Polo Sandoval is in El Paso, Texas.

While these attacks did not make a dent in his popularity in big cities, I think in middle Turkey, in the country center they did, that suppressed his popularity a little bit. What is more, Kilicdaroglu was backed by a pro- Kurdish party and Erdogan framed this as Kilicdaroglu being backed by a terrorist group, completely fake news. But these allegations also held some ground. So, I think it's up to him to deflect these attacks on his identity and also support for his party from the pro-Kurdish alliance. He also has to come up and inspire. He's now coming from behind. Erdogan is leading. It looks like momentum is with Erdogan. I think Kilicdaroglu has to make a case that, notwithstanding the not impressive turnout for him, the second round, the electorate should rally behind him because he can govern Turkey more effectively than Erdogan. The brand that Erdogan has successfully marketed is that he's made Turkey a military industrial giant. And I think the electorate kind of fell for that.

Chandler Parsons, who played in Memphis for three years, though never teammates with Morant, tweeted that he believes Morant should not be allowed to play at all next season. ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski is reporting that Commissioner Adam Silver could start seeing increased pressure from other teams around the league to hand down a tougher, lengthier suspension to start next season. It's important to note that after he was seen flashing a gun in March, Morant checked himself into a counseling program. He admitted he needed to get a better handle on dealing with the pressure he faces as a star in the NBA. He had met face to face with the Commissioner who described Morant's actions at the time as quote, irresponsible, reckless and potentially very dangerous, unquote.
