So the conditions here, the streets quite drivable, a light drizzle. All of that going to change dramatically. That's because authorities here on the ground are stressing the wind factor here. It's just going to be a freezing and a flooding threat. And that's why there are some communities not far from where I'm standing this morning where people have been asked to evacuate, with lake levels expected to be         some of the highest they've been in over 30 years.

So the report concludes that, in an effort to overturn election results in key states, Trump and his inner circle engaged in at least 200 attempts to pressure state officials. And it concludes that Trump spearheaded outreach in states where he'd lost but where there were GOP legislatures, including in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona. And of course, we've report on the January 2nd call between Trump and Georgia's secretary of state, where Trump went through a litany of false election claims and then asked the secretary to deliver him a second term by finding just enough votes to ensure a victory. Now, a Georgia special grand jury is looking into Trump's efforts to interfere in that state's election.

He is the conservative attorney who authored a now-infamous memo, detailing step for step how then-Vice President Mike Pence could overturn the 2020 election results. And the report reveals that Eastman actually reached out to speak to Trump on December 23rd, and that's the same day he drafted his initial memo on this Pence theory. And at the time, according to evidence uncovered by the committee, Eastman told a Trump assistant that he just wanted to update the president on \"our\" overall strategic thinking. And the committee wrote that Eastman received a call from the White House switch board. That call lasted about 23 minutes. And Sara, you may remember, Trump really latched onto Eastman's theory as he pressured Pence to block the certification of the electoral results. Now, in addition to the criminal referrals that the committee made earlier this week, the committee is also calling for lawyers involved in these efforts to overturn the election to be held accountable.",

The cells inside your nose, you can think of them as sort of like the first line of defense against germs. These are highly-specialized cells that know what to do when germs arrive. And they don't -- they don't perform very well when it's cold. When it's cold, they just don't do their jobs as well.
