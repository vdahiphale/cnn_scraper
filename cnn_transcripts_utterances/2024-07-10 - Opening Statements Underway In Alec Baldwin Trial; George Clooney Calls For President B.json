I think that we all know from his decades in the limelight that he is someone who speaks his mind. He doesn't hold much back. You know, there could be a lot of risk involved with that as well. This is a jury who I would imagine every single person on there knows a lot about Alec Baldwin. So, it may be better not to let him speak. But perhaps you know, he wants to speak his mind. So, all eyes will certainly be on that. This is expected to run for about eight days. So, the trial should be wrapping up at the end of next week. So, we'll see pretty soon if Baldwin will take the stand.",

So, will that help his case? We don't know. That'll be up to the jury to decide. But they are placing the blame on her. They are saying that this is an accident. But of course, as the prosecution has said, just because it's an accident, that doesn't mean that he does not hold criminal liability.",

      "sentences": "Back to our breaking news this hour. The actor George Clooney is now calling for President Biden to step aside in an op-ed in the New York Times. The actor and Democratic activist writes, it's devastating to say it but the Joe Biden I was with three weeks ago at the fundraiser was not the Joe big effing deal Biden of 2010. He wasn't even the Joe Biden of 2020. He was the same man we all witnessed at the debate.He has also called on key Democrats naming the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and the former Speaker Nancy Pelosi to ask Biden to voluntarily step aside. Clooney appeared alongside Biden, former President Barack Obama, and actress Julia Roberts at a star-studded fundraiser last month in Los Angeles. As that story develops, we'll bring that to you. In the meantime, for the first time since the Boeing Starliner was launched into space, we're hearing from the crew about their extended stay up there. Veteran astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore are still waiting to come home. They were supposed to be in space for a few days, it's now been more than a month. The trip has been delayed several times due to helium leaks and thruster outages. But the crew says they're confident the spacecraft will get them home. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They're doing what they're being asked to do, which is to participate in day-to-day operations for the ISS, while NASA and Boeing continue to look at the data coming from the spacecraft doing as much as they can. Being ultra- conservative, which is fine.But the problem is, the reason they're not bringing them home sooner is because the part that has all the problems, the service module, the thrusters, and the helium leaks. That part detaches when they come home and burns up in the atmosphere. So, they're not going to get it back. So, this is their chance to gather as much data as possible. Now, they've also emphasized there's no danger in the event. And it's necessary, Butch and Suni can get in the vehicle and come back. It's cleared to come back. The helium leaks are very minor. NASA has stated repeatedly they can tolerate over one hundred times the leak rate that they're seeing. The thrusters four out of the five have been re-enabled. They should be fine for entry. And even if they're permanently disabled, the other ones can pick up the slack. So, just being extra conservative. And Butch and Suni, I'm sure they're -- you know, astronauts like being in space, so they don't mind spending a little extra time up there. But they're -- they'll be ready to come home when things are cleared up.",

Even during this mission, obviously, things are not going the way that Boeing would have liked.Ironically, Boeing was chosen as the \"backup.\" NASA is saying, well back you know, years ago, we kind of like what SpaceX is doing, but we're not sure they can do it. Well, let's give Boeing the same contract, but with twice as much money. And we know they can do it. Well, SpaceX has been delivering astronauts to and from ISS for almost three years now. And now, you know, Boeing is about somewhere between one and one and a half billion dollars in the red out of their own pocket on this fixed price contract. So, they're not enjoying this, either. But, yes, a lot of issues with the spacecraft. But I wouldn't say that Butch and Suni are stuck. I mean, they -- if there's an emergency on board and they need to come down, they can get that vehicle come down, you know. But you know, there's no -- there's no rush to get them down, I guess, is the issue. And so, if they're stuck, you know, per se, then that's because NASA is just being a little extra conservative.",

Hey, you know, we kind of need to -- you know, get these guys off the -- off the vehicle. But it shouldn't be a problem because we have regular resupply vessels that bring up cargo and supplies up to the station. So, I think they're probably in good shape.",
