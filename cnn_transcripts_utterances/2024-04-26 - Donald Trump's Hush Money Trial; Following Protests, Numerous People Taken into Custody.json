He is charged with falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Testimony begins very shortly. On the stand will be David Pecker, who used to run the \"National Enquirer\". He is in the middle of cross examination this morning.Let's discuss what just happened and what is about to happen. With me, Defense Attorney and Former Prosecutor Randy Zelin and CNN Legal Analyst and Former Federal Prosecutor Michael Moore. I just want to read a little bit of what was one of the key points for the prosecution in direct to set the stage for where we are right now. One of the things the prosecution tried to do is suggest that the payments to Karen McDougal, ultimately to Stormy Daniels as well, were about the campaign. And just the campaign, or mostly the campaign. So, there's this exchange from prosecutor Josh Steinglass. After Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for president, did he ever say anything to you that indicated he was concerned about what Melania Trump or Ivanka Trump would think about these affairs? David Pecker says, no. And just before that, he said that it was about the campaign. He was worried about the campaign. Randy, to you, why was that important for the prosecution? How effective do you think that argument was?",

      "sentences": "Well, it was important because it certainly now creates a bridge from the former president's brain to the allegations in the case. Because, remember, it's got to be a specific other crime. The false entries are simply a misdemeanor. To get to the felony, you've got to be doing it in furtherance of another crime. Here we have the election fraud. So, what Mr. Pecker testified to now allows the jury to link the former president to election fraud.Is it a big deal? No, I don't think it's a big deal at all. John, quite frankly, a trial is all about whose story makes more sense. Whose story is more credible. Who do I like better? And right now, this is all old news. It is a victimless crime. It is so old, and I don't think it has any impact on the election at all, which is all the former president really cares about.",

What does the defense in cross need to do to undo the gains that the prosecution made? MICHAEL MOORE, CNN LEGAL ANALYST AND FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY:  Yes, well, I'm glad to be with both of you this morning. You know, it was good testimony for the prosecution to get out and make that link. I mean, there is maybe a tendency by some to throw a party every time the campaign word is mentioned in this trial. That's not going to be enough. They're going to have to tie in the fact that there was an intent to do this to actually influence the election, they have not done that yet. But they're trying to work their way and build the blocks. You think about a house would lay it bricks for the foundation, and that's kind of what they are doing is brick by brick, trying to get information out. The cross examination then brought out good information to the contrary. And that was that this is normal. What we're -- what -- what's happened here is normal. These stories, this paying people for this checkbook journalism, that's normal. So, that's so contradicting and deflating, if you will, the prosecution's bubble about the fact that this was campaign because Mr. Pecker testified there are celebrities that do this. We do this for the politicians. We do this for people. Trump's certainly not the originator of this idea to do this catch and kill practice. And so, you're watching now with -- through the cross examination, some chiseling away of the foundation that the prosecution has been trying to build over these last few days. So, that will continue today. I would urge that a trial though is a little bit like a small roller coaster. There are a lot of ups and downs and you don't get to the big hill until the end. So, we're going to be watching sort of the back-and-forth match between the defense team and the prosecution team for the next few weeks. That would be good days for both.",

What we call a constructive cross examination.The more you can show through David Pecker that this is done all the time. The more you can show through David Pecker that Michael Cohen was running the show. He's the fixer. The more you can show that this is what the former president does. He surrounds people, pays them and says, make this all stuff go away. I don't care how you do it. You do that, the jury is left with eyes glazed over, and at least one of them is going to say, I'm not convicting.

And Michael, I do understand that in and of themselves, there may not be any illegality in those conversations. But if a trial is all about the impressions made, the jury sitting there, I imagine going, huh, that's interesting. Donald Trump is asking a lot about Karen McDougal, this former Playboy playmate.

I mean, he's out there talking to David Pecker and doing checks and running accounts and -- I mean, that's his thing. And so, he's going to have his own problems on cross. But this effort by the prosecution makes a lot of sense to me, whether it's successful, we'll see. But they have to tie Trump to this, you know, we can talk about that there's a conspiracy. There's an agreement. But we have -- they're going to have to put some meat on the bones of those allegations if they intend to have a shot to get a guilty verdict in the case.",
