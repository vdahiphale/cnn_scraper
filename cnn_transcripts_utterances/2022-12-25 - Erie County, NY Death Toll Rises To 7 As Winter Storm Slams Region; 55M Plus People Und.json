Just today alone, that number leads the way in the U.S. where, overall, we were talking about well over 1,500 flights that have been canceled because of all of this cold weather that has moved across the U.S. We caught up with a number of passengers this morning. One guy I just talked to a few minutes ago, he was here yesterday trying to get onto a flight. He's already back in that line, trying to see if he can get out with his family.

Normally, prosecutors are out front. But the committee has been doing this longer than the DOJ and they seem to have gotten more information from witnesses than the prosecutors have.

I think the two charges most likely to be charged from January 6, are the conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of an official proceeding. And you don't have to take my word for it. There was a federal judge, very well- respected, Judge Carter, who has said in open court that it's more likely than not that Donald Trump violated those two crimes, but it's different between a judge saying it and prosecutors having to prove it beyond any reasonable doubt.",

A lot of people are really uncomfortable. But now just think for context. Take that, at least we can get back to mostly heated homes and take that in the context of Ukraine today, where the Russians are consciously trying to knock out electricity and heat and millions of people are in a cold like we're experiencing or even colder with nowhere to go and watch how they're banding together, pulling together, becoming even more defiant. I just wanted to give that perspective as we go through our very uncomfortable cold snap and that country is suffering through a Russian missile and drone induced, I think it's just punitive. Kherson, and I use that word punitive. There's no reason for the Russians to be firing or flying all these missiles and drones and our trailer (ph) into the area. Reportedly 18, sadly, Ukrainians died in the last 36 hours and a number more in the past week. This is -- there is no real military effect that the Russians are doing this. And again, I think all it does, Paula, friends is it's just increasing the Ukrainian resolve and defiance. You see it in that area. You see it in this Christmas season in the cities, in Kyiv.
