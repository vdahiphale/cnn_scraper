      "sentences": "Hello, and welcome to all of you watching us here in the United States, Canada and all around the world. I'm Kim Brunhuber. We begin with breaking news with what some call a once-in-a-half-century extreme weather happening right now in Florida. As we speak, up to 20 inches of rain has fallen in parts of South Florida in the past few hours. With more in the forecast.Will that lead to a flash flood emergency. The highest possible level of flood warning. So, what you see here is the Fort Lauderdale- Hollywood International Airport, which is partly underwater and closed until at least noon on Thursday. The city of Fort Lauderdale has activated its emergency operations center and plans to issue a local state of emergency. Officials also say airboats and high-water vehicles will join rescue operations in the coming hours. For the latest we go to meteorologist Britley Ritz here in Atlanta who's keeping an eye on all of this. Obviously, really folks in Florida used to storms but, you know, what we're seeing now so unusual. Take us through what they're seeing and what they can expect.",

      "sentences": "Yes. Thankfully things have tamed down a bit. Kim. But unfortunately, still dealing with flood warnings throughout the overnight hours and early morning hours with just a few more inches of rain expected for some of these areas. As for rainfall totals, Dania Beach over 13 inches. And Lauderdale pushing over 12 inches. These are estimated preliminary rainfall totals.So, there's still room for more to come. 10 to 20 inches right there near the airport. Now if that's the case, if we hit 20 inches and we verify that, that means we have hit a once-in-1000, onceoin-5000-year rainfall amount. Folks this is a very serious situation. So, do not drive the roadways. 12 to 18 inches of moving water to lift your vehicle right off the ground and many are already stranded. I've seen video of it. Thankfully, the rain chances have tamed back a bit for Southeast Florida but that same area of low pressure that brought the rain there working its way up through the Panhandle and right up into parts of Mobile, some flooding possible there as the heavier rain starts to set in. So, through your Thursday afternoon that rain pushes up through the Panhandle and then finally starts to taper back late Thursday and into Friday. Rainfall totals to come through Friday and additional one, possibly two inches of rain along the east coast of Florida. Again, the heavier rain will be concentrated around Mobile. Another two to four inches possible. And we also have the threat for stronger storms too. With the spin of that low we not only bring in heavy rain but also the threat for isolated tornadoes. Record warmth also a possibility. Some of these locations could be dealing with temperatures well above their normal. 65 possible record temperatures broken from the Midwest to the Northeast. Kim?",

Now, two new studies show water levels are rising much faster than previously thought in cities along the southeastern U.S. coast. Experts say that's even fueling more powerful hurricanes and stronger storm surges. One analysis shows an increase of almost five inches or more than 12 centimeters over the past decade.Cities at most risk include Houston, New Orleans, Tampa, and Miami. So, joining me now is a co-author of one of those studies. Tor Tornqvist is a Vokes geology professor at Tulane University in New Orleans. Thanks so much for being here with us. So first, I just want to get your take on what we're seeing right now in Florida. I mean, we keep -- seem to experience these once-in-a-century-type of weather events, but they seem to be becoming the new normal.",

So, it turns out that starting roughly around the year 2010 that the rate of sea level rise in, say, the southeastern part of the United States, so roughly from North Carolina, southward all the way down to South Texas, the rate of sea level rise has increased really dramatically. And we basically looked at rates that are exceeding 10 millimeters per year, which is, you know, at least twice, if not three times the global average.So, this is clearly an unusual situation. And part of this is, of course, the result of climate change and global warming and rising, you know, accelerating sea levels that we see in most of the world. But in this particular region, we see that the rate has gone up much higher and say last 10 to 12 years.",

And these issues, you know, when you talk to people, they're top of mind for many people, but the people I talked to, it wasn't necessarily because of the environmental reasons or even because they perceive, they themselves are under greater threat of flooding and sea level rise. The issue for many folks is insurance, it's become so expensive to get insurance, if you live anywhere near the water. Many folks can't afford it anymore.So, when we talk about this idea of managed retreat, the idea of encouraging or even forcing people away from these flood prone areas. I mean, is that what has to happen, basically trying to price people out of these areas to get out of these areas that could face sea level rise? Tore Yes. Well, that's a really good question. And I can actually speak to that, at a very personal level because I lost my insurance last winter. And that to very, very quickly find a new insurer for my home. And that is -- that is a common thing around here. There are, of course, areas, I'm lucky that I live in a -- in a city that is still reasonably well protected. But people who live in more outlying areas closer to the coast, they often face a situation that they can barely get any insurance. And you're right. That is leading to, you know, that certainly could have contributed to population loss that we start to see in, you know, parts of the state that are closer to the coast. And in fact, there was a report just last week that -- I think four out of the top 10 counties in the United States, in terms of population loss are here in South Louisiana. And, you know, that has to do with big storms, like we've had, you know, a lot of major hurricanes in the last few years. And that leads to people leaving. And, of course, people try to come back but not everyone comes back. And yes, that leads to, you know, what you're referring to this retreat. BRUNHUBER: Yes. It's certainly really concerning, especially as we watch the situation in Florida now just reminder of how much is at stake. Tor Tornqwist, thank you so much for joining us. Really appreciate it.",
