      "sentences": "Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.Right now, a major crisis at the U.S.-Mexico border is reaching a boiling point. A larger number of migrants is expected to try to cross the border to be processed in just about four days time after a federal appeals court rejected Republican efforts to keep the Trump- era policy Title 42 in place. Title 42 allows authorities to quickly expel migrants who cross into the U.S., citing health concerns over the COVID pandemic. But unless the U.S. Supreme Court acts, the policy will expire on Wednesday. CNN has reporters on both sides of the border and in Washington. Let's begin with Ed Lavandera, who is in El Paso, Texas. Ed, the city is seeing more than 2,000 migrants crossing every day. So how are officials now preparing for a possible increase next week?",

      "sentences": "You know El Paso for the last week has been the focal point of these days leading up to the end of Title 42, and the surge of migrants that have arrived here actually probably has very little to do with the ending of Title 42, more to do with just the timing of a large group of migrants arriving in the Juarez, Mexico area.But many of them have been released after being processed by Border Patrol agents here in the El Paso area. And they are waiting to leave the city. But there's such a backlog of so many people that it's created scenes like this here in the streets around the bus stations in downtown where people have been sleeping out on the streets. You can see this is some of the campsites, if you will, that are still left over from last night. And Fredricka, I can tell you is because there are so many people here, and we can just walk through the crowd here to give you a sense of just how many people are here, is that it is taking many of these people several days to get out of the El Paso region because there just aren't enough buses to get them to where they need to be. So that is why you are seeing so many people like this. The nights have been painfully frigid, very dangerous situations. Actually, the emergency management teams here in El Paso have teams going around the streets, urging people, and they're trying desperately to find as much shelter space as possible, especially to get young children off the streets in these overnight hours where the temperatures have dipped close to freezing. But many of these people are waiting several days to get on buses. And city officials here say that really is the key to making this go as smoothly as possible and averting a total humanitarian meltdown crisis here in the city. And they are really working on trying to get as many buses and people moved to bigger transportation hubs. So city officials say that they are talking to folks in Phoenix, Denver, Dallas, Houston, to try to get many of these people on buses, moved to those cities as quickly as possible, because from there there's more options. They can move to their final destinations much more quickly. So that's what officials say will really be one of the big focal points this coming week when Title 42 is lifted on Wednesday.",

They believe that their countries are not going to allow the people to be returned. Some fear that they're going to be deported back into Mexico but through another border. So the confusion is greater here.And also, the authorities here, they don't know what to do. They say here in Juarez, they were used to people being deported, but not people coming in in these large numbers to try to get in. They are struggling also with the shelters, with the services. And just like we have seen some governments in the U.S. bussing people farther north, states farther south in Mexico, they don't want to see the people walking through their state. They are helping with buses to bring them through to the border. Not only Ciudad Juarez, this is happening in Piedras Negras, Eagle Pass, McAllen. This is a larger issue.",

But it took on new meaning after that judge last month made the decision that the program would need to be lifted by December 21st. As mentioned earlier, last night a federal appeals court blocked an effort by some Republican-led states to try to keep this plan in place. And last night a White House spokesperson reacted, saying that they are focusing on a robust effort to try to manage border issues in the wake as they are expected Title 42 to be lifted on Wednesday. That spokesperson went on to say, \"To be clear, the lifting of a Title 42 public health order does not mean the border is open. Anyone who suggests otherwise is doing the work of smugglers spreading misinformation to make a quick buck off of vulnerable migrants. We will continue to fully enforce our immigration laws and work to expand legal pathways for migration while discouraging disorderly and unsafe migration.\" The Department of Homeland Security has been working for quite some time to develop a plan for when Title 42 is lifted. They released some points about that plan earlier in the week, and that includes trying to surge resources and personnel to try to deal with some of this processing along the border. They are also establishing some temporary facilities to do that processing. And they're also trying to ramp up, as mentioned earlier, on the ground and air transportation to try to process and move some of these migrants as they are expecting this increase to come on Wednesday. The White House has also asked Congress for more than $3 billion in funding in anticipation of this Title 42 change. And one thing that the White House has repeatedly said, that in order to fix issues at the border, it does require comprehensive immigration reform. And they have urged Congress to act. But right now, the White House and Biden administration are staring down this very steep challenge with Title 42 set to end on Wednesday.",

Remember, not only does RSV not have a vaccine, it also doesn't have a therapy. There is no treatment for it. There's only supportive treatment.

And so it really will depend on where you are.And just because we don't now see an increase in cases, it doesn't mean hospital beds aren't available, because people who are admitted and they're sick and they're still there taking up those beds, because they are not well enough to leave. So remember that just because you don't see cases increasing, those people in the hospital can be quite ill and are there for long periods of time. And that's why the beds aren't available.

After going through three years of this draconian, heavy-handed approach to COVID, now the government trying to downplay COVID. People here were caught off guard by the sudden reopening. Many feel like they weren't given enough time or resources to get ready.Across the country, fever medicine and antigen test kits are incredibly hard to get and out of stock here in Beijing. The country is scrambling now to boost the elderly vaccination rate and increase ICU capacity. At a state media event, some health experts even admitted that, quote, \"We were not super well prepared in certain aspects.\" The chief infectious disease doctor at a Beijing hospital said there have been outbreaks among doctors, nurses, and other staff, putting strain on the system. The doctor continued that, quote, \"We expect the overwhelming strain on medical services to be on hospital wards as infections reach the elderly population.\" This decision to relax COVID restrictions during China's winter when millions are expected to travel across the country for the new year holiday and also while seasonal flu could further strain hospitals, this timing has led to a wave of criticism on Chinese social media. State media has reported that all vacations for doctors and nurses in China's central Henan Province will be canceled until March. The report said, quote, \"Health workers must be on duty 24 hours a day to ensure we smoothly pass this transition period.\" Henan, which is the third most populous province in China, is ranked among the top destinations during this Chinese New Year travel rush. Experts say that considering how obsessed this government is with control, it is striking just how little preparation there has been for such a dramatic exit from Zero COVID.

And most of the fish, they did not survive. And two people were injured. The Berlin fire brigade says it is rescuing fish that are in containers in the basement of the building. And at this point it's still unclear what caused the aquarium to burst. A devoted daughter helped save her dad's business small business selling horror-themed Christmas ornaments.
