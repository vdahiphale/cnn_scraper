You know, Tom mentioned earlier about the chaos in these situations. And he's absolutely right. People see a lot of things. Make a lot of assumptions.So right now we don't know if there's a second shooter or not just from the actions that a police officer who doesn't really look like they're searching for a second suspect at least in the mall, might be wrong but it just seems like even the SWAT officers around the SWAT vehicles, those are the very ones that would be conducting such a search. But they don't seem to have that urgency that you would think you would have if they thought there was a second active shooter. So we don't know yet. I'm sure that there will be a statement coming out at some point in time. Hopefully soon, from some official at the scene that at least give you some preliminary information to kind of set people's minds at ease. But it looks like this is going to be something where we've got some people who unfortunately may have lost their lives in this particular incident. I hope that's not true. The shooter, I mean, that is what it is. I'm not concerned about the shooter. But I'm talking about innocent people who may have been seriously injured or killed. And hopefully, that's not the case. But it doesn't look very good.",

The other problem is the shooter could easily have gotten into a car in the parking lot and maybe trying to escape, posing as just a victim or a shopper, or they could have carjacked somebody. So you can't even let the cars leave without looking at the cars.I would say, though, you know, dovetailing on what Chief Ramsey said, every active shooter that I've been involved with there's always one more shooter reported than actually were. And when you get somebody who is dressed in tactical clothing, generally that's somebody who's not going to ask somebody to come along for the ride. So my blink on this, and I could be wrong, but I would say that the reports of a second shooter are frequent and usually not reliable. Not always. I mean, sometimes there are more than one but statistically I don't usually see them.",

This has all the earmarks, as the chief said, of something that has been at least resolved as far as the exigency of the situation. You see all those cars right there. A decision is going to have to be made on who you let out and how far you're going to go with the search.And part of that's going to kind of lean on what they know about the shooter that is dead.

Again, you know, it wouldn't be unusual, especially when we're talking about, you know, being in Texas and all that you had shoppers that were armed. But they're just there shopping. They're not, you know, doing anything wrong. They just happened to be armed.So I'm sure if they heard shots fired, some of them or at least one would probably take it upon themselves to take action of some kind. And If I'm a citizen and I see another guy with a gun and shooting, I can assume that that's a second shooter. But the fact that the officers -- I'm just looking at the posture, the way in which they're, you know, moving around especially around the SWAT vehicles and things of that nature. That indicates to me that there is not an active search for a second gunman at this point in time. So there's a lot of stuff that still has to be sorted out. That's why you haven't heard anything in terms of any kind of media presentation. They want to try to provide as much accurate information as possible. And the first information you get is usually not accurate. I mean, you get a whole lot of information but it takes a minute to kind of sort through it to a point where you actually have concrete information that you can pass along to the public.

Still trying to piece everything together. And according to information from law enforcement sources that spoke to our colleague John Miller, one shooter is dead. That shooter appears to have been wearing tactical gear. Now they are still looking for a possible second shooter. Now in these incidents, there's always a possibility that witnesses may have seen the shooter and described him differently. So it is still unclear if there was a second shooter but authorities are of course doing their due diligence trying to figure out if there is still a risk here. They have not told us how many people were shot, if people were shot. So we're waiting to hear about the details, the numbers, and really exactly what happened at the outlets here on Saturday afternoon in Allen, Texas. But there are many witnesses who are describing the chaos there, who say they were trying to get out of the area, who say they were terrified. Not just people who were at the area where they believe a shooting happen, but also people who are trying to reunite with their daughter, for example, who worked at the outlets. So there are families still trying to figure out exactly where their loved ones were because this was so chaotic. But again, we are waiting for a lot of details from authorities -- Paula.",

But you can figure out that, you know, perhaps that is someone who is -- had a love one either very close or perhaps wounded in this attack.And obviously she's had several police officers there trying to help her. And I think they took her away to another location to, you know, either console her or to get the best information that she can possibly get. But clearly someone very distraught there and tearful about what exactly was unfolding here. You know, and that really captures the franticness and the terrifying nature of a situation like this as so many people directly impacted by a shooting of this magnitude, or a situation of this magnitude. And just how quickly, you know, this word spread and how desperate people are for the best possible information that they can get.

We need to go forward and put barriers to those people getting guns. The other problem we have, though, is that we have tens of millions of semi-automatic rifles in society right now and if we were able to wave a magic wand and stop the sale or manufacture of them right now, we've still got to deal with the fact that there are millions and millions and millions of them out there. So we have to hit it from the mental health side. We have to hit it from the firearm side, and we have to hit it from hardening areas where there are a lot of public involvement. We did this after 9/11 with airports. We're going to have to, I'm afraid, do that same thing with schools, malls, churches, things like that.",

So, we're going to -- sorry, we're going to try to move out of the way here one second so this officer can move. Anyway, Paula, as I was saying, as the officer was leaving the scene here, the witnesses that we talked to say that they felt like the amount of time that the shooting lasted was about -- went over the course of 20 to 30 minutes when many people were then scrambling to get into the back storage areas of these outlet malls, and that's where many of them took cover. We also spoke with one witness who works at a hamburger place -- a restaurant there inside kind of where the you see the flashing lights there in the distance, she actually showed us a picture of one of the victims on the ground in front of that store. She believed that that was the gunman. We have not been able to confirm that at this moment. That is something that we're continuing to walk through, but we saw the picture of officers standing over one of the victims there. So the intensity, she was shaking, trembling, completely traumatized by witnessing -- and the experience that she underwent. Several of the other witnesses and you can hear from one of them, now, we're going to play some sound, he talked about how he was -- what he believes to be just missing the area where the shooting unfolded, had just walked through that area about five seconds earlier and this is what he described in these moments after the shooting erupted.
