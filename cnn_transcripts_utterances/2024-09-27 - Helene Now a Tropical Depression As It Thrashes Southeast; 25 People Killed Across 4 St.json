The storm, now a tropical depression, but it's dumping catastrophic amounts of rain across the region, even triggering landslides. Officials say all roads in western North Carolina should be considered closed amid the severe flooding. And the National Weather Service is warning a dam there is at risk of imminent failure.We also have new video out of Atlanta showing cruises. They rescue people trapped in rising waters. At least 25 people across four states have been killed. Now, Helene made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane in Florida's Big Bend region last night. This is some of the devastation you can see behind me that was left behind. For more on this, let's go to CNN's Nick Valencia in Atlanta. Nick, what is the situation like where you are right now?",

But some of this water, believe it or not, is being pumped out of the homes here behind me, out of their basements.In fact, I spoke to a resident who said she had nine feet of water in her basement - you see that - where some of this water is coming from. And then you see this man out here. He's a cardiologist, we understand, at a local hospital. He's got sewage that he's cleaning off his front steps because there's a sewage pump just to the off camera to me. But one of the more harrowing stories that we heard since our several hours of being here is what happened to the owner of that white Sedan here, Angelina Madut. She was working the overnight shift at a bakery in Norcross said she couldn't afford to miss a day of work. And even though she knew that Tropical Storm Helene was on its way to the area, she had to get to work and she had to get back. She comes through this road all the time, but she didn't really remember or understand just the grade here and the flooding. It really basically just submerged her car. You could see some video from earlier today. The water level on that car was reaching to the top of the window. We caught up with her husband. In fact, it was a meteorologist, a former HLN meteorologist, Bob Van Dillen, that was able to, you know, risk his own personal safety. He pulled her out of the car and was able to take her to safety. We talked to the woman's husband a short time ago. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ERNIST MADUT, ANGELINA MADUT'S HUSBAND: Tried to roll down the window and then the water came in and she was panicked. And, you know, I'd say, you know, just scream and, you know, and wave at them. And that's when Bob, which they parked their car facing that way and they didn't know what was, you know, behind them. So realize, you know, she - someone need help and came out.",

Now that the sun is up, we're really starting to get a sense for how powerful Helene was when it hit this part of Florida, right in the Big Bend area in Steinhatchee. You can see some of the debris that they've already started to pile together. All of this from last night's storm surge.This entire area was covered with pieces of docks, some boats that had floated up out of the water as well. And as we walk this way, this entire area was covered last night. We were a little further up the hill on higher ground, but we saw that storm surge come in and really where I'm standing right now, the water would have been above me. Another perspective, you can see these buildings here. The water was up to about the roof level. So significant, significant amount of flooding. And now as we look at the cleanup, I want to point out, you can see a dock that was in the water, it was way further up the hill. It's now been moved closer to the marina. That's a new dock. The owner of this marina telling me when they were hit by Idalia last year, they had most of their docks destroyed. They had just spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to rebuild them to get ready for this year. Now they've been hit by yet another storm. They were hoping these new docks would survive this storm. Obviously, you can see significant damage here in Steinhatchee. A lot of cleanup ahead as we're just, again, really getting a sense from officials how bad the damage was as they start their assessments.",

Helene is a tropical depression, so it's starting to lose its skeleton, but that doesn't mean that it won't produce this flooding rain. It continues to do that across the Carolinas.We still have tropical storm-force gusts. Cincinnati gusting up to 45 miles per hour; Louisville, 40-mile-per-hour gusts. At Charleston, winds are gusting to 31 miles per hour. You can see the rain is stretching all the way into southeast Missouri and then the Carolina coast there. So, again, a very wide storm as we've been talking about. Look at the flood watches, all of that green areas where we're seeing some of this heavy rain from Helene. But we've really been focusing on the western Carolinas. All of this white outline means that those are flash flood emergencies. That is the highest level that we have to alert people about rising waters and flash flooding. It has been catastrophic what's been going on in the western Carolinas out there today. I mean, they've had so much rain. The rain is tapering off, but that doesn't mean it's over because now the rivers are aggravated. They're rising, getting to record levels and then spilling. So just incredible to see what's been going on around the Asheville area, Hickory, the mountains and the foothills. Some of these rainfall totals have been over a foot - well over a foot. All of these kind of purples that you see here near Asheville are these totals that are over 10 inches. This is also a mountainous area, so the terrain isn't really good at taking in this water. So it has nowhere to go but to rush down the mountain and that's where you get these landslides that are such a concern. Here's a look at some of these rain totals. I mean, some of these mountains here in North Carolina were approaching 30 inches of rain. Thirty inches - 13 inches has fallen in Asheville. So again, the river problems will continue as we go into the weekend. Danny?",

      "sentences": "Well, there is no question that today's strike marks a significant escalation by Israel in this nearly year-long conflict with Hezbollah, following a series of escalatory actions by Israel over the course of the last week and a half or so. We have seen since those pager attacks that Israel has consistently been going one rung up the ladder almost every single day as it looks to intentionally escalate this conflict and to try and de-link it, effectively, from the war in Gaza.While Hezbollah has said that they would stop firing rockets on northern Israel should Israel stop the war in Gaza, Israeli officials believe that this is the better strategy to get Hezbollah to stop firing rockets, to effectively beat Hezbollah back into submission, to stop them from firing rockets in northern Israel and to restore security there, where some 60,000 Israeli residents have been displaced from their homes. An Israeli security official telling me tonight that indeed Hassan Nasrallah was the target of this strike. But I'm told that at this hour, the Israeli military is still conducting what's known as a battle damage assessment to determine whether or not Nasrallah was actually killed in this strike. What is clear, though, as Admiral Daniel Hagari, the Israeli military spokesman, announced this evening, the Israeli military went after what they describe as Hezbollah's underground headquarters beneath residential buildings in the southern suburbs of Beirut. And when you look at the power of this explosion and the Israeli strategy that we have seen being employed in Gaza, this suggests the use of very heavy munitions, potentially those 2,000-pound bombs that are used to penetrate targets deep underground, but that leave in their wake enormous civilian casualties. And, in this case, we have seen six different buildings, according to Lebanese state news agency, that have been flattened in this strike. The death toll expected to continue to rise. And these strikes clearly putting this region very, very much on edge, escalating the situation even further, where it seems almost difficult to imagine how this region and how this conflict between Israel and Hezbollah can be turned away from all-out war. FREEMAN: And, Jeremy, before you go, we couldn't help but notice behind you, it seemed like there was, perhaps, rocket fire in the air. I know you were speaking with us, but can you give any clarity on what might have been happening in the background of your shot there?",
