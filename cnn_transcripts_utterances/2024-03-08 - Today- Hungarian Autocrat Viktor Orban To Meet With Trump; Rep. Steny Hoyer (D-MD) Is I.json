I'll speak to the Labor Secretary about that in just a few moments. And later, a tire comes off, comes flying off a United Airlines flight during takeoff, damaging cars in the airport parking lot. Hello, I'm Wolf Blitzer in Washington. And you're in the CNN Newsroom. President Biden is taking a victory lap after his fiery State of the Union address. A CNN poll finding more than six and 10 viewers had a positive reaction to the speech last night. Over the course of 66 minutes, the President sought to assuage concerns about his age and contrast, his vision for America with Donald Trump's MAGA movement. President Biden blasted the former president more than a dozen times without ever saying his name, referring to him simply as my predecessor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

They said it was a friendly meeting between two people with no agenda. But of course, it is hard to see how Viktor Orban and Donald Trump could sit down with no agenda, these two powerful, one current leader, one former leader.But this is significant for a number of reasons. One, Donald Trump is not just the former president but he is also the Republican nominee, presumptive nominee and could be the next president. Other side of the coin here is that the White House did not issue Orban a formal invitation to come to the White House and Orban did not reach out to the White House for any meeting with any sit down in terms of the Biden administration. The other part of this that is significant is that Donald Trump is to win November, this will give us an idea of who he is aligning himself with in terms of world leaders. You mentioned there that Viktor Orban is a European autocrat, he's authoritarian. It's not so surprising that Donald Trump has often said that he admires these authoritarian leaders. I want you to listen to exactly what he has said about Viktor Orban. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He is a great man, a great leader in Europe, Viktor Orban. He's the Prime Minister of Hungary. He's a very great leader, very strong man. Some people don't like him because he's too strong. It's nice to have a strong man running a country. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Any country that's confronts that kind of an enemy understand, it's got to respond. And very frankly, former responses have not worked. We've constantly had additional attacks, rocket attacks, personal attacks by Hamas, notwithstanding peace agreements or cessation of fire.So that I think he was absolutely right. And I think he's absolutely right, on the fact that humanitarian concerns need to be at the forefront of our actions. I think the deployment, as a matter of fact, I had called the White House and suggested that we put some hospital ships out there as well, so that we can get people who need health emergency care, hospital care, have a facility which is not in harm's way, not being hidden under or around by Hamas in a hospital or in a school or in some other humanitarian related agency. So that I think he made the right balance in defeating terrorism defeating Hamas, but also making sure that innocent civilians, men, women and children are able to get out of harm's way and get the treatment, food, nutrition that they need. So I think he set the right balance, and we need to pursue that.",

Secretary, thank you so much for joining us. First of all, what more can you tell us about these latest jobs report a very significant number of jobs added this month.

And that means that people are being, you know, they're able to go to the grocery store, go to the pump, and feel that difference. I travel the country. I was in Atlanta earlier this week. And then Madison, Wisconsin, and I'm talking to working people, families, young people who are in training programs for jobs, they didn't even know existed, employers who are looking for workers.And I think the overall numbers are just the macro sense of what we're seeing on the ground, which is jobs being created, shovels in the ground, people opening up facilities to build electric vehicles, buses, and then to store them and make them part of their public transit system. All of those things improve lives for working Americans and for American families. And that's what we want to see. That's what we're going to continue to work toward. And your point about the racial gap and unemployment is very important to the President and to me. We're building an economy where no one gets left behind.

And then people said, oh, my gosh, the markets too hot and now everything's going to come crashing down. And none of those things have come to pass.And so the latest jobs number just further confirm that when you have strong, steady leadership, when you invest in America's industries, and America's workers, and when you create jobs, and then pathways for all communities, so they can put their talent into those jobs. That's a recipe for strength. And, you know, we talk about each month numbers, but the three-month average for job creation is 265,000.
