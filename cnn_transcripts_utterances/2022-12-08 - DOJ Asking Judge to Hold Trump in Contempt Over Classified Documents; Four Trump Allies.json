      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, this comes as the Justice Department continues to ratchet up the pressure on Donald Trump as part of their criminal investigation around what happened to documents from the Trump presidency that the former president apparently kept with him in different places after he left office.So, Wolf, the ways this arose is that, in May, there had been a subpoena for documents from Trump where the Justice Department didn't believe that they had gotten everything. There was that search we saw at Mar-a-Lago in August where they were collecting more documents being kept by Trump. And there continued to be these questions that the Justice Department had. Do we have everything? They kept wanting to get more. They kept wanting to believe that there may be still documents that Donald Trump had in his possession. And so this went into court, very confidentially. It was all sealed. And just recently, there were some more searches conducted by Trump's team where they found additional documents. They actually found two more that were marked as classified, turned them over to investigators. Even with that, the Justice Department is not satisfied. They believe that there still possibly could be more documents in Donald Trump's possession, and that's where this new proceeding comes in, where the Justice Department is asking a federal judge in Washington, D.C. to hold Donald Trump and his office as the former president in contempt of court. Of course, we don't know exactly how this will be resolved, but it is yet another chapter in this ongoing struggle for the Justice Department to try and get back everything that Donald Trump may have kept after the presidency.",

As you heard from Secretary Blinken, this was not a question of getting both Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan home. This was not a question of us having to choose between Brittney Griner and Paul Whelan. This was a decision for us that essentially came down to one or none. And so, of course, we took the deal that was on the table to bring Brittney Griner home at the same time, reaffirming the commitment we've made repeatedly, including today to Paul Whelan, to his family, to David, to Elizabeth, to his other loved ones that we are going to continue to do absolutely everything we can to bring Paul Whelan home just as soon as we can.",

And that is an imperative to deter countries, or even non-state actors, like terrorist groups, from engaging in this horrific practice, this practice of detaining, imprisoning, holding hostage innocent Americans. We can do both. And we're going to continue down that second path by ensuring that those responsible for this practice face costs, whether that's sanctions, whether that's visa bans as part of a new executive order that President Biden signed in recent weeks. We're being very clear with the American people regarding where they should not travel because they could well face the risk of wrongful detention if they travel there. And importantly, for this building, we're working with countries around the world, nearly 60 countries to establish and to reinforce a norm against this horrible practice, to make clear to countries and non-state actors around the world that there will be costs, there will be significant repercussions for those who engage in this practice that should have been relegated long ago to the dustbin of history.",

Well, credit has to go to the Biden administration, to John Finer, the National Security Council, and the president who made this tough decision to get Brittney Griner out in exchange for Bout, who is a bad guy, an arms dealer. I had been to Russia twice. The good news is that we got a marine out earlier and then Brittney Griner. So, we now have to get Paul Whelan out. The inside stuff is -- I can't get too much into it, but we were hoping for a two for two, Paul Whelan and Brittney for Bout and another Russian. But at the end, I think the geopolitical differences, the bad relationship between Russia and the United States. Russia said, we'll do one for one. And I think the president was right to go ahead with Brittney Griner, get her home to her family, to her father, to her wife who I've been talking to constantly. But now we have got to concentrate on Paul Whelan. And I think we have to make an effort to get him out before the end of the year. Because I think his family deserved that. He is wrongfully detained. He is a marine. He deserves to come out.",
