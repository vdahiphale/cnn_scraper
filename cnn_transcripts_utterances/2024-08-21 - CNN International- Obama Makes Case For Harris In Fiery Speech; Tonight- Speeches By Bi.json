Just hours from now, the Minnesota governor will step onto the spotlight just weeks after joining Kamala Harris on the Democratic ticket. Tonight, he will formally accept the VP nomination. Also speaking will be former President Bill Clinton, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. They will have their work cut out for them, trying to match the energy from night two of the convention. That's where former President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama fired up the crowd in their hometown of Chicago. Her speech actually got some of the biggest reactions of the night, as she targeted Harris' opponent, Donald Trump.

And it's been kind of funny, chatting up with some of the delegates in this hall. Even some of them were somewhat unfamiliar with Tim Walz before he was selected, and these are people who are pretty plugged in to Democratic politics. So, that will be his task.To do that, he is going to rely on his backstory and his biography. We're told by campaign officials that he'll talk about his upbringing in Nebraska and the values that were instilled in him there, and kind of draw a through line to his service as a teacher, as a coach, as a National Guardsman, as a congressman, and now as a governor. To put his name into nomination, we'll see some former football players who he coached. A student of his -- a former student of his will also be involved.

And so now, Republicans are setting the stage to question the election results, sow doubt in the voters' minds and overturn the process.But, we have volunteer attorneys in every county in our state. Our Democratic Party of Georgia has a voter protection team. That was the first year-round program in any state party in the country, and we're continuing to push back against this. What we know is that when we tell voters to show up and turn out to vote, we need to be able to ensure them that their votes are counted, and that's exactly what we're doing. And so, we had Donald Trump in Atlanta at a rally where he was alluding to the rule changes of a board of election. What presidential candidate is watching the minutiae of a state board of elections? Donald Trump is, because he has a plan. We need to notice what he is doing right now. We need to believe him. When he is telling us these things, he likes to virtue signal.

However, they are saying that the waiting period until that happens could be considerable. And they say that they believe that that is also part of what they call their punishment against Israel.

You're running on safety and security, and you're encouraging Republicans to come out to vote down ballot, because I think that's really -- for the Trump campaign, at their convention, there were so many opportunities to open up the arms and say, like, Republicans who have -- maybe didn't love Trump, come back into the fold. Here is why. Here is how we can get you back in. And they didn't do that. And unfortunately, I think that that's really where they're losing. And what Harris -- Harris-Walz campaign is seeing is this opportunity to appeal to those voters. And I agree with Natasha that what President -- former President Obama said, don't let one disagreement or one issue detract you. You're not going to agree with somebody 100 percent of the time. That's just not reality. But, if you can find some ways to get there, 80 percent of the way, that's where you're going to be. And again, when you face the choice of democracy, for somebody who is really pushed against our Constitution, that choice seems pretty clear then.",

I mean, there are some serious flaws that we could go at length about when it comes to Donald Trump.But, what I would say for the Republican Party and for those voters who don't want to vote for either Trump or Harris, you don't have to. The split ticket option is there. But also, if you chose to vote for Harris, that doesn't negate the fact that you're still a Republican. You can vote for Republicans down ballot, for your House, for your Senate, for your local school board, your mayor. Look down ballot, the things that are going to impact your day-to-day life directly, that's great. It's OK to vote for somebody else at the top of the ticket. It doesn't stop you from being a Republican. We're not going to -- unfortunately, Donald Trump did say, if you're not supporting me, you should be kicked out of the party. Well, here is the fun fact. That's not how that works. He can't do that. So, you're still a Republican. I'm still going to be a Republican. You don't have to vote for Donald Trump to maintain that status.",

That's actually why you're seeing him hold these events at 03But, today, Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance, will be in Asheboro, North Carolina. As you mentioned, Rahel, they're going to be talking about national security. That to me, when I talk to the Trump campaign, really means talking more about crime and the border, but also Joe Biden and the Biden administration overall, their handling of some of the wars in the Middle East, between Israel and Gaza, but then also between Ukraine and Russia, and trying to tie Kamala Harris to that as well. We know that's been a big goal of theirs is to try and argue that she is some sort of mastermind for a lot of the Biden administration's policies, even though, of course, we know she is Vice President. She doesn't call the shots for Joe Biden. But, that is their goal. Now, this is part of a week-long counterprogramming blitz that the Trump campaign has been doing. You saw on Monday, he was in Pennsylvania, talking about the economy. Yesterday, he was in a suburb of Detroit and Michigan, talking about crime. Today, national security in North Carolina. Tomorrow, he'll be at the border in Arizona, talking about, of course, immigration, and then he is also in Las Vegas, Nevada, another, of course, battleground state, before going back to Arizona Friday evening. Now, all of these are being dubbed by the Trump campaign as quote, unquote \"messaging events.\" They're in smaller venues. They're not really rallies, smaller crowd sizes, but the goal is to really try to keep Donald Trump on message, particularly on those issues that I just laid out, where they do think he polls better than Democrats and specifically better than Harris. Now, to answer the other part of your question, just about RFK Jr., this was a fascinating exchange between our own Kristen Holmes and Donald Trump yesterday. Take a listen to what he told her.

And this is the first time we've seen Target's quarterly sales rise in more than a year. And the reason that sales rose is because Target cut prices. Target cut prices over the summer on about 5,000 items. And so, that got customers into stores, got them spending online.And if you take a look at Target's stock chart, it's really been a roller coaster the past several years. You see there, they boomed during the pandemic. People were flushed with cash, and Target was an essential retailer. So, people stocking up there. But look, Rahel, Target sells more discretionary merchandise than its rival Walmart. So, you think of Target, it is more clothing, home goods, and people have pulled back on discretionary merchandise because of inflation, because of higher interest rates. And so, that has hurt Target. It sent its sales down. But, now that it's slashing prices, we're seeing a nice little comeback here for Target.",

TJ Maxx and Macy's, they sell very similar stuff, but you're just finding more deals, more discounts on designer clothing at TJ Maxx than Macy's. And it's -- we've seen department stores really get pressured on the lower end by discount chains like TJ Maxx, Ross Stores, Marshalls. So, that's really where the growth is right now.
