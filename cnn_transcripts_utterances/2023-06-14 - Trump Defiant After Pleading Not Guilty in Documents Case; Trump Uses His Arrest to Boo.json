I had a clear view of Donald Trump, and he sat beneath a light that really lit him up in the courtroom. His hair was quite bright. He was wearing a brighter navy suit than anyone else around him, but he was slumped over. When you walk in and you see him when the judge took the bench, he was lagging to stand whenever you're supposed to rise when the judge says, all rise.And for most of the proceeding, he sat with his arms crossed, sat back, clearly with a feeling of indignation or some sort of frustration with the proceeding. Occasionally, he was whispering to his attorney, but Donald Trump himself, he did not speak once in this proceeding. A little bit unusual for a federal court arraignment like this. The judge asked him no direct questions, instead referred to him as the former president throughout the proceeding. And his lawyer spoke on his behalf. His lawyer, Todd Blanche, stood up and was the one that said to the court that he enters a plea of not guilty at this time. Jack Smith, the special counsel, he was also in the room. So, we get this rare glimpse of Smith and really the first time these two men have ever been in the same room like this. Smith had quite an entourage around him, and there was quite a lot of security, too, for a proceeding like this. But, really, all of these things coming together mark how significant this moment is, that Donald Trump is being placed under arrest for federal charges, and he is being told, these are your charges, and you now must abide by the court's rules as you fight these, as you say you will, as it goes to trial.",

      "sentences": "Right. Well, there are a few notable things that I took away from his speech, Poppy and Phil. The first is that he reverted to the well-worn playbook that we've seen him use time and time again in these situations. He called these charges political and argued that they amounted to election interference. He also claimed that he was entitled to taking these documents with him and that others were not prosecuted for doing the same thing.Of course, the prosecutors in this case argue that that's not true, that he kept some of the nation's most sensitive national security documents and that his unwillingness to hand them over amounts to obstructions. That's the first thing. The second thing I found pretty striking was his tone. He was surrounded by his most sympathetic supporters and his fiercest allies. That's the type of environment that Donald Trump tends to rely on to appear, define and give off the public image that he's pushing back. But he did sound angry, and that's something I know that some of his advisers picked up on as well. He also did not linger after his remarks. He didn't mingle with the crowd. He pretty immediately left the outdoor area at his club and then went back inside. And then the third thing I would note is the substance. My colleague, Kristen Holmes, and I spoke with some Donald Trump allies prior to his speech, and they told us that they were hoping it would be more forward-looking, that he would focus on his re-election effort and some of his 2024 agenda items. But he did very little of that. He spent the majority of his roughly 30-minute remarks railing against his opponents, namely President Joe Biden and his 2016 presidential rival, Hillary Clinton. And he also specifically went after Special Counsel Jack Smith. And that's something I know that his advisers had urged him against doing, but he went ahead and did that anyway.",

So, what happened in the, quote/unquote, Clinton Socks case was, yes, former President Clinton had made these audiotapes, they clearly fell within the definition of personal records under the Presidential Records Act. They were never, ever designated as anything other than personal records, and he took them with them obviously after he left the White House.Judicial Watch, the nonprofit, sued to try to get a judge to order the National Archives, the archivists at the Archives, to challenge that designation. And the judge simply said, the law doesn't give me the authority to make the archivist do this. The archivist, if it wanted to, arguably could have brought some kind of challenge, some civil action itself but I can't make them do so. That has nothing, nothing no way, shape, or form, nothing to do with what we're currently talking about. The records at issue in the indictment were originally agency records. They became presidential records when they were sent to Donald Trump in the White House. They always were presidential records. They were always classified, and they always qualified as national defense information. When he left the White House, under the Presidential Records Act, he was supposed to let the archivist take control of that. He was not supposed to walk off with them, and he certainly couldn't keep them in Mar-a-Lago in any of the various unsecured locations that were listed in the indictment.

The president has to go through it. The president doesn't get to keep them in the first place. They start with the Archives. And then after you go through the process, usually Archives and the presidents agree on what gets to come and what gets to go. So, this is the opposite of that.

I'd like you to make them enforce their own laws in some way or own statute. And that's the court's dealing with that issue.But the analogies regarding Clinton, whether it's Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton, are going to keep coming up for this very reason. It's about the substance of the information, where you find the analogy classified or sensitive material as the information. But this case before Trump is about the tangible documents, one. Remember, the Hillary Clinton email discussions is about classified information contained within without the headings or the actual documents. And perhaps most importantly, the core of this indictment has to do with obstruction and willful retention of documents, and conspiracy.

It encompasses a number of things. One is what you typically think of with spying, selling documents, spying for a foreign government, things along those lines.But it also encompasses a number of other potential felony provisions, one of which is at issue here, which is the willful retention of national defense information, meaning you knew you had it, and you knew it qualified as national defense information and the failure to return it to the proper U.S. government authorities. That is what alleged. There's no allegation in the charges that he has sold or disseminated the national defense information that he has sold or given it to somebody else.

She said in those fundraisers, quote, we cannot go to those dark days. You know what's in store if these MAGA Republicans win. We know it because we lived it. Remember how hard it was last time? This time it's going to be even harder now. Now, these comments came in a fundraiser where the cameras were off.
