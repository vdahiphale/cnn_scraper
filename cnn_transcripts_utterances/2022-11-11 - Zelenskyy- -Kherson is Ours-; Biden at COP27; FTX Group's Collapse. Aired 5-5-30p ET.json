As Ukrainian soldiers have entered the city, after Russian troops withdrew from parts of the region. Then, President Joe Biden says that the U.S. is serious about fighting climate change, and urges other countries to do their part. Then, in a stunning downfall for one of the biggest companies in the crypto industry, FTX Group has collapsed into bankruptcy. We'll have the details. And we start in the city of Kherson, which Ukrainian forces have just liberated from Russia. When Ukraine launched its counteroffensive in the Kherson region in August, it set the ambitious goal of retaking most of the Russian occupied territory by the end of the year. Now, the region's capital is, as we can see, flying the Ukrainian flag again and Ukraine's troops are receiving a hero's welcome. Residents there are greeting the newly arrived Ukrainian forces with joy and relief, after spending months under harsh Russian rule. Ukraine has also successfully liberated the western part of the Kherson region. After Russia's forces were treated to the east bank of the Dnipro River. Ukraine says, as they were treated, Russian troops carved a path of destruction. According to new images, in the last day, at least seven bridges were destroyed in parts of critical dam were also damaged. The reclaiming of Kherson City is a major blow to Russia's war effort. Nic Robertson was at the scene, and tells us how the day unfolded. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They have they say, evacuated their troops entirely from the west bank, that is this very important strategic bound for the next report, it was so brilliantly demonstrated there. It is a huge, tactical and indeed strategic success for the Ukrainians but they now have the Dnipro River between them and the Russians along that line, that gives them a breathing faces to consolidate the required reckon gains but it gives the Russians solid their defenses because this was a very efficient withdrawal by the Russians, rather than a chaotic rout of the sort I also reported from a few months ago in Izyum, for example, where they abandoned enormous and material. This was a much more organized withdrawal. And they followed themselves out, left and then blew the bridges across the Dnipro to prevent them from being chased along that eastern bank. They will have dug again. They'll already prepare artillery positions, rockets and so on to -- with which to bombard and to continue to threaten the Ukrainian forces. But it also means they can advance anymore and that is very important for Ukraine, it means that other areas where the fighting's been extremely intense, particularly in the east around Bakhmut. That is to the east of Kramatorsk, very close to the original front lines that were frozen back in 2015, those areas have been very, very bloodily fought over in recent weeks. And it could mean, Ukrainians can divert more troops there and hold back intense by the Russians to advance their. So, this is far from over, it's a very, a very important strategic -- for the Ukrainians.",

Ballots are still being counted from Tuesday's midterms. In Nevada, a Democratic incumbent is gaining on her Republican rival. While in Arizona, the Democratic front runner has a bit more breathing room, but it's still too close to call. And a third Senate race is at play in Georgia. That one is heading for a runoff next month. Republicans are inching towards retaking the House, that promise red wave well that never materialized, making these contests closer than expected. So, let's get more now from CNN's Kyung Lah, live in Phoenix. Kyung, thanks for being with us tonight. Set the scene for us tonight what are we expecting to learn, what's the timeline? KYUNG LAH, CNN SENIOR U.S. CORRESPONDENT:  Well, we expect to know just a few more details at the top of the hour. That's when election officials in Maricopa county army talking to the press they've been holding these nightly briefings to explain what we're going to see throughout the evening and the days to come. But we already know a few details from election officials in Maricopa County. Actually, I want to give you a live look on in this room behind me look closer. You can see workers here, they're working around the call, working 18 hours to try to get these ballots. There is about 350,000 ballots still being worked through in Maricopa County, the most populous county in the state of Arizona. What officials have told us is that into tonight's release of ballots, they anticipate it will be about the same as last night as far as size, about 60,000 to 70,000 ballots. Those are the election results of 60 to 70,000 ballots. But here is why we're paying such close attention. More than half of them will be mail-in ballots that were dropped off on election day. Now, why is that important? Well, we had a background call with the Blake Masters campaign. He is the Republican senator nominee. The Republican Senate nominee for the state of Arizona. And what his campaign is saying is that they anticipate that those drop if mail-in ballots from election day, they anticipate will swing their way. That is their anticipation. But here is a wild card, Rahel, we don't know what that's going to be the case. They're trying to predict the behavior. And voter behavior has been wildly unpredictable here in Arizona since the 2018 election because of the influence of Donald Trump, frankly, because of the influence of conspiracy theories and election lies, and then, as well as the pandemic. It's very difficult to predict what voters are going to do this election, this time around. But Rahel, we'll be here we expect an update of the top of the hour. And those ballot results, critical ballot results that could be very telling this evening. They will be replaced at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time -- Rahel.",

It's one of the most staggering things that I have seen in my career, not just because of the speed that it happened, which is mind-boggling, right? It did not happen months or weeks, but really just days but because of who is involved here. I mean, FTX is not just some, you know, fly by night organization. It's one of the leading crypto exchange, at least it was. Sam Bankman-Fried has been one of the faces of crypto. I mean, he was the white Knight that's swooped in to rescue others, and now he has become so toxic that he can't get a bill out of his own. FTX is backed by some of the biggest, most sophisticated investors, Blackrock and Sequoia. It had endorsement deals with Tom Brady, Steph Curry, its logo is blast on the home of the NBA's Miami Heat. And now, it has filed for bankruptcy, which, you know, means that investors have lost a lot of money. The investors on FTX likely getting wiped out. The employees may be out of a job and unfortunately, some of the users, through no fault of their own, they may be out of a lot of money or at least unable to access it anytime soon. Let me read a statement from Sam Bankman-Fried, who said on Twitter today, after the filing. He said, quote, I am really sorry, again, that we ended up here. Hopefully, we can find a way to recover. Hopefully this can bring some amount of transparency, trust and governance to them. Ultimately, hopefully, it can be better for customers. It's a stunning collapse of one of the biggest players in crypto. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
