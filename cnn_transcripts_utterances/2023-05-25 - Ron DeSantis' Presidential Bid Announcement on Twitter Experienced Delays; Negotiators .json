Well, it's exceedingly short, and there's a lot of work to do.

But the conclusion is not definitive, and U.S. officials still doubt that President Zelenskyy knew about the attack in advance.

That's according to state media, who first reported that emergency services were at the scene after a blaze broke out on the balcony. Now local officials say no fire had been detected.

And according to Microsoft, it says Volt Typhoon has been active since mid-2021. It has targeted critical infrastructure in parts of the U.S., including the territory of Guam. Guam, of course, is home to strategic U.S. military bases. It's also a major communications hub between the U.S. and Asia. Now, let's look at the graphic. It's on your screen more closely.

Why do you think that there has not been, certainly public opinion or legislators to be able to coalesce around this one tragic fact? DR. JACK RESNECK, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION: Well, Paula, thanks for having me on. And indeed it's really discouraging that we have reached this point. The devastation of firearm violence in America really touches every state, every community, the numbers are awful, more than 45,000 deaths per year. As you said, those numbers have gone up. The number one cause of death now among children and adolescents between the ages of one and 19, that's more than motor vehicle accidents or drug overdoses or cancer. That statistic is appalling to me. And it's an epidemic, just as we as physicians think about opioids and fentanyl deaths as being an epidemic. This is an epidemic as well, and Americans just don't feel safe in schools and places of worship and stores, theaters, concerts, sometimes even in physician offices and hospitals where we see firearm violence.

And most of us know why, right? It's because it touches their lives so intimately. I mean, the one fact that you just gave about young people being so exposed to gun violence. I want to ask you though, we had the pandemic, right? We had COVID. That was declared a health crisis. It was treated as an emergency. What should the U.S. be doing right now to treat this like the health emergency that you've declared it to be?",

New South Wales Fire and Rescue say the building has started to collapse and flames are spreading to other buildings. CNN affiliate Nine News says more than 50 people have been evacuated so far. Now we'll continue to bring you updates on this developing story.Now, the worst meantime is over for Guam as Typhoon Mawar now moved the island. Guam's governor says as of Thursday morning, no deaths were reported from the storm, which lashed out with strong winds and heavy rain. The storm has also regained its super typhoon status and is now just shy of Category 5 hurricane strength with sustained winds of 155 miles per hour. It's expected to get even stronger in the coming days. Storm chaser James Reynolds joins me now from Guam and, you know, we just basically recap what the governor said, and yet, people are still being told to shelter at home. What has the impact of the storm been on Guam? JAMES REYNOLDS, STORM CHASER: Yeah, I took a walk around this morning to just get in a firsthand look at what has been going on in the aftermath of this storm. And literally all I could hear was the hum of generators because the power is out across wide swathes of the island. There was tree debris everywhere, huge trees knocked over. I went up to the waterfront and you could see the evidence of where the storm surge had been hammering the immediate coastline, you know. Big concrete blocks moved inland just showing the power of the water. So, yeah, Guam has been roughed up and it's kind of the cleanup is in full swing right now.",
