So this makes it harder for Ukrainians to go after the Russian, I suppose. Is that just desperation by Russia? What's their strategy here?",

Their strategy has made no sense really all throughout this war.And unfortunately, I think we're going to discover not just those explosions they're doing, trying to cover what's now a rout, not an organized retreat like we saw in Kharkiv back in September. But unfortunately, we're going to probably discover what we discovered or what they have discovered in every liberated area of Russia, the horrors, the war crimes, the torture chambers, the mass graves. I'm not looking forward to what is discovered.",

Of course, they'll lay booby traps, like they did in all areas. Even kids' toys booby-trapped to explode. So Ukraine has to very slowly, methodically clear these areas to make them safe for habitat. Plus, the Russians aren't that far away. They just retreated to the other side of the river. So they could still artillery barrage or bomb the city in more acts of desperation and hate.",

Usually, we times the dead by three to five times for wounded. So 300,000, 400,000 Russians wounded or killed in Ukraine for Putin's illegal war. Plus, the 700,000 men who escaped his attempt to draft more soldiers in desperation. He is destroying the Russian state. And, of course, I feel for the Ukrainian people. And after having visited, I mean, they're fighting for their freedom and for their nation, much like our story of independence.

The soldier is fighting for his families and for his fellow soldiers. They're also fighting for freedom, in general. It is both a positive and a negative.

Republican candidate, Herschel Walker, holding a rally in Georgia's critical Senate runoff, enlisting the help of GOP Senator Ted Cruz.A rematch is now set for Walker and Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock on December 6th since neither candidate hit 50 percent. That's one of three undecided Senate seats, along with Arizona and Nevada, that will determine who controls the chamber. And as for the House control, that is also up in the air. The magic number is 218. Neither party is there yet because numerous races are still too close to call. So here to break it all down, especially those House numbers right now, is CNN senior data reporter, Harry Enten. What is the state of play, Harry?",

But to give you an idea of who is leading at this point, the most sort of likely House after everything is counted, right now, leading the vote, Republicans at 221 to Democrats' 214. That is way too close to call given all of the remaining seats right now. This is unbelievable. I was just never expecting it. I thought the Republicans would run away with House control.

The reason I'm pointing out that race is because, two hours ago, the Republican was ahead. So this gives you an idea there's still a lot of votes to be counted and, yes, it could certainly flip. We'll take a look up in here. California's House 13th district. California takes a long time to count the votes because of vote by mail. You see, look here, just 44 percent, just 44 percent of the estimated vote in. And look at that, a margin of less than a point. Go down to Arizona House Six. Look at that. Just a two-point margin, 82 percent of the vote is in. Plenty of vote out there. And House 22, California, David Valadao's seat there, four years ago, he was leading for about a month after election day before that district finally flipped over to the Democrats. And there's only 32 percent of the estimated vote in. So, yes, Republicans are favored, but this is still up for grabs. There's still reason for people to be tuning in.",

Yesterday, Boebert was behind. Some of those late votes came in. She was able to take the lead.
