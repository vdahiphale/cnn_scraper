As iconic primatologist Jane Goodall turns 90, we look back at Christian'sconversation with the woman who transformed what we know about chimpanzees. Hello, everyone, and welcome to the program. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under the microscope like never before. A new IDF report blames mistaken identification for Monday's airstrike that killed seven aid workers in Gaza, saying they believed they were targeting Hamas operatives in the convoy, mistaking a bag for a gun. World Central Kitchen is now calling for an independent investigation, and the U.N. says sadly the attack is not an isolated incident. Meantime, President Biden has given Netanyahu an ultimatum, protect civilians and aid workers in Gaza or Washington could rein in its support. Within hours of that phone call, the Israeli leader announced additional aid routes. For Gazans, help cannot come fast enough, with millions on the brink of starvation. More than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed, the majority of them women and children. And 130 hostages remain captive, nearly six months on from the devastating October 7th massacre that killed over 1,200 Israelis. This week saw huge protests in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. So, amid the growing international and domestic anger, I spoke to Israeli Economy Minister Nir Barkat, who joined me earlier from New York. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

At present, Trump faces 88 charges across four criminal cases. And this week, a judge denied Trump's bid to dismiss charges of mishandling classified documents, citing their Presidential Records Acts. Judges who've worked in the legal system all of their lives see a broader pattern of behavior, attempting to delay justice and attack the courts. Former senior investigative counsel on the January 6th Committee, Temidayo Aganga-Williams, joins me now to discuss. Temidayo, thank you so much. So, listen, I mean, that does appear to be the number one tactic here, delay, delay, delay until possibly after the elections. We're getting closer to that date by the day. There are four criminal cases going on, and every single week it appears that the former president's counsel, his lawyers, are filing new motions, trying to make every single appeal they can, and thus far, that seems to be working. What is your take on this? TEMIDAYO AGANGA-WILLIAMS, FORMER SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE COUNSEL, HOUSE JANUARY 6TH COMMITTEE AND FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR:  You know, I think it is working somewhat, but the thing we have to remember is that our criminal justice system does move slowly. It moves slowly across the country for Americans every single day. It's exasperated here because the former president has resources, and he is seeking to avoid accountability. But I think what he is also doing is he's testing our institutions, and I think it's quite, I think, damaging to public perception to have the idea that the former president may not be forced to address and account for his actions at the end of his term. But I still hold confidence that he will find his day in a criminal courtroom, and I think it's likely, and I expect, he's going to have his first day in jury selection on April 15th in the New York election interference case. So, I do think that accountability is on its way.",

Once this trial begins, I'm not holding my breath that the former president won't make personal accusations or name calling or attacks against family members or whoever is involved in this case? AGANGA-WILLIAMS:  Well, I think he's guaranteed and already has done that. I mean, the day after the expansion of the gag order, Donald Trump, again, posted something on his social media account that implicated the judge's daughter. So, he has already, I think, you know, kind of thumbed his finger in the judges' eye there. And in the judge's order regarding expanding that gag order, he talked about possible criminal contempt. And what that means is that Judge Merchan could impose fines upon Donald trump and could actually put him in jail up to 30 days for criminal contempt. So, I do think Judge Merchan is looking down the road and trying to forewarn to Donald Trump and his lawyers that if this continues there will be consequences, especially, at least initially, monetary. Whether he would put the former president in custody, I think practically that is incredibly unlikely because of the blowback. Whether that's justified, I think, it's going to be unlikely.

ARI WALLACH, HOST, \"A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE FUTURE\":  So, look, most people think a show about the future is just going to be about the feature. But one of the things that became very clear to me, having been doing this for 20 years, is that the future doesn't happen in a vacuum. The future doesn't just happen as something that's, you know, projecting out from the present. In fact, most -- everything that's going happen tomorrow, in many ways, started yesterday. So, it makes sense when we decided to create a show about the future, that we were going to talk about it, almost going to the future and then looking backwards and talking about how we got there. And, you know, there can go back, in many ways, 20 years, when we go back, sometimes we go back 200 years and sometimes in the show, we go back 200,000 years.",

And what he does is he'll bring a group of people together. It could be 30 people, it could be 300 people who are wrestling with a major decision at the, let's say, the civic or organizational level. And then what he'll do is he'll cleave off maybe about a third of that group and he'll have them don these golden ceremonial robes. And when you put on the robe, what actually happens is you transform into a citizen from the future. So, you might be in the 2050s or the 2060s. And what your role in that meeting now is to act as a proxy for those future generations. And so, what it means is if you're thinking about where to build a highway or where to build a school or how to allocate your resources, it's no longer just doing it for everyone in the room in the present tense, you actually now have people from the future in the room. So, there's ways of actually designing how we think about the future and how we implement projects and endeavors in a way that will bring those who don't have a voice into the room.",

And one of the things he talked about, and this goes back to the title of the show, is when he thinks about long-term infrastructure, bridges, tunnels, roads, he doesn't just think about the ones that have been built and will be built, but he also thinks about what went into the ones that were made.

And you're right, overthe next several decades, barring any major scientific advancement, one in three of us will have some sort of memory care neurodegenerative disease afflicting either us or those that we love. In America, the way we deal with that right now, sadly, but in many ways, understandably, is we basically put people in locked hospital wards, and we find that they can be very anxious and very depressed, and we kind of have a common image of what someone going through this looks like. You know, they're kind of lashing out and they're yelling and whatnot. So, at Hogeweyk, they've done something fascinating. There's not a lot of technology in Hogeweyk. So, remember, a lot of what we do in the show isn't show examples of geewhiz (ph) technology. We do that. We show a lot of amazing technology. But sometimes, the \"technology\" is just a mindset shift. And so, the mindset shift at Hogeweyk was, instead of having people in locked wards, they actually built a safe and secure village. So, no one can kind of come in and out as they wish, but the residents in the village, they live in pods, they make their own food. There's even a grocery store, a restaurant, a movie theater that the people that are living there can visit. Now, they don't carry wallets, they don't have to necessarily pay for the stuff in the grocery store. But what they found was when people were living in an environment, in a community that was not the kind of usual locked ward, and they were able to experience aspects of their life from the years before, so going to the grocery store, going to the restaurant, they required 80 to 85 percent less medication for anxiety or for depression. So, what Hogeweyk showed us is sometimes the way we think about the future in terms of the past dependency, well, one in three Americans will have a neurodegenerative cognitive disease, therefore we should build more hospitals with locked wards. That's not locked in. There are different ways of doing things. And so, to me, visiting Hogeweyk was one of the most eye- opening experiences of the entire journey.",
