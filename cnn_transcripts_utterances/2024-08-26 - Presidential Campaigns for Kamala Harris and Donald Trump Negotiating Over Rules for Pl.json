But when symptoms do develop, the include fever, headache, body aches, but also neurologic disease. In some cases, you can develop inflammation of the brain, which is why this is concerning.But Sara, when it comes to West Nile virus, EEE, these are all good reminders for us to do the best we can to avoid mosquito bites. That's how these mosquito-borne diseases are spread. So wear repellent when outdoors. Wear loose-fitting clothing. Make sure you have your window screens in place so mosquitos don't come inside. And of course, if you have a mosquito bite and you develop symptoms a few days later, talk to your doctor. You definitely want to pay close attention to this around this time of year, Sara.",

Both candidates planning a battleground blitz this week as the Trump campaign is promising a campaign on steroids.Also this morning, new presidential debate drama brewing ahead of the September showdown. Also, flash flooding turned deadly inside Grand Canyon National Park. Hikers forced across rivers and formed human chains to get to safety. And new this hour, get ready for a hectic holiday at the airports and on the roads across country. I don't know if you've heard that before, but it happens. Millions expected to travel this Labor Day weekend. I'm Omar Jimenez with Sara Sidner. Kate and John are out today. This is CNN NEWS CENTRAL. All right, everyone, let the debates about the debate begin, at least for the rules. With just over two weeks until their critical face-to- face showdown, it now seems former president Trump and Vice President Harris's campaign this morning have reached a brand new stalemate of sorts over exactly how the debate well go down. Trump going on a brand new social media tear as Kamala Harris's team is now making the case for debate microphones to stay on the whole time. Lucky for us, we've got CNN's Alayna Treene and Priscilla Alvarez, who have the new reporting on what each side is saying. All right, Alayna, I want to go to you first. What is the latest from team Trump right?",

      "sentences": "Omar, I'm told that the only remaining dispute in this drama, this back-and-forth, is whether the mics are going to be on. The Harris campaign wants them to be on. Of course, the debate rules when they were set with a different candidate, that was President Joe Biden. Now, the Harris campaign says that they want these mics to be on. And in a statement, a senior campaign officials saying the following, quote, \"Our understanding is that Trump's handlers prefer the muted microphone because they don't think their candidate can act presidential for 90 minutes on his own.\" The statement goes on to say that they don't think he can handle himself against Vice President Harris without the benefit of a mute button.So they are needling former President Donald Trump a little bit here, but they also are pushing back against some of what you heard there from the Trump campaign, that the kit that the Harris campaign wanted the two candidates to be seated and for there to be notes. They say that is not the case. And while they are open to having opening statements, that is not something that they are insisting on. Again, the bottom line here is that this feud is about the mics being on or off over the course of the debate. Now I will also note that the next couple of weeks, I've been told, are very focused on debate preparations. This is something that the vice president already started earlier this month and something that she is going to be doubling down on in the days to come, of course, recognizing that this is likely a large audience to tune in for this debate. And it gives her the opportunity to go toe-to-toe against former president Donald Trump. And while she does do that, there will be trouble, perhaps on as much as earlier this month. This week, for example, she will go to Georgia with her vice president presidential nominee Tim Walz. That is a state, of course, that President Biden only won by less than 12,000 votes. So it is going to be one of the battlegrounds that is closely watched this election cycle and one that they are using to kick off after the Democratic National Convention, Omar.",

But as you note, the messaging from the campaign was that there would be an interview before the end of the month. Of course, the month ends this week, and we still don't yet have any clarity on when or if she will be doing that sit-down interview. But certainly that is an observation that many have made, because a lot of the campaign over the last month has been very choreographed with these stops, these rallies, the Democratic National Convention. So while she has spoken to press over the course of those rallies and gaggles, often as rallies end, she has not yet done that formal sit-down interview, which would be less choreographed simply because it is an interview, so you would have the journalist asking the questions there.So we're still waiting to see if we get more details on that.

Under the CNN rules, as we all saw, Donald Trump could just kind of make up all kinds of different things, and then it puts his adversary in a very difficult position. You either have to refute the lies that this man is telling, and then you kind of lose because the ability to make your own points, or you just let those lies stand.

The dirty little secret of all of this, we should share with your viewers, Sara, is that the big sit-down interview really is a way to signal to the rest of the press, a lot of the regional and local press, what are the issues? What has she said? And so forth. On the first night of the Democratic National Convention, let's remind everybody, a 92-page platform was passed by the convention. It commits to all kinds of different things in the area of environment and labor and a public option for health care and so forth. She's now officially committed to those.

So I don't know if it's on steroids. I think he's going to have to get into the game. If you look at what of the Harris-Walz team is about to do, the bus tour, the constant rallies.

He has stood against everything veterans have fought for by engaging in sycophancy with autocrats like Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. He has threatened to cut veterans' benefits.

And don't just take my word for it, listen to all the former flag officers who served in the first Trump administration who have issued collective warnings that he cannot be trusted to protect American National Security.

It's the same conversations happening in Venezuela, and Russia, and China. It's what dictators do to embed themselves in the organs of state. And I think the critical reminder from General McMaster is that that a second Trump administration would be even more dangerous than the first and here's why, during the first Trump administration, there were two groups of advisers. There were the sycophants, as you said, but then there were also individuals who put country and Constitution before the president's personal interests and told them what he didn't want to hear. In a second administration, those individuals will not be there. He is going to embed his own courtiers at the White House, at the Department of Justice, in the military, in the Social Security Administration, and the entire apparatus of the federal government will become a fiefdom for Donald Trump.",
