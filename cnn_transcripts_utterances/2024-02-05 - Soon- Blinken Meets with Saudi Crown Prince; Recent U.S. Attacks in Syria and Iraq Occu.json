So, National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, he did say just yesterday when asked whether this was the last of the United States' response to that drone attack that killed three U.S service members in Jordan last month, and he indicated that there is more to come when it comes to this response. Here's what he said.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAKE SULLIVAN, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER:  We are still assessing the battle damage. Our CENTCOM, Central Command, is looking at the capabilities we reduced and the casualties that were incurred. The president was clear when he ordered them and when he conducted them that that was the beginning of our response and there will be more steps to come. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As well as facilities used by Iran-backed militias, including those that the U.S. believes are responsible for launching that drone attack that killed those service members.And so, the U.S. is pretty confident at this point that they did manage to significantly degrade the capabilities of these groups. But the big question now, of course, is just how long it is going to take for those groups to regroup, because many of them have committed to not stopping their attacks on U.S and coalition forces until the war in Gaza is over.

Thank you so much, Natasha Bertrand for all your reporting.John. JOHN BERMAN, CNN NEWS CENTRAL CO-ANCHOR:  All right. Sara, just so people can see the range of where this is all taking place, there were strikes in Syria that we know about, strikes in Iraq that we know about. Also, these strikes in Yemen over the weekend that we know about. With us now, CNN Global Affairs Analyst Kim Dozier and CNN Military Analyst retired U.S, Army Major General James Spider Marks. Spider, we hear that more strikes could be coming, that is what the White House said over the weekend. To what end? What would that accomplish? And what is your view on the idea of this is all about deterrence? MAJ. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.) CNN MILITARY ANALYST, HEAD OF GEOPOLITICAL STRATEGY, ACADEMY SECURITIES:  Well, first of all, I think we should stop talking about what we're going to do and just go about the business of doing it. This administration has made it perfectly clear that it's not going to stop these activities, these operations until the objective is achieved. So, there's no time horizon. There will be -- additional operations will take place. The desire is to get these -- primarily Tehran, to understand that the proxies have now received some really crushing blows. They're going to have to reconstitute. There will probably be a period where they have to get their act back together, figure out what they are capable of doing if they intend to continue these operations. In parallel, what we're hoping when we see Secretary Blinken in the Mideast again, is that there can be an advanced, effort at a ceasefire in Gaza. And if that's the case, then I would suspect you're going to see the proxies backing off, which means, at least in the interim, the objective will be met.",

But the strategic target, as it were, is Iran, here, to get them to stop backing in influencing these groups. What do you think the view of all of this is from inside Iran?",

The key thing is, what we need to understand is what we're trying to achieve is a level of deterrence, that's what everybody's talking about and that's the objective. How do you achieve deterrence?Deterrence by definition is behavior that's acceptable within bounds. And the way you achieve deterrence is through the application of a whole of government type of strategy, a campaign. And in many cases that you punish your enemy and as a result of that input, you get an output that you can describe as deterrence. In other words, certain behaviors will be punished, certain behaviors will be OK. That's how you achieve deterrence, but you don't achieve it through very precise strikes that don't have some overarching objective. You have to do this over the course of time to achieve those objectives.",

But the hope is that after this pause, there won't be a resumption in fighting.What the Biden administration is painfully aware of is that it's losing support domestically from large parts of the Democratic Party, and also internationally, there is a growing anti-American, anti-West sentiment that's being shown in things like there was a Procter and Gamble factory where a handful of people were held hostage over the weekend in Turkey. Now, that was resolved peacefully, but it shows what the U.S. intelligence community is worried about. That the more the U.S. backs Israel, the more it will become a target for those who despise the death and destruction that they see going on the ground no matter what happened on October 7th.",

After months of talk, rumors, a lot of rumors, and a lot of negotiations behind closed doors, the Senate has unveiled a major $118 billion border security and foreign aid package. And in the less than 24 hours that people in charge of making laws have had the opportunity to read the actual potential law, the reaction has been some -- I guess, you can sum it up as like some digging in, some pushing back. It's still very unclear where this is headed.House Speaker Mike Johnson, for example, he says the bill is, \"Worse than expected\", and deemed it dead on arrival in the House of Representatives. Donald Trump also weighing in, as we know, his opinion has very clearly mattered on all Republicans, essentially, calling it, \"Great gift to Democrats and a death wish for the Republican Party.\" CNN's Manu Raju picks up from there. Manu, we just heard from another key voice in this in the Senate. One of the Republican -- one -- a member of Republican leadership, John Cornyn. What is he telling -- saying?",

I want to show you around because this is the takeover zone that was taken over by Texas, that's why you see the razor wire that's lining here, the Rio Grande.And our photojournalist, Orlando Ruiz, just took video of an encounter between Texas officials and a migrant that was in the river. And if you take a look at this dramatic video, you'll be able to see that a mother and her child, they were inside the Rio Grande, and a boat then comes along and state troopers -- Texas state troopers pull the child out of the water and then they pull the mother out of the water and onto a boat and then they go on. Now, I talked to Texas DPS about it. They say that in this case because it's a child and a mom, that they would be turned over to U.S. Border Patrol, which is the reason why we're even talking about this and why we're here in this takeover zone. Because even though the state of Texas has taken over this area, and just to give you an idea, if you're in New York, for example, and you have Central Park, any other area of the country, whatever green space that you have, there is -- you know, a space where the community usually goes in and hangs out. Well, that is this space for Eagle Pass residents. They hang out in this park that was taken over by the state of Texas. One day, razor wire went up, Sara, and then soldiers with long guns appeared and they put up gates. And so, that's this takeover zone, but border patrol is not allowed in this area. So, any migrants that are turning themselves into immigration authorities here, actually turn themselves into state authorities. And in this case, a migrant woman and the child is turned over to border patrol right outside the gates.",

Here's the new memo to Boeing employees from head of commercial airplane Stan Deal. He says, while this potential condition is not an immediate flight safety issue, and all 737s can continue operating safely, we currently believe we will have to perform a rework on about 50 undelivered airplanes. Deal says, the company must get it right. So, Boeing is slowing down 737 production, that could mean delayed deliveries of new planes.
