The U.S. Justice Department has appointed a special counsel to take over two of the most sensitive probes involving the former president. CNN's Evan Perez has the details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) EVAN PEREZ, CNN SR. JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Attorney general Merrick Garland appointed war crimes prosecutor Jack Smith to serve as special counsel to oversee two criminal investigations related to Donald Trump. The decision was triggered in part by the former president's decision in recent days to declare a third run as a presidential candidate. Smith most recently worked as a prosecutor in The Hague, overseeing Kosovo war crimes. He'll take over investigations stemming from the alleged mishandling of classified documents, which the FBI retrieved in a search from Trump's Mar-a-Lago home, as well as portions of the January 6th investigation, dealing with Trump's efforts to impede the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Garland said the appointment was intended to show that the investigations will be done with independence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Based on recent developments, including the former president's announcement that he is a candidate for the next election and sitting president's stated intention to be a candidate as well, I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint a special counsel. Such an appointment underscores the department's commitment to both independence and accountability in particularly sensitive matters. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And attorney general Merrick Garland is very much an institutionalist.So unless the DOJ was just going to drop this case altogether, I think what we saw was the likely move. I do question the timing maybe a bit, less than a week after Trump's announcement for 2024, especially if the objective is to obviate the appearance of a politically motivated investigation. I do think, to some extent, it plays into Trump's hands in the short term, who's already smearing this effort as a witch hunt. And in the long term, if any indictment is handed down, it increases the chances that it would occur in the heat of the 2024 election. But either way, this is going to loom over the Trump campaign, much like the Mueller investigation defined the first two years of Trump's presidency. I am skeptical that this will ultimately result in an indictment. But it was notable to hear former attorney general Bill Barr say that he actually thought the prospects of that happening were increasingly likely.",

But I think a big open question is how cooperative the administration will be with these investigations. Of course, we saw the Trump White House just totally shut down and refuse to hand over documents, to offer testimony, to comply with subpoenas, et cetera. And in the course of those investigations, that violated really long-standing norms. And so the question now is will the Biden White House do the same. But I think, in terms of policy, you're right.

You mentioned the president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying that power cuts continue to be an issue not just in Kherson but across the country.But especially in Kherson since the Russians destroyed so much of the infrastructure there. He mentioned that his government has opened up these centers that people can go to, to get warm briefly, to charge up their cell phones or whatever else and try to get a respite from the cold there. At the same time, you also have in the city war crimes investigators, documenting what they say is evidence of torture there. They also say that they've uncovered more than 60 bodies inside the city. Kherson is still very much on the front lines of war. So you have the Russian positions dug in just across the River Dnipro and you also have the Russians lobbing bombs in the direction of Kherson as well. We've seen throughout the course of this war, when the Russians are unable to really move the front lines forward, they seem content to lob bombs and lob missiles across the front lines. And that is what we've started to see already in that area. As you mentioned, though, the train has returned. And it is difficult to understate just how significant this is. The train is a huge lifeline for people across the country, because a large chunk of the population actually doesn't own cars. So the very first train departed Kyiv to Kherson; carried about 200 passengers. The lights are back on in the Kherson train station as well. You'll remember, at the outset of the war, there were hordes of people trying desperately to get out of the country. And they were flocking to train stations. That is because they didn't have very many other options to actually get out of the country. It is such a huge lifeline for so many people. It's also one of the primary ways that the Ukrainians move supplies around the country, which is why it has been such a big target for Russian missile strikes, not just on the front lines but really across the country. Meanwhile, the Ukrainians say that fighting is also intensifying in the eastern part of the country. Some of the heaviest is around the village of Bakhmut, right on the front lines in the Donetsk region. It has taken an absolute battering over the last few months. It has been fought for very heavily. And yet miraculously, the Ukrainians still control it, despite recent attacks. A British analysis of the situation on the front lines, Laila, predicts that the Russians are likely to take a lot of the troops that withdrew from the Kherson region and redeploy them to the eastern part of the country, which means things are about to get even tougher in terms of the fighting in that region-- Laila.",

Including this ICBM launch of what North Korea calls a new kind of long-range missile, capable of striking, according to the Japanese government, pretty much anywhere in the United States and potentially most of the world, excluding some portions of South America. If you look at the possible trajectory distance of this missile that was tested, the missile test was pretty striking when you look at the photos released by North Korean state media on Saturday morning. It was rising up over the Sunan area of Pyongyang. Kim Jong-un was there with his wife and, for the first time, his daughter, believed to be around 9 years old, appearing right alongside her dad as they walked around this gigantic missile. Dwarfed by the size of the transporter erector launch vehicle that was used to fire the missile basically more than 3,700 miles or 6,000 kilometers up into space before it splashed down in the waters near Japan. Had the trajectory been different, the missile could have traveled much farther, the Japanese government warns. Yet there has been little in terms of substantive consequences this year, with all of these North Korean missile launch events, at least 34. North Korea claiming to have launched around 50 ballistic missiles so far this year. That's more than any other year in North Korean history.
