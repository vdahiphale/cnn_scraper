Temperatures are plummeting across Iowa as the Republican caucuses approach with candidates forced to cancel events due to dangerously cold weather. We're going to have a live report for Des Moines -- from Des Moines and we need a forecast. So, that'll be just ahead. Plus, in just over an hour, President Biden heads to Pennsylvania where he is expected to tour Bidenomics. How will the President's message land in the Keystone State? We'll discuss that ahead. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It is 11 a.m. here in Washington. It's Friday, January 11. There are just three days until the Iowa caucuses, 11 days until the New Hampshire primaries, and only 297 days until Election Day. This is -- today is January 12, I'm sorry, State of the Race. All right. We begin with breaking news. There are huge crowds turning out in Yemen. They're protesting airstrikes that targeted Houthi rebels in retaliation for repeated attacks on shipping in the Red Sea. The U.S. and the UK launched dozens of strikes overnight backed by countries including Bahrain and Canada. The U.S. says more than 60 targets in Yemen were hit, including Houthi weapons depots and launching systems. A Houthi spokesman says five people were killed. The UK released this footage of the strikes, calling them an act of self-defense. The Pentagon says deterrence is also key. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MAJOR GEN. PATRICK RYDER, PENTAGON PRESS SECRETARY: The United States working very closely with the international community are taking very responsible, deliberate methods here to try to ensure that we can deter these kinds of attacks in the future, but doing it in a way that prevents this from spiraling out of control into a broader regional conflict.

Leading up to this point, the White House had been warning about these attacks in the Southern Red Sea, calling them intolerable, and again issuing a final warning before launching these attacks. Now, on Tuesday, that really marked the turning point, according to senior administration officials, when there were additional attacks that were targeting U.S. commercial vessels alongside U.S. Military vessels. And that prompted President Biden to convene his national security team where they reviewed a list of options. And then, eventually, the President directed his Defense Secretary to carry out the response. Now, in a statement, President Biden saying that these targeted strikes are a clear message that the United States and our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personnel or allow hostile actors to imperil freedom of navigation in one of the world's most critical commercial routes. That's the key here. This was a critical waterway where major shipping companies had to reroute their boats to go around the continent of Africa, adding time, miles and affecting the global economy. But, as you mentioned there, some progressive lawmakers have pushed back, saying that there should have been more notification to Congress before the administration moved forward with this. Now, senior administration officials have said that there was some notification to leadership on Thursday before this happened in the night hours. But also, Nancy Pelosi saying that the administration ultimately took the right step here, even if she respects her colleagues' views. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): It was not a declaration of war that has to come from Congress. I respect those who have their view, but I don't agree with them. And I think the President made the right decision. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That's the one that's between House Republicans and Democrats led by Chuck Schumer in the Senate.

They weren't particularly well armed. Suddenly, Iran is arming them with ballistic missiles which are capable of hitting commercial shipping, armed drones, etc. So, I mean, it's really -- the background here is the competition between Saudi Arabia and Iran in Yemen.

That's, of course, the attacks that we've seen from the Houthis again, 27 at this counting. 20 percent Red Sea activity is down. And you and I were talking a little bit about this this morning. But, the solution has been in part to route these vessels down around Cape Horn in Africa. I mean, that is like a significant -- there it is. It's a significant, as you can see, departure for these ships. And I'm curious kind of in your -- I know you were on a briefing from the NSC last night.

Something like 15 percent of the world's global trade goes through the Red Sea, and to reroute it around Africa adds 10 to 14 days to the journey, and adds hundreds of thousands of dollars to the costs. So, major shipping companies have already started boycotting going through the Red Sea. The insurance costs alone are too high. And all of this is adding cost to global goods, which eventually Americans are going to feel in their pocketbook. This is an election year. And Biden was also taking a beating for being too weak. I was hearing rumblings in the military community that, when are we going to do something to get the Houthis to stop harassing our trade? Well, they finally did something. Now, the question is, have they taken out enough of the Houthis' capability to actually keep things quiet for a bit, or have we just kicked off what's going to be a tit for tat back and forth, which could always escalate to something else?",

But, I think the big question is, what happens if this does become sort of a broader conflict? Right? And to Kim's point, I think we, at this point, don't really know how effective these strikes are going to have been in actually deterring the Houthis from taking further action against U.S. shipping. And I think if you talk to some regional experts, there is a sense amongst analysts that there is some real skepticism that these U.S. strikes are going to have made a significant sort of difference in trying to get the Houthis to sort of back off of these strikes. And so, I raised this because the Houthis are not the only Iranian-backed group in the region that are launching attacks both on sort of U.S. interests, on international interests. There is also these sort of Iran-backed groups in Iraq and Syria that have launched dozens and dozens of attacks against U.S. forces. If an American service member is killed either in Iraq, Syria or by a Houthi missile strike in the Red Sea, how does that change the sort of political mood, the domestic political mood here in the United States? I mean, we remember sort of what happened during the withdrawal -- after the Afghanistan withdrawal when 13 American service members were killed. Obviously, that --",

She is doing tele town halls. Ron DeSantis was able to get one of it in early this morning, but he has postponed the events he had planned for later today. And look, where we are in the timing of all of this is really impactful. These are these last days where people are really cluing in, really participating, where the politicians really want to be in front of as many Iowa voters as possible.

But, the intense cold as we look ahead to Monday when people will actually be gathering at caucus sites is starting to play into all the politics of this. We're seeing the Trump campaign begin to lower expectations saying, listen, in all of these polls and so many of these polls, he has this commanding lead. People may stay home. It may be a smaller margin than originally predicted because of this weather. We've seen the former President himself encouraging people to come out. On the DeSantis front, they have been talking about this ground game. This organization that they have with the super PAC that's aligned with his campaign, well, it's really going to be put to the test on Monday. We're going to find out just how good that organization is. Nikki Haley has been talking to her supporters about getting out.

But, we've got a blizzard unfolding right now, blizzard warning in effect for most of Iowa. We're going to get up to eight inches of snow. But, what really packs the punch is the 45 mile per hour wind gusts. That's what makes it a blizzard. It's the wind whipping around the snow, dropping the visibility, winter storm warnings stretch up to the Great Lakes. Here is a look at that radar right now. You could see where we have some of that heavy snow around Des Moines. Your wind chill right now is a whole two degrees. You have wind chills already about 25 degrees below zero from Sioux City and then up into northwest Iowa. Now, behind this is when that huge Arctic plunge comes in as we go into the weekend, and then on Monday while people are trying to head out to caucus events. So, overnight, going into Monday morning, here is a look at the wind chills, minus 45 in Des Moines. We put on here how much time it takes to get frostbite. We're talking 10 minutes or less. This is dangerous, life-threatening cold as we go into Monday, and it continues to stick around. Looking at wind chills, again, minus 30 to minus 40. Here is a look at the past caucuses where we've had temperatures in the 30s and 40s. The coldest so far was 2004, a temperature of 16. But then, if we put the forecast temperature on here for this one, we're looking at a high temperature of minus four. That would be the warmest that it gets during the day. So, it doesn't even look like we'll break zero as we go through the day, on Monday, minus four. They're in Des Moines.
