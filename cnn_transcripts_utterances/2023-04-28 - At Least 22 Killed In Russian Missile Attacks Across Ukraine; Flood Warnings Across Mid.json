Kyiv has not been targeted in an airstrike since early March, as most of the fighting persists in eastern most Ukraine.I want to bring in CNN military analyst and retired Air Force Colonel Cedric Leighton. Cedric, again, we're looking at images of the cities now some of the destruction that was done in both Dnipro and Uman, where Nic Robertson was. And I just want to remind people of where the cities are in Ukraine. You see Uman, right here, right in the middle of the country, Dnipro over here very far away from where the frontlines of the fighting are right now. So what is Russia get out of attacking these cities? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Basically, John is terrorized -- terror, terrorizing the civilian population, I mean them, making sure that they can really tell the Ukrainians that no place in Ukraine is safe. And that's really what we're seeing here. This is a war of terror against the civilian population. There is no other way to describe it.

So yes, the Patriot could very well destroy the missile as it comes in. It of course, you know, requires a lot of precision to do that, record is the right information or flight radar signature.

And had to be taken over by the FDIC and really sparked an awful lot of stress in the whole financial system. So here's what else they say, four key takeaways from the Fed. The Fed, by the way, is the regulator and the supervisor here. So this is a self-critical report.This is the Fed having to say, look, we did some stuff wrong as well. I mean, the Fed pointing out there were 31 open warnings or complaints that supervisors had flagged about this bank, and they were all still open when this bank failed. The Board of Directors failed to manage the risk of this bank and failed to manage leadership. Supervisors that's, you know, federal banking supervisors didn't explore appreciate the extent of the vulnerabilities and even what they did, they didn't follow up in time. Also on page 16 of this report, super interesting 15 and 16. It talks about, John, how the climate has changed. We saw how quickly this bank went down, money's moving faster. There are really kind of innovative new kinds of financial products and players in this arena. And social media meant that there was a failure of confidence very quickly spread.
