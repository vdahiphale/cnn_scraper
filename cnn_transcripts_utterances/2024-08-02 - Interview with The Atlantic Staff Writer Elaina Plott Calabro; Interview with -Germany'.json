Keesee, president of the Center for Policing Equity, what needs to change and how? Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. On today's show, the state of the race, the U.S. presidential election, and indeed the entire political landscape looks completely different today than it did two weeks ago. The surge in enthusiasm for Kamala Harris has injected a newfound energy into the Democratic Party. The vice president's campaign has broken fundraising records and seen an influx of volunteers. Meanwhile, in the Trump camp, after the unity on display at the RNC, it wasn't a great week. His vice-presidential pick, J. D. Vance, continues to face criticism for many, many controversial comments with reports that a number of leading Republicans urged Trump not to pick him. And the former president is himself under pressure after he attacked Kamala Harris' racial identity in a disastrous appearance at the National Association of Black Journalists on Wednesday. So, let's take stock now of the week that was in this race. Joining me, Bakari Sellers, political commentator and former state representative in South Carolina, and Elaina Plott Calabro, staff writer at The Atlantic. She knows Kamala Harris well, having spent time following Harris and her team for a profile of her vice presidency. What an incredible two weeks it has been in terms of momentum and a total shift given where things stood following the Republican National Convention, where it seemed that Donald Trump was riding high, and this was his election to lose, all of a sudden, here you have Kamala Harris stepping up as a presumptive candidate and nominee. And, Elaina, she really has reinvigorated the party. Are you surprised given the trajectory she's been on the last few weeks?",

Having covered Harris for, you know, a couple of years now. The person that I saw announced her candidacy in Wilmington the other day or the other week was really kind of the culmination of a trajectory that she's been on for, I would say, the past two and a half years, really, since the Dobbs decision leaked. And so, I would say that a lot of the inconsistent media attention, I think, has contributed to this notion that she has suddenly reinvented herself, in some sense. The Harris, again, that I saw in Wilmington and that we've continued to see on the campaign trail since then is really just a reflection of kind of the confidence and ease that she's developed over time in her vice presidency and is not sort of, you know, a new vision of her or what she's capable of.",

Now, we've seen ever since she stepped up, following that debacle of a debate for President Biden, she's really seemed to hit her stride. Is this something that you've always seen all along and perhaps finally the nation's getting a chance to see in a different light as well?",

And you look at the shift in the direction the country has gone in from 2020 to 2024. You say that really focusing on her background, her history as a prosecutor, perhaps even some of her politics being more moderate than those that they had sort of envisioned she would fill in 2020, that that's really viewed as a strength at this point. And perhaps that will be more of a comfortable position for her to showcase.",

      "sentences": "Absolutely. And I think when I talk about inconsistent press attention, what I'm really talking about is sort of after the first yearand a half of her vice presidency. I think there were very legitimate concerns about her readiness to hold a role such as the vice president or even the presidency in that first year and a half. And I think what happened is sort of this narrative crystallized about really her -- this idea of her incompetence. And the White House itself, which I -- as you mentioned, written quite a lot about, did not do much to step in and try to correct that, to try to tailor her portfolio to establish more of a measure of stability and success for her. So, as I've written ad nauseam, I think President Biden himself deserves, you know, a lot of attention when we're talking about why does it feel like this is not the Kamala Harris that we've seen before? But you're right, I think that when she ran for president, when she launched her own primary bid in 2020, it was a moment when her biography, her career as a prosecutor did not seem to be something that was going to play well with the Democratic base at the time, just a very particular political moment. But political cycles change. And then, four years later, she is in a moment where not only is she more confident just in her own capabilities, as Bakari said, having served in this vice-presidential role and gotten more comfortable with her own instincts. She's also in a moment where her career is something that actually entices a lot of Americans to her, and she's no longer trying to thread a needle with just a Democratic base, but actually appeal to the broader American electorate.",

I spoke to one Republicanlawmaker after Trump's appearance yesterday, and they said, you know, we're the party that's constantly saying, why do we keep talking about identity politics and race and yet, this is now suddenly the cornerstone of the Trump message against Kamala Harris? And I think to a point you made earlier, Bianna, there's a lot that you can criticize Kamala Harris on. There's a -- there are many ways that you can make an effective case against her when you think about positions she took in her 2020 campaign. And so, trying to, you know, point out the fact that when she was on the trail, then she called to eliminate private health insurance and things of that nature. And yet, this is the tack that Donald Trump has taken. So, I think a lot of Republicans who, especially after his assassination attempt, thought, oh, this is a new Trump. But of course, we've heard that how many times over the past eight years. He's changed. This is a new and disciplined version of this president. And again and again he shows why that is never something to rely on. And to the extent that this continues, I don't know if you will see any independence flock to him on a message like that.",

And so, there is a great deal of value in her continuing to prosecute the case about her vision for the future. And, you know, there's a lot of history in the Harris presidency or campaign, a lot like there was in the Obama campaign, but you can see it. And you -- she -- you don't have to lean into that identity as much as one may believe. And so, as Trump continues to go there, she continues to have to go to these places in which this election is going to be won, which is the suburbs and exurbs, and tell voters what she's going to do to make their lives better. Things like cost, inflation, et cetera. And as long as she stays on that message, like she's doing, what she's done around prescription drugs and insulin, et cetera, if she stays on that message, allow Trump to do whatever he wants to do. The split screen is divisiveness and hate versus a better tomorrow. And that's the split screen you want to have and be talking about.",

What she will have to do inthe next few months is establish an identity that's her own when it comes to her vision for the country that doesn't deviate necessarily from what she is going to tout as the accomplishments of the Biden administration, but still convinces Americans that she can build upon it in a way that feels more of her own signature and not just the same thing that we've seen for the past four years. I mean, look, you can't -- I don't think you can overstate the challenge of that. What I will say is that I'm not convinced that what we're seeing right now is just a sugar high. And the reason that I say that is, I think that a lot of this energy has to do with the fact that a lot of Americans are looking at a Democratic nominee as suddenly who is actually on the campaign trail, who is traveling every day, who is going on air, who is, you know, doing several, several events. And it's quite a contrast from a nominee like Joe Biden who, I think, a lot of Americans feel that they rarely saw. So, I think to the extent that she can continue this cadence of just constant movement and that sheer portrait of energy, I think, is what will go a long way to sustaining her appeal to Americans in this moment.",

Back in December 2022, a plot called the Reichsburger Plot wasrevealed or uncovered by the Domestic Intelligence officials, two of whom we speak to in the film. One national and one in the State of Thuringia. And this was an extraordinary plot where this group believed -- or were planning, according to authorities, and the trials are ongoing, that they could overthrow parliament by storming it violently. The head of Domestic Intelligence says that there were plans -- they had plans allegedly to even liquidate, to assassinate some of these politicians. And the big thinking behind it seemed to be that elements of the army and the police force in Germany would somehow get behind them. And they would then establish a new Germany under a man called Prinz Reuss, who is a German aristocrat. And they would then form a new sovereign Germany that was under its own laws and that they would start doing things like setting up a peace agreement with Russia. And it sounds farfetched, and it sounds weird, and it sounds, you know, unlikely, but Domestic Intelligence chiefs tell us that they were prepared, they had weapons, they had people in their group that knew what they were doing, former soldiers, some former police officers, and they saw this as a very serious threat that there would have been at least, potentially, a bloody attack on the government institutions of Germany. And right in the middle of that plot is an AfD politician, allegedly, who was going to be the justice minister of this new government. And of course, all the people charged deny the charges, they're on charges of terrorism and treason, among many other things. They say they talked about things, there was never a plot, they were never really going to do it, but they're on trial.

They went to a hotel inPotsdam just outside Berlin and it was a meeting where a far-right -- an extremist named Martin Sellner from Austria outlined this idea of what he called remigration. And the idea is that there are migrants that are in Germany and in Europe, from his point of view, who aren't really assimilated properly. They're a burden on the welfare state. They're culturally setting up parallel societies. They're not integrating and they're mainly targeting here Muslims. And that these people should be sent back. And he's sent back somewhere or possibly, in his words, to the meeting, sent to a model city in North Africa somewhere. Now, this theory has been around for a while, it's not surprising, but what really caught German -- the attention of German citizens was the fact that there were four AfD members, some other politicians there as well, from the center, but four AfD politicians discussing seriously this scheme. And the investigative journalists who we interviewed for the film, I asked, you know, what was their response, how were they responding to these theories? Because it's OK for somebody to say something, you may then disagree, but they weren't. They were then talking in detail about how they might push forward this sort of plans. And one of the most controversial aspects of this meeting was the idea that they might send back these German -- or Germans -- even German citizens with an immigrant background who they determine at some point in the future have not integrated enough. Now, the AfD deny, they say that's not part of their party policy, that would misrepresent their position, but it was discussed in those terms.

There are repeated stories in the German media about this. The AfD deny that, of course. They say, well, define far-right to us. It's all about languaging and perception, but they are basically coalescing behind them the far-right. So, which is what's called by Domestic Intelligence, the new right. And so, all these grassroots organizations are getting behind the AfD, at the same time the AfD is broadening its appeal because people are worried about the economy or the war in Ukraine and they're starting to get behind them, which is why their polling numbers are growing so strongly. I mean, the crux of the matter at the moment now is that he says that comment about that the government is -- it's the government extremism we've got to worry about, because his party and him personally -- he personally are under surveillance by German Domestic Intelligence because they are declared and deemed an extremist threat to democracy and the constitution. And that pretty much says it all. They say, well, we're -- that's political, you know, maneuvering by the government to try and curb out our true and honest democratic ways. The Domestic Intelligence Service say, you're breaking the red lines and breaking the law by going too far down this extremism path.",

Germany, unlike most other countries following World War II and the Holocaust, has really codified some of the toughest laws in terms of protection of hate spree -- condemning hate speech. Specifically, parliament just pledged to protect Germany's constitutional court as well. In terms of checks and balances and guardrails in place, did you get a sense that there is security along that front, that whatever happens they can withstand some of the biggest concerns?",

But also, what could happen is that the government might put in their own person into that body who would then be technically have access to the entire nation's surveillance and intelligence on far-right extremism in Germany as a whole. I mean, that's going to create a constitutional crisis because that's never happened before. And so, there are very serious checks and balances in Germany because of what they went through in World War II. It's unique in the western world, Bjorn Hocke is correct in saying that. But at the same time, if they get a little bit of power, it's going to be one of the first things they try and erode. So, it's a challenge, and I don't think -- and Stephan Kramer, for example, says to me in the piece, that if the far-right, if the AfD does win, if they basically get into a position of governmental power in that state, he will leave Germany.

She was a woman who had called the police for help and she ended up getting shot by one of the very officers who was there to help her. The officer has since pleaded not guilty because he's been fired and he's been charged with one count of aggravated battery with a firearm, official misconduct, and three counts of first-degree murder. A grand jury felt there was enough evidence to bring these charges. Now, his side has not said anything about this. You have seen that footage. What did you think when you saw it and what went wrong?

But I think what was very striking about it is that here you have a woman, and let's be clear, a black woman that has called 911 asking for help, hearing things outside of the home, where you have deputies actually who are on scene and have searched around the home and are literally talking to her about that they didn't find anything and asking if she was OK, does she need anything else, and she says no. And then, of course, you have the deputy in question, a Deputy Grayson, I believe it is, that comes in. And you know, ask again, you know, what else is happening? Asks for her I.D.

One, you don't escalate a situation, and we all know that. And this is 2024, and very rarely will you find law enforcement agencies and sheriff's departments who have not gone through some level of de-escalation training. In addition, you will very rarely -- and I'm not going to say that every agency has done this, but you will find that mental health training has also happened. I meant that you recognize when things are happening where you are going to need to do something a little different in your approach when you are with someone who may be in crisis or who may not be tracking. You didn't see any of that. You didn't see anyone -- you know, this particular person backing up to get distance between them. And so, this is what is so shocking and heartbreaking, but I will tell you, this is not new. This is what the black community has consistently, since George Floyd and before that, have been talking about. And the dangers of calling 911. And when we talk about what does it mean to be safe in your home, or how do you get safety?

But I also wonder, given your expertise, what kinds oftraining are officers now getting in departments that choose to invest the time in this? DR. KEESEE:  Well, it varies. Of course, it's going to depend on where you are or how large the agency is, whether or not you're a sheriff's agency, and whether or not you have a budget. I think communities would be very surprised about the lack of the training budget that most law enforcement have. In some cases, it's not even a line item. And so, a lot of what you will see is there will be critical incident training. You will hear it named CIT. You'll hear mental aid -- mental health first aid. That is really basic understanding of how people who are in crisis show up. What types of mental health, what does it look like. And often times, you can look at your own family members and friends and see some of those same things that are happening with them. And some of it is very basic level, and that's a lot of times what you need. A lot of academy curriculums have already been changed to incorporate those types of things, including the scenario training that you have. So, it would not have been uncommon to have a scenario-based training with an event sort of like Ms. Massey's, where you did have a conversation with her. And you have -- if you do have the resources, the ability to call someone else in to help with her, to see if there's anything else you could do. And at that time, law enforcement would back out. But there are plenty of trainings now, and it's really interesting that in this day and age, and it would be very uncommon to not have some basic level of mental health training. I would be surprised if a lot of agencies did not have. And then, I would add to that is before we even get to calling 911, does the person have or had everything that they needed before you begin to call law enforcement? And this is the thing that community and even law enforcement is talking about. Oftentimes those calls will come in, and we know 4 percent of 911 calls are what we call true crime calls. The rest of those are social needs. And the question is, why would you have law enforcement showing up for someone who has social needs? And that has been an ongoing conversation. I know, even when I was in law enforcement, that do you have the right people showing up for the right thing?",

And what's interesting is one of the things that we have to understand is we still have a lot of gender dynamics when it comes to how men believe women will respond or show up. A lot of those things have changed in the training. And when we talk about the dangerousness and who is a danger, what is interesting when you are talking about -- and we have these conversations around what the science says, especially when we're talking about black women and black men who are in danger. And we talk about how quickly folks respond, because when you associate blackness with criminality, it changes the way that you respond. And so, the types of training that we're talking about in the academy, it's just that, and you'll hear conversations around not just implicit bias training, but understanding culturally how policing has been introduced into different neighborhoods, and for you to have a self-awareness around how you may show up, how you may perceive things, and in order to do that, you have to slow yourself down, and you have to make sure you have all the information that you need in order to go into that space, and you also need to make sure you have all the resources that you need.

They were saying that his due process rights were not followed and they were demanding his full reinstatement with back pay. But it's important for unions to do exactly what they've done. I don't know what has created the turn of that. But when you look at the body worn camera and you see what has happened, you understand why this person should no longer be in law enforcement. And it's important to understand that the black community sees this. I mean, you see unions -- and believe me, a lot of folks belong to unions. But when you see a union trying to protect something like this, you then -- if you don't understand why the black community has a lack of trust, then I have to say that there's a real disconnect between unions and what they are supposed to be doing on behalf of officers. We understand -- I belonged to unions for my entire career. And the one thing that I would always want is to have my rights protected. But I also know that when I violated someone's rights, or when I was wrong, that there was going to be a level of accountability there. And this was before body worn cameras. And now, when you have body worn cameras, and if I'm an at- will employee, I understand as an at-will employee, that I may be terminated. And I think that whatever about face they've taken, it is glad to see that.

I mean, I'm not just saying by race, I'm talkingalso by gender, by class, by a connection so that they're able to have a life experience when they walk into unknown situations that the whole situation might benefit from. DR. KEESEE:  If you want the organization to reflect the community it serves, first, the organization itself needs to be healthy. And that means that when you are trying to recruit diverse organization to your point versus not just about race, and it's about thought and it's about experience. The other part of this, too, is understanding broader society has had a different lived experience when it comes to its interaction with policing. That requires law enforcement to decenter itself from what is happening out in the larger community. And in order to do that, that means that you have to step outside of yourself to understand that although you may be trying to do a good service, and though you may be trying not to do harm, harm has been done, although it may not have been done by you. And you'll hear law enforcement now saying it's very difficult for them to recruit because of what is being said. And what is being said about law enforcement is not new, what is new is that you've got social media and you've got it happening faster and quicker. And so, the ability to recruit has been happening for decades. It's just been exacerbated. But until those things are truly addressed, including the attitudes of folks inside organizations and in the community. So, I don't want you to think this is just about law enforcement. When I made the decision to go into law enforcement, I struggled in my own community about that choice itself. And so, when those things begin to align and we begin to address the conversation we've had here, the long-standing issues of how safety is delivered, then you will not see a lot of those hurdles.",
