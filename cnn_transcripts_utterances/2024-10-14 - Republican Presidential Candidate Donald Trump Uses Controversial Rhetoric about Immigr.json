It may be, though, whoever buys this has to just listen to it themselves. To actually commercialize that, we need some sort of agreement with the estate, the family, of course, of Jimi Hendrix.

All the scum that we have to deal with that hate our country. That's a bigger enemy than China and Russia. I think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people.

In every race that I'm working in in the 20 congressional races, Republicans use this language because, as you all said earlier, abortion is a major issue here. So Republicans know it's their Achilles heel, and they are trying to demonize immigrants and Latinos to say you should not vote for the Democrats because they're going to come and get you. And don't forget about this Dobbs thing. So they're trying to scare people back to their party.Now, what that does with Latino voters -- I'm in Arizona today. I campaigned out here all weekend, is that you start seeing an erosion of folks, mainly older Latinos who are closer to the immigration experience, saying, is he talking about us? Is he talking about my community or my grandmother who immigrated here? So it's a double- edged sword that cuts both ways. But specifically, what he did yesterday is to scare white women who he is losing dramatically because of abortion and Dobbs back to him with a scare tactic.",

How to afford to put food on your table, put gas in your car, health care and housing. Thats number one.Number two is that they regard our immigration system is being broken, fundamentally broken. Democrats agree, Republicans agree. They have different solutions. But third, and probably most important, what we regard as horrific language -- and I'm shocked by it -- it's not having an impact because those who live in these border states, in Arizona, for example, or in Nevada, which has a significant Latino population, they're afraid. Crime has gone up there. Violence has gone up there. And the concern right now is if we don't get control of that border, it's only going to get worse. Harris made a statement which I thought was -- I was surprised by it, which is there's no difference between her campaign or her issues and Joe Biden's issues. On immigration, the public thinks the Biden-Harris administration has failed. I would have counseled Trump not to be so negative, not to be so personal, to dial it back.

So what happened here in Asheville over the weekend actually, at least two counties, Ashe County and Rutherford County in the hard-hit western portion of North Carolina is threats being made to FEMA workers to the point where they had to halt operations to help out people, just out of an abundance of caution for the FEMA workers. \"The Washington Post\" first reported that National Guard troops saw \"armed militia\" making threats of FEMA workers, so that's why they had to pause these operations. It is not clear if that threat was credible, and we certainly reached out to FEMA to get more information on that.
