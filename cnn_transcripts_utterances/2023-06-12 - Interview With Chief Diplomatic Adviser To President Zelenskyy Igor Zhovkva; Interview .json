As former presidents and prime minister's face legal and political battles, both here and the United States, tonight we examine why the rule of law matters, and how Donald Trump and Boris Johnson are being held accountable. But first, Russia's war in Ukraine is top of the agenda in Washington, with top NATO officials in town to meet President Biden about continued support for Kyiv's counteroffensive. On the battlefield, fierce clashes are reported in the south and the east of the country, and Ukraine claims to be making incremental gains. Its forces say they've captured at least three villages on the frontlines, and they've released pictures of a flag being raised in one of them. We get the latest with Igor Zhovkva, deputy head of President Zelenskyy's office and his chief diplomatic adviser. Igor Zhovkva, welcome back to the program.

He's announced not about his counteroffensive but about Ukraine's counteroffensive. So, an interesting tendency. I'll ask again, please, Christine, to avoid any speculations and misunderstanding, the ultimate goal of Ukraine's counteroffensive campaign is to win back all the territories of Ukraine, including the Crimea. And when we our partners for telling, we will stand with Ukraine as long as it takes, and when we hear from our partners, only the Ukrainian authority, Ukrainian president, Ukrainian people who will define the scope of the victory, we are agreeing with this.

But what we're having now, we are liquidating the aftermath, the immediate aftermaths of this terrorist attack. We are saving people, almost 30,000 people are saved on the controlled part of Ukrainian territory. Unfortunately, the situation on the uncontrolled part of Ukrainian territory, of Kherson region, is much more difficult, because these are those areas which were mostly affected by this flood. And unfortunately, more than 25,000 people are still in poor conditions on this uncontrolled part. And Russians would not take any actions to evacuate people nor they allowing international institutions to approach the areas and to save the people, which is giving them elementary conditions for living. But as far as the longer-term aftermath of the disaster is our concern, we can only calculate (ph) when the water will go down and we can be thinking of that in several days, this will be the case.

He was making the point that actually Joe Biden, by any rational assessment, is doing a pretty amazing job considering the politics of that country at the moment. Trump has got a real following, a deep following. Johnson had that following whilst he was a leader of the conservative party. But it's perfectly clear now, look, he's claiming some great establishment plot against him. He got kicked out by his colleagues, because they no longer thought he was a winner. He's now being kicked out of -- he's run from parliament because they've decided he's a liar, and you can't come back from that.

Yes, they probably have aspirations to diminish U.S. power and influence in what they believe to be their sphere of influence. As we know, from the Monroe Doctrine way back, the U.S. always also interested in ousting European powers as it became a much stronger nation.

I think that China believes it's new normal now with U.S. restrictions on technology, but they do have hope that trading and investment relationships can resume normality and further talks about discussions on collaboration.

That hasn't changed. There's superficial levels of convergence. The new generation, they aspire to the American lifestyle to a certain degree. They like Hollywood and NBA, but their identity is still firmly local. And the fact that 80 percent of these half a million students studying abroad every year returning to native soil is an indication of that, even though they have great economic opportunities elsewhere. And I think, yes, you are absolutely right, political liberalization has totally stalled. But we also have to ask, you know, what does the new generation want? Yes, they have very different appetite for consumption and borrowing compared to their risk averse parents' generation, but politically, what is their mentality? Now, there are many international surveys that showed they're much more open-minded and socially conscious, and I think there is a lot more convergence of social values of the new generation around the world with the Chinese, but they also look abroad and do not find inspiration. They don't look at western liberal democracies as paragons of success, or the other democracies that was transposed onto native soil as models that they aspire to.

And yes, we can maybe say that there are some references on the top that are imposed on the general public, but China, you know, faces a real challenge. It's no longer the country where the entire population revolves around one goal, which is higher income and more GDP. It's becoming a much more complex nation with individual preferences, diverse opinions. And how do you manage a greater complex society is going to be the key critical challenge for the leadership going forward, and it's not going to be easy. If you look at the youth unemployment rate, 25 percent of people with bachelor's degrees without a have job, I mean, that is really signaling social instability issues. But also, don't underestimate the Chinese government in their rapidity and swift adjustment to policies. In the U.S., policies take a time -- take a long time to change, but the parties change. In China, parties -- the party doesn't change, but policies can change very quickly. If the government has a mind on something and they believe that's the right thing to do, things will happen swiftly.

It did change the government, way faster than anyone had ever expected. And so, I think that it's one example of this feedback. And this most important thing is that the communist party -- the boat stays afloat because of the sea of people. So, that's something that is really important in China.

Youknow, my mom was a very nurturing person. I always say that she was everybody's stage mom. If she saw a gift or a talent in you, she would champion that and say, go for your dreams. And, you know, she really empowered us to do that for ourselves and, you know, included us in her artistry and in her creativity. It wasn't something that was separated from our daily lives. We were very much a part of all the different aspects of her life at that point. And so, I think, it allowed us to feel very close to her, even though we had to really share her with the world most of the time.",

And \"Love to Love You, Donna Summer,\" is available on HBO and streaming on Max.And finally, tonight, even days later, this story continues to amaze, the sheer will to survive of four small children. The youngest, only one-year- old. They have been found alive, as we know, in Colombia's Amazon jungle. But it was after more than a month after a plane crash where they lost their mother. The general who led the massive search for the kids has told CNN he believes rescuers came within 100 feet of them at one point, but didn't find them right away because of the rainforest density. All three adults on board, including, as I said, their mother, were killed. But here's why their father said he remains hopeful for his children. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MANUEL RANOQUE, FATHER OF RESCUE CHILDREN (through translator): We are indigenous people. I believe in the jungle, which is our mother. And that's why I've always kept the faith and would say that both the jungle and nature have never betrayed me. (END VIDEO CLIP)",
