      "sentences": "Well, I think the main thing here to say about the cease-fire, is that it's a cease- fire in name the only. And we could talk about what the generals are saying on the paramilitary forces and the armed forces of Sudan. But in reality, there is no cease fire. There's been repeated clashes in Khartoum overnight and in the morning according to eyewitnesses we have been speaking to.And you're right, the health system in Sudan, Bianca, is often shaky. In Khartoum, they you have some world class hospitals but more than two-thirds of the hospitals are shut by the fighting. And doctors are dealing with awful conditions, running out of everything and they are just trying their best to save lives. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MCKENZIE (voice over): A brave Sudanese doctor takes us inside a frontline hospital in Khartoum, filming over several days. Dr. Howida AlHassan and her team are barely coping at Alban Gadid Hospital. They talk about ceasefire, but there is no ceasefire. The wounded keep coming in, she narrates. The same staff have been here for 11 days. They're facing a deluge of civilian victims, many with multiple gunshot wounds, wiping away the blood because the casualties never stop. My son was wounded, says this man. I had come because many hospitals aren't working. DR. HOWIDA ALHASSAN, ALBAN GADID HOSPITAL (through translator): I'm astonished how we're able to continue. We don't sleep. I wouldn't call what we do sleeping. I would call it fainting. We faint, then we wake up again. I'm surprised how we are managing. MCKENZIE (voice-over): Doctor Howida says everything is running out. They're giving smaller doses of medicine to ration their supply. We use the equipment and the instruments more than once, she says. We can't sterilize properly. There are just too many wounded. ALHASSAN (through translator): Soon we'll have no bandages, no medication, no anesthetic drugs and no oxygen. The situation is bad, with all the meanings of the word. MCKENZIE (voice-over): Bad and it will get worse, unless help comes soon or the fighting stops. Sudan's doctors' union says that more than two thirds of hospitals are shut in the capital. Eyewitnesses and doctors' groups say hospitals are being targeted with heavy weapons by both sides, which they deny. As foreign governments spirit their diplomats and nationals out of Sudan, Dr. Howida says her conscience compels her to stay. ALHASSAN (through translator): I believe the number of casualties and wounded will increase after the foreigners are evacuated. God knows if we will be alive or dead. MCKENZIE (voice-over): Sudanese blood is one blood, she told us. I beg you to silence the sound of the rifles. (END VIDEOTAPE) MCKENZIE (on camera): Well, we spoke to Dr. Howida just this morning. She says that they've run out of oxygen at that hospital. They're running out of supplies. The international Red Cross say they tried to get supplies into some hospitals. They were stopped by armed men. And I think this is an issue facing many different hospitals across the country and especially in the capital. And if you consider that they've had to bring in youths from the neighborhood in that eastern part of Khartoum just to protect the hospital from looting. And they say that other parts of that capital, there are armed men inside of hospitals. It's just a total breakdown of the capital and if it drags on for several more days -- and, frankly, there is no sign that a cease-fire will be holding any time soon, at least for now, you're going to see almost a worst-case scenario for those in that hospital and in that city -- Bianca, Max.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max, it's symbolically very significant. Remember, this had been rumored for a long time. Especially after Xi came back from Moscow after he visited with Putin last month. And especially after that flurry of diplomatic visits to Beijing by European leaders. You have Macron and von der Leyen.On top of that, you have this growing desire by China to be seen as a global peace maker following that deal, they brokered between the Saudi's and Iranians. So, it's in this broader context that we finally saw this highly anticipated call take place. That's also why some analysts see this call as a reward from Beijing to Europe's willingness to engage with China on this issue. But let's not forget what just happened in the past few days. The Chinese ambassador to France causing an uproar across Europe when he requested on live French television the legality of the sovereignty of former Soviet states. Even though Beijing has since said, disowned those remarks but damage has been done. So, the need for damage control may have finally tipped the scales in favor of this rather modest gesture, according to some analysts. That's why we finally saw this call on Wednesday. Now, of course, Xi reiterated a lot of China's longstanding talking points but he did pledge for the first time to send a special envoy to Ukraine and other regional countries to discuss, quote, unquote, a political settlement. But even state media here has acknowledged nothing is likely to change and in the short-term given the chasm between Ukraine and Russia on their positions. And adverse states going to take a lot more than a phone call to convince China skeptics and critics in Europe about that it's now serious to play an unbiased role despite that no limit partnership with Russia. And -- but one thing this call does indicate, of course, is China is now willing, at least, to engage with Ukraine more regularly and it's definitely trying to show Europe that it wants to play a more active and constructive role in ending this war. And Europe, of course, is increasingly a battlefield in the strategic rivalry between China and the United States -- Max and Bianca.",

We've seen the Mykolaiv Region come under attack by the Russian Armed Forces. At least one person confirmed to have been killed by the Ukrainian authorities after the Russian armed forces launched four missiles from the Black Sea.We've heard from the Ukrainian authorities say they believe high precision weapons were used in that attack. Meaning that those civilians and civilian infrastructure were targeted deliberately as we have seen over the past few months of this grinding war. And yet, President Zelenskyy has maintained that the Ukrainian armed forces will be victorious. He spoke yesterday addressing this and this is yet another crime against humanity that they will be held accountable. But we are also seeing further attacks in the Zaporizhzhia Region. More than 80 attacks, drone attacks, missile attacks, artillery attacks according to local military official there. Killing at least two people. So, this is still ongoing and it is grinding on. We heard yesterday from a U.S. military official assessing the situation on the ground. This is the U.S. general for Europe, Christopher Cavoli, he warned that the Russian's ground forces are larger at this point now than they were at the beginning of the war. This is despite the significant losses that we know that the Russian armed forces have sustained. And he actually said the Russian armed forces still has plenty of options on the table. So, this will be a significant concern for Ukraine and of course, for NATO and Ukraine's other international allies. But that said, Christopher Cavoli also said that the Ukrainians are in a good position when it comes to that potential for a counteroffensive and that the U.S. is still keeping that support for the Ukrainian armed forces ongoing.",
