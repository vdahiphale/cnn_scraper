Look, the President, as you know, is very close to his family. This is a holiday week, Fourth of July. He spent time with his family, as you all know, and reported at Camp David. Hunter came back with him and walked with him into that meeting, that prep - that speech prep. And, you know, and he ended up spending time with his dad and his family that night. That is basically what happened. It is a week where there's going to be more family members who are going to come to the White House. I'm sure you'll see some of them on Fourth of July.

      "sentences": "Thanks, Karine. You've said a couple of times now that the White House has provided thorough medical records for the President. The White House released a six-page summary back in February. I don't think that was full accounting necessarily. And Dr. O'Connor, in that memo, described the President as, quote, \"a healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.\" I think that is clearly not what the majority of Americans are seeing.And we have a new poll from CBS News that says 72 percent of registered voters say the President does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president. So, are you saying that the majority of Americans are misguided and that they just need to trust Dr. O'Connor and take him at his word? JEAN-PIERRE: So, a couple of things, and I want to say the President is feeling better. And you saw him last night. You saw him today. But he does, indeed, still have a cold. Look, you know, I want to be very sensitive here. And I think it is important to be sensitive here. We understand how the American people are feeling. We get it. We do. And we - I do not want to take away from that. I'm not going to speak - I know that there was - you all did a poll. CNN did a poll. I'm not going to speak to every poll. I'm just not going to do that. And also, I'm, you know, constraints in doing that as we're heading into an election in November, as you know. What I will say is majority of Americans also support the work that the President has, doing in a sense of his agenda and what he stands for, what he's been fighting for, whether it's reproductive rights, whether it's an economy that works for all. And that is something that the President is going to continue to do. And this is why we have said, and I have said this multiple times from here, is that's why the President acknowledges. We get it. We get what Americans are feeling. That's why he's acknowledging he's not a young man. That's why he's acknowledging he's a little slower than he used to be in walking and not as smooth as speaking. We get that. But we also want to make sure that we point to the successes that he's had, his record and we want to continue to build on his unprecedented record. And I'm not going to discount what the American people see or feel. What I can say is what we know from our side of things, we can speak to his record, and we can speak to what the President has been able to acknowledge and I think that's important, too. And that's basically acknowledging what Americans are seeing and feeling.",

That is something for the campaign, as you started saying, that the - what the campaign has laid out their argument of the case. That is something for them to take up and that is something for them to answer. What I can speak to is the President's record. What I can speak to, what he's been able to accomplish and the things that he's been able to do and get done is actually in line with the majority of Americans.

This year the President has done more than 40 interviews, and unscripted, right? Those interviews are unscripted. He has done more than 500 gaggles, right? Of course, unscripted, talking directly to many of you. Let me just finish. And so he enjoys doing that. He enjoys engaging with all of you, and we're going to continue making sure that happens. I will say this, this is a - obviously, this is a president that was a senator for 36 years. He was a Vice President, as you all know. I'm just repeating things that you all know, for eight years. And so he has long-time advisors that have been here with him for a long time. I don't think that's unusual. He also has people who have - who are new to the administration that also advise him. Look, I've been in meetings with the President where it's been a diverse group of people, and he sees us and he knows the reason why we're sitting in front of him is that we have something to share and he wants to hear from all of us. I've heard him say, hey, what is it that - what do you think? What do you think? And so my experience has been that that world is indeed open and that he does get to hear from a diverse group of people. That has been my experience. And - but it is not unusual for someone who has been around for that long of time to have a group of people that he's - that's been around him for some - for a minute, right? And I think that makes sense. There's nothing about that that is nonsensical, that actually makes sense.

And, look, independent mainstream fact-checkers in the press and misinformation experts have been calling out cheap fakes. And at the end of the day, they're fakes. That's what they were, targeting the President. They had said, the reporters and these misinformation experts, said that this president was being targeted. And what we did was echo them.

We really, truly want to turn the page on this. We really want to be able to get out there and, you know, speak directly to the American people, you know, speak directly to you all, the President will. And I think that's important, too. Look - and not forget what this President has been able to do the last three and a half years, how he's been able to deliver. And there is a stark contrast in what this president has done and what Republicans in Congress are doing, right? He's trying to protect our rights as President. He's trying to protect our freedoms. He's trying to protect really important programs that matter to the American people. He wants to protect women's rights, Roe v. Wade. He wants to continue to build an economy that works for all.
