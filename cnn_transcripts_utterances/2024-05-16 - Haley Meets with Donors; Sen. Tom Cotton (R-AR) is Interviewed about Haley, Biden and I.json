He's denying them the munitions that they need in the middle of a war of survival against Hamas, which committed the worst atrocity against Jews since World War II.And the announcement that President Biden made this week, that he's going to deliver a billion dollars of arms, is just a smokescreen for that de facto arms embargo, because those weapons and those munitions won't arrive for months or even years. It's all designed to give cover to Democrats who recognize that Joe Biden is catering to the small, pro-Hamas wing in his party against the large pro-Israel majority of the American people. In contrast, Donald Trump has said he would back Israel to the hilt, which is what we should be doing so Israel can win this war more quickly and destroy Hamas. That's what we should have been doing all along. But President Biden's tied himself in pretzels for the last seven months, once again displaying weakness because he is worried about this small, but outsized vocal pro-Hamas minority in his own party. BOLDUAN: I've heard you say de facto arms embargo in recent days as well, but it's not a de facto arms embargo. It's not - it's not that in reality. It - they sent $26 billion over in that foreign aid package. It's not a full arms embargo like on, I don't know, Somalia and Sudan. You don't really, you don't think that Israel could pull off its operation in Rafah, how they plan it, what they want to do, when they want to do it, without - without what - getting more right now from the United States?",

But his assessment is that they need to change strategy before they do. They are, right now, his description is clearing and leaving. And they need to be clearing holding and building, which is what they did in Iraq. He makes the case that the IDF strategy is not working.

You have to destroy and get a military victory. That's what happened when General Petraeus was the commander of the 101st Airborne in March and April of 2003. You have to have a military victory before you can have a political victory.And I know that President Biden is demanding that Israel have all kinds of elaborate plans for what's going to happen after Hamas is defeated. That's not what we did against the Islamic state when Barack Obama started a war. Didn't finish it. Took Donald Trump to finish it. But we focused on achieving a military victory. And until Hamas' final four battalions hold up inside Rafah are destroyed, until their leaders are captured or killed, I think it's premature to demand Israel start developing all kinds of elaborate plans for the so-called day after.

The question is whether invading Rafah ultimately helps or hurts the cause. After meeting with the Israeli ambassador today for an hour, I'm even more skeptical of their plan. You said, I support President Biden's decision. At that point you were talking about his decision not to provide certain offensive weapons if Israel went into Rafah. We're getting the news that Israel is increasing its troop presence on the ground there. Can you tell us what you disapprove of that you learned of Israels' plans? REP. SETH MOULTON (D-MA): Well, look, they just don't have answers to basic questions that you need to know - have answers to if you're fighting a counterinsurgency. Like what is the end game? How do they plan to prevent civilian casualties? What is the humanitarian aid plan? So that you - you're actually winning the support of the population and not just pushing them further into the arms of the terrorists. They didn't have answers to these things. They didn't have answers to a basic question, which is, if indeed Hamas is harboring its - its leaders and the hostages in - in the tunnels under Rafah, how are you going to save the hostages when you go in and try to take out Hamas' leaders? So, it really seems to me that they need to go back to the fundamentals of a counterinsurgency plan. I think - I wrote an op-ed on CNN just off of - just after October 7th saying, you guys have got to get this right if you want to win, and they still don't seem to have a winning plan.",

And we already see in the north a part of Gaza that's been practically obliterated by Israeli bombs that it hasn't been effective at defeating Hamas. Hamas is now researched in the north. They have continuing problems. Fighting is getting intense there again. That just confirms that Israel's strategy to date is not working.And, look, I say this with Iraq experience, having made a lot of mistakes in Iraq. When we first went into Iraq and Afghanistan, we thought we could just kill terrorists and that would be enough. It took us a while to learn that the key in a counterinsurgency campaign is not just killing terrorists, although you do have to do that, it's winning the support of the population. That's why limiting civilian casualties is so important, providing humanitarian aid and having a political end game that both sides can believe. Israel still hasn't explained that to the world.",
