My question on this -- clearly, there is unity and there is momentum behind Mike Johnson's candidacy at this point. There were 20- plus Republicans who did not vote last night.Why should we assume after the last 21 days that everyone's going to get in line? REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN):  Well, it was late, and those 20 were out. Some of them had dinner. Some of them had receptions. But I think what you need to understand about Mike Johnson is just who he is. You know, this town is bucking, and there's much mashing of teeth and wringing of hands last night from the lobbyists and the special interests. You know, this town is languishing in moral and fiscal ambiguity and he will restore that. Mike Johnson is a good man. And I think as you saw last night, that we are ready for a leader. We don't -- we don't deserve a leader like Mike Johnson but dadgummit, we're going to get him. And I think he's going to carry us over the finish line. He is an excellent man. He's a family man. He's a fine Christian. And he is a -- I think he'll be a giant. He's not very tall physically, but in these halls he is -- you will stand in his shadow.",

And I said well, it's always the first few that hit the beach that end up getting killed, and that's what -- exactly what happened. And I said I would hope that we would get someone like Mike Johnson. And I -- and I actually had texted him at that and I reminded him -- and he reminded me of that last night.And so, you know -- and the other question is -- I get asked is was it worth it? And I said absolutely, it was worth it. It was -- as I've stated many times, I've prayed about it. It was the right thing to do. And I think you're going to see a great leader. I think the lobbyists are doing everything they can right now to generate, as they did last night in our meeting. You saw some of the old guard trying to rally support for a bogus write-in-type situation. And then that's why we forced the vote on a -- on a -- on an actual voice vote -- a roll call vote -- so people had to stand up. And then you saw everybody gathering around him at the podium.

Given the fact that there appears -- at least based on that sound -- that there is momentum behind him, is this somebody you believe Democrats can work with across the aisle? REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY):  Well, good morning. Great to be with you. I don't know Mike Johnson well. Based on his track record he appears to be an extreme right-wing ideolog. Mike Johnson wants to criminalize abortion care and impose a nationwide ban. Mike Johnson was one of the chief architects of trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Mike Johnson also wants to end Social Security and Medicare as we know it. Those are extreme views and House Democrats will push back aggressively against that. However, at the same period of time, we've said from the very beginning of this Congress and demonstrated that we are ready, willing, and able to find common ground with our Republican colleagues in order to advance bipartisan solutions to solve problems for hardworking American taxpayers. And all Mike Johnson will need to do is to meet us in a bipartisan way in that fashion and we'll be able to work together whenever and wherever possible. MATTINGLY:  Mr. Leader, I was talking to a Republican congressman last night that I wouldn't put in the Mike Johnson category ideologically. He said look, we have to do something. That's why people are moving in this direction, framing it as if there was no other alternative. Had a resolution been put on the floor or if a resolution is put on the floor to more broadly empower the speaker pro tem, do you think Democrats would support it? Would you ask your members to support it?",

That set topline spending numbers for us to utilize in order to reach agreement on the spending priorities and needs for the American people. And it was the Republicans who, less than a week after supporting that agreement that they negotiated with President Biden, broke their word and abandoned the agreement. And that is why we're facing a possible government shutdown.
