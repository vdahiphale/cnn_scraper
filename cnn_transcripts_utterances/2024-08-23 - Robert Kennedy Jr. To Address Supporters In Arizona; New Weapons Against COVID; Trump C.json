And we have a potential shakeup in the race for the White House because any moment now, independent presidential candidate RFK Jr. is speaking in Arizona. These are live pictures of the stage he's expected to take here shortly. And sources say he is expected to end his campaign and could, though not guaranteed, throw his support behind former President Trump.Trump is also in Arizona today. And his team says that a special guest will join him for a rally in Phoenix. They're not saying exactly who that is, but you could guess, I guess. Yeah, not much room for interpretation there. RFK Jr. is likely departure leaves Trump and Vice President Harris now strategizing how to pull in Kennedy's supporters with fewer than 75 days until the election. This comes just hours after Harris made history by accepting the democratic nomination for president. Our correspondents are covering all the latest angles and developments. Let's start with CNN's Kristen Holmes who's live for us in Phoenix awaiting Kennedy's press conference. Kristen, what are you hearing about exactly what he's going to say?",

He's holding a campaign event there before he heads to Arizona.Alayna, have you heard anything from sources giving you a clear indication of whether Trump is going to be meeting up with Kennedy? ALAYNA TREENE, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: That is the expectation as of now, Boris and Brianna. But again, things are fluid. And I think Kristen just laid it out perfectly that nothing is guaranteed, but we can kind of read between the lines there. There's a reason that they're both in Phoenix today. I don't really believe in coincidences when it comes to politics of this nature. So I keep an eye out for that. What I also am paying close attention to is what Donald Trump says at this event about RFK Jr. Because RFK Jr. Junior's announcement where he is expected to suspend his campaign, is about an hour before Donald Trump is slated to speak just behind me here. And so I would anticipate some live reaction before they potentially see each other in Arizona later today. But I also just want to walk you both through quickly what you're going to expect from this event before he goes to Arizona, this event in Las Vegas, this is all about touting his no tax on tips proposal. This is something he actually first pitched at a rally in Las Vegas in June. I'm told that today, he's going to be interviewing some people in the audience. And I'll tell you, this is a very small venue. This is very unlike Donald Trump's normal event. This is not a rally. We're in a small Italian-Mexican fusion restaurant, not roughly a little over 100 people here who are his supporters. And so very small event, but really trying to drive home that message that his economic outlook and his economic proposals are better than those of Vice President Kamala Harris. And another thing I think you can expect is he is very angry with Kamala Harris for also announcing a similar policy regarding no taxes on tips. You saw Donald Trump kind of slam her on social media, saying that she's copying his proposals, that she can't make up her own mind about her own proposal, so she has to steal his. You'll hear some of that same rhetoric at this event shortly.",

      "sentences": "Well, there's a lot more work to be done. That's what the vice president also included in her message last night. But a source tells me that the next focus for them is going to be that September presidential debate. That is an opportunity where she will, again, be able to speak to a very large audience and draw a stark contrast right next to former President Donald Trump.Now, over the next few weeks ahead of that September debate, we can anticipate that she's going to continue her travel, but not at the same pace as the last couple of weeks when she was hitting all of the battleground states. That cadence of travel will continue after the fact as they focus now on the debate prep. But I will note that the Vice President, those around her say that she is clear-eyed. She knows that this is a truncated campaign for them and that there is a lot of work to be done in the weeks to come. We also heard this week from the battleground state director for the campaign. One of the places that they're looking at, and we can -- we anticipate to see a lot of action is North Carolina. They want to stay very bullish there. And one of the bounces that he described that he wanted to see after the convention is more volunteers and more setting up their infrastructure because this is a race that's going to be called on the margins. And so they need to get out the vote. And that is something they're keenly aware about. So a lot of the focus that we can see on the ground at the very least is trying to make sure they mobilize those voters. One way to do that is through your surrogates. And we know from the campaign that the Obamas and the Clintons will be among those who are going to be hitting the campaign trail. Obama's senior advisor said that one way that the former President wants to get involved is in areas where he thinks he can move the needle, so looking for those opportunities. Again because they know it's going to be close, we've talked about this extensively. And so how do they capitalize on the moments that they have between now and Election day? But at least for now in the next couple of weeks we can anticipate a lot of debate prep, something that the Vice President already started and is going to continue to do a lot of ahead of September 10th, and travel, though maybe not as much as we saw over the last couple of weeks.",

I'm having success. I'm doing great with the Hispanic voters. I'm doing great with black men. I'm doing great with women because women, they want safety and they don't have safety when they have somebody allowing 20 million people into our country, many of them very dangerous people.

And really, his team had urged him to move away from the personal attacks on Harris. But in many ways, he couldn't help himself. You heard him repeatedly this week, slam Harris, slam the other speakers, like the Obama's earlier in the week after their speeches for what they were saying in a key grievance of his, is that they've spent so much time focused on attacking him, Donald Trump, rather than on the issues. You heard a lot of that last night. And he's continued to post about her speech today.

If Donald Trump could scoop that up, he would be tied in this poll. Look at this New York Times/Siena Poll where it had a three way race. Look at this. Here, they're showing Donald Trump ahead. If he grabbed 6% here, even more so and as Kristen mentioned a little while ago, the swing states like Arizona. Look at that. That's where the support for RFK is.

That sounds really bad until you look at the 81% who have an unfavorable view of Trump.And one more thing, you have to think about in all of this is we decide what happens. Very typically, when people say they're supporting a third-party candidate like this, when it comes to actual voting, the performance is much lower than what people expected, sometimes a third, sometimes a quarter of what people expected.
