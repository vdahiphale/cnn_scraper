I do think that right now the Ukrainians are sensing that the Russians are going to try and make a bigsecond push to try and attack Ukraine in a bigger way than they have before. Certainly, one of the things that we've heard from Vladimir Putin over the past couple of days was that he believes that right now there is a certain shift of momentum towards the Russians. Especially if you look at the area around Bakhmut, Soledar, in the east of the country where, of course, you have that private military company of the Russians, the Wagner military group fighting there. And that really is one of the only places where the Russians have been able to make gains. At the same time, the Ukrainians are saying right now that more weapons -- more sophisticated weapons are very important to them. And that's for several reason. One of them is the fact that you have had a lot of civilians who have been impacted over the past couple of days. In fact, right before coming here I was actually in the town of Dnipro, about 400 miles away from here, where a civilian building, a residential building, was struck by a missile that the Ukrainians say was a Russian missile that's normally designed to destroy aircraft carriers. It completely obliterated an entire house. Right now, the death toll there stands at 45. And the Ukrainians are saying they would need more sophisticated air defense weapons. More, for instance, are the patriots that the U.S. is currently training on the Ukrainians on. But if they look at the situation on the battlefield, they look at the fact that the Russians have mobilized hundreds of thousands of people that are currently, apparently, in training or are already being brought to Ukraine and might be on the verge of mobilizing even more. They say the big next up for them would be main battle tanks. That's what the Ukrainians are pushing for right now. That is also what a lot of European countries, like for instance Poland are pushing for. The big issue there right now is the Germans because the tanks that the Ukrainians want is, of course, the Leopard 2 main battle tank. And the Germans would have to sign off on any sort of tank deliveries by any country in Europe. And there are a lot that have the Leopard 2 to be able to give those to Ukraine. Christiane.",

If it's going to be Kevin McCarthy who has made deals to the extreme wing, who's always clasping to hold on to power. That would be very unfortunate. My hope for the sake of this country, for the sake of this presidency is that we can get something done. Because ultimately, as I write in that piece, our challenges remaining the worlds' economic superpower and worlds leader. And that's really what they've sent us to Congress to do.",

It -- we've worked on bringing manufacturing back. We worked on cybersecurity. We've worked on data privacy. I think, particularly, when it comes to rebuilding the industrial base of this country, it should be bipartisan. But I'll tell you where I approach things, I grew up the sone of immigrants in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. I was born in Philadelphia. I was growing up at a time when the county was 95 percent white. I was probably only one of two or three Indian kids in a high school of 800 people. But people in Bucks County believed in me. They gave me a shot. They believed that anything is possible in America. And they were Republicans, and they were Democrats. And I still believe most people in this country are decent patriots. They care about this country. They want this country to succeed and they're good people. And that faith gives me a sense that if someone is here in the United States Congress representing 700,000 people, I owe it to their constituency to listen to them. And not just label them as something not worth working with, but to listen to them as someone who's representing the American people.",

If they look at recent history, when Republicans have overreached, when they have beenobstructionists, they usually don't stay in the majority. It's in Speaker McCarthy's interest to do things that are good for the American people. And we can when it comes to manufacturing in the United States. When it comes to some deal on immigration. When it comes to data privacy. When it comes to raining in the excesses of technology. These are all areas that we can work on. If it's two years of investigations, well, this is not going to bode well for the country or for the Republicans re-election chances. If it's getting things done, if it's good for the country, and frankly, it'll be good for them in 2024.",
