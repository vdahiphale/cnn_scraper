And so if you're Trump, you know, how do you - how do you help him along in not jumping over the bar and that's by letting him talk. I mean the problem with Biden in a lot of his public appearances is, the more he talks, the worse it gets. And so you have to have a little bit of discipline here to see if Biden can unspool in a way that would lead people to believe, yes, you know, I've been thinking he's not up to it and that was confirmed tonight.For Trump you just don't want to misspeak constantly and let the narrative of the campaign be - of the night be something like, oh, you know, Trump misspoke more than Biden, or Trump, you know, mixed up names in the same way he says Biden does.

But he's a performer and he's not a politician. And so I think - think - when we talk about debate prep, you know, Axe and I are thinking about, how would you prepare a regular person or a regular politician. That - that's not Trump. And so all the tactical and, you know, policy stuff that we might kick around here as being smart debate prep, I doubt that's in the matrix for him. So, I think it's harder to prepare Trump.

And according to Cindy Clemishire, who spoke with \"The Wartburg Watch,\" which is an evangelical church watchdog group, she details that back in the 1980s she was sexually molested by Robert Morris for almost five years. In a statement, the senior pastor, Morris, said that he - when I was, quote, \"in my early 20s I was involved in inappropriate sexual behavior with a young lady in a home where I was staying. It was kissing and petting and not intercourse, but it was wrong. This behavior happened on several occasions over the next few years.\" He also goes on to say that he was confronted by the family and went into what he described as freedom ministry and counseling for several years. And then he goes on to say that since that time I have walked in purity and accountability in this area. It's important to point out that what the pastor describes as inappropriate sexual behavior is actually criminal sexual molestation of an underage girl who was 12 at the time and not able to give legal consent. And also he describes her as a young lady. We should point out that Cindy Clemishire was 12-years-old at the time. She spoke with CNN affiliate WFAA about this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
