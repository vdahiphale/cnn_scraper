Four days to Election Day, and Liz Cheney is saying today, this is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death.So, what is Liz Cheney responding to? Donald Trump before a crowd in Arizona last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: She's a radical war hawk. Let's put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face. You know, they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, oh, gee, well, let's send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The former Wyoming congresswoman who, of course, was the top Republican investigating the attacks on January 6th and Donald Trump has been threatening and hurting Liz Cheney ever since, she goes on to say in this new statement now just a short time ago, we cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.Of course, Liz Cheney has emerged in this campaign as one of the leading supporters and surrogates for Vice President Kamala Harris. That is just one of the biggest examples of the upside down nature of this campaign, a conservative Republican supporting the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris. But, last night, the former president went on to say that he believes that because of a foreign policy that Liz Cheney simply does not represent the view of Americans. Of course, this dark rhetoric is closing this campaign in a far different way than the two previous campaigns in 2016 and 2020. However, politically speaking, we do not know if there will be any fallout from this. It sounds extraordinary to say, but given all the rhetoric, all the back and forth, even language like this may not move this electorate. But Liz Cheney has been out on the campaign trail here in Wisconsin and across the blue wall in Michigan, Pennsylvania, other places, I'm told, she may be responding to this more later today, and Vice President Harris also could be. But there is no doubt four days before Election Day, this deep, dark rhetoric is hanging over this race.",

It's one of the reasons he ran for president, his vaccine skepticism, misleading information. Now, Donald Trump is saying he would be at the center of his administration.But, again, important to point out, one of the political reasons Donald Trump is doing this, he is trying to get RFK supporters to vote for him. In fact, just this week RFK Jr. was here in Wisconsin campaigning and he said, do not vote for me, vote for Donald Trump. So, for all the wild cards hanging over this race, and there are many, his name is still on the ballot here and in a tight race, that too could matter, Kate.",

She is trying to paint a photo of the vice -- or sorry, of the former president plotting revenge in the Oval Office. She has often said on the campaign trail recently that the former president is consumed with what she calls his enemies list while she is working on her to-do list for Americans. That was her message here in Nevada yesterday.Now, in doing that, she's also warning of a second potential Trump term and also talking about the freedoms that are at risk if the former president were to be elected. And on that front, she talks about reproductive freedom. And yesterday, she tailored that message even more to respond to what the former president has said about women. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, U.S. VICE PRESIDENT, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what's in their own best interest and make decisions accordingly.

You heard there from Jeff that Liz Cheney has been a leading supporter for the vice president. She was recently in Wisconsin with Vice President Kamala Harris. So, certainly, she is probably going to be talking about more of that because she is trying to reach those disaffected Republicans, Republicans who are fatigued by Trump and do not want to hear this rhetoric. The vice president, of course, has been rapidly responding too much of the former president's comments in recent days. So, we anticipate we'll hear more from her today on all of that. Sara?",

      "sentences": "Yes, you bet, Sara. And it's interesting to note that, like you said, there are a lot of voting rights stories coming out of Pennsylvania right now, but a lot of them have longer histories than just the past few days. Nevertheless, as you noted, it's colliding, of course, with the election coming up.So, this first one concerns these mail-in ballots. Remember, Pennsylvania mail in ballots have three parts. They have the ballot itself, then they have the secrecy envelope, and then they have the actual envelope that you send the whole thing in. On that third envelope, you have to sign and date it, okay? But the problem is that in the past, there have been legal challenges because sometimes people either forget to date the envelope at all. They put in their birthday instead of the date. They fill it out. Well, this is exactly what this latest lawsuit appeal from the RNC is about. They've appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to clarify after a couple of dueling rulings this particular week to clarify that counties must enforce not counting any of those mail-in ballots that are undated. We'll see ultimately if the Pennsylvania Supreme Court weighs in. They have until Monday, or at least that's the hope from the RNC. The other thing, Sara, that I'll quickly note when it comes to mail-in ballots is this, you said the word early voting in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania really does not have early voting. They have an on-demand mail-in system, and this is what tripped up folks in Bucks County earlier. It's not like you walk into a polling place and it simulates the idea of voting on Election Day. Instead, you have to go into an elections office, request a mail-in ballot, you apply for it, you get it back then with an elections official, and then you first fill it out and hand it over to a drop box or something like that. Well, there were videos that went viral back earlier in the week in Bucks County in particular of long lines and some people getting turned away early before they could apply for that mail in ballot to then turn in. Well, the RNC and the Trump campaign, they sued Bucks County. They got the deadline extended. So today, actually, only in Bucks County, voters have an opportunity to do that early voting, really, that on-demand mail-in voting until the end of the day. So, Sara, these are all these sorts of stories that are kind of swirling around Pennsylvania in these final days before the election. It's challenging. It's confusing to some voters. And, really, when it comes to mail-in balloting, the Legislature of Pennsylvania had opportunities to kind of get in there and fix some issues over the past several years since they introduced this back in 2019, and they just haven't. And I think now you're seeing some of that come to fruit again in these final days before the 2024 election, Sara.",
