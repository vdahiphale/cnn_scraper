Potentially, that gives you a motivation of this is the exact type of person who would be motivated, right, to exact some kind of political coercion or message as it relates to UnitedHealthcare and exactly what he did.So everything you do as a defendant is going to be used against you. Brianna and Boris, of relevance to me with respect to the substance in the press conference were two things, takeaways. And that is, I was looking to see whether Pennsylvania would want to prosecute, right, believing they would be deferential to New York. But it's clear now that they think that the New York case should have priority to the extent that it's a murder charge. That's number one. And then, of course, when you look at the extradition issue in terms of whether he would fight it or waive it, I think John Miller makes a very good point with respect to him potentially not wanting to be at Rikers Island. Now, here's the issue. There's not many defenses on extradition. Just to reset, extradition is a process where one state is requesting you because of the crimes you've committed there. And you have every right as a criminal defendant to say, hey, I'm not waiving anything. I'm going to fight extradition. That's fine. But there's not many defenses. Number one, is the extradition warrant full, complete and accurate with respect to the accusations? Number two, does it allege probable cause for the offenses for which you were charged? Number three, does it refer to you? And if those elements are met, then guess what? You are then sent back to the ultimate place, that is New York, where they're seeking your extradition. And so whether it's a delay tactic, whether it's anything else, I could say one thing with clarity and certainty, and that is he will be in New York. When is the open question?",
