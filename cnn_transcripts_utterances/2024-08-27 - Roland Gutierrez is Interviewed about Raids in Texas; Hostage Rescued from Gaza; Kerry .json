No charges have so far been filed since the raids in three counties last week. The attorney general's office says that they were all tied to allegations of voter fraud. First of all, do you think the rates are legitimate? ROLAND GUTIERREZ (D), TEXAS STATE SENATE: No, I don't, Sara. I mean the attorney general is basing his claims on an affidavit that's from an election two years ago. There is no basis to what he's alleging. I want to be very clear who we're talking about. This is the attorney general, Ken Paxton, who was indicted for securities fraud, was on some form of felony, deferred disposition where he has to pay $271,000 in restitution to the people that he defrauded. So, essentially, we need to consider the source here. This is an 87- year-old great grandmother. The other two women were also in their 80s. They were mistreated. One of the - one of the people who was targeted had people draw guns on him. The things that the Texas rangers didn't do in Uvalde they did to these people. They treated them as if they were El Chapo or something. We have some real problems here in Texas with disinformation, like your last story, with this kind of influence peddling because what they want to do is intimidate Latino voters, suppress the vote in south Texas because they're fighting for every race. And they have a seat that they think they can win in House District 80, and they're trying to do everything that they can to do it. And Ken Paxton will stop at nothing.",

This just coming in in the last several minutes. A joint statement from the IDF and the Shin Bet, the domestic security services, saying that the hostage Kaid Farhan Elkadi, age 52. He was a security worker at one of the kibbutzes in southern Israel raided during October 7th, that he has been freed. This under special operations from the 401st Brigade and other forces that are involved typically in operations like this one, rescue operations.They say that he is in stable condition right now, being transferred for medical checks at a hospital. And his family, of course, has been updated with his details. So, his family is now receiving that - what can only be described as joyous news for them. It has been some time since a successful operation inside Gaza to rescue some of these hostages, you have to go back to June 8th when four Israel the hostages were rescued. That in central Gaza. I should note, this operation took place in southern Gaza. And, of course, just last week you'll remember, John, that six hostages bodies were recovered. Of course, it has been a number of weeks since a live hostage was rescued from Gaza. That brings the total number of hostages remaining there to 108, not 100 percent certain how many of them are still alive though. Israeli officials have acknowledged that many, many are - are dead. We do have a reaction as well from the family - the Hostage Family Forum. They call this nothing short of miraculous. So, John, you don't get news like this often. And it's been - well, we're coming up on 11 months since the October 7th terror attacks. Successful rescue operations, like this one, are few and far between.

Meanwhile, it buys time for Ukraine to develop its own deep strike capability. President Zelenskyy's release to - of information of a new Ukrainian drone missile it's called and it's going to go deep and maybe be effective. So, there are lots of arguments in favor of this. The question, though, John is, is this operationally significant or strategically significant? And right now it has political significance strategically. The whole world sees it. But in terms of military operations, it's not yet accomplished a strategically significant resulted.
