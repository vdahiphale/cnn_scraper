This hearing starting just minutes from now there in New Mexico, this will be the suspect's first appearance in court since he was arrested by Albuquerque SWAT officers on Monday.Now, take a look at these charges. They are obviously very serious. He's being charged with felon in possession of a firearm as well as attempted aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, shooting at occupied dwelling four counts there, four counts of shooting from a motor vehicle as well as conspiracy. Now, we've reached out to Pena's attorney, but what police alleged is that he was the ringleader in this conspiracy to target Democratic officials in New Mexico shooting at four homes. This came after Pena allegedly went to the homes of three of these elected officials essentially berating them, very erratic claiming that he believed that he won his election, despite losing it in a landslide. Authorities released in this criminal affidavit, a litany of evidence they have. It includes the firearms that were recovered, it includes a cell phone technology they were able to use and analyze to put him in the location around these areas. Police also say they have a cooperating witness, someone with knowledge of this conspiracy has flipped and is providing information to authority, so again, a very strong case there. Again, you look at the alleged motive here, this is someone who was motivated by election lies, it appears, that is drawing the ire of law enforcement. The prosecutor there in New Mexico was on CNN this morning, slamming these political lies that have resulted in this violence in this case, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SAM BREGMAN, BERNALILLO CO. DISTRICT ATTORNEY: It is unacceptable at every level. It doesn't matter if they're Democrats or Republicans. This kind of violence carrying out your politics or election denying or whatever it might be in the - in - with acts of violence, shooting firearms into homes is unacceptable.

There is a mound of evidence that this defendant would have to overcome to not be found guilty of killing his wife. I don't think that's possible given what the prosecution has laid out so far.

They talk about the impact of his mother and father's divorce on him, and how that divorce and treatment by his mother and father impacted him mentally and psychologically.

Now, CNN reached out to Santos' lawyer and his congressional office for comment. We'll let you know if they get back to us. In the meantime, we are hearing from GoFundMe.
