I'll give you my take on this historic moment.And more than a year after Putin's invasion of Ukraine the battle for Bakhmut rages on. What are the lessons we can draw from Putin's protracted war and how can Ukrainians win this fight? I'll ask the military strategist who commanded many high-profile missions throughout his career, including the raid on Osama bin Laden. Retired Navy four-star Admiral William McRaven. Finally, a very special conversation with one of the world's greatest film directors. I sit down with James Cameron to discuss the role of technology in movie making, his passionate work to protect the planet, and what he thinks explains the stunning global success of his movies.

      "sentences": "But first here's my take. The news of Donald Trump's indictment has left me feeling torn. On the one hand, Trump is a walking advertisement for rich privilege. For decades, he has flouted rules, norms and even laws as he climbed his way to the top, brazenly convinced that the usual standards didn't apply to him.His company was found guilty of tax fraud. He has been taken to court countless times for unpaid bills, and he has even stolen money from his own charities. For those of you who saw Jon Stewart on GPS last week, that was the gist of his passionate argument. Jon is certainly right that the law should not care about the popularity of a person or the political effect of an indictment, and no one can really be sure what that effect would be in the long run anyway. And yet this case is not simply one of the law in all its impartial majesty holding somebody to account. The prosecutor, Alvin Bragg, is an elected district attorney who ran a campaign for that office, boasting that he had helped sue Donald Trump over 100 times. Even so, once elected and after looking over the evidence, he is reported to have put the case on the back burner, which triggered a storm of criticism from his Democratic base. He then reversed course and decided to pursue the case on a new basis if reported accounts are correct, which goes something like this. Trump's offenses to have violated New York state law by falsifying business records, but the statute of limitations for that misdemeanor has expired. So Bragg's office will argue that the misdemeanor is actually tied to a felony because it violates federal election laws. But that violation is one that both Trump's and Joe Biden's Justice Departments looked at and decided against prosecution. That is, as many legal experts have pointed out, a novel legal theory. I should note that Trump denies any wrongdoing. Given the circumstances, this case has the feel of zealous prosecutors minutely examining all possibilities to find some violation of the law. This appends the notion in Anglo-Saxon law that you first have a crime and then you search for the criminal rather than first looking at the person and investigating to see if he or she has committed a crime. Many Republicans have darkly prophesied that this is a watershed moment in American history and will unleash a torrent of indictments by state prosecutors against national politicians whom they dislike. Perhaps. But they seem to have forgotten that they have been instrumental in developing this weaponization of the legal system. This week, the \"Wall Street Journal\" huffed and puffed, \"As these columns have made clear, we believe any prosecution of a former president should involve a serious offense.\" Really? The \"Wall Street Journal\" filled six volumes with over 3,000 pages of editorials endorsing the crazy Whitewater related investigation of a sitting president. For those who have forgotten Whitewater was a failed land deal in which Bill and Hillary Clinton lost money, which triggered a special prosecutor who found nothing he could use to prosecute them on that matter, but in the course of his investigation learned that Bill Clinton had had a sexual relationship with a White House intern which he then used to ask Clinton questions that he figured the president would answer dishonestly leading to a perjury charge. That's a serious crime. The \"Journal's\" theoretical standard is the right one, however, and the truth is, Trump is likely to face just such serious charges soon. In Georgia, he could quite possibly be prosecuted for having threatened the secretary of state in order to find the 11,000 odd votes he needed to win that state. And then there is the January 6th uprising in which he could easily be charged by federal prosecutors with an effort to overturn an election. Trying a former president breaks centuries of precedent. But he should be tried if the offenses themselves are likewise president shattering and those election related ones are. Paying hush money to cover up an affair, however, is just not at that level. And I worry that the far more serious cases against Trump will get lumped together with the Stormy Daniels affair as just more efforts to find something to bring Trump down. The rule of law is not pursued simply to punish people but to create a system of self-government that is widely viewed as legitimate and fair. The hush money case will captivate the country and of the rumors about the charges facing him are true Trump is probably guilty. But will it create more or less faith in our judicial system and our democratic system? That is the worry that leads me to conclude that this is a case of trying the right man for the wrong crime. And let's get started. The battle for eastern Ukraine was incredibly intense and bloody this week as Russia hammered its neighbor with all manner of munitions. In Bakhmut, the most hotly contested city in the region, Wagner mercenaries fighting on behalf of Moscow raised the Wagner not Russian flag near the center of the city. Where does the war go from here? Let me bring in my guest today, retired Admiral William McRaven. Before he retired from the military in 2014 McRaven led Special Operations Command, where he oversaw the U.S. Military's most elite combat units. McRaven has another terrific new book. It is called \"The Wisdom of the Bullfrog: Leadership Made Simple (But Not Easy).\" Bill, welcome. ADM. WILLIAM MCRAVEN (RET.), FORMER HEAD OF U.S. SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND: Thanks, Fareed. Good to be with you.",

But I think what Zelenskyy looked at was, look, if we lose Bakhmut it plays into Putin's narrative that the Russians are winning.And, oh, by the way, it will, you know, it will bolster Russian morale, it will probably unduly affect Ukrainian morale. It could also affect support from Europe and the United States. So while it is just a small tactical piece of ground, I think it has huge strategic implications.

You know, I trust General Mark Milley, one of the finest officers I ever served with and obviously Secretary Lloyd Austin.Both of these gentlemen have incredible combat experience, so if they are kind of withholding the aircraft and withholding the attack them, so I've got to believe there's a good reason for that. But I think in general, the administration has kind of managed the war pretty well. Now what they've got to do is decide whether or not they want to win the war and all of that being the Ukrainians helping the Ukrainians win the war.",

Bill, you've heard people talk about this issue of who would win a war over the Taiwan straits.

He has focused on building up his military because I think he realizes that he's not in a position to do an amphibious assault across the Taiwan straits if the United States is going to try to try to stop that maneuver.And I do think we can we can prevent the Chinese from crossing the straits. But it's going to come at a very, very high cost. And the fact of the matter is we don't want to go to war with China. China doesn't want to go to war with us. So, you know, I know you've heard my position before on this, but I'm a believer that we need to hold the Chinese accountable on the Uighur. We need to hold them accountable on Hong Kong. We need to hold them accountable when they violate the WTO. But at the end of the day, we need to find some common ground with the Chinese, find common ground on trade, find it on climate. Find a way to build a relationship with the Chinese because if we don't we're going to force the Chinese into the arms of the Russians more so than they are now, and this alliance between China and Russia will not be beneficial to anybody in the world.",

So when we look at the Chinese military, particularly their navy, they have more ships than the United States has. They're not in a position to really kind of take us on in the Pacific region. They've got three carriers and frankly they're having trouble finding pilots to demand the planes, but sooner or later they are going to get to the point where their military will in fact be as strong as our military in the Pacific region. We don't want to find ourselves in the South China Sea getting into some sort of conflict that escalates itself. The way you prevent that is you create a dialogue.

Because, you know, water pollution and all these things.So, I knew that years ago. And I thought, well, too bad we have to eat. We have to eat meat to be healthy, right? And then I saw a film called \"Forks Over Knives,\" which dispelled that myth. And then that took me to \"The China Study\" and I read that very, very thick, dense book, lots of graphs and things like that. A lot of double blind studies. And really drilling down on the data. I realized that that film wasn't right. We don't need animal protein. In fact, it's very deleterious for our health, but I was approaching it from a sustainability standpoint. And I thought, wow, one elegant solution. We just stop. So, my wife and I talked -- Suzy and I, and we just -- we just went -- I hate to use the word vegan because I think it's off-putting. People think it's kind of a hippie, new age kind of -- kind of thing, as opposed to a whole food, plant based diet, which requires no animal whatever, anything, cheese, milk, meat, fish any of that.

You know, there were people already on the ground. So, I formed a foundation called the \"Avatar Alliance Foundation\" to fund some of these NGOs to fight these battles. And then I started to leapfrog ahead to do some more \"Avatar\" film because I figured I just need to keep on with that messaging about how we need to connect with each other, how we need to reconnect with nature, how we need to defend her.
