This latest vote could reflect the U.S. president strength on the national stage and serve as a litmus test of his refusal to call for a ceasefire in Gaza. President Biden won the Democratic primary handily.But what's key here is the protest vote roughly 13 percent of voters who tick the uncommitted box. Those are the critics determined to send a message to the Biden campaign about the consequences of his stance on a conflict increasingly referred to as a genocide. President Biden did not mention them in the statement he released two hours ago thanking Michigan voters. On the Republican side Donald Trump is celebrating a win over his last Republican challengers standing Nikki Haley. We are seeing about a 42-point margin of victory. Looking ahead to the general election, Trump said we win Michigan we win the whole thing that Haley told CNN's Dana Bash She's staying in the Republican race and looking forward to Super Tuesday. Now just one week away. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) NIKKI HALEY (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We've only seen a handful of states vote. I mean, look, I've said this before, as much as the media wants to jump ahead, we're taking this one state one day at a time. That's what this is about. America is blessed to be a democracy. Let people vote. Now in the next week, we're going to watch 20 states and territories vote. Let's let that happen. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Jeff Zeleny reports from Dearborn.JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: President Joe Biden easily winning the Michigan primary on Tuesday, but not dispatching with his biggest opposition. And that is the protest vote to his handling of Israel's war in Gaza. Here in Michigan, which is the heart of the Arab American population center in the U.S. as well as the Muslim-American population center here in Dearborn. There was a significant protest vote because of how the President has handled this war. They have been calling for the President to demand a ceasefire that has not happened. So, there was an uncommitted movement that reached out over the last three weeks or so that urged Michigan voters to check uncommitted on the ballot. Now, tens of thousands of Michigan voters did just that. Of course, many, many more voted for President Biden, but the question is, with Michigan being such a competitive battleground, given the fact that Donald Trump also won easily on Tuesday night. Where does this go moving forward? Now, Michigan leaders vowed to take this to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, saying that will take the anti-war movement to the streets. There is no doubt that is going to be one of the soundtracks of this presidential campaign, the president's handling of Israel's war in Gaza. Michigan, of course, is so critical on the road to the White House. The President can barely spare any votes here. He's already down in the polls. So, the question going out of this, is there a policy change that can win back some of these voters? The voters we talked to said that they were simply doing that registering a protest vote, they're hoping the White House listens. So as this policy evolves as the situation on the ground there evolves, this dynamic could certainly change but it is a victory for President Biden, but certainly a sign of complications and vulnerabilities to come.

In each of the last three Democratic presidential primaries there's been an uncommitted vote that's exceeded 20,000. So, the Listen to Michigan campaign in setting its goal at 10,000 was already establishing kind of an artificially low bar. 48,000, which is the most recent number I've seen who voted uncommitted is non-trivial certainly.But Biden did win the state in 2020 by about 154,000. Plus, the actual percentage of uncommitted this year actually equals out to about the same who voted uncommitted in 2012, even though the numbers look inflated because overall, turnout is higher. I think a certain fraction of uncommitted vote will also turn out for Biden in November. This is just symbolism. So, I do think that these defections are concerned for Biden, but Biden's prospects in Michigan and similar states, I believe, are going to hinge much more on wider demographics.",

I think the main issue of who wins Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio, Michigan, comes down to who appeals to large pivotal constituencies.Blue collar workers, suburban women, et cetera. That's where general elections are won and lost. And so, I do think that the Biden administration and Trump's campaign at the same time has to keep their eye on the ball here, and they need to focus on sort of what is most likely to drive the boat.",

There is a certain fraction of Republicans who are turned off by Trump as their nominee. And for them, Haley is almost a protest vote of their own. But it's not enough to make this race competitive and momentum is likely to push some of Trumps vote totals even higher in Super Tuesday states where the composition of the voting base is much more MAGA.Haley's clearly hoping that Trump's legal challenges will catch up to him. Now, this is a concern for Trump. We saw it in South Carolina as well, that there's a certain fraction that is just hauled out. But by and large, you know, that that vote probably is unattainable.

It was -- gates where there's a strong independent streak and then in South Carolina where it was her home state.But, you know, she's put up a fight for Donald Trump. I think a lot of people, especially Democrats are going to respect that. But at the end of the day, I'm not sure how much she has achieved except -- in so far, she's proven that there never was sort of a sizable anti-Trump vote in the Republican Party. There was always this theory that voters wanted the Trump like that they wanted Trump without the drama. I think that they wanted Trump specifically and they wanted Trump Ultra. None of that's changed. So, we're headed toward Joe Biden versus Donald Trump rematch. Not many Americans are enthusiastic about it. But that's the reality.",

Here, more than 4,400 feet above sea level, where snow is disappearing fast, people are questioning how much longer skiing can go on. This year, the influence of El Nino means temperatures have been even higher than usual. Normally, on a Sunday in February, you'd have 6,000 people skiing on these slopes.
