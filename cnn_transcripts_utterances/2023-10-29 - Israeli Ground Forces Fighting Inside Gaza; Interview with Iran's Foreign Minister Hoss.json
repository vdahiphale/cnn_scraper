I'm Bianna Golodryga filling in for Fareed Zakaria today and we are coming live from New York.Today on the program, I have an interview with Iran's foreign minister who warned this week that if the attacks in Gaza continue, America will not be spared. I asked him where Iran's threats stands now, how close the Middle East may be to a much wider war, and what Iran's role was in Hamas' October 7th attack. And how are the Israeli people feeling as the country launches its second stage of war. I'll ask top Israeli anchor Yonit Levi. Then for one brief shining moment, Sam Bankman-Fried was a crypto mega billionaire, on the subject of a ton of buzz, but then it all collapsed. This week he took the stand in his federal fraud trial. The great writer Michael Lewis was by Bankman's side to witness his rise and fall, and tells Fareed the fascinating tale. Yesterday, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the war on Hamas his nation's second independence war and warned that it would be long. Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross has called the humanitarian situation in Gaza a, quote, \"catastrophic failing that the world must not tolerate.\" CNN's Sara Sidner joins me live now from Tel Aviv with the very latest. So, Sara, what more are you learning about this expanded operation into Gaza?",

And he really sort of frame this as an existential threat to the survival of Israel, and has said that the next phase of the war is happening. What you're seeing is not a huge ground invasion but a small one. You are seeing soldiers are in Gaza, Israeli soldiers in Gaza as we speak.We have also seen the volley of airstrikes that have been going on there in Gaza with devastating effect. We have also seen plenty of rockets that have come over. They come over daily, really. Tel Aviv is not used to getting this number of rockets or rockets at all. It is more rare here than it is along the border in places like Ashkelon and Ashdod and Sderot. But now it has become a regular occurrence that rockets continue to fly over Tel Aviv here. The thing that Israel has of course is the Iron Dome that knocks those out. But we have -- really, we've been seeing just an enormous amount of fire power inside of Gaza and on the perimeter as there is tank fire. We are hearing from our reporters there as well that there is small arms fire that has been going off over the past 24 hours, and of course those airstrikes which is causing certainly a devastation there in Gaza, and a lot of death including a lot of civilians, men and women and children and babies. But here in Israel there is also a big call by those who have hostages still in Gaza. They are demanding to have some answers, to know exactly whether or not this new phase of the war is going to put their loved ones there in danger. They met with the prime minister and defense minister Yolav Gallant and, you know, really demanded that their hostages, that their family members be put as a priority. And they were promised that they were a priority to the Israeli government. But since then, you know, we have seen so many strikes. There was just a lot of fear on the part of those with family members that are in Gaza in those tunnels that they just will not be able to make it out alive if this continues the way it does before a negotiation is able to get them out -- Bianna.",

Now the strikes were a response to a series of attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria from Iran's proxies since the war began. Earlier that day Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian seemed to threaten the U.S. in a speech at the U.N., saying that America, quote, \"wouldn't be spared from the fire if the war in Gaza continued.\" I sat down with him on Thursday afternoon to ask him about that threat but I began the interview with what began this war in the first place, the October 7th Hamas attack.

In the past month, Netanyahu was involved in very radical, extremist actions and also desecrated the Al Aqsa Mosque, and even disrespected the Christians. And also Jewish settlements in the West Bank. For 16 years Gaza is a small area, is under total human blockade. When you treat a nation like this, they believe it is their right to defend their motherland. You see, I would like to emphasize we are opposed to the killing, killing of the civilians.

You see, two weeks ago I was in Iraq, also in Syria and Lebanon, I could see up close and personal that the people of the region, they are very sensitive about the developments in the Palestine.

On the 7th of October, in the afternoon, the countries in which Israel has embassies, it is what happened to their embassies by the people in those countries. You know, this is the source of evil. You see Israel, it is just a source of insecurity. They have assassinated our nuclear scientists in our streets. They don't care about the security of the region.

So I asked Yonit Levi to join me. She is one of Israel's most recognizable people, a top anchor who joins us from her news channel N12.Yonit, thank you so much for taking the time in your busy schedule to join us today. As we noted, we are now two days into what Prime Minister Netanyahu described as the next phase of this operation. He says that he has the full backing of the government going into this stage. How are the Israeli people feeling about it now? YONIT LEVI, ANCHOR, CHANNEL 12 NEWS ISRAEL: Well, I mean, Bianna, as you mentioned, it's been three weeks and a day. The ground incursion, the IDF's ground incursion into Gaza has started, and this is a very complicated thing to achieve. First, because there are 230 hostages, Israeli hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. The Red Cross hasn't seen them. Their families don't know their condition. So the Israeli government wants and thinks that this is a tactic to pressure Hamas into somehow a deal to release these hostages, and of course the bigger goal or the biggest goal by the Israeli government set is to topple Hamas and to dismantle its abilities to do this again. I think it's important to say Israelis are still very much in this. They are reeling from the worst terror attack that they have ever suffered. Every day more and more information is coming out. You know, I've just spoken to sources telling me that there are still 100 Israeli bodies that haven't been identified. Just so you let that sink in for a minute on what that means what has been done to these people before death or after. I mean, this is where we are. We are -- the whole public is, you know, watching this very, very closely. They're concerned about the hostages and also about what the next steps of this war will look like.",

We need to mention that this, of course, that this war that has been forced upon us happened when Israeli society was already very divided over the judicial overhaul, the protests we've seen this over the last couple of months.So, on the one hand, you have the people reminding Netanyahu that he was warned by his security officials, by the defense establishment, that our enemies might see this as a moment to strike Israel because of what they perceive as weakness. He, on the other hand, and his supporters, by the way in a tweet he has since then retracted and say, I did not have a specific alert to what Hamas intended to do on October 7th. All of this, Bianna, just a prelude to what we will see when this war is over. The arguments or the questions, who knew what, what kind of policy vis-a-vis Hamas was the prominent policy by the government. But again, I think that many in Israel kind of feel that this is the moment to try, if this -- we're able to do that, try and come together because the external threat is bigger than anything else that is happening right now.",

And I know his popularity soared.I'm just wondering if there is concern now given the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding in Gaza and the continued pressure from other countries for a cease-fire or a halt in operations, if there is a concern that perhaps some of that would be appear to be unconditional support from the U.S. may fade at some point?",

And Israeli felt like he got us. He understood how devastating this massacre was and how Israelis feel.It is not only, by the way, the support of aircraft carriers or anything like that. There are military experts and generals helping Israel with the guidance of how do you fight this kind of war against terror in a densely populated area. There are many experienced American generals in Fallujah or Mosul, places like that. So, I think, that there is -- there might be some sort of difference between how patient the Biden administration is and how patient the rest of the world is to what we are seeing in Gaza. I think that what Israelis feel, from the Israeli point of view, again, the world has moved on quite quickly from showing very, very brief empathy to what we are still going through to in many cases even blaming Israel for what has happened. And I think that many Israelis feel like their case isn't clear enough, maybe hasn't been clear enough for years. But how do you wage this war against a terror organization that is so cynical that it starts by murdering your own children and then hides under their population not at all caring if they are hurt? So, it is a very difficult thing to maneuver. And I think that Israelis on one hand do feel like the stopwatch has begun to run its course. Israel always has a very short window but are also kind of angry, by the fact, that there is a stopwatch to begin with because they feel like they have been through something that should never happen again. And, of course, anyone who knows anything about Jewish history knows that those words never again have -- are imbued with a lot of meaning and tragedy.",

I mean, even his lawyers aren't disputing this, that crypto was unusual, in that unlike say on the stock exchange, crypto actually is -- crypto exchanges serve as the custodians. So, if you own crypto at FTX, you kept your money at FTX as if it were a bank. And they were meant to keep your crypto in cold storage like it was just supposed to be there and customers would have thought that was true. And what was true instead was that money was largely inside of Sam Bankman-Fried's private hedge fund, Alameda Research. So, everybody agrees with that. Where it gets complicated is the how and the why and the intent. And this is where it gets a little messy. The bulk of the money gets -- how it gets there is in the beginning banks wouldn't open accounts for FTX. Not because FTX was an illegal thing but because they just didn't want to be associated with crypto. They had opened accounts for Alameda Research because Alameda Research is sort of like -- tricked them into thinking this wasn't crypto. And so, in order to get your fiat currency, your dollars and your yen and your euros on the FTX, you had to send it to an account in Alameda Research and it just stayed there. Even after later on FTX gets bank accounts it's pulled there and never gets moved. What I found, just from the point of view of storytelling is that if you took -- if you look at this thing from -- not just Sam's point of view, but point of view of the people who work for him, point of view of people outside of the firm, that you might come out with different answers. Different readers might conclude different things about the intentions of Sam Bankman-Fried. I think some of the readers would lynch him. I think the others might think, this guy is just weird enough so that this was maybe more complicated than just pure theft.",

But I was thinking right from the start, the day I meet Sam Bankman-Fried, the day he starts telling me this story about how 18 months ago he had zero dollars and now he has $22 billion and he's kind of bemused by it, and the world is organizing itself around this pile of money.
