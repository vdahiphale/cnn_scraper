Wall Street clocked off at lunchtime for the Thanksgiving weekend,and the Dow managed to carve out some modest gains closing up about half a percent or 150 points there. Those are the markets and these are the main events: NATO pledges to step up aid to Ukraine as Kyiv races to restore power following Russian strikes. Rising prices don't seem to be holding back US shoppers with early numbers showing record breaking Black Friday sales. And Adidas says that it plans to investigate allegations of misconduct against Kanye West. Live from New York It is Friday, November 25th. I'm Rahel Solomon, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, Russia is trying to weaponize winter. That warning from NATO Chief Jens Stoltenberg as hundreds of thousands remain without power in the Ukrainian capital. Stoltenberg is calling on allies to step up support and also slamming Russia's tactics. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO SECRETARY-GENERAL:  What we see now is that President Putin is trying to weaponize winter by indiscriminate and deliberate attacks on cities, on civilian infrastructure. He tries to deprive the Ukrainians of gas heating water, and this just demonstrates once again the brutality of this war. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the Ukrainians are saying that to get their entire network back to where it should be, it will take a year or two. There simply aren't the products in the world that they can actually bring in, a lot of switching stations and other highly technical stuff needs to be built, bespoke if you like. They're combing the world in their words, trying to find the equipment but in the meantime, they can try and get by. They can get by with additional generating capacity of the still being donated by the European Union and also by switching lines and trying to get their nuclear power stations working effectively. But of course, every time the network is attacked, the nuclear power stations are disconnected very often from that network. That means the cooling system has to go into diesel generators, and they become vulnerable to meltdown in and of themselves since the diesel generators are on site and vulnerable themselves to attack, break down, or running out of fuel. So that is the sort of challenge that they face in the short term here in Ukraine, and the same time Ukrainians are saying to NATO, and others well, of course, Putin is weaponizing winters. It is what Russia does. Winter is one of its major defensive and sometimes offensive cards that it can play. Now, it is obviously Putin's aim here to go after the civilian population, try to break the resolve of the civilian population, puts so much pressure on the population, that it weakens the resolve to prosecute the war effort on the ground. The Ukrainians are insisting that's not going to happen, that they'll get through the winter by hook or by crook. They are also saying that they need those more modern surface-to-air missiles, anti-missile missile systems to protect themselves against what they know, will -- be excuse me -- more of these swarm attacks against their energy infrastructure.",

There has been somewhat a degree ofexaggeration or dooms saying from the UN and others saying, in the worst case scenario that it could be the worst winter since the World War Two, but at the moment, the weather isn't that bad. Efforts at repair are remarkably quick. They are even talking about having Kherson connected to the national grid, perhaps even by tomorrow. That's nothing short of a technological miracle in many ways, since Kherson was -- the connections to the to the rest of the country were broken deliberately by the Russians, as was its power generating capacity. So just getting it connected to a national network is no mean feat. The conditions are muddy, wet, rainy, they're not pleasant, but they're a long way off winter, and that is what Russia is really working towards, Rahel, it is a steady degradation of the capacity here. They know that they won't be able to do it all at once, but if they break enough parts of the network enough times, the Russian argument will be that in the end, they actually break the whole system.",

The crowds have not led up all day and take my word for it, inside the store, you cannot move. It is really, really crowded. Today is Black Friday, the unofficial start to the Holiday shopping season, and it is expected to be one of the biggest shopping days of the year with 115 million people across the country shopping with more than half, shopping in store, 67 percent. And you mentioned some of that online spend for Thanksgiving. On Thanksgiving, these numbers are eye-popping. Adobe Analytics says that $5.2 billion was spent online. And keep in mind, this is when people were supposed to be eating their turkeys. So, I did speak with shoppers as well about the tone and the feeling of this year's shopping experience. And, you know, let's talk about the elephant in the room, inflation, and it is really forefront on the minds of shoppers, and they are telling me that there's a new strategy that they have to really think about how inflation is cutting into their wallet, so they have to stick to their budgets and really pay attention to those discounts and decide what presents to buy based on what those discounts are. Still the National Retail Federation is pretty upbeat about how the Holiday shopping season could wind up. They're saying that spending could increase by eight percent over last year, adding up to a total of $940 billion to $960 billion, and I'm talking about November and December spending -- Rahel.",

Last week, its chief executive lowered his outlook for the rest of the year blaming inflation and rising interest rates and international shoppers are planning to spend less this year. According to Boston Consulting Group, shoppers across Europe are planning on spending up to 18 percent less on Black Friday than they did in 2021. Jerry Storch is the former CEO of Toys R' Us and the founder of Storch Advisors. Good to have you. So Jerry, Black Friday, does it still mean the same as it used to? Because it seems like at least from my perspective, there have been Black Friday deals for weeks now. JERRY STORCH, FORMER CEO OF TOYS R' US, FOUNDER OF STORCH ADVISORS:  Hey, you know, there have been Black Friday deals since July, but most retailers started in earnest in early October calling all the sales Black Friday. The term has been so watered down, it is really just a buzzword, not a particular day. And almost every item that's on sale today was available for the same price, starting Sunday of this week, because the entire week most retailers ran one ad for the whole week. In the old days, there used to be one ad on Sunday, and another ad on Thanksgiving Day that started Black Friday. They didn't run that ad this year, it is the same ad all the way through. So, it is being spread like jam or jelly on a piece of toast, and there is no more jam or jelly if you just keep spreading it.",

Who remembers that? Who even knows, you know? But I'm getting reports from all over the country that it's a very sluggish Day sales wise, is less than people expected in the stores, bricks and mortar. Again, all these deals have been available online. It may not say what's going to happen for the whole season. And again, many of these sales have already occurred earlier in the season. So we'll see what happens. At the end of the day, Black Friday is nothing like it used to be used to be. It used to be mob to mob, walls of people starting with giant lines outside the store the night before, and none of that happened this year. You know, Macy's in Herald Square, hey, that's a one of a kind store. Goodness knows, again, I suspect they really aren't going to do that great at the end of the day. But putting that aside, because I don't have their numbers, the reports from all over the country from Target and Walmart, from everybody is -- and Best Buy, there haven't been the lines there were you know, pre pandemic.

We can look at the report, what you see is sales were up year-over-year, month-over-month, but they weren't up as much in most categories as inflation. So you're actually losing ground versus inflation. And the biggest growth rates were in necessities, like in groceries. So you look at growing groceries, health and beauty care. The items people have to buy first, gasoline is up, too. So that's where the money has been spent. There's little leftover in many consumer wallets for the optional goods like apparel, for example. And so some retailers reported earlier in the week and the socks went up -- stocks went up. That's because they did better than expected.

It's going the other way,cutting interest rates by one and a half percent on Thursday to nine percent. It's the fourth month in a row that the central bank has dropped rates. And it's doing so on the demands of President Erdogan who favors lower rates as part of a strategy to encourage growth. Mr. Erdogan believes that this path will lead to lower inflation despite historic evidence to the contrary. The results so far, well, Turkey's inflation rate is now above 85 percent. And at the same time, the value of the lira has tumbled against the U.S. dollar. Selva Demi Rob is a professor of economics at Koc University and a former economist at the Federal Reserve Board. And she joins me now from Istanbul. Selva, good to have you. So walk me through one just this logic, because at a time when central banks including the Federal Reserve had been hiking rates, I think the fed has raised rates about 375 basis points since March. And Turkey, it's the opposite. Help me understand the logic.",

But it's important to sustainable growth and in the absence of price stability, you cannot really have sustainable growth.

With this monetary transmission. usually, when Central Bank's change interest rates in one direction, they hope that market interest rates will follow. So when the fed tightens, long-term interest rates go up. When the Turkish central bank cuts interest rates, long term interest, interest rates actually go up, they don't go down. So, it shows that this unorthodox policy, the transmission from the central bank to the markets is not working, then they come up with macro prudential tools, which is like making the banks buy more government bonds as part of the reserve requirements, which increases the demand for bonds and lowers interest rates. So when monetary policy is not working, you kind of interfere with the free market mechanism and generate demand in order to lower interest rates on bonds and the rest of the markets.",

And when you are late in achievingprice stability, unfortunately, you have to be more hawkish and it will hurt when you become hawkish. So there's a recession concerned. But when you look at the inflation expectations, I mean, long term, like five-year inflation expectations actually never exceeded the target too much. It wasn't really more than three percentage points. And if you look at the short-term interest rate inflation expectations, we see that they did start to come down with the feds tightening cycles. So the fed I mean, compared to let's say, Turkish Central Bank is still a much more independent and credible central bank. Yes, they made a mistake in studying their tightening cycle, and they are paying the price for it. But in the end, the markets do by that when they see a central bank that admits its mistake, and then tries to correct it, then they give credit to the central bank and inflation expectations, even in the short term are gradually starting to come down towards the target. So it still has a long way to go. And therefore, there might be a recession. But I think inflation expectations will be anchored because that's the game. That's what the fed will do.
