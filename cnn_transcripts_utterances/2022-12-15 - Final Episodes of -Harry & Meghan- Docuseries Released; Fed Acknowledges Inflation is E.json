Some 50 reports of tornadoes across the U.S. south and as the severe weather moves east, a new tornado watch is in place for Alabama, Georgia and Florida.At least three people are dead and multiple injuries after several tornadoes tore across Louisiana. Officials are telling residents in hard-hit areas to stay indoors until crews can clean up the damage. And we're learning more about the challenges faced by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex while deciding to give up their senior Royal duties. It's all part of the record-breaking Netflix documentary which premiered its final three episodes earlier today. And CNN's Anna Stewart joins me now live from London. Good morning to you again, Anna. You've had more time now to view the three new episodes that dropped just last hour. What are the headlines?",

Appreciate it.Well, later today the U.S. Senate could vote on a bill that would fund the government for another week. That's after the House passed a so- called stop-gap measure to avert a government shutdown on Friday. This bill, which is just a quick fix, was mostly pushed through by the Democrats with just nine Republicans crossing party lines. And it gives negotiators more time to hammer out a broader, full year deal with new spending levels. On Tuesday they announced there was an agreement on the framework. Most of the disagreements are over how much money should be spent on non-defense domestic priorities. Well, U.S. financial markets are looking to rebound from a disappointing performance on Wednesday. But right now, the futures look a little bleak, all in negative territory there. Stocks fell after the U.S. Federal Reserve announced a half point interest rate hike. The Dow closed down .4 of a percent. The Nasdaq fell 3/4 of a percent. More now on the Fed decision from CNN's Matt Egan. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

      "sentences": "Rosemary, the Fed is still pumping tough medicine into this economy trying to get inflation back under control. It's just lowering the dosage of that medicine a bit. After four straight rate hikes of 75 basis points, the Fed is now raising interest rates by 50 basis points. That is an acknowledgment that inflation is cooling off, that the Fed's medicine is working. But the Fed is making clear that their job is not nearly done here yet.In the Fed's statement they said that inflation remains, quote, elevated. And during the press conference Fed chair Jerome Powell, he said it's going to take substantially more evidence to gain confidence that inflation really is on a sustained downward path. So, no victory laps from the Fed and I think that makes sense. Seven percent inflation is of course better than the 9 percent inflation from earlier this year, but it's still 7 percent inflation. That's still triple the Fed's target. And so, Fed officials are penciling in even more rate hikes next year. They see their fed target range going up by 75 basis points next year. That means even higher borrowing costs. Mortgage rates, don't forget, recently hit 20-year highs. Credit card rates are at record highs. They could go even higher next year. This also means that the Fed is going to be putting even more downward pressure on this economy slowing it down trying to get inflation under control. Now on that front the Fed darkened its economic projections for next year. They now see near zero GDP growth for 2023. They bumped up their inflation forecast and they see unemployment going from a very low level from 3.7 percent today to 4.6 percent next year. Now that's not high overall but it does still translate to a loss of roughly 1.6 million jobs. Another reminder, I think, of the real pain here caused by not just high inflation but the war on high inflation from the Federal Reserve. Rosemary, the hope remains that inflation is going to cool off enough in the coming months to allow the Fed to stop raising interest rates before it causes a recession. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
