She's been in this game, for a very long time. It's a little bit different from first lady, Michelle Obama, who married someone, who was not in public life, when they first got together. Jill Biden has been in this for a while. But it also underscores the problem for them. Here they are, she's on a trip, visiting countries, in Africa. The posture that this administration has had towards Africa is radically different than the prior administration. But it's a conversation that can't be had.
