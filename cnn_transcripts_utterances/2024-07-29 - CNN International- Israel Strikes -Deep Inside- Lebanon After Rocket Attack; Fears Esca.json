      "sentences": "Well, I just returned from Majdal Shams, a Syrian Druze community not far from the Israel-Lebanon border that has been absolutely devastated by this rocket attack over the weekend, which Israel says Hezbollah is responsible for. 12 children are dead as a result of this strike. Many of them were simply playing soccer on a soccer field in the center of that town. And one of the most devastating aspects of this is just how close they were to a bomb shelter. Just a few yards away from that bomb shelter is where this rocket hit. But, there simply wasn't enough time for all of these children to get into that bomb shelter, as the sirens went off just seconds before that rocket made its devastating impact.Yesterday, we spent time with the families of some of those children who were killed, one father, who is still just trying to piece together how this could have happened, and his anger, of course, at Hezbollah, that Lebanese militant group for this strike. Now, the question now is, how the Israeli government, the Israeli military will respond to this strike? We know that last night, the Israeli Prime Minister held a security consultation with his top generals and foreign policy, national security advisors, and then he met with his political and security cabinet, which authorized him as well as the Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant to decide effectively when, where and how Israel will strike back. And so, it is not clear yet how soon the Israeli response to this strike will come. But, it is clear that it will come. The question now in this entire region is to what extent that Israeli response could potentially escalate things even further. There have been fears for a long time now that a strike like the one we saw over the weekend, whether in northern Israel, the Golan Heights, or in Lebanon, could -- one in which there would be a number of civilians dead, including children, like in this instance, could potentially set off that broader regional war, could turn this long simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah into an all-out war. And so now, everyone is waiting on pins and needles to see what the Israeli response will be, and whether or not it will trigger that worst case scenario that many had been fearing.",

Now, yesterday, we heard from a senior media adviser to Hezbollah that the group is in a state of mobilization that some of their military posts have been evacuated in anticipation of some sort of larger than usual Israeli strike.Now, just a little while ago, I got off the phone with Lebanon's caretaker Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib, who told me that through diplomatic context they had received assurances that the Israeli response would be, in his words, limited, and he said that they were taking --assuming that what that means is that Beirut will not be struck, the airport will not be struck, and particularly the southern suburbs of Beirut, where many of the leaders of Hezbollah are believed to be based. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has made it clear that if those areas are targeted, Hezbollah would respond to in kind toward Israel. So, there is a sense growing but still slight that perhaps a full-on regional war can be avoided. But, despite that, certainly, we are seeing that, for instance, Lufthansa, the German airline, has suspended all flights to Lebanon until the fifth of August. Air France has suspended all flights today and tomorrow to Beirut. Germany and Italy have told their nationals to leave Lebanon as quickly as possible. And the Assistant U.S. Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, who is in Lebanon at the moment, put out a video statement on X or Twitter, saying that people -- Americans in Lebanon should leave before the crisis begins. Now that there is communications and some airlines continued to function, she warned those American nationals who want to stay in Lebanon despite the situation that they should be prepared to shelter in place, she said, for a very long time.

Russia and China sent their congratulations to the strongman leader after Sunday's ballot, while the U.S. expressed serious concerns that the results were fair, and European nations also voiced skepticism. According to Venezuela's government-controlled Electoral Council, Mr. Maduro one more than 51 percent of the vote. The opposition is rejecting that number. It says Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia won with 70 percent of the vote. Stefano Pozzebon is joining me now live in Caracas with more. Hi, there, Stefano.

And instead, we've seen that the Electoral Council, which, as you said that, is closely aligned with the Maduro government, proclaimed in the middle of the night Maduro as the winner, to the astonishment of the world there. The United States have not actually been coming out with the harshest words. Many countries in Latin America, from Chile, to Uruguay, Peru and Costa Rica are already calling these elections a blatant fraud and they said that they are not recognizing these results. The U.S. has instead only short of that measure, saying that they urge caution and they would like a full audit of the results proclaimed yesterday by the Electoral Council. [08:10:00] I think, Amara, that now the ball is back onto the opposition's field. They need to decide whether they will take to the streets and protest to sort of like enforce those results, or they will -- they could publish the data and the numbers that they handle. We know that the opposition deployed an operation of electoral witnesses in most of the more than 30,000 voting centers here in Venezuela over the last 24 hours to try monitor the vote and report as many irregularities as they could. And of course, a lot of pressure and a lot of scrutiny on how the international community will react. Two countries that have not taken up positions just yet are Brazil and Colombia. These are the two biggest diplomatic power when it comes to the Latin American left.

They contradict exit polls. They contradict what we saw on the street. And they contradict what the evidence shows in the few cases that the opposition did have access to the electoral ballot results. And they were there in the large majority of voting centers. So, it's not that. There was no witnesses there to see what was actually happening. So, the question now is, what will the international community to do with this?

The local SWAT team is speaking out. Plus, the park fire in California is already the seventh largest in the state's history. The man accused of starting it is expected in court Monday. We'll have more on that. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) WALKER: The local SWAT team that made up part of the security detail at Donald Trump's Pennsylvania rally is speaking out. Text messages obtained by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley show that officers had noted the presence of the gunman 90 minutes before he opened fire, and they were discussing him by phone. One officer even took a picture of Thomas Matthew Crooks before losing track of him. Their comments came in a story first reported by The New York Times. Members of the team told ABC News, they were supposed to have a face-to-face briefing with the Secret Service but that never happened. Let's bring in Zachary Cohen, who has been following the story from Washington. That seems like a huge security fail.

It's still in very steep terrain, difficult areas to get to.But, there are two things that really helped over the weekend. One, the weather, so, lower temperatures, some cloud cover. That really helped these firefighters. And then, the other thing is the resources. We now have about 4,700 people on the ground battling these flames. So, they've been able to come and do assessments. You mentioned 100 structures already destroyed. There is people that are going essentially door-to-door, not really door-to-door because, of course, of the destruction, but really going one by one to make sure and to see what the destruction is. And then the other thing that firefighters told me is that they were able to have this direct attack on the flames, and that's what helped get that containment from zero percent to 12 percent. It's really been the first time that we hear optimism from firefighters. And they also told me that the priority is getting people back into their homes. They're very sensitive and are very aware of what the people here in Butte County have lived through. In 2018, they went through the deadliest fire in California history. And so, they know that this is something that's difficult and traumatic for a lot of the people in this county. And so, they're doing everything they can to get them back into their homes, and of course, to continue to bring that containment number up.

But, as you note, Amara, this does face a steep, uphill battle, and it has really little chances of going anywhere. But still, the President has cast this as a way of reforming the Supreme Court and essentially restoring trust and accountability in it.Now, his proposals include, for example, a constitutional amendment stripping the President of immunity of crimes committed while in office, also term limits for justices who serve a lifetime, and then to bringing a code of contact. Now, bringing all of this together would amount to seismic changes for the way the Supreme Court operates, and again, the way it's been described by the White House is an attempt to restore that trust and accountability not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the presidency. Now, we also moments ago got a statement from the Vice President. She says that this would have -- it would restore competence in the court, strengthen our democracy, and ensure no one is above the law. The Vice President also says in her statement, there is, quote, \"a clear crisis of competence facing the Supreme Court.\" Now, this has been a cornerstone of the campaign, of the Biden campaign and now the Harris campaign moving forward, particularly amid all of those controversial rulings from the court. But, even as they lay this out, the reality here is that it would include or require a congressional approval as well as that constitutional amendment I mentioned, a ratification of 38 states. That is a complicated process, a difficult one, and especially with a divided Congress unlikely that it would pass muster. But, the President is set to announce this in Austin, Texas, later this afternoon, in an event commemorating the Civil Rights Act. So, the President making clear here his take on the Supreme Court on what the changes should be to reform the court, even if it's an uphill battle to actually get it approved.",
