G7 leaders rally around Ukraine as they meet in Japan. An exclusive interview with the Turkish president. If re-elected, he'll stick with his unorthodox economic policy. And the world's richest man looks for a successor among his children. Coming to you live from New York. It is Friday, May 19th. I'm Zain Asher, in for Richard Quest, and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. Good evening. Tonight, the G7 is strengthening its military support for Ukraine as it takes aim at Russian diamonds. Leaders of the world's richest democracies began their meeting in Hiroshima earlier. They pledged to stop exporting anything to Russia that would help in its war in Ukraine, and the US said it would support training Ukrainians on F-16 fighter jets. Ukrainian president, Zelenskyy is expected to join the meeting this weekend. Marc Stewart is at the G7 in Hiroshima. We've also got Nic Robertson, standing by for us in eastern Ukraine. Nic, as I just mentioned, one of the biggest headlines to come out of the G7 so far is really this idea that Western allies now support sending F-16s to Ukraine, something that Zelenskyy case asked for, for many months. They probably won't arrive in time for the counteroffensive, but just walk us through how much of a game changer this is going to be on the battlefield.",

      "sentences": "Ultimately, once the training has been accomplished and once the planes are found and put intoUkrainian hands, they will make a difference. There's been a narrative hear that until Ukraine has better air defenses, if you give them these fighter aircraft, then there's a real possibility that Ukraine would use them, and the Russians would shoot them down. So, it's a sort of you're creating a system, an air defense system that these aircraft can operate them. So you can't get too far ahead of yourselves militarily. That's what people have been saying. But in parallel to this ongoing discussion about when Ukraine can have the F-16s and really, it is President Biden announcing that he will support this coalition of countries that will help train Ukrainian pilots and the United States won't stop. Countries like Denmark, like Norway, like the Netherlands, all of whom have F-16s and potentially could donate them to Ukraine. The United States won't get in the way. So, they're not going to be available in the short term, even though we know that the British back in February said that they would begin some F-16 fighter aircraft training for Ukraine's fighter pilots. The difference that they will make on the frontline is unlike the planes that the Ukrainians have right now, these aircraft don't have to get so close to the Russian forces to fire their missiles, which automatically makes them safer. And that's a fundamental difference. They can sort of look over the horizon better. They have better technology. They will be able to use the more sophisticated weapon systems that NATO is providing Ukraine. You know, the counteroffensive, it has to be said has been much talked about. There are no details on when and where it will be launched. It might be next week. It might be even a few months away. The concern is if the fight gets bogged down in this counteroffensive this summer or this fall, then it could stall, and the initiative will be lost. And that would be to Russia's advantage, because it will reinforce its side more with more men, better trained, better equipment. So if the fighter aircraft can come into play before the end of this year, a big aspiration, Ukraine will hope to be able to press the advantage and take back all the territory that they want. That's a big ask, and it's perhaps too much for this year.",

You know, when tanks were committed and tanks were the last big thing on the on the Ukrainian agenda, big ticket item that they wanted, and when they were committed, not so many came forward, barely a hundred and Ukraine had said they thought they would need about 400. So I think Zelenskyy is going to, as his advisers say, give a clear assessment of what they need, make a clear case and clear arguments about the situation and be able to do that face-to-face. So the need for more ammunition is a big thing still for the Ukrainian forces. You know, frontline officers here tell us that they could advance more and do more if they had more ammunition, it would be relatively easy. They just don't have it. They are stockpiling it for the big counter offensive in other areas, that is not entirely clear, but I think this is what Zelenskyy will try to communicate that even despite, you know the 1,550 armored fighting vehicles they've got from NATO allies, and the coming soonish of the F-16s, it doesn't guarantee a victory. And I think that's the sense that you get here at the frontlines, that nothing in this fight is guaranteed. And Zelenskyy will want to, I think reinforce that message that the country really does need the help. It is not crying wolf, he is not asking for too much. He is asking for the bare minimum to get the job done.",

Oftentimes, we see them make some progress, people get really optimistic, and then things either kind of break down, or everyone kind of needs to take some time apart, and so we're kind of at that point. So what will be key moving forward is if and when they come back together. Both sides still understand that a negotiated deal is the best way out of this particular situation. Now, they've got to come together and figure something out and we are told that they have spent the last several days really laying out what their positions are, of course, just to remind everyone, the White House and Democrats just want to raise the debt ceiling, that's all. Republicans -- the House Republicans want spending cuts attached to that. And they have some leverage in the sense that they run the House, and they've got to have that support to get anything through the House of Representatives. So that is the kind of the big picture right now. What's in the details is where will they make that deal? We've been told that there are some issues where they feel like they can make some -- they can cover some common ground, potentially work requirements around some social programs, calling back some unused COVID money, potentially doing something called permitting reform. So these are kind of the things that they're circling around right now. But at this point, Zain, the discussions, they're not anticipating any further discussions today.

In an exclusive interviewwith \"Connect the World's\" Becky Anderson, Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he plans to keep cutting interest rates though most central banks do the opposite when there is a period of high inflation. The results have been mixed. The Turkish lira crashed by more than 40 percent last year. Annual inflation has come down from 85 percent in October to 44 percent last month. Becky Anderson is in Istanbul for us and joins us live now. So of course, aside from foreign policy, Becky, one of the key issues that has loomed large over this election has of course, been the Turkish economy. Obviously, I mentioned how much the Turkish lira has plummeted, and also just the rising cost of living for a lot of ordinary Turkish citizens.

But it seems no change, if indeed, President Erdogan is to win this second round. Look, his main opponent has campaigned on a sort of ticket of fundamental change here in Turkey, fundamental change to the way this economy is run. Kemal Kilicdaroglu says that he would put the central bank back in the hands of central bankers; at present, it doesn't have that independence. Policy is run by the presidency. The opponent -- his opponent says that he would change that, and he wants to see a fundamental change to the way this country is run. He sees an erosion of democracy under President Erdogan and President Erdogan, of course has been in power here for more than 20 years and a creeping authoritarianism, which many people, many millions of people who voted for Kilicdaroglu says, you know, is exactly what is happening here. But look, the opposition candidate has lost his momentum and when I asked President Erdogan whether he was confident of a win on May the 28th, he told me he was, and you can see it. He genuinely thinks he can win this. And he has first passed the post, right? I mean, you know, it's two candidates at this stage. President Erdogan, and the opposition candidate and a further term for President Erdogan will be extremely consequential. What happens here in Turkey doesn't stay in Turkey. The decisions that are made here, don't stay here. Turkey has a huge influence on the global stage, not least, of course, as a NATO member with the current war in Ukraine going on.

And in this circumstance, what Montana has done is ban access to an entire speech platform rather than addressing narrowly the problem at hand. They could have taken a much more narrowly tailored approach. The Constitution requires them to take a more narrowly tailored approach. And so, it's pretty clear to me that Montana has stepped far beyond its authority, even assuming some of its concerns. And, you know, just to a certain degree, we agree some of its concerns are real and should be addressed.",

So, we do have precedent saying that this would not be -- that this is not that -- that this is not legal. But like even an additional -- in addition to the constitutional concerns, I'm not even sure how this ban could be implemented.

It's such an alarming global precedent lending legitimacy to authoritarian regimes that like to block access to U.S. platforms or prevent or it shut off the internet entirely when dissent begins within the -- within a country. The U.S. has been a leader in condemning that sort of cutting off of access to international communications platforms and we should not become part of the crowd that engages in censorship when we are -- when we have legitimate concerns about privacy.",
