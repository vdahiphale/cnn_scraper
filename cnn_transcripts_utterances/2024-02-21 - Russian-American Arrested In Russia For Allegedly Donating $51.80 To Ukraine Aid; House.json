A long-time enemy who survived being poisoned dies mysteriously in a Russian prison. A Russian pilot who defected to Ukraine shot dead in a parking garage in Spain, and that's just the most recent to run afoul of Vladimir Putin's Russia. Now, a 33-year-old woman, Ksenia Karelina, a Russian-American dual citizen, is now under arrest in Russia on charges of treason. Here she is celebrating her U.S. citizenship in 2021. Here she is photographed as a ballerina in New York City. Doesn't look much like someone who may have committed treason, does she? But the big question is, why was she arrested? Well, the number might surprise you. It's all over, apparently, $51.80. Think about that for a second, $51.80. That's how much she's accused of donating to a Ukrainian charity right here in the United States, according to a statement from her employer, a spa at a hotel in Beverly Hills. Now, Russia's Federal Security Service, the FSB, says that she was arrested for -- quote -- \"providing financial assistance to a foreign state in activities directed against Russia's security.\" Her boyfriend saying this to CNN tonight.

And yet if you look at the court documents, every year since 2010 right through 2023, he was admonished for not telling the truth, for perhaps fabricating. So, he played a role for them as far as criminal activities but not so much for the counterintelligence aspect which only came later as we saw the election interference which -- post 2016. Now, it's very likely that he has been working on behalf of Russian intelligence and, certainly, he would be an element of their misinformation campaign, but how much of what he's saying is now truth or lies to sort of save himself.

And that dodging came as Republicans on the House Oversight Committee spent more than eight hours hearing testimony from President Biden's brother, James Biden. Now, they say that Joe Biden never had any involvement in his business dealings. I'm talking about Congressman Jamie Raskin, who was the top Democrat on that committee. He joins me now. Congressman, thank you so much for being here. I mean, you were a part of this closed-door hearing today with the president's brother. What did you hear? REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD): Well, I heard the story of James Biden, who is the president's younger brother and a businessman, and also somebody who filled in with Joe Biden's family after he lost his wife and his infant. And so, he has been sort of an integral part of their family structure ever since tragedy struck. And he was very emphatic and categorical about it. Joe Biden had no involvement in any of his business ventures. Joe Biden received no profits from any of his business ventures. Joe Biden was not his partner, and he never asked Joe Biden nor did he ever receive from Joe Biden any official favors to benefit any of his businesses. He was totally clear about that. That, of course, basically reaffirmed everything that we'd heard for the last many months from all kinds of witnesses. [23:10:02] COATES: It strikes me that that testimony likely was expected, that there wasn't really, you know, a bombshell that would come out nor was it actually expected, but there has been a bit of a bombshell recently, and that's about this former FBI informant who is being charged with lying about the Biden dealings in Ukraine, and that's the same person that the Republicans seem to have built a lot of this entire impeachment inquiry on. The fact that he has been relied on, you say, is a reason to do away with the entire inquiry if there was ever reason to keep it. Do you -- do you think that his testimony or his statements that he has made in the past as an informant is reason enough to dispense with the inquiry?",

Um, he was the confidential human informant who asserted that Burisma had passed $5 million to Joe Biden and millions more to Hunter Biden. And that was the genesis of this whole wild goose chase, even though it was refuted and debunked by a dozen other witnesses, including, you know, the former president of Ukraine, Poroshenko, who said it was nonsense. The Republicans in the Senate couldn't find anything to substantiate these allegations. Even Lev Parnas, who's Rudy Giuliani's right-hand man, wrote a letter to Chairman Comer and to me saying, please, call this off. There's nothing there. I was sent out with Rudy Giuliani to try to find some substantiation for this claim and there's simply nothing there. He offered and insisted that he come and testify before the committee, but, of course, Comer and the gang didn't want to hear from him. So, now, we're getting a complete demolition of the theory going back to the original source of it. I'm not sure my friend, Jim Jordan, who's normally nimble on his feet, has been able to concoct any kind of excuse for where they are now.

I don't think in any way, shape or form, or anyone would argue that politically, this is a winner for President Biden.Now, mind you, he's going to upset progressive groups, immigration advocates with any sort of move if they adopt something like this. Of course, we haven't seen what it is yet, but assuming they do. But I think that when they're presented with the alternative, like what Isaac was reporting, comparing these militarized camps and horrific imagery along the border of mass -- I'm not sure how to describe it, but camps literally of children locked up behind cages again. I think they're gambling that people are going to come back to the Democrats and come back to the President, even despite their frustration with this politically. If I'll just say one other thing very quickly, though. Operationally, this is a disaster. As you might recall, just last week, it leaked out that ISIS is looking at massively reducing detention capacity, pulling money from other critical national security priorities. You're going to start pulling money from, you know, child exploitation investigation, counter-narcotics missions in the Caribbean to fund immigration because we're so overwhelmed with the numbers. Something IS going to have to give, Laura. You know, I don't know if this is going to be it, but I think ultimately, something is going to have to give because the numbers are just too great at the border right now.",

But today, it's all about Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was the armorer on that set. Prosecutors say that she had a duty as the person who was responsible for ensuring firearm safety to make sure that what happened didn't actually occur. She, of course, faces an involuntary manslaughter charge. She has pleaded not guilty to that. But she faces a second charge of tampering with evidence. And what authorities allege is that on the day of the shooting, after she was interviewed by police, she allegedly handed off a bag of cocaine to someone. The reason why --",

In reality, what the judge was looking for was a group of 12 people who could render an impartial verdict, regardless of what they knew ahead of in advance.
