That was an extremely emotional moment that we saw just there. MJ LEE, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTYou know, you saw in the clip that you just played one line of questioning from Robert Hur, in particular, very much anger the President, questions about the President's son's death, Beau's death, and the suggestion that he didn't remember when exactly his son had died. We're learning this morning that in private, at that private Democrats retreat in Virginia yesterday that he erupted into anger allegedly saying, \"how would I effing forget that?\" Now, the issue of just about his age and alleged memory issues is not just about the fact that some of these details the White House and his allies find unflattering and gratuitous, it is that they speak to a broader issue that we've seen expressed by voters, concerns about his age, concerns about his mental acuity.

Instead, he has used this as an opportunity to do what he does, which is blur the lines between his case, the Jack Smith's handling classified documents and Biden's case, saying that it's a two-tier justice system that Jack Smith should drop the charges, that he was more cooperative than Biden, which obviously we know is not true given that the FBI had to execute a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago to retrieve some of those documents.But so far, he has not yet touched on the mental acuity, mental fitness, the age lines from that document. And one thing to point out is while Donald Trump has alluded to Biden's age often called him incompetent, he never actually brings up his age. For two reasons, I am told by senior advisors, one, because Donald Trump himself is an older man too, because Donald Trump's supporters are also older. He is trying to not risk alienating some of those people as well and drawing attention to his own age. So, will he bring attention to the mental acuity? Likely. Will he bring attention to the age? Likely. Now, the one thing I want to note is that it is undeniable that yesterday was arguably one of the best days for Donald Trump in the time since he has actually announced that he was going to run for office in November of 2022, including with those Supreme Court arguments. He watched them, he thought that they went very well. This is what he said at a rally yesterday about them. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Our Supreme Court, hopefully, we'll be doing something in terms of helping our country and preserving democracy.

This Republican counsel was a Trump appointee to the -- US attorney for Maryland.Before he had clerked for a right wing Judge Kozinski in California in the Ninth Circuit who resigned, being accused of sexual harassment, then he clerked for Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who Senator Joe Biden voted against confirmation. This guy has donated to Republicans, he is a partisan and this stuff, the only job he had was to indict or not indict. And to add all this, the only thing he didn't add was the legal disclaimer that this is a political ad in support of Donald Trump. It was a total cheap shot. And I think Biden made it worse, no question about it. And Axe is right, it plays into the master narrative, the negative narrative, of Joe Biden. But I think people have stopped for a minute and say, that help appointment was this by Merrick Garland to put a partisan Trumper in charge of this.

Someone who has unspooled in public on a regular basis, lies all the time and has not one counts and tried to overthrow democracy last time he's in. Joe Biden, you have someone who is old, someone who's seen as decent, because that's true. Somebody's been an effective and consequential president. It's reasonable to have concerns about what a second term would look like. What you need to balance those two things and take into account what's in the national interest ultimately. For a lot of people, this will be an agonizing decision.

The justices themselves put it on an expedited schedule. And certainly we did see yesterday that Chief Justice John Roberts has a majority, if not a unanimous court to outright reverse the Colorado Supreme Court.And that court was the bench that said that Donald Trump should not be on the state ballot because of his role in the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. They cited a provision of the Constitution that bars insurrectionists from holding future office. But the issue now is what are their legal grounds? They can't just say, OK, we reverse we're out of here. They need to come up with legal grounds. And yesterday, Sara, we heard a couple of different options being offered, picking up on the lawyer for Donald Trump, for example, to say that only Congress has the authority to have disqualify someone from the ballot. It shouldn't be up to individual states. But then there were some other issues having to do with the specific text of the 14th Amendment section 3. For example, is the president even covered by language that refers to an officer of the United States? It sounds like a president would be but in the terms of the Constitution is they were written at the time of the 14th Amendment. There's some ambiguity there. And finally, I would just say another overriding consideration for this court are the practical consequences. Several of the justices raised, you know, just the whole idea of not just who decides but taking the -- taking a candidate off the ballot and what it would do down the road. Let me just read you something from Chief Justice John Roberts in that regard. He said, if Colorado's position is upheld, surely there will be disqualification proceedings on the other side. I would expect that a goodly number of states will say whoever the Democratic candidate is you're off the ballot. And others for the Republican candidate, you're off the ballot. [09:25:10] So that gives you a sense of kind of their thinking, OK. Then down to exact timing. They will meet in a coming days in a private session to take a vote and begin hashing out the legal rationale. I would expect because they've expedited the schedule for this, that they are mindful of Super Tuesday, a month from now, that they are going to try to do it fast. But, Sara, justices are a lot actually like us. The writing is hard. It takes many, many drafts. They go back and forth on their rationale. And I would think by early March, we'll see something up.
