I'm Jake Tapper.This our breaking news to U.S. citizens Judith Tai Raanan and her 17 year old daughter Natalie Raanan, who had been kidnapped by Hamas on October 7, have now been released. And they're now back in Israel. We just got this new photograph of Judith and Natalie from the Israeli military. Israel believes that Hamas still has around 200 hostages. And as of this morning, Israel's military says that they believe most of them are still alive. Plus, will they or won't they? That remains the key question at the Rafah border between Gaza and Egypt. There are trucks lined up inside of which are much needed food and water and fuel and medicine. But promises that these trucks would be let in to Gaza this morning have not been realized. Here is the U.N. secretary general at the key crossing earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONIO GUTERRES, UNITED NATIONS SECRETARY-GENERAL: Behind these walls, we have 2 million people that is suffering enormously. So these trucks are not just trucks, they are a lifeline. They are the difference between life and death for so many people in Gaza. What we need is to make them move, to make them move to the other side of this wall. To make them move as quickly as possible. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The President saying in a statement this afternoon that he is simply overjoyed that these two women now get to be reunited with their family. But he acknowledged too that this is far from over. A U.S. official confirming to me this afternoon that there are additional American hostages being held by Hamas, though we still don't know an exact number. Remember U.S. officials have continued to use language like a handful of hostages that are believed to be there.And the President saying that he is committed to working around the clock to get more hostages out. Now, U.S. officials have been stressing for a while that it has been extraordinarily difficult and challenging to ascertain any information about American hostages, their condition, their number, where they're being held, whether they're even in one place. But it is clear that the Israelis played obviously a very important role in sharing intelligence with the U.S. and that the Qatari has also played a very important role in mediating this situation. One piece of reporting that I will note from earlier today, Jake, that I think is really important is that according to a U.S. official, they are still not aware of any so called proof of life videos concerning American hostages that is akin to the video that was released earlier this week by Hamas of a 21 year old French Israeli. So, Jake, just needless to say, this has been an incredibly dark sort of focus for the President trying to get these American hostages out. We know that this was a significant focus for him when he traveled to Israel earlier this week. And it remains his top priority, he said, in the statement that celebrated the release of these two hostages.",

We had not been given any indication from sources that there was much headway being made with Hamas and the release of any of these hostages. Earlier this afternoon, Kaitlan Collins and I heard from different sources that this was underway, that two American hostages, a mother and a daughter were on their way out. We didn't know who it was, of course now it has been confirmed as Judith and Natalie Raanan. I was told that they were handed over to the Red Cross, which obviously operates inside Gaza.They're relatively independent organization, as far as any organizations are independent in the Gaza Strip, and they were driven south. There are two crossings out of Gaza into Egypt and into Israel. And so we know that very quickly from the time that we learned that this was happening, they did get out and they were handed over to Israeli authorities. The Israelis say that they were taken to a military base. We heard from Secretary Blinken earlier today who said that they will be visited soon by U.S. embassy officials, be given anything that they need. Obviously the priority is on getting them home as soon as possible so they can reunite with their family. Here's a little bit more of what Blinken had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
