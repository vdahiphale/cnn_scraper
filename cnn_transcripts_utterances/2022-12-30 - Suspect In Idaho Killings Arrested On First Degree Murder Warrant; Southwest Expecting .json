I'm Sara Sidner.We begin the hour with breaking news and a long awaited arrest in the horrific killings of four University of Idaho students back in November. Bryan Christopher Kohberger is in custody on a first degree murder warrant in those stabbing deaths. That's according to an affidavit. The killings terrorize a small town of Moscow, Idaho which hadn't seen a murder in seven years. Investigators are going to be holding a press conference. They are setting up as we speak and we are going to take you there live. But first, CNN's Jean Casarez is in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. That is where the arrest of Kohberger was made. And CNN's Veronica Miracle in Moscow, Idaho. Jean, we're going to start with you. What are you learning about how this arrest actually came to be?",

But the arrest, as I said, was at 1:30 this morning by the Pennsylvania State Police. And if you're wondering, well, how did this Idaho suspect come to be in Pennsylvania. It's fascinating because according to a source, they tell CNN that the FBI out of Philadelphia were surveilling him for four days right here in very rural Pennsylvania. At the very same time in Idaho, the Moscow Police, Idaho State police and the FBI were putting everything together that they had to find probable cause for a judge to sign off on an arrest warrant. That happened. When that happened, Pennsylvania State were surveilling him the whole time. They moved in and they arrested him. Now, as far as the criminal complaint he has been held, according to their complaint being declared a fugitive of justice. And that is allowing them because a judge in Pennsylvania doesn't have authority to hold someone on Idaho charges, but fugitive of justice charges not living in the jurisdiction and there is an extradition hearing at this point. It is set for Tuesday, Sara.",

Thank you for all the new details this hour.Casey Jordan is a Criminologist and Behavioral Analyst and Ed Davis is the former Boston Police Commissioner. I want to start with you, Ed. Sources are telling CNN the investigators traced ownership of a car seen at the house and DNA taken from the scene itself in order to apprehend this person, Mr. Kohberger. Can you tell me how these pieces of the puzzle can come together? And if there is DNA, does that indicate that they have his DNA - they were able to find it in some other criminal case, potentially?",

The other way would be familial DNA testing, which has been widely reported on recently. And the third way and a way that we used to do was follow the suspect around until he just got it a cigarette butt or a bottle of water and then test to get his DNA profile from that. Any of those things could have happened.But when you look at the digital evidence here, the camera footage, there's not a lot of cars moving around between three and four o'clock in the morning in a town as small as Moscow, so significant work was done analyzing those videos. They come up with the car. The other thing is that in a violent attack like this with a knife, it is quite common, actually more the rule than the exception, that the suspect will injure himself or herself in committing the crime. So there's very, very likely to have blood from the victims and from the suspect in the same place.",

Only a few dozen flights have been canceled so far, a big relief for a lot of people compared to what it's been over the last week, a very different story from the thousands scrapped earlier.

So I started asking people what do you think about his apology and what's it been like for you over the past week. And many of them say, sorry, is just not enough. One woman told me that because she has been stranded in Atlanta for over a week and it's the end of the year, she's out of paid time off. So that meant that she will not receive a one full week of her paycheck. Her bills are going to show up on time, but that paycheck will not. There are other people who tell me that they were supposed to spend time with family, but they ended up spending it alone here in the airport, sleeping on the floor, trying to figure out their next steps. And so I want you to hear from one woman who was from Brooklyn and then she says that she was a loyal Southwest customer but not anymore. This is her response to the CEO's apology this morning, take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Sara, of the nearly a thousand interviews that this committee has conducted, the Ginni Thomas transcript is one we've really been waiting for to see if we could get some more answers on these text messages that she exchanged with former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in the days and weeks following the election.Now, CNN has previously reported that Thomas who is a conservative activist exchange over two dozen text messages with Meadows where she was urging him to try to overturn the election to text him things like: \"The majority knows Biden and the left is attempting the greatest heist in our history.\" And what's interesting is that in this transcript, you see investigators press her about these conversations. And she does actually express something we haven't seen a lot in this investigation, Sara, which is regret and remorse. She says that this was \"an emotional time,\" she regrets these text messages and describes them as emotional text to a friend. But, of course, a friend in a very high place. And there were a lot of questions at the time, we first reported on these text messages several months ago, questions about the wife of the Supreme Court Justice, texting the White House chief of staff trying to undermine democracy and questions about what would happen if her husband had to rule on any issues related to the January 6 investigation. Now, there's one text that she sent Meadows where she says that she's been discussing all of this with her \"best friend.\" And at the time, there was speculation that she was referring to her husband, the Justice. And in this transcript, Sara, she confirmed that indeed, that is who she was likely referring to. But her regret and her remorse stops with her text messages to Mark Meadows. And when investigators and lawmakers on the Committee pressed her about her false claims of election fraud, she doubled down even when presented with evidence, the losing record of the Trump legal team in court, the fact that former Attorney General Bill Barr, White House counsel, they all told the former president there was no election fraud. She was asked if she had known that if she would still pursue these claims and she said yes. She said that she still believes there is more to be uncovered. So notable there, Sara, even though she's remorseful over her text messages to Mark Meadows that really the crux of what she was arguing: the election fraud, false results, she still hold out hope that there will be evidence eventually, though she confirmed she has no specific evidence at this time.",

They had a vote in their committee last week along party lines to release these documents. And one of the things you were hearing from Republicans is this was rushed, that this is unfair, that this is unprecedented.But I want to read you one thing that one of the Republicans on the Committee, Jason Smith, said in a closed door session Republicans revealing this today in their documents. They said - he said to Democrats, \"I had countless people tell me of things that they were concerned with President Biden's family's dealings and how they believed that him and his family is enriched because of his political power. They are begging for oversight and accountability on that.\" And that's really a shot across the bow, Sara. Sort of warning if you do this, if you release Donald Trump's tax returns, wait and see what happens when the shoe is on the other foot when Republicans have power of this committee. So I think that is such an interesting place to watch how do Democrats and Republicans use this law going forward and specifically how do Republicans use it in just a matter of days. Sara?",

You voted to release these documents on Donald Trump. Why do you think it was important that the public be able to scrutinize this? REP. JUDY CHU (D-CA): The American public has a right to know what their president's finances are. The presidency is unique. No one else in the country has the immense power to sign bills into law and direct an entire branch of government. If this person is signing up to be the leader of the world, then the American public deserves to see those taxes. And actually, what we were looking at was whether the mandatory presidential audit was being done, that was the basis upon which we have that hearing last week. And to our shock, we found that it wasn't being done, that only one mandatory audit was started and none of the audits were completed. So we wanted to let the American public know about that, but to really understand how that occurred, and why that was wrong. We needed to release those tax returns.",

This is why Democrats put in the inflation reduction Bill $80 billion for the IRS to restore its functions and to make sure that the ultra wealthy in this country pay their fair share. And by the way, those audits would only be for anybody earning $400,000 or more. But I do think there's another problem as to why this happened. And I think it's because there was a lack of will to really take these audit seriously. You know that they only assigned one agent to this presidential audit for such a complicated audit that had thousands upon thousands of pages and 400 related return returns. There should have been at least five auditors and those that amongst them had special expertise in foreign taxes as well as in financial products. So there was something drastically wrong there.",
