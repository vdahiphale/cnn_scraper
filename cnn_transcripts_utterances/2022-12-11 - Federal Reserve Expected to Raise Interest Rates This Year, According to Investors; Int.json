And this is according to both sides, unusually, they agree that military targets were indeed attack there.That's been an anticipation that the Ukrainians would like to open up another front in the south of the country, not least because ultimately, they'd like to be able to push on to the Crimean Peninsula, which has also seen some of those attacks. I think the other thing to take away from this is that the Ukrainians appear to be using more accurate and more missiles, more in terms of volume and they are more accurate. There is some suggestion coming from American diplomats that perhaps the Ukrainians have now developed the capability to build their own guided missiles or drone systems. And if that's the case, that could be a very important development as the winter frost approaches. And when the ground hardens, that's when you can anticipate more fighting potentially in the south of the country, because armor will be able to move across the frozen ground. Right now, it's raining, it's muddy. And the risk is that they would get very badly bogged down in the south there. Amara, Boris?",

But -- and -- but let's take a step back. A criminal referral from the January 6 Committee to the Department of Justice would be largely symbolic in nature. The Department of Justice certainly does not need Congress's permission to investigate and has conducted already a ongoing wide- ranging probe -- criminal probe into January 6. But members on the committee have long felt that criminal referrals are an important part of their work, particularly if their investigation has uncovered evidence of a crime. So this meeting later this afternoon, we'll see if a decision comes out of this virtual meeting. But members have said that they don't plan on releasing their decisions publicly until they release their final report on December 21.",

Obviously, we saw a huge run up in gasoline prices over most of this past year and then declined the last few months.Huge relief to consumers. But what the Fed cares about is the sort of less volatile what they call core components of inflation. So what's happening with shelters, rents, for example? What's happening with all the other services that Americans buy, as well as the goods that they buy? Cars, appliances, et cetera.

They have been pretty clear about the fact that they are not going to take their foot off -- the brakes rather, because they are still worried about inflation. The question is how aggressively they will continue raise rates?So, for the past several meetings, they have raised interests by, an almost unheard of, 3/4 of a percentage point each time. And again, very high by historical levels. What markets are expecting them to do is to moderate that a little bit. So, they're going to keep raising interest rates, you know, it's still going to get more expensive to borrow. But the increments might be a little smaller. So, half a percentage point instead of three-quarters of a percentage point. But the other thing to bear in mind is that Fed Chair Jerome Powell has indicated in recent remarks that even if they slow the pace of interest rate hikes, they're not going to stop. And in fact, they might continue for longer. So, they might end up at a higher, what they call terminal rate, you know, the final point at which they stop raising rates than had been predicted just a few months ago.",

They might be trying to get rid of all of that backroom stock in a hurry, so that we've seen discounts there.There are some other signs that inflation might be moderating. We've gotten some encouraging news in some recent reports. If you look at rent prices, for example, depending on what measure you look at, rent growth is either slowing or even reversing. If you look at some measures of new rents being issued, so that's a very good news considering how much we've seen rents go up in the past couple of years. And, you know, some isolated things like chicken wing prices have gone down. Obviously, we just talked about gas prices have gone down. So, there are some bright points.
