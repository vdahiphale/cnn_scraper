CNN's Melanie Zanona is following all of the latest developments on this. She joins us from Capitol Hill. Melanie, what kind of pressure are not just McCarthy but Biden under right now?

      "sentences": "Yeah. Lots of pressure on both sides and not a lot of time to get a deal done. But I will tell you that negotiations are slowly but surely moving ahead. They are starting to gauge on substance. Sources tell us that the White House is now pushing for a debt ceiling hike that lasts into 2025 so they don't have to deal with this until after the next presidential election.We're also told that work requirements, tougher work requirements for TANF, which is the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, is also on the table. But there are members in both parties who are starting to grow very uneasy about what type of deal might be cut, especially now that the negotiating room has shrunk down just to Biden and McCarthy. You have Democrats who have signed on to a letter calling on Biden to invoke the 14th Amendment in order to just raise the debt ceiling on his own. That's a really long shot idea that the White House has already said is unworkable. And then you have some conservatives who are calling for a complete end to the bipartisan talks and insisting that that the Senate just passed the House GOP debt ceiling bill. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. BERNIE SANDERS, (I) VERMONT: The President has the authority to use the 14th Amendment, and he should be prepared to do that. Period. I think none of us are aware of exactly what is happening. I think what the President has insisted from day one. That there be a clean debt ceiling approach and I think we all support that. REP. RALPH NORMAN, (R) SOUTH CAROLINA: I would suggest that McCarthy not meet until he put something in writing. His words have no meaning. Put it in writing and if it's anything less, we're not going to accept it. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Yesterday Janet Yellen, the Treasury Secretary, was with all these bank CEOs, two dozen bank CEOs, and they talked about this and she reiterated failure to raise or suspend the debt limit would be catastrophic for the financial system as well as American families and businesses.And John, I think the message has gotten through because now you're hearing a little more optimism and a little more urgency, but the time still here is really running out. So where -- I guess where are the potential compromises work requirements. Senator Biden had supported work requirements over the past years for safety net programs. That's something that Republicans really want, more of them for people aged 50 to 55 to work more, to get some of those food stamps and Medicaid, maybe climb back unspent COVID aid that states have. States aren't very happy about it, but it's someplace that maybe you could find some compromise. And energy permitting, that's something they're also talking about. But there's a bunch of stuff outside of that that both sides aren't moving on. So still, as Melanie said, a very ambitious agenda with a very, very short timeline.",

So a 95-year-old woman in Australia is in critical condition after being tased by a police officer inside her nursing home. Employees at the home called police because Clare Nowland, the great grandmother who has dementia. She was carrying a steak knife. Investigators say she was approaching the officer when he tased her. But the officer admitted that as she was approaching, she was doing so at a slow pace because she uses a walker. A community advocate says Nowland is 5'2\", less than 100 pounds. She is well known in the area because local media covered a Skydiving trip she took to celebrate her 80th birthday day. She did it again at 85.

Now has the nation confused because Wednesday, the president of Colombia tweeted that four children who were on board a small plane that crashed in the southern part of the country more than two weeks ago were actually found alive.But then he later deleted that tweet, saying that information given to him by the country's child welfare agency had not been confirmed. The search then intensified Thursday after the discovery of new findings that could give clues on their potential location. Military forces searching for the children, the youngest, just eleven months old, are following a trail of scrunchies, plastic wrappings and a baby bottle. Now, search officials say they have located footprints as well, and a makeshift shelter with sticks and branches. CNN's Stefano Pozzebon is following this for us. Stefano, conducting a search in the dense jungle is an extremely difficult challenge. This story, just yesterday we were saying, hey, they're saying these children are found, and now that has all changed. What can you tell us?",

It's deep in the amazon rainforest, a place where you move around either by small single engine planes, like the one that these children were on board, or with canoes and boats on the rivers which act as waterways. Talking from one community to the other, and talking with the search and rescue teams that are on the ground is incredibly difficult. Think that yesterday I was at Vigil Hill (ph) here in Bogota, the capital of Colombia, to pray for the well-being of these kids. And the indigenous people there told me that even them sometimes they can't talk with their community after 04:00 p.m., for example, and so it's very hard to get in touch with them.",

People may develop, you know, rash and things like that across their chest, across their abdomen.That same sort of thing can happen on your face. And I think you got an image here of showing you the facial nerve. So this is the nerve that that virus might affect if it's affecting the face. And when that happens, people will develop weakness, numbness. They can develop rash on the face. And, John, if you've heard anything about shingles, it can be really painful.
