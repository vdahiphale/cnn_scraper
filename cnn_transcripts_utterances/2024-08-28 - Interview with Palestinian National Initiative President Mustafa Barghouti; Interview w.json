Palestinian politician Mustafa Barghouti joins me from there. Plus, former Israeli hostage and nurse Nili Margalit tells me about taking care of her fellow captives underground in Gaza and her plea for the rest to be brought home. Also, ahead, he's behind some of pop's biggest hits. Superstar musician and producer Jack Antonoff in the studio to talk about his new album and working with Taylor Swift. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. And we begin in the occupied West Bank, where major Israeli raids and airstrikes, the most expansive in years, have killed at least 10 Palestinians. The IDF says it was working to thwart terrorism in Jenin and Tulkarm. In the past hour, Jordan's foreign minister has condemned Israel's actions, saying, quote, Israel's expansion of its war against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank is a dangerous escalation that must be stopped. And he went on to blame the radicalism of this Israeli government. Meantime, Israel's foreign minister had posted on X that the same strategies Israel has used in Gaza must be used in the West Bank, quote, we must address this threat with the same determination used against terror infrastructure in Gaza, including temporary evacuation of Palestinian residents and any necessary measures. He went on to say, this is a war and we must win it. So, let's now bring in politician Mustafa Barghouti. He's president of the Palestinian National Initiative Party, and he's joining me from Ramallah in the Occupied West Bank. Mustafa Barghouti, welcome back to the program. Can I first start by asking you to put this in context of size and intensity? Is it -- when was the last time you saw this scale of Israeli operation in the Occupied West Bank?",

And Hamas itself claimed responsibility for -- there was an attempt at some bombings in Tel Aviv and has called for resistance. And now, you've probably seen what Khaled Mashal has said, the former Hamas leader, that they have to return to, quote, martyrdom operations, which is not so subtle code for suicide bombings, on all fronts.

Of course, there are a small number of young people who are carrying guns, but it's nothing in comparison to the mighty power of the Israeli army. And they don't need to do all these operations of invading all these places and trying to ethnically cleanse whole refugee camps. Now, talking about guns. It is well known and it is so confirmed and documented that most of the weapons that people have in the West Bank come from Israeli -- from the Israeli side. These are guns that were stolen from the Israeli army by Israeli military people who sold them in the black market. That's the main source of weapons. So, it's not about trafficking all these guns through Jordan to West Bank, we all know how much Jordan is restricting that, how much Israel is controlling its borders. So, all these are rumors to bring an impression as if Israel is fighting with Iran. That's not true. Israel is fighting with the occupied Palestinian population, the people they have been occupying since 57 years, the people who have been displaced from their homes since 1948. And up until now are not allowed to go back home. Israel used to use the names of other countries to justify their oppression and persecution of the Palestinian people. They used to say they are fighting Soviet Union, and Egypt and Syria at some point, and Iraq. Now, it's Iran. Maybe tomorrow they will talk about Azerbaijan. I don't know. But the reality is that this is a struggle between the Palestinian people who demand freedom, end of occupation, end of apartheid, end of this system of oppression. And there is a very short way to security, not only for Palestinians, but for Israelis as well. And that short way is to end occupation. We've been saying that for decades. What do they do? Could they continue wars afterwards? In 2002, they reoccupied every single corner of the West Bank. Did that bring security? Did that bring peace? Of course not. The only way out of this situation is for Israel to end occupation. And for countries like the United States and European countries who are also responsible to pressure Israel, to stop the occupation and end the system of oppression and persecution of the Palestinian people. I think the atrocities that are happening in Gaza should be more than enough to convince the world that it is unacceptable to continue this torture of the whole Palestinian population.",

And now, we started to see cases of poliomyelitis. This is horrible. The whole population is at risk of diseases and death. Our medical teams tell us there is about 1.6 million people now in Gaza sick with different diseases. Our medical teams told us that every Palestinian in Gaza now gets sickness three times a month, different kinds of sicknesses, respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections, a whole population deprived from water, deprived from food, deprived from safety, no shelters, clustered in a very small area and bombarded continuously. Today alone, the Israeli army killed 45 more Palestinians. Most of them were children. Of course, then you will see reactions from certain political leaders because they cannot tolerate what's happening here. And then you add insult to injury by expanding this terrible genocide war into the West Bank, of course, that drives people crazy. But is this -- is there a way out of this? There is only one way.

Many of the movement leaders continue their campaign in hiding inside Venezuela amid political violence and the threat of a government crackdown.

He was urging people to vote for opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez, who was challenging authoritarian President Nicolas Maduro at the polls. But since then, a lot has changed. Venezuelan electoral authorities declaring Maduro the winner of that election without showing any proof. And the government detaining more than 2,000 people in a ferocious crackdown on dissent. Medina is now a migrant in Colombia. I never wanted to leave this way, he tells me, fleeing my homeland as if I was a criminal.

And then, when I was growing up, it was a little bit more of like the local punk scene. But the way that I've come to understand the sound, which is something that flows very naturally through me is, I believe Jersey is the only place in the world that really hugs a city like that. You know, if you think about Tokyo or London, kind of -- doesn't London go like this or L.A.? You know, you have New York City, you have a tiny sliver of water and then you have New Jersey. It's almost medieval, right? Like a moat. It's right there. And so, I think a lot about the amount -- and I don't even mean this in a poetic way, of literal energy that sort of like comes off of New York City and then sort of drifts over New Jersey. Makes you as a kid feel like you're missing out. Makes you feel like there's something you want to be a part of.
