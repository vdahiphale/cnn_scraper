This hour we bring you the view from Washington and Beijing. Up first, though, a local governor in Mexico says two or four kidnapped Americans have been found dead. All the victims have been located. The divide between Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu and Wagner Mercenary Boss Yevgeny Prigozhin sharpens amid the fierce battle for Bakhmut, some 4000 civilians remain in that besieged town. Iran begins making arrests in relation to schoolchildren being poisoned. There have been thousands of suspected cases since November. And the opposition comes together in Turkey to name its challenger against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The elections there are set for May, the 14th. Right, you're with the second hour of \"Connect the World\", welcome back today. The National People's Congress, the new Chinese foreign minister came out swinging. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He talked about the U.S. involvement with Taiwan and its support for Taiwan. He also accused the U.S. of trying to orchestrate a NATO style alliance in Asia and made suggestions that Asia could be the backdrop of a conflict very similar to that of Ukraine. Certainly, a long list of grievances, if you will, but not necessarily unexpected - at one point was the China's diplomat to the United Nations and to the U.S And has basically made this shift from someone who has been careful and thoughtful to taking on more aggressive tones like that of Beijing, strong wording very stringent wording and a very tense tone. He is trying to establish himself as now a key player, very Beijing centric. And at the same time, as you mentioned, we have the National People's Congress beginning with Xi Jinping beginning a new term. So, they too also want to have a very strong tone. Look, there is certainly tension in this area. We have seen militaries across the region really beef up, including Japan where I am now.

State Department has a briefing later today. But I do think that the context is important here. Obviously, these comments made during the National People's Congress, as Marc was saying there. And so therefore, you have a foreign minister who's new to the job, who is likely, you know, making comments that make him seem, you know, a really tough incoming leader in this role. And U.S. officials will have to just wait and see what that looks like in terms of his actual engagements with U.S. officials. It's worth noting that he and the Secretary of State were both in India, for the foreign minister's meetings of the G20, just you know, in recent weeks, and they didn't have a meeting. Now, obviously, the Secretary of State did have a meeting with the other top diplomat, Wang Yi of China, just a few weeks ago. But that was a contentious meeting, because that was around the time, of course that Chinese spy balloon it was after the U.S. shot that down, which is obviously created a lot of tension between the two countries. And then of course, accelerating those tensions are the warnings from the Biden Administration that China's considering lethal assistance to Russia, to be used in the war in Ukraine. So, we've got a number of issues that are really challenging the two countries relationship right now. And it looks a lot different than it did at the outlook at the beginning of this year, when, you know, it looks like U.S. officials and Beijing officials were potentially going to try and kind of engage with one another. Well, now, that has been halted. And I asked yesterday, the State Department spokesperson, if there was, you know, any plans for the Secretary of State to go ahead with his rescheduled trip to Beijing that was cancelled because of that balloon. And they really had no good answer. There's clearly not a date on the calendar for that trip right now. And one thing that Ned Price said was that the United States wishes that they had more and, in some ways, deeper lines of communication with the Chinese right now.",

We've seen the Secretary of State talked to a lot of European allies to make sure that they too, would oppose that lethal assistance. We've actually heard, you know, in recent weeks from some of those European leaders, mirroring what the Biden Administration, German Chancellor Scholz saying just last week, that they have warned the Chinese against going ahead with this a lethal assistance to Ukraine. So, while the Biden Administration has repeatedly said that they don't think that we are entering a period that would, you know, mirror a new Cold War, because the U.S. and Chinese economies are so integrated, which was not the case with the U.S. and, and Russia during the Cold War.

Now U.S. official familiar with this investigation tells me they believe this was the aftermath of that initial kidnapping. And again, you see a woman there who is violently shoved into the back of the pickup, there are also people around that vehicle who don't appear to be moving, who are then loaded up put in the back of the truck. Now CNN has not been able to confirm that those are the Americans that you were seeing. But an official says that this was the aftermath of that incident. But as you mentioned, the breaking news now we're learning and this actually tracks with what a source was telling me about their outlook on the law enforcement side. They knew that this was a very grim situation after this violent attack. The news now that all four have been recovered; however, two of them are deceased, two of those American citizens. I'm told by a source that this recovery occurred at some type of medical clinic in metamorphose, which was just over the U.S. border. Of course, we know this group of Americans had traveled from the U.S. state of South Carolina to Texas and then into Mexico in order to receive some type of medical procedure. Of course, it's not uncommon, for example, for Americans and Canadians to travel into Mexico seeking low-cost prescription drugs, lower price medical services, were told that that is why this group of Americans went there. However, immediately after crossing into Mexico on Friday, they were met by gunfire, a group opened fire on their vehicle. The source tells me that officials believe that this cartel, the Gulf Cartel in Mexico mistook this group of Americans for Haitian drug smugglers. So, these Americans simply in the wrong place at the wrong time as this battle between two violent factions were supposedly supposed to occur there. And again, sadly, those Americans were taken captive, and now two of them have been announced as deceased. Now we're waiting to see what happens. Next up, you know, finally, I'll tell you having worked kidnapping investigations of law enforcement and a previous career, the FBI has been engaged in this case from the beginning. But now we expect FBI agents to actually go there to the scene into Mexico working with our Mexican counterparts, in order to try to ensure the well- being of these two Americans that are still alive. Again, I'm told that one of them is severely wounded. And then they'll try to interview them to gather as much information as they can. Because we know now that the recovery has happened, Becky. The FBI continues to work with the Mexican authorities and hopes to try to eventually find and locate the cartel members responsible for now what appears to be the murder of two Americans.",

Now, of course, we are learning from the Iranian interior ministry are cited by state media that a number of people have been arrested, and identified in connection with this spate of suspected poisons. Although at this stage are unclear how many people exactly were arrested and what exact role they played in these suspected poisonings. And look on Monday, we heard from Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He said this was simply an unforgivable act and so that those who were involved would face severe punishment. But also on Monday, we heard from the investigative fact-finding committee which has been set up by the Iranian regime in order to look into an investigate this spate of suspected poisons. And they say that they are looking into some 5000 cases, the vast majority, as you mentioned, are young schoolgirls. But crucially, that fact finding committee has said that they believe around 90 percent of these cases were not in relation to poison, but rather they've described this as being caused by anxiety. Now, we at CNN have heard cases of young girls experiencing heart palpitations, shortness of breath, numbness in their limbs and nausea. And of course, there is real concern that they, these young schoolgirls may have been exposed to some substances. And at this stage, while the committee says that around 90 percent are believed to be in relation to anxiety, according to their claim. They are still looking into the question of perhaps a suspicious substance in some of those cases. Now, look, we have also heard reports from parents, from teachers and from medical staff on the ground across Iran dealing with these suspected cases who have told us that they say they are being silenced by the authorities, they feel that they have been told not to speak on these cases. One teacher even telling CNN that he feels that his phone is being monitored by the authority so, there is a real sense of concern here over what the regime wants to get out and what exactly they are saying about these cases. And of course, we have seen protests as well, in response to this and a real sense of panic amongst parents whose children have been impacted. And as expected, there has been a violent crackdown on those protests. As we have seen in the past, in most recent days, we've seen the security forces in Iran using tear gas and forcibly attempting to disperse those taking part in these demonstrations. And of course, it is important to remember the context in which this is all unfolding. Iran has seen for the last few months a spate of protests taking place against the regime all in the wake of the killing the death of Mahsa Amini in September, caused by Iran's notorious morality police. So, this is a time in which Iran is facing a huge amount of uncertainty, the regime is coming up against a huge amount of discontent which is spread across the country. And as we are continuing to see this, there is a huge crackdown by the regime on any sign of dissent. And this latest spate of poisonings is really important to question the actions that the authorities are taking. There is some concern that this may be linked to that spate of protests that we've seen across the country. But at this stage, the regime says they are still carrying on with that investigation.

And that's what's allowing us to launch products much faster than others at a much more economical price to the market, which means if I use a good example, we just launched in IDEXX, a UAV, a tactical UAV.",

At least six Palestinians have been killed in an Israeli militaryrage into the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. This is information we are getting from the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been commenting on the raid saying that Israeli forces have killed what he calls an abominable terrorist who killed two Israeli brothers, settler brothers after almost a decade of a war that has decimated the country, killed hundreds of thousands of people in force countless young children to go hungry. There is new hope, a new glimmer of hope at least in Yemen. The arrival of the first cargo shipping years, but while it is a positive development hopes of any lasting peace still remain elusive. Laila Harrak has more for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LAILA HARRAK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): A commercial cargo ship Doxon Yemen's who data ports. The first time in several years, a vessel carrying more than just humanitarian essentials has been allowed to unload there. It's the sign the fragile piece brokered by the UN last year between Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government is still largely holding neither side renewed the agreement when it expired in October. The Yemeni government says the move is meant to build trust and strengthen negotiations between the two sides. We have been fighting a civil war since late 2014. Hodeidah and much of the Northwest including the capital Sanaa is controlled by the Houthis, who are backed by Iran. But the government controls most of the rest of the country, and is supported by Saudi led forces that enforce a naval blockade off Yemen's waters. Under a U.N. vetting program to ensure weapons don't enter the port. Only ships containing food, fuel and cooking oil have previously been allowed. The hope is the additional goods flowing into Yemen will help to ease the humanitarian and economic crisis gripping the country. The U.N. says two thirds of the population needs help and protection and is appealing for nearly four and a half billion dollars of aid. Despite some of the recent gains made. ANTONIO GUTERRES, U.N. SECRETARY-GENERAL: Civilian flights resumed from Sanaa vital supplies arrived through the port of Hodeidah. But the economy is in enormous difficulties. Basic services risk to collapse, and the military needs to continue to soar. While access is constrained and funding perennially falls short. HARRAK (voice over): It's a shortfall on so many levels, food and fuel prices have surged. Inflation is high. There are dual currency notes and exchange rates, all of which makes it harder for Yemenis to buy anything at an affordable price. These Yemenis cut trees to earn a little money.",
