What will the people of South Carolina do in your opinion?REP. JAMES CLYBURN (D-SC), ASSISTANT DEMOCRATIC LEADER:  Well, the people of South Carolina are very, very pleased with Joe Biden, the African American community as well as those non-African Americans. Last night, I was at a commencement exercise here in Columbia and I heard nothing but positive things about Joe Biden. Now, we know that we have three branches of government. We don't blame Joe Biden for the decisions being handed down by the Supreme Court, and we cannot blame Joe Biden for what the majority in the House of Representatives may be doing with the debt limit. We can look at his record, and when you look at Joe Biden's record, it is a stellar one. Let's go back to the rescue plan. Go back to his infrastructure bill, his CHIPS and Science Act. In Columbia, South Carolina, VW just announced that he's going to put their new SUV will be built in Columbia. Why? Because of the CHIPS and Science Act, expecting 4,000 new jobs. That's Joe Biden. Inflation Reduction Act. When I'm talking -- my late wife was diabetic, and so I know what the cost of insulin has been. They give Joe Biden credit for that, that's his record. And veterans, that's the big thing when it comes to this debt ceiling, because Joe Biden with the PACT Act went back and picked up all those Vietnam veterans that got left out because they were not treated fairly when they came back from Vietnam. We picked them up, and we have taken care of them with the PACT Act. Yes, we did OK for those in Afghanistan and Iraq with the burn pits, but we did much more than that. So, that's what people are going to be looking at. Not just whether or not we could not get 60 votes in the Senate to do what we wanted to do with voting or to do what we wanted to do with the police reform. But he has a record that he can run on and I've been very proud of that record.",

Robert Kennedy, Jr., is going up against him. He's a conspiracy theorist. He is an anti-vaxxer. But he's polling at 19 percent. Are you concerned, as a person who has backed Joe Biden, who is behind him and his re-election, are you concerned and do you think Mr. Biden is concerned with this polling?",

I guarantee you, of that 19 percent, 15 percent is Bobby Kennedy. And when you get exposed to the fact this is Bobby Kennedy Jr. And not Bobby Kennedy Sr., those numbers are going to reflect that reality.So, this 19 percent doesn't bother me at all. I am bothered by anybody who's an anti-vaxxer, who is a conspiracy theorist. This is all about a democracy moving forward, leaving a country for our children and our grandchildren. And you cannot do that if you are against vaccines. I grew up at a time when polio was running rampant. Why did we get rid of polio? Because of vaccines, Jonas Salk, and Albert Sabin. And now we've got a vaccine for this pandemic, and you're trying to get it behind us, and anybody that's against vaccinations, I just have a problem with them, and most people I know would have a problem with that.",

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [10:40:00] BERMAN:  All right, the breaking news is this, a verdict has been reached in the seditious conspiracy trial against five members of the Proud Boys for their actions leading up to and on January 6th. There are no cameras in the courtroom. We have people inside. We are also listening, people are our reporters, to an audio feed. We will bring you this verdict the second it comes in.

This is, of course, in relation to January 6th, and basically, it's that they tried to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power. That's the large charge. There's a lot of other charges that are sprinkled in and each person faces a different number of charges in this particular case.Dominic Pezzola, which is one of the five who are on trial, you will remember him and I know the country remembers him because he was like the first person to break through a window, and you saw him with the shield of a police officer. This is on video, the jury saw this, smashing into the window of the Capitol. And then you saw people flooding in through that window. So, I know that was shown to the jury, that was part of the evidence. And what the argument that is being made here by the prosecutors is not only did they actually do this, this wasn't spontaneous. The Proud Boys are arguing that this was spontaneous. They had no plan. They just ended up getting caught up in the crowd. But the prosecutors are saying, look, they had been plotting this for a long time. And they did show the jury that in their estimation with evidence of text messages and different types of communication between all of these members of the Proud Boys. Trying to show that they brought things with them that they shouldn't have had that could be weapons. That they were the first to help push past police. That they were the ones breaking in and each of them are members of the Proud Boys. It's something similar that they did in the first seditious conspiracy trial that -- with the Oath Keepers. And so, this is the second one of its kind. Now, just a warning, the verdicts could be some people get guilty, some get not guilty, or they all get not -- it could be a hodgepodge, which is what happened with the Oath Keepers.

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, it looks like this moment right now, the judges on the bench. There is a partial verdict that the jury has reached some unanimity on some of these charges, potentially even that major seditious conspiracy trial. But like much of this trial, the defense team is arguing vigorously. They have tried to derail this case dozens of times, trying to get mistrials.And right now, our reporters in the courtroom, Hannah Rabinowitz and Holmes Lybrand, they're sending information that there is a dispute going on about whether the defense team even wants that partial verdict to be read right now or if the jury should continue deliberating. So, that's what's going on. But this is a case that we really need to watch on so many fronts because this is not just about the people on the ground on January 6th. It is also about someone, Enrique Tarrio, the founder of the Proud Boys, the head of the Proud Boys who was not on the ground and the possibility that he could be convicted for engaging in this agreement. And this is not just any conspiracy case either. It is a seditious conspiracy case meaning not only would these men need to be convicted, be proven that they came to some sort of agreement, but that agreement was to overthrow the government or somehow hinder the government by force. So, a lot is on the line here and there is a lot that is at stake for the Justice Department in their January 6th prosecutions. We don't have a verdict yet. As far as I can tell the jury is not back in the room, but we're eagerly awaiting to see what happens next.",

This has been such a difficult case to get through. There have been so many different motions trying to get things tossed, questions about jurors that have arisen.And so, the defense has really taken every opportunity they can to make this difficult. The judge has been losing his patience many times. But as much as the defense is arguing right now, it's quite clear that the judge has already told the jury, you can bring back a partial verdict, we will take that. That's OK. He could tell them to go back and keep deliberating on the other counts but that seems to be what they're still deciding upon right now.",

They go after decisions made by the judge more.

But there is a lot more contention, if you will, in this court. And the judge in this court is different from the judge in the Oath Keeper case, the judge in the Oath Keeper case.
