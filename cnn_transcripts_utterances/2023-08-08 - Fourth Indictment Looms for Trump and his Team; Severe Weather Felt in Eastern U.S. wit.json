These orange barricades were erected around the Fulton County courthouse last week. Monday morning, metal barricades were put in front of the street in front of the courthouse to block off vehicle traffic. The street is still open to foot traffic, but they're taking security here very, very seriously. We're also learning about who was subpoenaed to appear before the Fulton County grand jury. It was just a short time ago that we learned that former Lieutenant Governor Jeff Duncan has been asked to appear before the Fulton County grand jury. And it was while the Republican was the Lieutenant Governor here in Georgia that he was the president of the Georgia State Senate, the same state Senate that Rudy Giuliani, Trump's former attorney, appeared before three times to have spread conspiracy theories and election lies. Duncan, now one of three people who has been subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury, that coupled with the security precautions, the strongest indications yet that this investigation could be nearing its end.

They are not exceedingly rare. They happen in the District of Columbia, where this case will be tried. And it doesn't mean that somebody's First Amendment rights are infringed upon.As we all know, the First Amendment does provide robust protection for speech, and particularly for political speech. And the former president is a current political candidate. But when it comes to being a defendant in a criminal case, it does not infringe on those rights to say there are certain other compelling reasons why we don't want this case, as the Department of Justice said, tried in the court of public opinion, why we don't want the former president and his legal team to share certain information. And I think, frankly, this is part of a concerted effort for the Trump team to say that the judge and the Department of Justice are simply trying to chill him, trying to gag him, but essentially create a gag order.",

LEVINSONit's difficult to predict, but the judge will find that there are good reasons for at least a limited protective order in this case. And this is a judge who has already ruled in some cases dealing with January 6 defendants, and she has been one of the more aggressive judges in terms of sentencing of January 6 defendants. She takes the events of that day very seriously. This is also a judge who has previously ruled against the former president when it came to a claim of executive privilege in a different case. And so I don't think this is a judge that is going to be frightened. I don't think this is a judge who will fall for political arguments masquerading as legal arguments.",

He could also, if those cases have not been completed, try and direct his attorney general, whoever that person is, to try and dismiss the cases.

The National Interagency Fire Center says nearly 90 large fires have burned more than 500,000 acres in nearly 12 states.In New Mexico, firefighters are still battling a fire that started over the weekend due to lightning. Officials say hot, dry, and windy conditions could lead to more active fires. And this was the scene in California where the York Fire caused widespread devastation. The National Preserve in the area is closed due to the fires. And the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating a deadly helicopter accident from Sunday where two aircraft collided while fighting the Broadway fire near Los Angeles. One helicopter was able to land safely, but officials say the other crashed, killing all three firefighters on board. In the coming hours, drones will be used to examine the crash site. After that, the wreckage will be taken to a secure location for further examination. According to Cal Fire, the three deaths are the first during the state's 2023 fire season. We're turning now to Ukraine, where at least seven people have been killed after Russian missiles struck residential areas in the Donetsk region. It happened on Monday in the eastern city of Pokrovsk. This is new video showing the aftermath of that strike that left at least 67 others injured. Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs said police officers, rescuers and two children were among those hurt. And meantime, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is warning that Russia may be left without vessels if it continues to attack Ukrainian ports. His comments come just days after Ukrainian sea drones hit both a Russian tanker and a warship. And Ukraine's security service says a woman is now in custody in connection to an alleged plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Ukrainian security officials published a blurred image that they say shows the informant for Russia. She has not been named but officials say she's from the southern Ukrainian region of Mikhailov. And CNN's Clare Sebastian joins us now from London. Claire, what more are you learning about this alleged plot to assassinate President Zelenskyy?",

They do say that she was a resident of the Mikhailov region and that she was a saleswoman in a military store.Beyond that, we don't know much. They're saying that she could face 12 years in prison. But I think this really draws attention to two things. One, that President Zelenskyy is under threat. This is something we've known since the beginning of the conflict. And in fact, President Putin himself has said we're not fighting against the Ukrainian people, although I think the victims of various recent attacks might dispute that, but that they are fighting against what he calls the regime in Kyiv. So we know that there have been attempts in the past on President Zelenskyy and this is clearly something that's ongoing that the security services have to combat. Secondly, I think is the issue with informants that they are in a constant battle against this trying to prevent information. Not only for example about in this case the itinerary of the president leaking out, but they also said that this same woman was trying to gain information as they tracked her beyond that trip by president Zelenskyy to the Mikhailov region they continue to track her when they say that she was trying to track down information about electronic warfare systems ammunition storages all things that are critical to the Ukrainian efforts on the front line. So look I think it's potentially convenient for the security services that given the publicity around this being an assassination attempt on Zelenskyy. They were able to sort of get a lot of information out about this and created a deterrent at this critical time in the conflict.",

Stephanie, what is the latest on the political instability in Niger and what is the likely next step now for the military junta? STEPHANIE BUSARI, CNN SR. EDITOR, AFRICA: Yes, so everything hinges really on these talks that are happening on Thursday. Everyone is, there's a lull in the tough talking and the rhetoric action. As you know, military action was promised on Sunday. That deadline has expired. Now it seems that all sides are quite keen to reach a resolution that does not involve any military action. And but -- Victoria Nuland saying yesterday that she had very frank and difficult conversations with some of the military leaders in Niger. But interestingly, she didn't meet General Tianny, but he met with Mali spokesmen who were visiting the country. But you know, he does seem keen to get to the table and have some talks. And Victoria Nuland was keen to emphasize that it would be very wrong and very tragic for the people of Niger. If Wagner, who had been on the sidelines making some attempts to perhaps come in to join any kind of conflict that happens, it would be tragic for the people of Niger if that were to happen. So, a lot really hinges on this meeting that's happening with the ECOWAS leaders on Thursday. The tough talking has subsided.
