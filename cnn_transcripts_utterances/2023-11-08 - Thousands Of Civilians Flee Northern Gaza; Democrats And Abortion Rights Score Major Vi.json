Speaking today, the U.S. Secretary of State says occupation, either by Hamas or Israel is not on the cards, and that any new government must be led by the Palestinian people. Have a listen.

There has to be a political factor involved, some diplomacy involved, and you can't continue to make enemies by killing the people that are surrounding this terrorist group no matter how horrible they are.

Now, Israel has so far been reluctant to do so. Prime Minister Netanyahu insisting that any pause in fighting will only allow Hamas to regroup. Still, of course, aid agencies are ringing the alarm as food, fuel, water, all run out, and more than 2 million people, half of them, children, remain under siege and under bombardment. I want to give you the example of medical supplies. Doctors saying they're having to perform surgeries without anesthesia. The ICRC, the International Committee for the Red Cross says that one of its convoys came under attack, making it ever more difficult to get those crucial medical supplies to places like Al-Shifa Hospital, the main hospital in Gaza city, where doctors say they're having to make decisions as to who gets treatment because of running out of supplies. Now, there's also, of course, the evacuations that took place over the last couple of days. The Israeli military has been opening these windows, these time -- just a few hours of time windows to allow civilians to flee Gaza city. But that doesn't mean there's a pause in fighting as they move southwards. The U.N. estimates some 15,000 people have used this corridor so far, but they face harrowing conditions only to get to another place in Gaza, the south, that is also not safe. Take a look at our report. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ABDELAZIZ (voice-over): Taking only what they can carry, families are fleeing Gaza city. They wave white flags made of anything they can find. And as the sounds of war echo around them, they signal yet again that they are innocent. \"Now, we're supposed to be in the safe area, but you can hear the bombs behind us\", he says. \"All of our houses are gone. Nothing is left.\" The Israeli military has been calling for weeks on all those living in the northern part of the Strip to move southwards. Most recently, opening what it called safe corridors for limited windows of time, pushing thousands here to Salah Hadeen(ph) Street where evacuees describe a harrowing journey. \"We saw along the road destruction, dead bodies everywhere. And the Israeli tanks would demand to search the youth\", she says. \"We saw one young man stripped naked. We witnessed unbearable scenes.\" The only way to reach the route is by foot or by cart for those who can find room. \"There was heavy shelling on our neighborhood, and we were forced to flee. We have to use these donkey carts because there is no fuel\", he says. \"They cut everything off to force us out of our homes.\" Israeli troops are now in the heart of Gaza city, as Israel's Defense Minister apparently declared the entire city the whole of the enclave's largest population center, a legitimate target. YOAV GALLANT, DEFENSE MINISTER, ISRAEL (through translator): Gaza is the biggest terrorist stronghold that mankind has ever built. This whole city is one big terror base.

It's the biggest victory for the conservative movement, possibly, you know, in its domestic history in United States, but that is causing a backlash. It did in the midterm elections last year. It did this year. Voters are making clear, especially in suburban, more moderate areas, that they have no time for Republican restrictions on abortion.

He called it of overall security responsibility by Israel in Gaza. What we've seen here in Washington, D.C., at least, is two days of very forceful pushback from the Biden administration, saying there should be no Israeli reoccupation of Gaza, that should be completely discounted. Secretary Blinken, who has just left the Middle East, he was in Tokyo earlier today. He said very firmly that Israel should not occupy Gaza. We should note that Israeli officials have walked back some of what Netanyahu has said. We have heard top Israeli officials saying they have no intention of re-occupying Gaza. But Isa, it really does beg the question of who would govern the Gaza Strip, if Israel is successful in pushing Hamas out. And for that, there is no answer right now. There is no clear -- there are no specifics from Israel, from the United States, from any others.

One Dutch company has invented a more sustainable and affordable approach. Bianca Nobilo has more from our \"Going Green\" series. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) (MUSIC PLAYING) SID VOLLEBREGT, CO-FOUNDER AND CEO, ELEMENTAL WATER MAKERS (voice-over): When you look at the desalination industry, which is currently responsible for 5 percent of the water supplies globally, it emits a lot of carbon dioxide, lots of greenhouse gases. So we knew that we had to do it totally different. My name Is Sid Vollebregt. I'm the cofounder and CEO of Elemental Water Makers. We want to saw fresh water scarcity using only the sea and sun. BIANCA NOBILO, CNN ANCHOR (voice-over): Today, the U.N. estimates that more than 2 billion people globally do not have access to clean drinking water. VOLLEBREGT (voice-over): The idea of Elemental Water Makers originated a long time ago in Madagascar and there we witnessed what it means not to have access to clean water for a rural community. NOBILO (voice-over): They built their innovation around reverse osmosis. VOLLEBREGT (voice-over): Reverse osmosis has been used since the '60s but we actually improved it with energy recovery technology that allows us to use 70 percent less electricity. The second step is that we made the system suitable to be powered by solar energy. And the last step is that we don't use any chemicals in the process. This is one of our solar desalination facilities. Here we have the sea water entering the system. It first goes through the three treatment steps. Reverse osmosis takes place in these membranes. Here we can tap fresh water from the sea. NOBILO (voice-over): Sid says that they've built projects in 27 countries to date. VOLLEBREGT (voice-over): For these remote communities, we help them set up the solution, we install it, we train them to operate and maintain the solutions. NOBILO (voice-over): The remote coastal town of Efoetsy, Madagascar, has seen improvements in illness rates as a result of having a desalination facility, according to a local nonprofit. PIERRE-FRANCOIS DUBOSC (through translator): It's pretty fantastic. It allows people to drink water that is clean, that is very healthy, that is very good. And in terms of hygiene and health, it is crucial. We have diseases that may be disappearing now. VOLLEBREGT (voice-over): For me it was really closing the loop from seeing a problem, developing technology to actually making a solution available onsite. And the moment that we were starting the machine and handing out water to people, who have never drank clean water in their life, that was something I will never forget. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The E.U.'s executive body is recommending that officials begin formal membership talks next year once Kyiv meets final conditions. The European Commission president Ursula van der Leyen called it a historic day. Any final decision to allow Ukraine into the E.U. would still take years. October is the fifth month in a row to break the hottest temperature records in 2023. That is according to the E.U.'s Copernicus Climate Change Service. Last month, if you remember, saw the global temperatures reach 1.7 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average. Ocean temperatures continue to soar, spurring developments of hurricanes and tropical storms, according to the service. 2023 is virtually certain to become the hottest year on record. That is very alarming indeed. Climate change and high temperatures are considered the greatest threat the world's coral reefs. But part of Australia's Great Barrier Reef are showing some resiliency with coral now starting to regenerate. It's welcome news for scientists who are lobbying the Australian government to do more to protect this natural wonder. Our Ivan Watson has the story for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IVAN WATSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Nighttime on Australia's Great Barrier Reef. The sea explodes in an otherworldly spectacle. This is coral spawning. One of the world's greatest natural wonders is made up of billions of living creatures that reproduce like this each year. And this season has scientists excited. ABBI SCOTT, CAIRNS-PORT DOUGLAS REEF HUB COORDINATOR: We were out driving until about 11 pm last night, looking at the coral spawning and we were lucky enough to see some of the species spawning. Not all of them but we saw the soft corals and they filled up the water with bundles of eggs and sperm, which was really spectacular. WATSON (voice-over): The spectacular sight is a type of synchronized breeding. Coral polyps release millions of sperm and egg bundles into the water all at once. When two bundles from the same species collide, new life is born. It's a display of nature's resilience, repeated around this time of year across the Great Barrier Reef's nearly 133,000 square miles. But while some parts of the reef remain healthy, other parts are bleaching and dying, killed by temperature rise due to global warming.",
