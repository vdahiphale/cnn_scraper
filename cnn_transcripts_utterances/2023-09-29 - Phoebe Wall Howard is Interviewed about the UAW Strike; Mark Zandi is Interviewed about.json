Good morning. I was so struck yesterday reading this piece you did. You got the transcript of Bill Ford, who had -- not only the president of Ford, he has been at the negotiating table for every union negotiation since 1982. The year I was born. A long time ago! And what he said about politicians was striking. Tell us. PHOEBE WALL HOWARD, AUTOMOTIVE REPORTER, \"THE DETROIT FREE PRESS\": Well, I mean, it's one thing for automakers to welcome politicians from both parties, not outside negotiations, but this has just been - this is a really rough negotiation cycle. And I think politicians coming in from both sides of the aisle, it's not helpful. That's basically what they're saying. Things are very difficult behind the scenes. So, making things more difficult in front of the camera is just not helping the process at all. And that's very unlike him.",
