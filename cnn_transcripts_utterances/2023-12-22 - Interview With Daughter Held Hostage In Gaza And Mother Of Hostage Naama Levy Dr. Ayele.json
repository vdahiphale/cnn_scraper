And my conversation with Dr. Ayelet Levy Shachar, whose daughter, Naama, is still being held hostage by Hamas. Then, is Pope Francis becoming more radical as the head of the Catholic Church denounces the war in the Middle East and permits blessings to same sex couples? I discuss with Reverend James Martin, who knows the pope well. Then, the voice of a generation, superstar soprano Renee Fleming joins Michel Martin and reflects on her career as she is honored at the Kennedy Center. And finally, Christiane is serenaded by one of the world's most popular pianists, Lang Lang on his work and how music can be a bridge in our fractured world. Hello, everyone. Welcome to the program. I'm Bianna Golodryga in New York, sitting in for Christiane Amanpour. Well, after frantic negotiations, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution on the war between Israel and Hamas, calling for \"urgent and extended humanitarian pauses\" in the fighting as well as unhindered humanitarian access. This just three days before Christmas, as the Holy Land for Christians, Jews, and Muslims is being torn asunder under a bloody conflict. Some 20,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7th. That's according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Ramallah. Those left alive are dealing with injuries, disease, and starvation as the infrastructure to deal with such challenges crumbles around them. According to the World Health Organization, there are no functioning hospitals left in Northern Gaza. Here's just some of what Palestinians say they are facing on the ground. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RIDAAN ABU MA'MAR, LOST BOTH PARENTS AND TWO OF HIS SIBLINGS (through translator):  There is nowhere safe in the whole of the Gaza Strip. My whole family is gone. We are only four people left out of a family of eight. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (through translator):  I was at my aunt's house and we were playing. We saw a big and fast airplane flying over and suddenly, it bombed our place and stones fell on me and then people removed me from the rubble. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Meantime, in Israel, many families spent Hanukkah this year mourning the loss of loved ones after the brutalattack on October 7th that left around 1,200 people dead. And just today, there's been another devastating blow. The family of Gadi Haggai announcing that the 73-year-old grandfather has died while in the captivity of Hamas. Earlier this week, I spoke to Dr. Ayelet Levy Shachar, whose daughter, Naama, is still held hostage by Hamas. Her violent capture on October 7th was caught on camera by her attackers and released publicly. The footage is upsetting to watch, but Dr. Shachar tells me why she wants the world to see it. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. AYELET LEVY SHACHAR, DAUGHTER HELD HOSTAGE IN GAZA AND MOTHER OF HOSTAGE NAAMA LEVY:  My voice may be soft when I speak right now, but the scream is inside me. And I don't hear the voices of the world loud enough responding to the scream. My daughter has been kidnapped by Hamas. Can you even begin to imagine that? GOLODRYGA (voice- over):  It's one of the most recognizable images from the horrors of October 7th. 19-year-old Naama Levy dragged from the back of a jeep at gunpoint by Hamas terrorists.

You know, that's all I want. I don't want to travel anywhere. But I'm doing it because I think this is -- I think the United States has the most power here. And I want to influence whoever I can. GOLODRYGA (voice-over):  Like many other families of hostages, Levy Shachar is also disappointed in what they view as an ineffective role played by the International Committee for the Red Cross. While acknowledging the organization's principle of impartiality, families believe more aggressive statements like this one from the ICRC president last week, demanding access and the release of hostages could've put more pressure on Hamas.",

I know these are private conversations. Can you just give us a summary of some of the things that you discussed with him that helped lead to this landmark decision and his views and how they've evolved over the past few years? REV. MARTIN:  Sure. I'm one of many people that speaks with him about this. You know, I don't want to break confidence, but we talk about the needs of LGBTQ people and their plight in the church. I sometimes talk about LGBTQ people who are persecuted, you know, in terms of violence. As you know, in 10 countries, it's a capital offense, you can be executed. And I think, you know, like anybody, he has been listening to the experiences of LGBTQ people over the last 10 years of his papacy. He's gotten to know them. He's gotten to know people who minister to them. And I think this is the end result of that listening. But also, you know, really understanding the pastoral needs of the people on the ground, right? This is part of his flock, and this is a part of his flock that he wants to welcome and help them feel included in what is, after all, their church too.",

I think his most five -- his five most famous words, who am I to judge? And they have to do. Interestingly, the question was about, as you said, gay priests in the Catholic church. But then the next day was followed up by a journalist who said, well, you only meant gay priests, right? He said, no, I meant anybody who was gay. And then, subsequent to that, you had comments about parents not kicking gay people out of the house. You know, the need for the church to welcome gays, meeting with people who minister to them. So, it's been a gradual process for him and progress for the church, and it's pretty amazing that it's come to this point. I don't think people expected the same sex, a couple blessing approval to come so quickly, but, you know, he's also someone who's getting older. There's a new person in charge of Vatican doctrine who's much more open to this. And so, all these things came together to produce that document from this week.",

MARTIN:  I was not surprised that there was so much pushback. When I was at the Synod in October, the worldwide meeting of Catholics Cardinals and Bishops, there was a lot of pushbacks to this issue. I think what surprises me is that it comes out in official statements from bishops' conferences, Malawi, Cameroon, a couple other places, and some religious orders. That's pretty unique to come out and basically say, we will not implement a papal directive. So, I'm not sure what Pope Francis or the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith will do about that.

I don't know how they will respond. I don't know how they should respond. I think -- you know, maybe speaking to the bishops personally, talking to the bishops' conferences, but it is a pretty strong reaction. I mean, as you can see that, you know, really sort of -- he speaks the level of suspicion about LGBTQ people in some of these countries, particularly, in my experience, in Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe. That's where the most pushback is coming from. I think the way to sort of help bishops and other people on the ground with this issue is to help them get to know LGBTQ Catholics. I mean, that's really what changes hearts and minds. It's not arguments or debates. It's encounter. It's really listening to their stories and listening to who they are and their experiences of God in the church.",

This year, we have seen the pope speak out about the fighting, the humanitarian crisis. Obviously, the October 7th horrific terrorist attack as well. He's met with families of loved ones on both sides, Palestinians and Israeli. And he condemned the shooting of two women in a Gazan church. Recently, Gazans have accused IDF snipers. The IDF denied those accusations. But over the weekend, the pope said, \"Some say this is terrorism. This is war. Yes, it is war. It is terrorism.\" What do you make of how he's handled his public role in trying to bring this war to an end? REV. MARTIN:  I think he's handled it very well. I mean, he quotes constantly, which I think is probably the most succinct summary of this from Saint John Paul, the second war is always a defeat for humanity. And so, he has been very strong about the need for a ceasefire, the need for peace. And I think, you know, on the ground, what the Vatican tries to do is work with local cardinals and archbishops and priests and nuns and brothers and lay people to sort of provide assistance, but also to get a sense of what's going on the ground. So, I think he's done a very good job. His role is as peacemaker, not as politician. And I think some people might feel that he's not said enough, but he's not a politician. He's trying to be really a peacemaker.",

Talk about the type of sermon that you would deliver and message that you think is an important one to send now to families all over the world who are watching things unfold and really feel, you know, desperate about the global situation now and, you know, what 2024 may look like. REV. MARTIN:  Sure. I mean, there's a lot of despair. There's despair over what's going on in Israel, in Ukraine. I mean, in a sense, the polarization in the United States. I think one of the most important messages of the Christmas season is that nothing is impossible with God. I mean, God -- Christian believes that God became human in Jesus. And that this is something that obviously never happened before and never has happened since. But when we look at despair and we look at hopelessness, that is really not coming from God. What's coming from God is the desire for a new future, the desire to hope, the desire to keep on going. That's also the message of the resurrection, right? When the disciples thought that nothing good could happen after Good Friday. So, consistently, nothing is impossible with God. And also, fear not, which is what the angels say to the shepherds at the nativity. And also, what the angels say at the resurrection. So, fear not and keep hoping.",

Can we provide a platform for arts and health? I think we could -- our audience would love to know the science behind what it means to be listening to music or feeling emotion around the arts. And so, we've been doing this for five years now. But for mental health, I mean, you know, Vivek Murthy, our surgeon general, Dr. Murthy, has actually done, you know, in a recent study, you know, kind of a release stated that, I mean, it's -- music can actually create endorphins that are very healing around depression. It alleviates the depression that we feel and, you know, it's a similar to going out into nature, to creating something artistic using your hands. I mean, it's worked. It's done wonders for veterans, for people. We're not going to -- we're going to have a lot of anxiety and depression around climate. So, yes, there are so many different ways.
