Republican presidential hopefuls are stepping up their attacks, as a new poll in Iowa shows Donald Trump's lead is only getting bigger. And under pressure. The president of the University of Pennsylvania is forced out and now calls are growing for Harvard's president to resign after her widely panned comments on the rise of antisemitism on campus.

And I just want to show you in Michigan specifically, Dana. Look what happens when you add in these independent third-party kind of candidates.

This idea that he inflated his wealth that all of this was just for tax purposes, but it wasn't actually who he was that made up. And that is part of something that has really bothered him.
