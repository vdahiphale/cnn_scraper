Here's what we know. The IDF is currently conducting air strikes against Hamas targets. It's a response to the massacre that it placed four days ago, and we are still counting the casualties and fatalities. The strikes are being conducted against infrastructure, against the Hamas command and control positions against their staging grounds, and we are making sure that they cannot repeat attacks in towards Israel. On the defensive side, we are making sure that those breaches, the 20 or so breaches along the perimeter of Gaza, are no longer able to be breached and our forces are very strong on the ground, in order to make sure that this attack, this most devastating attack, cannot be broadened beyond what they've already completed.

Not just because they are the militants that launched this attack, this unprecedented attack on Israel, probably one of the darkest days, single days in Israel's history since it was founded in 1948. But also of course, Hamas controls the Gaza Strip. It is effectively the government of the Gaza Strip. So from Israel's perspective, the line that we just heard from Peter Lerner just there, is that this is all on the head of Hamas and any consequences, whether its people suffering because of a lack of food or a lack of water or any civilian casualties, are also on the head of Hamas.",

The U.S., for its part, has been coordinating with leaders in Qatar as they continue with this mediation effort. Sources have told us that Qatar's Prime Minister met with Hamas leaders on Sunday and that things appear to be moving very, very quickly. But of course, no clear indication of where those talks stand at this stage. We have heard from U.S. defense officials who have said that they are offering support to Israel when it comes to efforts to rescue those held captive by Hamas in Gaza. That support, according to defense sources and officials, does not mean U.S. boots on the ground, but this will take the form of reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence support from the U.S. Now at this stage, the Israel Defense Forces haven't been able to give an exact figure as to how many Israeli citizens are currently being held hostage within Gaza.
