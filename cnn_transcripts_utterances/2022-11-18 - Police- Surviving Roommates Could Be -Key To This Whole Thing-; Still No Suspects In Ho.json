And public health officials I've talked to say this is just one example of what can happen when children are not up to date on their childhood immunizations and a highly contagious virus like measles enters the community and has an opportunity to spread.Now I did speak with officials in Columbus just this morning. Here are the latest numbers. They said that while there are many children under investigation, they have confirmed 19 cases. Although as you referred to, Erica, many more are suspected and are under investigation. All of the children are unvaccinated. And we should have a chart here explaining that these cases have been in 10 daycare centers and two schools. So that's part of the investigation. And these are young kids, Jim and Erica, they're under the age of four except for one who is six years old. Now again, the CDC has confirmed it's going to send a team to Columbus to help with this investigation. And as I said, measles is highly contagious, so much so that if one person is infected, 90 percent of those who come in contact with that person will become infected themselves if they are not vaccinated. And that's why public health officials say make sure your kids are up to date on their immunizations, including the MMR, the measles mumps, and rubella vaccine. Jim and Erica?",
