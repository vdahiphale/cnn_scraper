Where is Yevgeny Prigozhin, the leader of the armed rebellion against Putin? In a rare press conference today, the president of Belarus said Yevgeny Prigozhin is not there. The head of the Wagner group who marched on Moscow had been banned to Belarus by Putin. The whole deal was go to Belarus, go there. But according to Belarus' dictator, Prigozhin is not there and he could actually be in Putin's home city. Here is our Matthew Chance questioning President Alexander Lukashenko. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That after satellite images indicated there were bases being prepared. Now he said that Wagner fighters were also not in Belarus and were, in fact, elsewhere near the front lines in Ukraine.

And I appreciate both of you very much. Bill, so, obviously, we haven't seen Prigozhin since that armed rebellion 12 days ago. The part of the deal that was announced was he was going to Belarus. But Lukashenko says he's in St. Petersburg, maybe in Moscow, and we're seeing -- but he's a free man, he can -- he can do whatever he wants and I talked to him in the phone yesterday. Even though they've raided his houses and taken everything out of it and are, you know, humiliating him with all these wigs and everything else that they're parading around. What is going on here, Bill? BILL BROWDER, PUTIN CRITIC ON RUSSIA'S WANTED LIST:  Well, I think, first and foremost, I mean, he's -- he's committed the cardinal sin of making Putin look weak. Putin prides himself on being a strongman dictator and Prigozhin basically put a hole -- just sliced that reputation in half by marching on Rostov. Nobody stood in his way. They were cheering him on, taking selfies with him. Going on to Voronezh and then getting within two hours of Moscow. He's kind of a folk hero in Russia and he makes Putin look like a very weak man. And so, what's going on right now is the Russians are in a state of apoplexy, Putin particularly, because he's been challenged. His entire sort of strongman image has been challenged. So, Prigozhin surely doesn't want to be found right now. I can imagine if they're doing all these movies and opening these criminal cases against him, they would love to kill him if they could get their hands on him. And so, he's probably gone underground. He's a very dangerous man. He has a whole army of mercenaries and people loyal to him.",

That went to an outside law firm that had been representing this office seeking some of the same sorts of records from a cup of cases that had been filed here in Arizona.
