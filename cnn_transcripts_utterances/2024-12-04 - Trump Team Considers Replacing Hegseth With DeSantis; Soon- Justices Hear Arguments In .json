It is clear that his past and what he did and didn't tell the Trump administration about it is a problem. And since Trump announced his plans to nominate the former Fox News anchor a bunch of past allegations have surfaced of drunken misbehavior, sexual misconduct, and financial mismanagement of the veteran's nonprofit that he once ran.CNN's Harry Enten has the numbers on how much has changed for that man and how fast it has changed for him.

They went out to dinner at Jean-Georges. There it is -- that romantic dinner at Jean-Georges. Trump brought him out there. There's Reince Priebus.

Donald Trump don't normally come back to folks like that and give them jobs. I think the senator from Tennessee probably has a better shot if Hegseth don't make it. And just to be clear for everybody watching, I don't think there has to be all these FBI checks to see if somebody's qualified. I think a pretty simple Google search would tell you that Pete Hegseth, in my opinion, is not qualified. And now one thing that everybody needs to keep in mind is that these senators are elected to six-year terms for a reason. That means if there's a lot of them who Donald Trump can't threaten because they're not up for election in two years. They're not up for election in four years. They're not -- many of them -- 33 percent of them to be exact -- are not up for six years.

They say that Wen \"believed the North Korean government wanted the weapons, ammunition, and other military-related equipment to prepare for an attack against South Korea and military uniforms, which would subsequently be used by the North Korean military to disguise their soldiers to conduct a surprise attack on South Korea.\" Now, describing how this scheme worked the authorities allege that the suspect set up a front company in Texas where he procured ammunition, where he procured weapons, and then brought them to the Port of Long Beach here where I am near Los Angeles for shipment over to North Korea, often disguised in containers that had false manifests such as one item labeled a refrigerator, for example. Now, authorities spoke about the scheme and what they actually uncovered. I'll show you some of the pictures -- what they got from his residence as well as from his cell phone. They say that they got over 50,000 rounds of ammunition. They obtained a sophisticated device for chemical detection as well as another type of device that detects listening devices in a particular area -- all that prohibited to be sent over to North Korea. Now, authorities held a press conference yesterday. They described this scheme and what they think the results of this investigation actually led to. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) AKIL DAVIS, FBI ASSISTANT DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF L.A. FIELD OFFICE: Not only did the investigative team prevent additional restricted items from going to the North Korean regime, but they gathered valuable intelligence for the United States and all of our allies.

What we understand is that Musk is playing sort of a guardrail role in terms of who has access to Trump from the tech space.And Musk and Zuckerberg have had this sort of fraught relationship. As you said, Musk offered to fight Zuckerberg in a cage fight. That never really materialized. But Musk has been really critical of Zuckerberg and of Meta in the past of their content moderation policy. So some of what you're seeing from Meta where they're sort of talking about wanting to walk back content moderation and admitting that they made mistakes in that space may not be only an effort to sort of win over Trump but also Musk, who we know sort of has the closest connection to Trump at this point.",

Two council candidates deadlocked with the exact same number of votes at the end of their campaigns.So the city had to activate a tie-breaker plan that they had approved earlier in the year. Drawing straws was chosen as the most cost effective and time effective option. A special election, they say, could have cost upwards of $165,000 and those plastic straws probably cost about 10 cents. The only rule here is the longest straw wins. And after drawing straws, candidate Mathew Pratton beat out Bonnie Rodriguez for the city council seat. Rescue crews in Pennsylvania -- they have been working through the night searching for a missing grandmother who may have fallen into a 30-foot sinkhole. She was out looking for her cat and police say that 64-year-old Elizabeth Pollard -- she was last heard from Monday when she left her home with her 5-year-old granddaughter with her in search of the cat. Authorities then discovered Pollard's car parked near a restaurant -- her granddaughter still inside the car, and a deep sinkhole just steps away. Officials so far -- say that so far, monitoring equipment -- look how big that hole is -- monitoring equipment has not found -- picked up any sound from the sinkhole but they have seen a shoe on a search camera. And there's also this. Some folks in Oklahoma are definitely going to be getting some coal in their stocking this year after a tradition of airdropping toy paratroopers for kids turned messy and frankly, disappointing. A U.S. Army veteran known as \"The Flying Santa\" has been spreading holiday cheer this way by dropping these paratroopers -- these toys -- for the past four years. But as this -- at this year's event a crowd of about 100 people gathered and you can see what played out. Adults were seen in video pushing children out of the way and diving for the toys themselves.
