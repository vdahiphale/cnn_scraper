Israeli forces intensifying their attacks against Hamas with many civilians caught in the crossfire. We have new footage to share with you, but we must warn you it is graphic.The new video obtained by CNN shows a young girl being pulled from the rubble at the collapsed Al-Buraq school in northern Gaza. At this point, it's unclear what caused the blast, but sadly, it is just one of several incidents involving civilians today. There are reports of Israeli airstrikes damaging several hospitals as well. Now, the IDF maintains that it is exclusively targeting areas with ties to Hamas and that any civilian losses are unintended. The head of the al-Nasr hospital says that Israeli tanks are currently completely surrounding his facilities, cutting off patients and doctors from power, water and critical medical supplies. Now, a short time ago, we learned that President Biden spoke with the leader of Oman as unrest builds across the Middle East between the U.S. and Iranian proxies in the region. There are also growing international demands to further address the dire humanitarian crisis that is currently unfolding in Gaza. Speaking today after meetings in India, the Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, gave one of his most direct condemnations yet of the mounting death toll. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But what this official was warning the White House, the FBI, the CIA in this cable is that with all of this images coming out that we've been seeing in Gaza of the Palestinian civilians being buried under the rubble of all of the thousands and thousands of civilians being killed, it is sparking a real uproar and backlash in the Arab world against the United States because the U.S., it appears, to the Arab world is supporting Israel's campaign really unconditionally.And the sentiment that is being expressed to U.S. officials in the region is that they are \"losing the Arab publics for a generation.\" And that U.S. support for Israel is being seen in the Arab world as \"material and moral culpability\" in what they consider to be possible war crimes. So this backlash, obviously, it poses a serious risk, of course, to Americans who are in the region. And we have already seen Iran and its proxies exploit all of the tensions and all of the anger launching attacks on U.S. service members in the region. So it has real consequences. And the U.S. is trying to really toe this very delicate line between, of course, supporting Israel in its war against Hamas and retaliating for the brutal terrorist attack on October 7, then also disagreeing with how Israel is carrying out this operation. From the very beginning, they have been urging Israel to be more precise and more limited in its campaign something that Israel does not appear to have heeded over the last several weeks of its bombardment of Gaza. So the Secretary of State, he is resisting calls from these Arab allies for a ceasefire. And at this point, the U.S. is backing some humanitarian pauses.

First, I want to replay that video that was captured just moments ago, the bombardment in Gaza. To the untrained eye, it looks like just a series of explosions. But obviously, you can give us perspective on what's actually happening. Walk us through what we're seeing. MAJ. MIKE LYONS, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Sure. So Israel would own the night if it was a conventional fight with their night observation devices. But in the urban fight, which is where they're at right now, they can't use that technology. So what they've got to use is illuminating flares coming from artillery or mortar rounds that light up the sky for the soldiers on the ground to see. And then you can see what they're doing is they're calling in accurate artillery fire. I think that's the other side to this coin, is making sure that they're hitting targets that are, from their perspective, military targets. So it allows them to turn the lights on when they want, hit a target and then the illumination goes out, goes dark for a while. And then again, they decide to turn the lights back on. So this is a classic example of how you have to fight in an urban warfare setting.",

And I understand that he's communicating or they're communicating back to the United States.But at the end of the day, they're going to do their job and push back on this fight and recognize that Israel is fighting for their existence. And they're fighting for something that after being attacked. So again, as I look at those communiques, it's unfortunate that they're leaking. But I also don't think they're going to put any pressure on Israel just yet. I don't think Israel is stopping until it's convinced that Hamas has been roundly and soundly defeated, especially in the northern part of Gaza.",

And if I was the parent of a service member that was in Syria or inside of Iraq, and they were being attacked by these drones, I would say it's time to get them out. If we're not going to protect them like we should, it's time to withdraw them.And what I mean by that is responding proportionally, going after the leaders of these groups that are attacking our soldiers, not some ammo depots and dumps and the like, and not taking away their equipment, taking away the leadership that's making the decision. So I would like to see the deterrence escalated, but this - the administration does not want to see that, because it could eventually lead to something that they don't want to do with the Iranians. But again, from my perspective, we have to do more than just visual deterrence, which is really what we're doing.",

And so if they want to escalate, if they decide that it's important for them to escalate, then we'll see what happens. Then you'll see the true effect of having two carrier groups inside the Mediterranean like we do right now.Again, we have to ensure, we don't want this to escalate. But protection of our forces has got to be one of our primary objectives. It's not the primary objective and making sure that we can protect those troops, because if we can't, then let's just get them out of there and just decide that we're not going to even put ourselves into that fight.

Dean Phillips, the congressman from Minnesota, first and foremost. But by starting in South Carolina officially, he will not - he will likely not have a big challenge to his candidacy there.
