Among the alarming conclusions, Coast Guard personnel accepted behavior accepted this behavior as status quo. And the Coast Guard does not have measures to prevent sexual assault. Coast Guard personnel have been discriminated against and sexually harassed. C.G. indicates, \"We will not tolerate discrimination.\" Yet, even when found guilty of these, there are no consequences. One Coast Guard employee said the attitude is, \"I got through it, so can you, and the culture was boys will be boys.\" So even though this report was from 2015, CNN spoke to dozens of Coast Guard employees who say the culture hasn't changed.

He's not giving that demand. The Pentagon has not moved on that. But he's facing relentless pressure, including from his own party, to back off.

I don't know what they're going to do with the resolution. But we're going through all of the people that are up for promotion. We will promote people in the very near future. This is people that are running our military. I think that we need to make sure that people that are our generals and admirals should be vetted to some degree.
