I want to go through with you some of what we're hearing is coming out of these meetings that Kennedy's having on the Hill. Here's John Thune, top Republican in the Senate. He said, I think he understands the value and benefit that vaccines play and have played through the years preventing disease. Does Kennedy's record reflect that? DR. PAUL OFFIT, DIRECTOR, VACCINE EDUCATION CENTER AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PHILADELPHIA: Not at all. He believes that we have simply traded in infectious diseases for chronic diseases. He thinks that vaccination and pasteurization have made us unhealthy. He has consistently said that vaccines don't work, that they're unsafe, and that when data show him that he's wrong, like the notion that MMR or measles, mumps, rubella vaccine causes autism, he simply doesn't believe it because he has a fixed, immutable belief system that he holds with the strength of a religious conviction.

He talked about tuberculosis, smallpox, polio, and noting how that has now grown to the dozens.

This thing about transparency is very upsetting to me because you can see all the data that everybody else sees. It's all open to the public. I mean, when we, the FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee reviewed, for example, the COVID vaccines in December of 2020, we reviewed about 800 pages of data.That was all on FDA's website for anybody to look at. I don't know what Tommy Tuberville was talking about, but one thing that Tommy Tuberville said that should be a key to exactly what RFK Jr. is going to do is he said, I just talked to RFK Jr. And he -- we talked about how do we really need all these vaccines? That tells you everything about what RFK Jr. is about to do. He is about to do everything he can to destroy the vaccine program in this country.
