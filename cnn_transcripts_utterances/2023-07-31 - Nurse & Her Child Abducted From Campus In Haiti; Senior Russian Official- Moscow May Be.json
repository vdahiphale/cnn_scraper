A typhoon is expected to drop as much as 40 inches of rain. It has killed at least four people already. More than 31,000 people have been evacuated near Beijing, and another half million in the province, where the storm made landfall.Thousands in Niger railing against their French colonists by supporting Russia. Protesters who support the military crew in Niger came out in mass and the country's capital on Sunday waving Russian flags and shouting, long-lived Putin. The Kremlin has actually called for the release of Nigeri's democratically elected president Mohamed Bazoum. In recent years, Russia has attempted to capitalize on an anti-colonial sentiment in the country to bolster its influence on the American -- African continent. And at least a dozen people were killed and more than 120 injured when a fireworks warehouse exploded in Thailand. Police are planning to charge the owner of that warehouse. More than a hundred homes were damaged. The cause is under investigation but the initial report suggests there was a welding error. John?",

Her husband, the organization's founder, said his wife and child were abducted near the Capitol. CNN's Paula Newton recently returned from Haiti. Paula, what's the latest on this?",

What's so complicated here, though, John, is the fact that of was this targeted, was this not targeted, who even kidnapped her.A lot of the kidnappings that have been happening in Haiti of late have to do with gang violence. And then, of course, the kidnappings go along with ransom demands. Again, the family is actually asking people to not speculate on what exactly is going on in terms of negotiations, although U.S. authorities say they are very closely connected to this case and doing all they can. What's interesting here, John, is that they were actually taken from the Ministry itself just outside of Port-au-Prince. And this is a place that would have had some kind of security. But the charity itself posted in a statement saying that they were taken directly again from that ministry, which would have had a church and also I believe a school and some health facilities. I want you to listen now to Alix Dorsainvil in her own words about what she's doing on the ground there in Haiti. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And she will need them, given the fact that it is so difficult right now to ascertain exactly who took her. Why?And again, we're not talking sometimes about a very organized gang. Sometimes it can just be a group of a few individuals, which can be quite menacing as you can imagine, and terrifying, especially when there are no high-level negotiations taking place. Now, as I said, U.S. officials tell us they are aware and doing the best that they can to work with local authorities on the ground, John.",

They wanted Canada to lead. Canada has declined saying that they were looking for a Haitian-led solution.So, what now? Kenya indicated on the weekend that they would be willing to send in about a thousand troops in order to train police there. But this is not going to help the situation in the medium term. We have had some type of a truce with these gangs. John, we've also had quite a brutal vigilante uprising, which seemed to keep a lid on the violence for quite some time. But having said that, remember the United States already on Thursday, on the same day that this nurse and her child were abducted, asked for all Americans to leave Haiti and also evacuated its non-essential personnel. That gives you an indication, John, that they assumed this is going to get all a lot worse before anything gets better.",

His comments after -- come after a drone hit a Russian shopping center in Moscow overnight. We've got some video of that attack. You can see an explosion really on the streets of Moscow. There are no words if anyone was injured in that attack.Just yesterday, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the war is gradually returning to Russia's territory. Although we should say they did not claim direct responsibility for that drone attack in Moscow. I'm joined now by former CIA director and CENTCOM commander, General David Petraeus. General, I'll get back to the nuclear threat in just a moment. But first, you know, these drone attacks that are taking place on Russian soil. The Ukrainians don't claim responsibility for all of them. But what's the strategic game, if any, that Ukrainians get from this? GEN. DAVID PETRAEUS, FORMER CIA DIRECTOR: John, I think that the objective here is to again, bring the war to the Russian people, particularly those in Moscow. These are presumably Ukrainian-produced drones. They are targeting, according to individuals with whom I spoke, in fact, seven weeks ago, in Kyiv, legitimate military targets. Although they don't always end up hitting those, of course, because the air defense can deflect them. But I think these are similar to those Russian ethnic forces that were operating from Ukraine into Russia, the Legion, and so forth. What they're trying to do is again, to acquaint the Russian people with the fact that a war is going on. That it can have an impact on them. Ideally, that it's not going well for the Russians on the battlefield, in Ukraine. And also to distract them to a degree to require them to use assets to protect their own soil, their own ministries of defense, and so forth that can't be used, therefore, on the battlefield in Ukraine.",

As a mother you can really get caught up in the needs of your children and the seemingly endless giving. But when the chips were down, my children really showed up for me. I saw a side to them I had never seen before. And it made all of the difference. And as we know she, has rescheduled her North American tour. She is going to be going international for that leg of the tour in October. But all of her fans are just so happy to know that she's alive. She's recovering.
