Plus right now, the Former President is attending day two of the massive civil fraud case brought by the State of New York. And later this hour, my interview with, Will Hurd Republican Presidential Candidate and the Former Congressman from Texas. Hello, everyone, I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching here in the United States and around the world. It's 11 am here in Washington, Tuesday, October 3, 398 days until Election Day this is today's \"State of the Race\". Its House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's move now that Florida's Matt Gaetz made good on his threat to try to oust him on the House floor. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): I have enough Republicans where, at this point next week, one of two things will happen. Kevin McCarthy won't be the Speaker of the House, or he'll be the Speaker of the House working at the pleasure of the Democrats. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That vote is going to give us the first signs of where McCarthy stands. And at this hour, it seems pretty clear that McCarthy does not have the votes that he would need to kill Gaetz's push. And what this should show very clearly, McCarthy will need Democratic votes to stay Speaker of the House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): If you throw a speaker out, that has 99 percent of their conference, that kept government open and paid the troops, I think we're in a really bad place for -- (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I'm just saying it is possible. No, of course, Democrats don't help the Republicans at this point, a couple of things. One of the fundamental problems with McCarthy right now is he's not even capable politically of keeping to any deal he might come up with the Democrats. I mean, he couldn't even keep the deal he made with the President earlier this year. He has no credibility. It's very clear his caucus, the majority of them, they don't respect him. So even if Democrats came to him and said, do these 10 things, and we'll save you, there's no reason to believe he actually be able to take action on it. So I think that's one problem. The second thing is Democrats have been handed a message for 2024 a culture of disruption, dysfunction and chaos. We have saw it in the GOP presidential debate, we hit going on with Trump. We from the top to the bottom, we thought the hearings last week, were just a joke. And now they can't even get it together to you know, get the budget down. We had this Democrats had to step in then Kevin McCarthy goes out the next day and attacks them. Why and particularly if no other Republicans want the job? Why should we, you know, why should Democrats take it up? Let them have it. And again, then it gives a really important contrast for 2024 that they just can't govern. They're so dysfunctional, they can't govern.",

I think the Democrats have leverage, I think that they want to have policy wins. They want to have some political wins, too.

I think both sides are going to imposture and stay in their corners until very quickly, there's a deal.

My apologies for that but let's I want to game out kind of what happens here, because Ithink the thing that we may be on the verge of seeing that we don't have any real way to get our heads around, is having no Speaker of the House, right? Because if they vacate you know, if Democrats and I agree with you, Karen, it is a tough political position for them right now, all signs coming out of that caucus right now are that I mean, maybe they in the end will save him but they are not yet ready, like we are politically not in a place where they are ready to save McCarthy out of the gate. So if he lets you know this motion to vacate has to be dealt within 48 hours of Monday night when Gaetz didn't. So McCarthy has until then to decide what to do. But he ultimately will have to bring it up. If he doesn't have the votes and Democrats don't save him. What then happens is there's a list. And it's almost random. Someone else has a temporary Speaker of the House and they have to vote over and over and over and over again until they get to 218 votes.",

Let's also now go to this, which is something that Republicans also are spending a lot of time focused on,because frankly, it's easier for them to do that, than to focus on all the divisions we've been talking about here. The current president's son, Hunter Biden, has left a federal courthouse in Delaware, he pleaded not guilty to three felony gun charges, including lying to the ATF and possession of a gun while using an illegal drug. It's all related to a gun purchase he made in 2018. Hunter Biden was released on several conditions, including not using alcohol, drugs or a gun. Elliot, let's talk about this for a moment. I don't, you know, we're not making equivalence here. This is we're covering this because it's news. This is the son of a president. It is somewhat unusual for this to be prosecuted in this way. What are we going to see next in this case, obviously, the judge said Hunter had to show up today.",

Number two is Hunter Biden's attorneys I think are going to challenge the constitutionality of the very law that he's charged with because of the fact that there's a movement in the law, particularly on the right, but it's, you know, you know, where the Supreme Court is to strike down some of these gun prohibitions as violating the right to bear arms.

Now we are still waiting on an official statement from Jeffries. But you also heard him talking about how this was a moment for Republicans to decide to stand against Maga extremism, he did not indicate that Democrats were going to be coming to aid that effort. Obviously, this is a moment that a lot of Democrats have been waiting for. But I told, I was told that there were more than 30 members who got up in the Democratic caucus meeting and spoke about their distrust for McCarthy, making very clear that while this is an individual decision, the caucus seems very united on how to move forward right now. And obviously, Kasie, this has been, you know, sort of the question -- for the last month ever since Matt Gates had been threatening that he might move to vacate the chair tried to oust McCarthy. We've been asking Democrats, you know, was there something that they wanted? Was there some kind of legislative promise? Would there be some kind of power sharing agreement? What could be negotiated? But McCarthy made clear just about an hour ago, that there would be no power sharing agreement with Democrats that he's a Republican, he's a conservative, he didn't want to change the way he was governing. And that obviously could mean that at this moment, if there's no negotiation, if there's no gift from McCarthy, Democrats seem to be headed in the direction of they're just going to let this play out on the House floor with Republicans responsible for McCarthy's fate.",

But members very clear that they don't trust McCarthy and if that is the premise that you're going into this with, then it's very hard to imagine a situation in which Democrats might find a way to negotiate a deal with McCarthy, and actually believe him enough to make a step to save him. Now, I think one of the key questions is, if there's a procedural vote today on what is known as a motion to table, and Democrats do not vote for that there's going to be a final vote on whether or not McCarthy should keep his job. If that happened tomorrow, perhaps there would be time to have a conversation between Jeffries and McCarthy. But the two of them did speak yesterday. And there is no resolution to this point that McCarthy and Jeffries would have been able to reach an agreement. So it's hard to imagine, over the course of the next 24 hours, that would change but I always throw in the caveat. Never say Never up here.",
