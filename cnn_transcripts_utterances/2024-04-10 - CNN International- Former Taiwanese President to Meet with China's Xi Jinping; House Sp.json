      "sentences": "You know, it's all about optics at a critical time, Max, and we just learned that this meeting just took place. Chinese leader Xi Jinping held talks with Taiwan's former president in this rare encounter that recalls a past era of warmer relations.This is not an official visit, but this is the first time that a Chinese leader has hosted a former leader of Taiwan, and it comes at a critical time, just weeks before Taiwan inaugurates a new president, a new president that Beijing openly loathes and detests. Now, Ma Ying-jeou is the man who's in Beijing today. He's the ex- chairman of Taiwan's opposition, Kuomintang. He led Taiwan for eight years from 2008 to 2016. He arrived in China on April the 1st in what he calls a journey of peace and friendship. And Taiwan officials have told CNN that his meeting with Xi was moved to today to coincide with the Japanese prime minister's state visit to Washington. Now, Ma last met with Xi Jinping back in 2015 in Singapore. It was the first such meeting since the two sides split in 1949. It was a landmark meeting, and it took place just before Taiwan's current president, Tsai Ing-wen, won election. And China, again, openly detests Tsai and her party, the DPP, which is independence-leaning. China has ramped up recently some aggressive tactics, especially since the election in Taiwan earlier this year in January, which resulted in another presidential victory for the DPP. And analysts say that Beijing is using today's meeting to shape the hearts and minds of people abroad and also inside China. We spoke earlier to Wen Ti-sung. He's a Taiwan-based fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub. And he tells CNN this, quote: Ma's visit gives Beijing proof that there is still a significant portion of Taiwanese society that values shared ties of Chinese tradition and culture between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. He goes on to say: It is also a useful data point that Beijing can point to, to tell China's domestic audience that there is still reason to be patient with Taiwan, unquote. We also heard from Amanda Hsiao of the International Crisis Group. And she adds this, quote: For Beijing, Ma's visit is a useful way of assuring its domestic audience we have not lost the hearts and minds of the Taiwanese people. Now, China claims Taiwan as its own territory, Max, despite having never controlled it. Back to you, Max.",

And, you know, analysts I've been talking to say, for example, Ma Ying-jeou, this is a visit that keeps him relevant. You know, he is a former leader after all. And it's also a way to protect his legacy for him to be remembered as a Taiwan leader who managed to directly engage with Beijing.As for his party, the Kuomintang, they may be a little bit torn about this, because on one hand, we want to celebrate this meeting, this milestone. But it doesn't want to undermine its current leadership, especially as they're catering to a population back home in Taiwan that is a little bit more cautious, more weary, definitely, of closer ties with China, especially compared to a generation ago. As for Taiwan's ruling party and its supporters, they will likely play down this visit as just a private tour of China by Ma Ying-jeou, a man who is effectively a retired political figure.

But as Ukraine critics warn Johnson not to move ahead, many in both parties say the House's decision to slow walk an aid package could lead to a Russian victory. SEN. THOM TILLIS (R-NC): If we don't rearm them, then the coalition supporting them will fall apart, and it'll be on the hands of people who stand in the way of the supplemental or a viable alternative if the House can produce it to us. Get us something, but inaction's unacceptable. RAJU (voice-over): Two months ago, the Senate passed a $95 billion foreign aid package, with 22 Republicans voting for it, including Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell. SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), U.S. SENATE MINORITY LEADER: I hope that at some point here, the speaker will put the Senate-passed supplemental on the floor. RAJU (voice-over): Johnson is trying to narrow the Senate's plan and add new border security provisions, all while looking to turn Ukraine aid into a loan, an idea backed by Trump, but one generating skepticism. SEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): His positions are ever-shifting right on this, so it's a little bit hard to follow what it is day to day. RAJU (voice-over): It comes as Johnson is grappling with another major dispute dividing his conference, renewing an expiring law that gives the FBI the power to conduct warrantless surveillance. Still, Johnson could hang on, given many are skeptical about Greene's effort. REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): The last time I pulled the trigger on a motion to vacate, I could make a true promise to the country that we would not end up with a Democrat speaker of the House.

The state is doing nothing, he says. The city mayor said the flood has now peaked according to Russian State News Agency TASS. And the Kremlin spokesperson described the deluge in these regions as inevitable due to an abnormal increase in water levels. Dmitry Peskov also said that President Vladimir Putin is currently not planning on visiting the affected areas. Across the border, in Kazakhstan, the country's president said the floods were his country's worst natural disaster in decades. In Russia, the country's emergency situations minister flew over somewhat the flooded zones on Tuesday to inspect the damage.
