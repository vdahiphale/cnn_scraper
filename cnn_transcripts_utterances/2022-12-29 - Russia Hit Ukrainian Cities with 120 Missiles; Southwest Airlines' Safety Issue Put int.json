I'm Alison Kosik.Ahead on CNN Newsroom, relief is still days away for many Southwest customers as we enter day eight of the airline meltdown. I'll talk to an aviation expert about the federal ramifications. Plus, we'll have a live report on a deadly fire at a casino in Cambodia that's left seven people dead. And Pope Francis says Pope Benedict is very sick and asks for everyone's prayers. The latest from the Vatican. We begin with what Ukrainian officials are calling a massive missile attack on cities across the country. The Ukrainian air force says Russia is attacking from various directions with air and sea-based cruise missiles. CNN's Ben Wedeman joins us now from Kyiv. Ben, what's the latest?

Lviv, Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, Odessa, and other cities as well.Now, here in Kharkiv there doesn't appear to have been any major damage. One house was damaged from falling debris from a downed missile. There was also some damage to an industrial enterprise and a playground. But in other areas it appears that the damage may be more severe. In the western city of Lviv, the mayor says that 90 percent of the power has been knocked out there. There they have suspended the trams and trolleys. In the city of Kharkiv there were also reports of explosions there. The metro, the subway has been suspended. So, it does appear that this seems to be a nationwide attack by the Russians on the -- on Ukraine. Now, this was not unanticipated. Several days ago, there was an attack on the Engels 2 air base well inside Russia. Ukraine did not claim responsibility, but it was assumed that it was done by that. And it was only a matter of time. It was widely believed, that before the Russians took revenge for that. Alison?",

Thanks very much for your reporting.Now to the travel fiasco for Southwest Airlines, passengers are facing another day of cancellations today as the carrier struggles to get back on track. A pilot's union representative says it looks like the flight schedule will be mostly full by Friday. The airline has canceled more than 2,300 flights for today, but that number drops to only 39 cancellations by Friday. Airports are filled with long lines of Southwest passengers trying to rebook as piles of luggage continue to grow. While other airlines were covered from last week's winter storm fairly quickly, Southwest has not. On Tuesday, Southwest accounted for 84 percent of cancellations among all airlines in the U.S. On Wednesday, that number jumped to 91 percent. And for today, it's at 99 percent.

The question is whether they're going to use it and not just one area of the federal government, not just one branch.For example, the United States Department of Transportation and its Federal Aviation Administration needs to address this very promptly as to the effect on safety and the effect on the national aerospace system. Not only has Southwest said they could not keep track of their planes and pilots. And since aviation, including navigation and maintenance and safety really is a giant computer program. Everything runs on computers. And so, the FAA, the Federal Aviation Administration really looks in -- needs to look into whether they're able to run a safe operation and whether they're even able to be a big major national aviation operation. And of course, they also have a few international flights. So that's first and foremost. The other body of government that needs to be looking into this. Of course, United States Congress and U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, and they really need to evaluate whether it's time to re-regulate the airlines. In the past, they have punted. They said, we're going to do a passenger bill of rights. It has really never a materialized. Because once the airlines were deregulated decades ago, all of that customer service, you know, customer amenities, what you do for customers when they have been stranded, dumped, overbooked, et cetera, was really left to the airlines. And even this week, the United States Department of Transportation has said, well, we'll wait to see if the airline does the right thing. That's ridiculous. At this point, Congress needs to say the right thing does not serve the United States. It does not serve the passenger. And it could have a ripple effect around the world. So it's time for Congress to look at the law and whether it's time to get tough and re-regulate the airline operations.",

It is -- it is the, you know, the government that can return some of the rights to the passengers. And so in the past when we've had meltdowns and we've had other airlines meltdowns and other airlines have done so in the past. Congress has said that they're going to act. In fact, at one point they did pass a passenger bill of rights, which basically said you can't be stuck on a tarmac for more than three hours. And at that point you have -- you're allowed to be, you know, off aircraft. Or the government will find the airlines, but the fines go to the government, not to the aggrieved passenger. So, that's usually what Congress does, but it has really gotten to the point where you cannot conduct business or you cannot conduct your lives in the United States and rely on the airlines.

The U.S. will require all travelers from China to show a negative COVID test result before flying to the U.S.Before we got this official announcement, Beijing responded to potential travel restrictions from the U.S. by defending its COVID policy, accusing western media for hyping up China's COVID policy change and by urging countries to work together. This is what else the ministry of affairs spokesperson had to say. Quote, \"China has always believed that the measures taken by countries to prevent the epidemic should be scientific and moderate and should not affect normal people to people exchanges.\" Now, the irony here is that since the start of the pandemic, China has had some of the strictest border controls in the world, but now that the country is finally easing up and cases are surging, other countries are getting nervous. In addition to the U.S., Japan, India, Taiwan have put COVID testing requirements in place. In fact, Taiwan and Japan say if the traveler from China tests positive for COVID upon arrival, they'll have to quarantine for several days. Now, China has stopped reporting daily COVID cases on a national level, it's severely narrowed its definition of COVID deaths. Only reporting a handful of COVID deaths for the entire month. But Beijing says, look, everything is under control. Yet we know that hospitals are overflowing with elderly patients, and crematoriums across the country are overwhelmed. Fever and cold medicine are scarce. The big concern from some countries like the U.S. is the lack of data from China that could help detect new variants. GISAID, the global consortium that maintains a database of COVID sequences has said however, that China has ramped up the amount of data it's submitting, and that all the genome sequences shared so far closely resemble the variants already circulating in other parts of the world since July. But the U.S. says the data shared from China isn't enough. And look, it's not as if China has totally thrown open its own borders. China's border still remains largely close to foreigners, apart from a limited number of business or family visits. Selena Wang, CNN, Beijing.",

It's a pretty impressive facade and I think many of you will be familiar with the kind of layout that you used to in a big hotel like this. We know that 700 Thais were rescued, that gives you a sense of the number of people that may have been in the building. They've already been taken to Thai hospitals. To put it in context, even though this hotel, the Grand Diamond Hotel and Casino is in the town of Polpet, which is just over the border in Cambodia from Thailand, most of the people who go there to gamble are Thais. It's also a very popular stop off point for those people who are making their way to Siem Reap. That is where the beautiful home -- the beautiful temples of Angkor Wat are located. So, it's a big transit town. It's a very important business town as well, in terms of that trade between Thailand and Cambodia. But I wanted to give you that context because you can imagine that this hotel would've been very busy when this happened. Rescue workers also tell our teams over in Thailand when they arrive, pretty much the fire engulfed the whole building already. Pictures coming out overnight. You have scenes of the dark night sky, bright orange, amber, intense flames rising up (Inaudible) upwards. And also, I think it's, we have to point out that this is really a race against time when it is a situation like this. People also lost their life already in this (Inaudible). And we know that at least 11 people have died through smoke inhalation. This is something that creeps through every crevice in the building and it is absolutely toxic. People came out this morning. Onlookers, obviously this blackened (Inaudible) smoke rising, obscuring the sun to see what was happening. But you can imagine all of this blackened smoke really pushing out any sense of positivity this morning. This is what the pictures were as people woke up in Southeast Asia and for this town, which is incredibly popular with many of these tourists. I also just want to share that (Inaudible) we know that Cambodian authorities, and you mentioned this, are working with Thai authorities. This is because this is very popular with the Thai. The rescue workers were shouting out to try and help in the Thai language. My fear is, and the fear of people around is that death toll will go up. We're going to be monitoring the situation very closely, but rather sad news to wake up to here in Southeast Asia today.",
