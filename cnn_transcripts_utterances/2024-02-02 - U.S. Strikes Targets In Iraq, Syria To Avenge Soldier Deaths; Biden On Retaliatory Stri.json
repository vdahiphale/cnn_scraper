President Biden tonight ordering strikes against Iran's military and some of its affiliated militias, which the U.S. blames for the death of three American troops in Jordan. Now, Biden's green light comes after days of considering options and the reluctance to spark a wider regional conflict. Here's what we know at this hour. The Pentagon, it says that the U.S. forces have hit more than 85 targets in Iraq and in Syria from the air using long range bombers. The president says that this is just the beginning of a retaliation campaign and he warns of further strikes. Now, a U.S. general says that the operation took just about 30 minutes and likely resulted in some militant casualties, but they insist that the targets were chosen specifically to avoid hitting civilians. Now, remember, this is coming after weeks of tensions and provocations in the region by these militias since the Hamas attack on Israel. That includes the drone attack days ago on a U.S. outpost in Jordan. That's where the three service members that you see here were killed, dozens of others were hurt. Now, President Biden today attended the dignified transfer of their remains at Dover before the news of the strikes. Let's get straight to CNN Senior International Correspondent Ben Wedeman in Amman, Jordan. Ben, you're there on the ground. What will the wider regional implications be of these strikes?",

Certainly, what we're seeing is that they are picking their targets carefully. Certainly, there's been plenty of forewarning that this was going to happen.And we understand that many of the Iranian advisers in Syria and Iraq, as well as members of those militias, actually evacuated many of these facilities before they struck. But, certainly, this raises tensions, even further, tensions that were already very high as a result of Israel's war in Gaza. And it puts many of the governments in this part of the world in a difficult position. On the one hand, there's not much love lost between many of the pro- American autocracies in the Middle East and Iran. On the other hand, they're very sensitive to popular public opinion, because many people see the United States as a direct participant in Israel's war in Gaza because of its very generous military and political support for Israel. So, they're walking a fine line along with the United States. But the worry is that even though the United States has made it clear it will not strike Iran, the worry is that there could be a mistake, that some of these groups in Syria and Iraq, they don't take dictation from Iran, and oftentimes they act independently. And they could do things that could, in fact, draw the U.S. even further into basically what we're seeing as a medium-intensity regional war between the United States and Iran, but fought through proxies. The worry is that the war could be a direct military confrontation between Iran and the United States.",

So where do you do that and make that happen? And so that would be in Iraq and Syria, where IRGC officers are stationed, and they're providing arms and whatnot to the militias.

But its real use here and its utility, as you can see, as you have is the weapons and the number of weapons that it can hold compared to a smaller aircraft, so smaller number of aircraft necessary.And then there was also a lot of messaging ahead of time that a lot of leaks that have been gone uncontrolled, which should have been controlled at this point if it wasn't purposeful is what it sounds like, which I think was part of the messaging that we don't want to war with Iran.

The base actually protrudes across the base into Syria. And we saw previous strikes of a couple of F-16s bombing some small warehouses. It was sending a message.

But if we're going to limit our attacks only to the militia, then we need to be prepared for a long haul, a long slog, to take out sufficient infrastructure to get them to change their behavior.

I don't know. But I think, ultimately, the infrastructure and the decision-making mechanisms in Iran are the ultimate target, if we're intent on changing behavior.And I will say, Abby, kind of a big picture of comment here, why is all this going on? Well, the reason is, of course, is the war in Gaza. That is what is prompting this. So -- and this is kind -- I'll just reinforce a point I made before, that this issue is not soluble by military airstrikes alone. There has to be a political solution, first, to end the fighting in Gaza, and ultimately some sort of an arrangement to accommodate some sort of a two-state solution for the Palestinians.

Now, over on Capitol Hill, the House Judiciary Committee is issuing a subpoena against her. That subpoena is part of a broader investigation that focuses on Willis' use of federal funds.Now, Willis has yet to confirm whether she will comply with that order. For more on this, I want to bring in Pennsylvania Democratic Congresswoman Madeleine Dean. She's a member of the Judiciary Committee. Congresswoman, thanks for being here. On the subject of the subpoena from your Republican colleagues, do you think that there are any valid concerns here about how Fani Willis used federal money and, for that matter, state money given her admission of this personal relationship? MADELEINE DEAN (D) PENNSYLVANIA:  Thanks, Abby for having me on. And I am a member of the Judiciary Committee, but I think this is a misuse of our authority. Mr. Jordan is in the wrong lane. Any strangely in the wrong lane because as you well know, Mr. Jordan is 631 days under subpoena that he has never responded to. So, here he is issuing a subpoena against the D.A. in a state case. It's not our lane. We are not the prosecutors in that case. I'm very sad, upset for the prosecution of that case. Certainly, if there is an intra-office affair in this setting, it takes away from the work that all the good people there are doing, but we don't know the facts of that.
