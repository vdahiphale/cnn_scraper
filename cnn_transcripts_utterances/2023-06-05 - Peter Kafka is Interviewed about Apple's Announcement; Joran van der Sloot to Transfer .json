The White House has denied this and dismissed this as political attacks. And the FBI has urged caution in this in some of their letters to the committee, pointing out that the kind of document that they're going to show these lawmakers today shows information that comes from a confidential source, but it's information that's unverified, that's unsubstantiated. And we've learned from sources that these allegations sort of stem back to the kind of thing that Rudy Giuliani was sharing with the Justice Department back in 2020. At that time, DOJ was led by Bill Barr. This was during the Trump administration. And DOJ was pretty skeptical with these allegations. A lot of the information was coming from Ukrainian sources. And as you pointed out, when FBI and prosecutors started to review this information, they couldn't corroborate the claims. So, I think for Republicans, it's going to be sort of a heavy lift to try to prove to the American people if there's anything in this that is actually true. But, again, they want to move this process forward. They want to see this document today.
