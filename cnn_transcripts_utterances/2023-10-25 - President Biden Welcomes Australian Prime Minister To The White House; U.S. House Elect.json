Fifty other nations we've been able to put together, all doing our part to support Ukraine. And I want to thank you, Mr. Prime Minister, for the new package in military aid you recently announced, and I -- it's for Ukraine. Look, Australia and the United States also share in my view the commitment to upholding international rules through the road, including freedom of navigation. Just this past week, the PRC vessels acted dangerously and unlawfully as our Philippines friends conducted a routine resupply missions within their own exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea. I want to be clear, I want to be very clear. The United States defense commitment to the Philippines is ironclad. The United States defense including the Philippines is ironclad. Any attack on a Filipino aircraft vessels or armed forces will invoke our mutual defense treaty with the Philippines. And Mr. Prime Minister, today, we renewed our commitment to defend the values that are at the heart of this alliance. And we continue to stand as one to forge a better future for both of us and all the region. So I want to thank you again for being here, thank you for your partnership and your leadership in this critical moment. And I'd like to now turn it over to you.",

And hence, I welcome the fact that I have been invited to China, I'll be traveling at the same time as we will commemorate 50 years since the first visit by an Australian Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, to China. In a short period of time now, and I think that is a positive thing. It is good that various senior representatives in the U.S. administration have had meetings with their Chinese counterparts in recent times because dialogue is always a good thing. Through dialogue comes understanding and comes a diffusion of tension. We want a peaceful and secure region, but we want one as well that's based upon the rule of law. And we're national sovereignty including issues such as the South China Sea and the rite of passage in that important waterway there, that is China Sea, the Taiwan Straits is respected.

But the fact is that, I have met with Xi Jinping more than any other world leader has. I've been in over 68 hours of private meetings, he and I with simultaneous interpreters, it started back when I was vice president, it was appropriate for a president of the United States to be meeting with the vice president.

The Belt and Road Initiative has been -- ended up dead in the news where most of the people signed on. We are working with our G7 partners to provide infrastructure for the very nations that he's trying to deal with.

To that end, he spoke at length about Israel. He fielded several questions from reporters about Israel and about the conversations that the U.S. has had with the Israeli government and its perspective on how things should go from here. President Biden denied that he had told the Israeli government to delay a ground incursion to be able to deliver humanitarian aid and get hostages out. He said that if it is possible to get those folks out safely, that he wanted them to do that. But he said that it's Israel's decision and that it remains a question as to whether the hostages that are being held by Hamas can even be extracted safely. He also cast some doubt on some of the claims of casualties in Palestinian Territories by Hamas, saying that, essentially, that there is no notion that the Palestinians are telling the truth about how many lives have been claimed. And he says, that is the price of waging a war. But of course, he did this against the backdrop of a bilateral state visit with the prime minister of Australia, where the topic at hand was supposed to be China, was supposed to be the alliance, strengthening the Indo-Pacific. But certainly, the conversation has shifted elsewhere.",
