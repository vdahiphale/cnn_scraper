And the reason for that is they want to make sure that the Lebanese military, which is supposed to patrol, can be in place and there won't be any gap or any vacuum that could be taken up by others. When it comes to northern Israel, there is concern that there is still a threat on the border. You have some 80,000 residents of northern Israel that have been evacuated from that area now for well over a year. They've been in other parts of Israel. So it could potentially take a little longer to gain the confidence on the Israeli side that this really has come to an end. Bear in mind, this is a 60-day ceasefire. It is a significant move, it is a significant step, but it isn't at this point a permanent ceasefire. That is what it is hoped to turn into, Max.

It's significant to say that the U.S. and France, this isn't the end of their role. There is going to be a monitoring mechanism, a multinational committee, if you like, and it will be chaired by the United States. France will be heavily involved as well. So if there does appear to be a violation of the ceasefire terms, they are supposed to be the first port of call. They are supposed to be reported to, the diplomats and the military of those two countries, and they are supposed to help the Lebanese military negate whatever violation is perceived to have happened.

Thank you so much for joining us, Ron.I think a lot, what a lot of people are confused by here is that Donald Trump promised to bring prices down during the election, and this by definition will increase prices, which he'll be aware of, won't he? What do you think he's thinking? RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SR. POLITICAL ANALYST AND SR. EDITOR, \"THE ATLANTIC\": Well, look, I mean, this was the tension all the way throughout, because not only do economists almost universally, with the exception, as the report noted, of people in his actual inner circle, believe that tariffs will be passed on to U.S. consumers and result in higher prices. But the mass deportation program that is the other pillar, really, of his domestic agenda is widely considered to be inflationary by reducing the labor force in key areas like construction and agriculture. So, you know, this was a challenge for the Harris campaign all the way throughout. I mean, you had analyses from Moody's and J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street firms consistently concluding that if Trump actually moved down the roads that he proposed, that prices would be more likely to go up than down in his presidency. And yet for most voters, you know, the immediate comparison, you know, that their frame of reference was that prices were more affordable when Trump was president than when Biden was president. It was hard to get them to look forward, not back. I think Trump, you know, believes that perhaps that he can bluster and move these other countries in this direction without actually imposing these tariffs. But he is obviously taking an enormous risk, both with the domestic economy and with U.S. international relations.",

I think, you know, Wall Street, by and large, is, you know, anticipating that this is kind of bluster and negotiating tactic and discounting the possibility. I think it's, you know, premature to assume that Donald Trump does not mean what he says. I mean, you know, the history in the U.S., the research by academics is that presidential candidates try to do what they say when they get elected. They don't always succeed in doing it. They get stopped sometimes by Congress, sometimes by the courts. But I think it is kind of overly sanguine to assume that everything that Trump is kind of, you know, all the saber rattling is only that and that none of this can come to pass.

Last week, Ukrainian forces used the U.S.-provided longer-range missiles for the first time to target military infrastructure inside Russian territory. For Ukraine, the fighting grinds on as the war approaches the three- year mark. The outlook seems bleak for one unit in Pokrovsk that's so low on infantry, it's resorting to drones instead.

Russia advancing too fast here, south of Pokrovsk in the east, to miss any chances. The skyline speaks of how Pokrovsk is in Russia's crosshairs. Ukraine is short of manpower, but it is so bad here, they say they must rely on drones, not infantry, to slow a brazen Russian daylight assault like this one. UNKNOWN (translated): The situation is very critical. We lack infantry to fight and hold out for some time while the attack drones do their job. That's why we often see the enemy uncomfortably penetrating vulnerable areas. PATON WALSH (voice-over): Watch how the first Russian tank here is relentless. A Trump presidency and possible peace talks loom. Do they even have time for that here? UNKNOWN (translated): I cannot say how much time we have. If there is any time at all. Because now they are pushing their troops to the front as much as possible. And then at one point they will go for an assault. They can go very far in one moment. PATON WALSH (voice-over): Talk here is abnormally negative, with weeks of costly and chaotic retreat on film. Like these Ukrainians hit when they're mistakenly told this building didn't have any Russians in it. This house has an encircled Ukrainian drone unit without any infantry to help fight advancing Russians. So they send a drone to fly just 30 meters across the street.

This footage shows a local in Orange who's shown Russians where Ukrainians were hiding. They are led out and shot while face down. Part of a pattern of surrendering Ukrainians executed, say prosecutors investigating this incident a fortnight ago. Pokrovsk, key site, bombed, but so far spared Russia's trademark devastation.

And I think that soldier, laced with profanities as it was, lays out the issue better than anyone can, which is Ukraine is caught in the middle here. That is the headline.If Trump and President Putin begin to compete with each other, and I'm using the non-profanity version of what he said, Ukraine is caught in the middle. I am out of men. I am alone. I do not have the resources I need to fight. And so in that report from Nick Paton Walsh, you're really getting the read of what's happening on the ground.  Yes, President Biden recently approved the use of these ATACMs, these U.S.-made long range missiles to fire inside Russia. But that has made no difference on the ground as of yet. Ukraine is on the back foot. It is losing soldiers quickly.  It is losing resources quickly. And it is ceding land to Russian forces who are absolutely right now have the momentum with them. And President Putin has responded to the use of these ATACMs by lowering the threshold of the nuclear doctrine, by using an experimental new ballistic missile on a city in Ukraine earlier, and by continuing to push with quite a level of ferocity, both in Kursk and in the Donetsk region, in that area that Nick Paton Walsh saw those soldiers, of course, struggling, unable to find men. So sending drones instead of actual soldiers to do the fighting. There's also reports that the North Korean factories, you'll remember that Russia is sourcing weapons from North Korea, that some of these factories are actually expanding, meaning making more weapons. This is significant because we've seen this surge of ballistic missiles being fired at Ukraine. And about a third of those missiles actually come from North Korea. So, again, another indication that President Putin is not just getting more men via North Korea, you'll remember more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers on the ground, but also more weapons. He has an arsenal that's growing while Ukraine is looking at a President Trump that they fear will close the door on the resources they need.",

If you're over the age of 35, you're still operating on the old boundaries. You're like, no, Israel's the most moral democracy in the Middle East, maybe in the world, right?
