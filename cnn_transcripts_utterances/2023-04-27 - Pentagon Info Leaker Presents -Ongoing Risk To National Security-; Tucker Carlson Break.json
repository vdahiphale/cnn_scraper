A federal judge is going to decide whether he is going to stay in jail while he awaits trial.And now, prosecutors are going to see if they are exaggerating the threat to national security while overnight they filed new documents overnight, saying he made a deliberate effort to disseminate this country's secrets. They claim he also made regular comments about violence and murder and spoke about wanting to, quote, \"kill a ton of people.\" This is what investigators found in his bedroom. They say that Teixeira had access to an arsenal of weapons and including handguns and rifles and a gas mask. Jason Carroll is in Worcester, Massachusetts, outside of the court. What new details are emerging today and what do you expect?",

      "sentences": "Well, John, as you can imagine, a lot of new details are emerging in the 11th hour court filing. First and foremost, Teixeira viewed hundreds of thousands of documents and, if he is out on bail, he will have access to some documents.And they say that the defendant knows where is the information and how to access it and based on his specialized I.T. skills, he presumably knows how to disseminate the information without immediately being contacted there. And in addition, the defense, for its part, put out a response, if you will, to what their thought is about this. And the argument that, namely, he is not a, quote, \"serious risk of flight or obstruction.\" And if the judge allowed bail, maybe he could do it with conditions, such as being released to his father, confined to his residence and could undergo location monitoring and no contact with witnesses and no access to the internet. So they are setting forth, that those could be some of the conditions of the bail. And again, the prosecutors are saying that, once he learned and got wind that authorities were on him, he got a new email address and a new phone and he told people, quote, \"delete all messages\" and \"if anyone is coming to look, don't tell them (INAUDIBLE).\" He allegedly also destroyed some of his items, like a gaming console and a laptop that he put in a Dumpster. And also they're disturbed by some of the things that he searched, like Ruby Ridge, the Las Vegas shooting, Mandalay Bay shooting, the Buffalo top shooting and Uvalde. All these things will be taken under consideration in this hearing.",

Over at Newsmax, FOX's smaller right wing talk competitor, they are seeing an incredible surge. Last Monday's ratings, they were averaging 147 6000 (sic) viewers, not too many. But then Monday, they were looking at 531,000 viewers, four to five times higher. So this is a trend that shocked FOX, because it is happening again after the firing of Tucker Carlson.",
