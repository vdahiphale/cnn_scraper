Moments ago, the former president addressed supporters in New Hampshire and he thanked DeSantis for his support. All right, CNN's Alayna Treene is with the Trump campaign in New Hampshire.

Take a listen to how Trump put it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Before we begin, I'd like to take time to congratulate Ron DeSantis. And of course a really terrific person who I've gotten to know his wife, for having run a great campaign for president. He did. He ran a really good campaign. I will tell you. It's not easy. They think it's easy doing this stuff. Right? It's not easy. But as you know, he left the campaign trail today at 3:00 p.m., and in so doing, he was very gracious and he endorsed me so I appreciated that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But just hours after he dropped out and gave Donald Trump his endorsement, Trump is singing a different tune now.I think it's worth noting that that was actually the first time in months that Donald Trump had actually referred to the Florida governor by his name, Ron DeSantis, rather than the nickname that Trump has given him which is Ron DeSanctimonious. Very noteworthy I think for someone like me who goes to many of Donald Trump's rallies, I have not heard him use Ron DeSantis' real name in a very long time. Now I do just want to talk about, though, the attitude in which Donald Trump is approaching this. And I think it's a very stark contrast to what we've of course seen over the past year. I mean, DeSantis is someone that Donald Trump had attacked for several months, that most viciously attacked him, I'd argue, in the lead-up to Iowa. And part of that was because the Trump campaign was concerned about his candidate at one point, but also because it was very personal to Donald Trump. And from my conversations with Trump's advisers, they argue that it's still unclear whether or not the Trump campaign will actually embrace DeSantis as a potential surrogate. But I can tell you that as of now there are no plans for DeSantis to join him on the campaign trail.",

I beat Biden. I beat him by up to 17 points. This is a fact we don't want a President Kamala Harris. That should send a chill up everybody's spine.

And then in their theory, the centrist parts of the party most resistant to Trump would have no choice but to rally around DeSantis, even if they didn't like many of his positions.And that theory crashed and burned. You know, you saw in Iowa, he only won about 10 percent of voters who identified as part of the MAGA movement so he failed to crack the Trump base. But in the process, he alienated a lot of the voters in the center and left the room for Haley to emerge.

I can -- he says, they are trying to say he's cognitively impaired because when I use -- when I talk about Barack Hussein Obama, he's using the former president's middle name, when he gets Obama confused with Joe Biden. Trump is claiming that he's not cognitively impaired when he says that. But just the other night, he confused Nikki Haley with Nancy Pelosi. And there have been a series of these.

And there is a perseverance and I'm sure a loneliness of trying to take on Donald Trump at a point when so many in the party are coalescing around him, for their own reasons.In many cases like the South Carolina contingent who came up here yesterday. But having said all that, what she has shown this week is that she will go so far and no further in directly challenging Trump. She is comfortable challenging Trump on issues where she does not have to express a value judgment about him. She talks about generational change. She talks about electability.

You know, DeSantis was squeezed because he couldn't break into the right and he lost the center. Obviously she is not going to get the right.

But it was 2016 all over again where all of these people ran against Donald Trump on the assumption that at some point Trump would falter or, you know, be convicted or something, and then they would be the heirs to the Trump voters.

I think 2018, 2020 and 2022 were really serious, you know, ego bruising rebukes from a lot of voters to a lot of Trump voters. And I think because of that, these voters have kind of constructed this alternate universe where they really are a majority. Trump is really popular. All of these things that happened are just rigged elections or put-up jobs or politically motivated prosecutions. And I think, you know, the cognitive dissonance of realizing that how many people don't want Donald Trump to return to office has made a lot of these folks dig in and wanting to return him to office out of pure spite rather than anything they think he'll do for the country, which is really, you know, pretty unfortunate way to vote but Trump voters have always been kind of, you know, vengeful, resentful group and I think that Trump's multiple losses and the multiple Republican losses over these past years have really turbocharged that sense of resentment.

The Republicans in Congress trying to make tradeoffs when a nation that's a democratic nation like ours, that is looking to us for help for their sovereignty and their freedom, we're debating that.It just doesn't make sense to me from a political perspective as a soldier that this kind of thing would be going on in Congress.

Because of the fight that the Ukrainians have showed, that's difficult to quantify and they still have the ability to conduct asymmetrical attacks like we were talking about earlier. HERTLINGlong it's going to take, Jim, I don't know. Having been a commander on a battlefield once where the supply lines were interrupted, you have to do a lot of things to adapt to that. I can't imagine what Ukraine is doing right now, what their commanders are having to do when you're talking about the depletion of artillery rounds, the depletion of equipment that's being damaged or destroyed, and how they're making that work. So in that case, a commander has to pick and choose their fights. And that's tough to do when you're trying to gain momentum in an assault. Both sides, Russia and Ukraine, are in an operational pause right now. Ukraine, because of the supply difficulties. And I would suggest Russia because their soldiers are getting killed by the dozens, by the hundreds on a daily basis because they're still having challenges with maneuver and attacks in different areas.",

They really do see this as a one-on-one contest, but there are some concerns. And it does bear out in their own internal research that a lot of undecided voters still just don't see President Trump as the likely Republican nominee. And until that happens, it's very difficult for them to make the choice argument, the contrast argument with President Trump. Right now it's Biden running against sort of an abstract Republican. Once Trump is the nominee, they think it will be very easy for them to make this argument that Biden makes all the time to compare me not to the Almighty but to the alternative.

There's been a Super Bowl in this country for nearly 60 years, and the Detroit Lions have never played in it. In fact it gets worse, over the last 30 years, they've never even won a playoff game. They've had 11 head coaches in that stretch, though. So to say that Lions fans have been in need of something like this for a long time, there are whole humans in Detroit who have never seen this team win a playoff game. And now that they have won two, the impact on the city has been amazing, Jim. And some of it's been financial. City officials estimate that with each of these two playoff home games that they have made $50 million in economic impact on the city a pop, each week. And then emotionally, you just have a city that frankly has been a punching bag for national politicians for years, all the ups and downs with the auto industry. You have very diverse population there, which makes the city stronger but has also led to people, you know, maybe not having something in common to root for. And this has given them that.
