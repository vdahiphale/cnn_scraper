Let's go now to Nic Robertson in Ukraine.President Zelensky has attendance there at the G7 Summit, significant moment for his country after we watched his tour of Europe not too long ago. He's now in Japan. NIC ROBERTSON, CNN International Correspondent: Yes. And his meet again with the Italian Prime Minister and the British Prime Minister. And that tour in Europe was to those G7 European members. It was Italy, it was France, it was Germany, it was the U.K. And so U.K. has -- that really seems to have been the heavy lifter on getting the F16, the fighter jets, the training for Ukrainian pilots and possibly procurement and provision of these important fighter planes for Ukraine, an important ally and getting that moving. And, you know, President Zelensky, when meeting with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak today was thanking him for his help in that process. Obviously, when they're all sitting in the room with the G7, Zelensky, when he speaks the G7 collectively will want those other voices of the European leaders to follow them behind him and give him support if President Biden is still feeling a little cautious about how much engagement and how quickly the United States engagement should be with the F16 fighter aircraft. Although the United States is not going to stand in the way of other allies providing those aircraft. But I think also an important meeting for Zelensky today was a meeting with Narendra Modi, the -- the Indian Prime Minister, a huge country, very important, influential on the world stage, important with other partners around the world. And Narendra Modi, of course, still buying Russian oil. That money in Zelensky:s ailes -- eyes is what goes to fund Russia's war in Ukraine. So the conversation there, we don't have all the details of it. But undoubtedly Zelensky will be trying to put forward his views about that. And what we've heard from Narendra Modi on it and saying, look, he realizes and believes that this -- this war in Ukraine is bigger than just Ukraine. It affects the whole world. This is something he says that goes beyond politics and the economy. It's a humanitarian issue. And he pledged to Zelensky, to do everything he can to help find a solution. I think Zelensky will want to say, OK, let's see how you achieve that. From his perspective, of course, cutting off additional funds getting to Russia payments for oil. That would be a big step.

But all the support infrastructure.I push back a little bit in terms of what you said in terms of today's no is tomorrow's. Yes, I think it -- the Biden Administration and NATO as a large group have been masterful in getting the right things at the right time. So this comment on F16s that will come months away is really talking about further commitment to Ukraine. And I think that bothers Russia quite a bit, that the Western Allies are staying alongside President Zelenskyy and his country. It's the right thing to do. But when you talk about cost of these military equipments, whether it be tanks or high Mars, or jets, which costs billions of dollars in this package, you're talking about politicians that also have to persuade their Congresses and their parliaments to allow these kinds of things to be delivered. These are just not items that are sitting on a shelf somewhere that you give away for free. These are things that have been purchased by the various Defense Departments of countries and they have to understand that it's taking away from their capability to give to Ukraine. So it's -- it's a very difficult decision-making process. And I know everybody wants to give Ukraine everything they have right now. But it's a whole lot tougher than doing just that.",

On one hand, we heard from President Biden a few hours ago who projected optimism about the state of negotiations. We heard in a clip just a few minutes ago, at the top of the show, he basically said he was not at all concerned about the state of negotiations. Obviously, on Friday, we saw that major back and forth where negotiations hit a snag at the Capitol. Negotiators left the room saying that progress wasn't being made. Eventually, they came back into the room where they had a candid conversation according to sources in the room. But they left with -- and you're right. No indication that a deal was being made or when they could meet back up.Still in Japan this morning, President Biden really described it as kind of the natural ebb and flow of how these major negotiations will go. But on the other hand, we heard overnight from Communications Director Ben Lebeau of the Whitehouse who really slammed Republicans about the same negotiations. He said and I'm to read this to you, Republicans are taking the economy hostage and pushing us to the brink of default, which could cost millions of jobs and tip the country into recession after two years of steady job and wage growth. There remains the path forward to arrive at a reasonable bipartisan agreement if Republicans can come to the table to negotiate in good faith. [08:15:09] So that comment there kind of showing the deep frustration that there is among people in the Whitehouse about Republicans. And also Republicans have deep frustration about the Whitehouse. And I'm feeling like they won't move off those spending cops that have always been present. But, of course, still, there is a long way to go when it comes to making a deal. But we know that X date is June 1st when the country could possibly default on the debt for the first time in the nation bringing about as the White House has said repeatedly economic consequences. And of course, this is something that has shadowed the President Trump, so we're expecting to hear more from him as the days go on trying to really get some type of deal between both parties.",

So it certainly gives you a sense of that urgency as authorities here on the ground tried to find more room for these asylum seekers. And it's one of the reasons why on Friday, they opened up the Asylum Seeker Arrival Center here in Midtown's Roosevelt Hotel. This is a facility that will serve at least or at least be used in two separate ways. One, sort of a central location where many of these migrants will be processed, will be offered some of those resources by some of those nonprofits.

So inherently, there's going to be more sugar offered in the bread items that are frequently offered to students at breakfast. I'm more concerned about antibiotic use.
