Thousands of soldiers killed on both sides. According to NATO officials, for every one Ukrainian soldier killed, there has been five Russian troops killed in this fight. The city of Bakhmut itself largely destroyed. By some estimates, 90% leveled. That means homes, businesses, life itself absolutely decimated by this near constant artillery and shelling.
