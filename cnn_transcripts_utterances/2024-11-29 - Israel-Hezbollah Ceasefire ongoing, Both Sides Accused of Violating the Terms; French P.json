Israel's military claims it killed more than 2,500 Hezbollah operatives since late September when the military ramped up its offensive in Lebanon. Meanwhile, the Lebanese army claims Israel has breached the terms of the ceasefire numerous times since it went into effect on Wednesday morning. The people of Lebanon, meanwhile, are desperate for a return to normalcy. Thousands were displaced by the 13 months of fighting, have started returning to their homes and businesses, many of them destroyed amid Israeli warnings that some areas aren't safe yet. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's ready for a ceasefire in Gaza at any moment, but he added that he's not ready to end the war there until Hamas is completely dismantled. In an interview with Israel's Channel 14 on Thursday, Netanyahu also said the conditions for a hostage deal have changed for the better. He claims that a lot is being done to secure a deal, but declined to elaborate further. All right, I want to go live now to Abu Dhabi and CNN's Paula Hancocks.

Now, it has been welcomed with relief and celebrations in many parts of Lebanon. But there is concern that the next two months could see a return to the fighting. And part of that is fueled by what we're hearing from Israeli officials, that if they believe that the terms of the ceasefire are being violated, then they will retaliate. And we heard from the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in that interview with Israel's Channel 14, saying that if this framework, this ceasefire is violated, it will lead to an intense war. So it is holding for the most part. We have seen the Israeli military saying that they targeted what they said was terrorist activity in a facility used by Hezbollah to store medium-range rockets in southern Lebanon. They say they carried out an airstrike, and in a separate incident, they say that they targeted suspects in southern Lebanon as well. The Lebanese army, for its part, which is supposed to be patrolling southern Lebanon to make sure that Hezbollah cannot rearm, that's part of the terms of this ceasefire, say that Israel has breached the terms several times as well. But for the most part, it is holding. The 60 days will be key because it will take that long, according to the Israelis, for them to be fully out of southern Lebanon. Kim?",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEVE CONTORNO, CNN SR. REPORTER: 24 hours after President-elect Donald Trump and Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum had a conversation by phone, there seems to be a disagreement over what exactly was said and agreed to. Trump writing on Truth Social that, quote, \"Mexico's president has agreed to stop migration through Mexico and into the United States, effectively closing our southern border.\" In a second post, Trump added \"Mexico will stop people from going to our southern border effective immediately. This will go a long way toward stopping the illegal invasion of the USA. Thank you.\" In a press conference on Thursday, though, Sheinbaum had a different interpretation of the call. She said, quote, \"Everyone has their own way of communicating, but I can assure you I give you the certainty that we would never and we would be incapable of it to propose that we would close the border. It has never been our approach. And of course, we don't agree with that.\" This all stems from Donald Trump's threat to put a 25 percent tariff on Mexican goods if the country doesn't do more to slow the flow of migrants and drugs across the U.S. southern border. Now, it was not immediately clear what policy concessions Trump had actually won in his negotiation or if the Mexican president had promised enough to get rid of that threat of a 25 percent tariff. When I asked the Trump transition team if that was the case, I did not immediately get a response. Steve Contorno, CNN, West Palm Beach, Florida. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

You see these messages, you see these indications for the Israelis that they are ready to go back to all-out war on Lebanon if they don't feel it's happening in the south is frankly to their liking. So the question I think is going to be whether or not that calculus holds. Again, I think it does because of the fact that you have the Trump administration coming in less than 60 days, a Trump administration that does not want to deal with another in the region. So I think that that's, you know, weighing very heavily in that regard. I think you have the Lebanese, wanting a ceasefire, so that's of the issue. The issue will really be an internal Israeli issue, because there are very powerful voices within Israel that are keen to return to war, to actually expand the war on Lebanon. But at the moment, the calculus from the Israeli leadership, from Benjamin Netanyahu, is we've gotten what we can get from Lebanon.

It is thought to be a young specimen of a gharial type crocodilian that was likely three to four meters long.Adults of the species could grow up to nine meters in length. While it once inhabited Peru and neighboring countries, this type of crocodile no longer exists on the entire American continents and is now only found in Asia. The discovery was made in fossil-rich desert regions of Peru and is notably well preserved, missing only parts of the animal's left limb and tail. The first North Atlantic right whale calf of the season has been spotted off the coast of the Carolinas. The young whale was seen alongside three potential mothers, with researchers unsure which of the older whales the calf belongs to. Wildlife advocates the sighting is cause for hope, given the species is nearing extinction, mainly due to human interaction. It's estimated that only about 370 of the massive creatures remain, including fewer than 70 reproductively active females. Offshore wind turbines are a great source of sustainable energy, but these giant structures are often stationed out at sea in windy areas with choppy waters, which makes maintenance a challenge. Well, now a team of robotics engineers may have created an A.I.-powered solution. Michael Holmes tells us more.
