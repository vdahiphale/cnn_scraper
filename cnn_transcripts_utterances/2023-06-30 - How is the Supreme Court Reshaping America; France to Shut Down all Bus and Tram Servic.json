      "sentences": "Well, this hour European countries issue travels advisories for France after a third night offurious protests and concerns over further violence. And these are live pictures of protesters who are back for a second day in Iraq. These are demonstrations outside the Swedish Embassy protesters demonstrating western values. This was after a man was allowed to burn the Quran in front of a mosque on one of Islam's holiest days in Stockholm. Also, this hour just breaking the Supreme Court has blocked Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness program aimed at delivering up to $20,000 in relief for student borrowers. And in another landmark ruling they have ruled some businesses can refuse service to members of the LGBT community. And tonight, documents shared exclusively with CNN show that Russian General was a secret VIP member of Wagner, the group that carried out brief revolts in Russia last weekend. He has not been seen since that aborted rebellion. The U.S. Supreme Court has been handing down major decisions to wrap up their term. And on the last day, which is today that was the last day to issue opinions it has handed down two big ones in the last hour. First, the court ruled in favor of a website designer in Colorado, who objected on religious grounds to providing her services for gay weddings. Second, the justices struck down the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness plan, and it is a serious setback for the White House although it was long expected to draw legal scrutiny. Well, rulings on those cases come on the heels of one striking down affirmative action the decision which effectively means that colleges in the U.S. can no longer take race into account as a specific basis for admissions. It reverses years of precedent comparable to another move last year, when the very same court struck down the constitutional right to an abortion. CNN White House Correspondent Stephen Collinson writes and I quote him here both rulings these original two and a flurry of other right wing jurisprudence by the courts bold new majority often on freedom of religion cases that please conservative Christians are the products of decades of activism by the conservative judicial movement. Unlike liberals, right wing legal activist prioritize the ideological reconfiguring of the High Court as a litmus test in federal elections at all levels. And they fast tracked cases on key issues through courts to exploit the Supreme Court's new makeup which of course is conservative. So tonight, we ask how the U.S. Supreme Court is reshaping the fabric of America. Senior Political Analyst for CNN, John Avlon joins us now. John, let's start right there with our big question tonight, are these decisions made by the Supreme Court the highest court in the land reshaping the social fabric of America?",

The totalaverage debt balance is about $40,000, as I understand it, in the U.S., affecting nearly 44 million borrowers. That's more than $1.7 trillion across the U.S. This was a major campaign pledge by Mr. Biden. He says he will announce further actions on student loans today. But this could be very consequential for him politically, could it not?",

Not only that, but as a current article on CNN shows, this is something that is broadly popular over 6 percent of the American people support this plan, which was a forgiveness for up to $20,000 for those individuals. So politically, I think like much like the Dobbs decision, this could be a real negative for Republicans. But I think the underlying issue here is whether the President the administration has the authority to forgive those college loans. That is ideological, to some extent, it's very political, and it flies in the face of popular opinion. But as you note, the White House is getting ready for a second approach to this, because they fully expected this to happen. So they're going to take another shot at this and try to benefit politically frankly.",

For example, in some cases, the court decided against what had been seen as Republican priorities in redistricting cases in Alabama and North Carolina. Saying that you needed to protect the Voting Rights Act protection of minority communities, African American communities in these cases that didn't line up with Republican political priorities and that's healthy. We need the center to hold in American politics. And that's nowhere more evident numerically than on the court. So whenever justices vote against the perceived interests of the political party that appointed them, that's healthy for the credibility of the court. The problem is now ideological decisions aren't 5-4 they're 6-3. And indeed, Republicans have made it very clear that there's an ideological litmus test for who they will nominate to the court. And that's the long- term danger. It will take a time to unwind to this there needs to be a rebalancing. Ultimately, what we need is the center to be strengthened on the court and more independent voices that aren't being driven by ideological or political agendas as those two have become conflated. That's a real danger to the fundamental integrity of the American system.",

France deployed 40,000 police officers as protests spread across the country and this unrest sparked by the police shooting of a teenager during a traffic stop caught on video earlier this week. Critics saying it were racially motivated. The government reports nearly 900 arrests with nearly 250 officers injured.

And when you talk to people around here, they say, yes, well and good. That's fine. Yes, we use the buses. We don't want to see them destroyed. But we also say, you know, there are two parties who are responsible here. There's also blame on the government about the way some of the neighborhoods are treated about the sense in these -- some of these neighborhoods that there's a racism bias by the police in the way that they treat some of the youth in these areas. This is deep, it's ingrained. The President at the moment is speaking, potentially hit to one side of it, that there's no justification for attacking government buildings.

They've worked together in Ukraine, of course, but also in Syria during Russia's military campaign there. But what's new as a result of these documents, is evidence that that relationship between this senior Russian commanders who by the way, we don't know where he is at the moment, he sort of vanished and disappeared. That relationship was much closer than previously understood. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHANCE (voice over): This is the last time we saw General Surovikin on Saturday looking nervous, imploring Wagner mercenaries to end their brief rebellion. GEN. SERGEY SUROVIKIN, COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE AEROSPACE FORCES: We had victories together, we are the same. But you must do this before it's too late. CHANCE (voice over): There was clearly pressure in his words to make a difference. It's well known that Surovikin nicknamed General Armageddon fees ruthless tactics, bombing cities in Syria was very close to Wagner. But just how close, is only now becoming clear. Documents shared exclusively with CNN suggests he was since 2018, a secret VIP member of the group with a personal Wagner registration number. The documents obtained by the Russian investigative dossier center lists Surovikin along with at least 30 other senior Russian military and intelligence officials, that the dossier center says that also VIP Wagner members. Wagner hasn't answered CNN's request for response. It's unclear what VIP membership entails like if there's any financial benefit. But it does imply an overly close relationship between the Russian military and the mercenaries. They failed to prevent from staging a military uprising at the weekend, even allowing Wagner fighters to take over an entire Russian city with virtually no resistance. It all raises suspicions in the Kremlin of divided loyalties. But General Surovikin, whose whereabouts remain unknown, is one of Russia's most capable, highly decorated commanders.

In the West, we have seen this happen in Sweden before earlier this year, in January. Swedish authorities again, allowed a far right Danish politician to burn the Holy Quran outside the Turkish Embassy. And now you have this. And Muslims would tell you, they've seen other incidents as well. In the West, there's this feeling amongst many Muslims and Muslim leaders, you hear them talking about this. They feel that there is this rise in hostility towards Muslims in some Western countries that they see a rise in Islamophobia. And these sorts of what they describe as incidents that show hate speech, not freedom of speech. And they have really wanted to see Western countries taking more action to try and rein in what they see as this extremist behavior. So you can really understand why people are so angry and outraged when they see this happening once again. Of course, Sweden, as you mentioned, has said that this is about freedom of speech, freedom of expression, in the country that is protected by its constitution that is at the heart of Swedish democracy. But at the same time, Becky, we've heard from Swedish officials saying they condemned this, but they have no choice but to let this happen because of the country's democracy. But today, interestingly, we heard from the prime minister, perhaps some of the strongest reaction we've heard so far during a press conference saying here in Sweden, we should come to our senses. There's no reason to insult other people. And we've also heard from the Stockholm police saying that on Wednesday, they filed a report against this individual who were in the Quran on the first day of raid. And that they are going to try and pursue this through legal means and through the courts. They're accusing him, he suspected of agitation against an ethnic or a natural group perhaps too late. The damage has already been done by kids we can see. And many will be asking why let this happen in the first place.",

But at the same time, there is nothing new. I hear a lot of people talking about this being unprecedented. I hear a lot of people talking about you know, this is no, this is nothing new for us. And when I say us, I'm talking about scholars working on the Bayou these suburbs, with you know, black and brown French citizens or immigrants. I'm talking about artists working on race, racism, policing, I'm talking about residents who are suffering the brunt of racism and police violence. I'm talking about every, I mean people. And here and this is what I talked about the colonial continuum. The way these places these suburbs at the outskirts of France's big city, Bordeaux, Lyon Paris are being policed, these places that are full of residents. And I'm saying this again, black and brown residents, who for the majority are a direct result of France's colonial past. There is a direct continuum between the policing of this area and the policing of the colonial police is this countries where they're coming from, from Senegal to Vietnam to. So there's nothing new, what is different is just the name of the kids. But what all these kids have in common is that they're black and brown, there is nothing new.

And I think it has also something to do with the realities, you know, what is allowed by social media, and the fact that you can see in real time when you're in Nantes, when you're in Nanterre, what's happening right through - - and all these. So that is different, and it makes things go really quickly. And we can see it with the response of Macron, the response of the government. I mean, Macron had, he responded pretty quickly. And that surprised many, right, he responded really quickly on Twitter, but and you open with that his response. I mean, how you say that we don't understand how this happened. We understood. And this is where the problem is, people have been talking in France for decades, and people have been talking during colonial times during slavery, the issue is that no one is listening. No one is hearing. So it starts with understanding that this is not new. Many people in France discovered police violence in 2020 with -- , and because for the first time police violence is happening on real time, and it's being videoed. And it's happening on white bodies, people that you can identify too, with, because they look like your uncle Marcel. And they look like granny, we see old white ladies being beaten in the streets by police. And for the first time we see human beings being attacked by police and police violence became a topic. But before that, that violence, and this is why we talk of the -- the suburbs as a laboratory, where I mean, I often use this with my students at Carnegie Mellon, this tape of a French journalist being absolutely outraged at flush ball being used on the -- during the chelation episode. And saying flush balls, I mean, this was for the body or for the suburbs. So this right this frontier, we can use this for civilized people, you can use this for, for French people, i.e. white people, this is reserved to control these, these spaces of wildness. So, knowledge, we need to understand that all these events are connected; we need to understand that all these events are part of our history. And we understand we need to understand the origin of this, right? When you look at the history of French police, some of the most well-known brag that I'm talking about, for example, -- the back had a colonial history, it was created by a French officers. And when we talk also here about the colonial continuum, you look at the history, the professional history and trajectory is officers, they will go from Algeria. And being called to tame a mutiny or tame a strike in, in a factory in Vietnam, Indo- China, you know, when he was a French colony, and then calling Dacca. And then from this -- in the colonial world, they will land in -- and create. So there is absolutely a continuum in how we created that.",

Sources tell CNN that after having his security clearance taken away earlier this year, Malley has now been placed on leave without pay. This story is being followed closely by CNN's U.S. Security Correspondent Kylie Atwood and she joins us now from Washington. So what do we know about the reason for his suspension, Kylie? KYLIE ATWOOD, CNN U.S. SECURITY CORRESPONDENT: Well, listen, what we know, Becky is that earlier this year, the State Department was investigating his handling of classified information. And the potential mishandling of that classified information is what prompted diplomatic security at the State Department to suspend his security clearance. Essentially, what that means is that Rob Malley, earlier as of earlier this year was no longer allowed access to any classified information. Now, it's our understanding that he remained on the job, at least in some capacity. Even after that security clearance was suspended, just as of yesterday, according to a source familiar he was placed on unpaid leave. And during that period of time, you know, between when the security clearance was suspended, and yesterday, when it comes to Iran, there's two major portfolios, of course, trying to put controls on Iran's nuclear program. Brett McGurk at the National Security Council really took up that portfolio took the lead on that; it obviously requires a lot of work in the classified space. And then when it comes to Americans who are wrongfully detained in Iran, it appears that Rob Malley was still quite involved on that portfolio, at least when it comes to engagement with the families. I spoke with some of the families who had spoken with Malley, at least in recent days; the last week leading up to what we now know yesterday was him being sent on unpaid leave from the department. Now, Rob Malley himself gave us a statement saying that he has been informed that his security clearance is under review. He says he's on lead, he expects the investigation to be resolved favorably and soon. Of course, we don't know when that investigation will be completed, and what the eventual decision will be whether he can remain at the department, or if they'll have to leave.
