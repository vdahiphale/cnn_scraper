His next virtual court appearance is scheduled for July 26th.All right. Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield. A dangerous heatwave is growing across the U.S. leaving more than 100 million Americans under heat alerts this weekend. Many cities including, Washington, D.C. could Eclipse record temperatures over the next three days, with highs in the upper 90s, even triple digits. Joining me right now, CNN correspondent Polo Sandoval is joining us from Brooklyn trying to keep it cool there. And meteorologist Elisa Raffa from the CNN Weather Center in Atlanta. Good to see you both. All right. Polo, you first, how are people handling this heat? POLO SANDOVAL, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It's so hard to escape this heat, Fred, especially, if you don't have any air conditioning. Of course, for some of the youngest of those roughly 100 million Americans that are affected by some of these heat advisories, this is how you do it, you basically turn to some of the water features and water parks throughout the region here to try to stay cool. Again, you are looking at well over 100 million people that are affected by this for yet another day. And that is why authorities and municipalities up and down the Northeast are stressing the importance of staying hydrated, staying cool. And also, this is key, checking on the elderly. Checking on the most vulnerable. There is so many states where a large percentage of the population doesn't even have air conditioning because these are temperatures that they are simply not used to. And that's why, speaking as a Texan, when you see temperatures in the high 90s, you may see it as just another summer day. But for some of the people, especially the Northeast that are not used to this, that comes with the deadly potential. That's why you're seeing cities like New York and other regions are opening up this cooling centers for those people who need them. Washington, D.C. today, expected to inch closer to triple digits. So, the mayor there is extending that heat advisory into next week. A very similar situation that's playing out in the state of Maryland as well. Fred.",

But you can see the alerts stretching down the I-95 corridor from New York to Philly, and Washington, even stretching back towards Cleveland.And we've had a pretty hot month. We've had heat alerts and effect every -- nearly every single day to last 30 days. And we have surpassed the average from last year. The other day, we had 120 million people under heat alerts. So, just again, incredible, widespread, long heatwave. We'll continue to find temperatures above 90 degrees for, at least, 80 percent of the lower 48, as we go into the week. More than 250 records could fall both daytime highs and overnight lows. We'll look at the temperatures for today, 98 degrees in Washington, D.C., 94 in Raleigh, 95 in Little Rock. Temperatures stretching into the 90s even down to Atlanta. This is the area that we're watching where we've got temperatures that could climb up towards 100 degrees in Philadelphia, D.C., and Richmond. But look at by Monday, you see these temperatures getting back a little bit closer to average in some of the middle and upper 80s that says that front comes through, and does start to bring some of the relief. We're not really seeing too much relief on the overnight temperatures. Look at the overnight lows. 80 degrees could be your overnight load tonight in D.C. So, just sweltering with these temperatures in the middle and upper 70s, not really getting that relief at night. And what we do know is that especially these overnight temperatures tend to warm on when we're looking at climate trends faster than the daytime temperatures. Once the map loads, you'll see that the overnight temperatures are about four to five times more likely because of climate change just again continuing to swelter. Fred.",

      "sentences": "Yes. In that Camp David setting, presidents always choose it when they want somewhere secluded, somewhere free from distractions. And that's certainly the case. For President Biden, as he enters this intensive, multi-day stretch of debate preparations out there, we do know that even before he arrived, he had started going through these binders that his aides had prepared really trying to crystallize the policy differences between himself and President Trump going through potential questions, potential answers, trying to fine tune some of his responses, his retorts. And you can expect that the President is doing that in these early days of debate prep.One thing that we did hear from a person who is familiar with the debate preparations is that President Biden really wants to be punchy in this debate. He had been, you know, really ramping up how he had been going after President Trump over the last several weeks. And we -- they do expect that as they carry through on the debate stage. On Thursday night, one of the things that the campaign really hopes to do in this debate is what they say is hold Trump accountable for some of the statements that he's made over the course of the campaign, whether it's saying that he wanted to act as a dictator, taking credit for the overturning of Roe versus Wade, all of these things that Trump has done. That Trump or that Biden very much wants to emphasize and wants to underscore for the audience, which may be tuning into this race for the very first time on Thursday night. And I think when you really boil down the debate strategy, it is to present this choice to voters. That it is either Biden or Trump, and that they will have to make that decision in November. And it was interesting to hear the vice president Kamala Harris, kind of describe that strategy just yesterday. Listen to what she said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He is out on the campaign trail this weekend, really projecting confidence ahead of this critical matchup. We also know that he really feeds off of the energy of his most devoted and loyal supporters, and they no doubt are here at the Faith and Freedom Conference. You know, another thing Fred, he can ill afford to lose time on the campaign trail. That's why we see him out here in D.C. and in Philly this weekend. It was just a few weeks ago, where week after week, he was in the courtroom before ultimately being convicted in New York, losing precious time to make his case to supporters. We know that the former president really values rhetoric over substance, and so, he will have the opportunity to hear to perhaps test out some of the rhetorical gimmicks he might have planned for the debate stage. He has engaged in some policy discussions, though, about a dozen with some of the V.P. contenders. And in those conversations, we know that he has been sharpening his message on abortion and foreign policy. But what he is, perhaps, expected to really focus on in the debate is needling, President Biden over this issue of inflation, the economy and the cost of living. Fred.",

And so, you know, the temptation in the debate is to try to hit a homerun, to go for the big one.

They also control a lot of the food supply as well.So, China really need the -- Kim needs to really make pay close attention to China, but China really needs to have a very peaceful North Korea on its -- on its shores. And it's close. Look, the -- one of the major populations of China, Shanghai, the population center, 30 million people is just 700 miles from the North Korean frontier. Imagine if Kim, for some reason, launches a nuclear attack against anybody in the region. Or even in the United States. And there is retaliation. The fallout from any kind of a retaliation, a nuclear retaliation in North Korea would decimate China's southeastern portion of China, would make it potentially Shanghai unlivable for 100 years. So, China is terribly afraid that they don't want it that kind of a destabilizing position in this region. And I think China, United States today -- if the United States has any pressure to bring it to bear on this, it would be on China to really make sure that Kim understands the stakes involved.

But on the Actor Alec Baldwin's alleged behavior in the days and weeks leading up to that shooting. Some of the evidence that they cite includes video evidence showing Baldwin allegedly using a gun as a pointer. They say he was engaged in, quote, \"horseplay,\" pointing the muzzle of a gun at another actor. They said, at one point, while setting up for a scene, he fired a blank round at a crew member. And during a safety briefing on firearms safety, he allegedly was distracted, facetiming and texting with family members. Now, all of this tracks with what Santa Fe's district attorney first told CNN when charges were first brought against actor, Alec Baldwin. Take a listen here to the D.A. describing what she claimed was \"a culture of unsafe practices\" on that movie set. MARY CARMACK-ALTWIES, FIRST JUDICIAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY: There was such a lack of safety and safety standards on that set that there were live rounds onset. They were mixed in with regular dummy rounds. Nobody was checking those.",

Most people have to walk long distances every day to reach the different sites.Now, Saudi Arabia had misting systems in place and water stations passing out bottles. But one pilgrim from Indonesia, for instance, said that whenever more water bottles were delivered, those sites were quickly overrun by people trying to get some. He said that, in the three kilometer or so walk between one of the sites and his hotel, he saw dozens of people who had passed out and some who had even died and no help in sight. Now many of the pilgrims were not officially registered. And that means that they may have lacked the same transportation options or air-conditioned tents that others had. One man from the U.K. said that those unregistered people instead set up make-shift tent cities in whatever shade they could find or make. And they got very little medical attention. Listen.",
