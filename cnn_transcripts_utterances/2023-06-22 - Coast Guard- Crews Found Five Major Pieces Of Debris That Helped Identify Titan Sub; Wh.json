Did one of these seams fail along here? Was there a problem with the carbon fiber itself? Had it become stressed and did it give way? They may not get answers, but the more pieces they can collect, a piece at a time with those robotic rovers down there, picking them up as a guest told you a while ago, loading them into baskets, bringing them to the surface, the more chance they have of putting it all back together.

So tensile stress, which is normally what you see with an airplane that's built out of carbon fiber, as tensile stress as opposed to compression. So I think that might have been what happened.

But if you're going to do that, then you have to also have more means of being able to communicate with the surface. Just the one acoustic radio, acoustic communication system is probably not sufficient. Needs better navigation systems to be able to tell exactly where it is and notify others where it is.It needs a beacon so you can find it if it does get lost. It didn't have any of those things. And then you need a way to allow the crew to get out if they were to be able to surface. One of the challenges with this vehicle is the door is bolted on from the outside. So even if they successfully surfaced, they still could not let themselves out. They would have to have been retrieved by somebody coming from the outside and unbolting the door.

This revelation comes as the Special Counsel's office has begun producing the evidence in the classified documents case to Trump's legal team as discovery, I believe is what that's called. CNN's Paula Reid and Elie Honig are with us. And Paula, we knew about the one recording of Trump from July 2021 at Bedminster, where he's talking about some document involving a potential attack on Iran. He was meeting with a bunch of Mark Meadows autobiographer. I mean, it's kind of a contradiction in terms. But some people helping Mark Meadows write his autobiography. What do we know about these other recordings?",

So last night, when the special counsel revealed that it had interviews, plural, well, that piqued our interest. So we called our sources and we learned that, in fact, the Trump team has provided about half a dozen additional interviews to prosecutors. They were subpoenaed in March of this year to provide any materials related to General Mark Milley.And we've learned that they've handed over multiple recordings where Trump can be heard talking about Mark Milley, but he does not reference any classified documents. Now, the Special Counsel also has at least one other source providing them recordings, and that also includes one of the copies of that Bedminster interview that they originally got. Now, I want to emphasize during the discovery process, as Elie knows as well, you have to hand over everything you've collected, and not all of these are necessarily going to be pertinent to the criminal case. And we have multiple sources telling us that none of these additional interviews rise to the level of potentially incriminating conduct like that original Bedminster interview.",

They're the best possible evidence you have, because you get to play for the jury the defendant's own words and the defendant's own voice. And if we look at a crucial conversation like the one at Bedminster, where Donald Trump is acknowledging that he knows he has these documents, that he knows they were never declassified, and he's apparently referencing the contents of them, this is the document, the recording that Paula reported on, which appeared in the indictment. It's the single most important piece of evidence that I've seen in the indictment.If you didn't have a tape, you'd have to call it eyewitness. And eyewitnesses can be cross examined. You don't remember exactly what words were used. You may have some bias or incentive to lie one way or other. But if you have a tape, you just play the tape, and that's the best evidence you can have as a prosecutor.",

But that has created a potential archive of evidence for prosecutors. And it's our understanding that most of these recordings were uploaded to the iCloud.
