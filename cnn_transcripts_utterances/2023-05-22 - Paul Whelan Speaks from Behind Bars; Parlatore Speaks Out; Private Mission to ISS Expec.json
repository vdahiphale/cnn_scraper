What the man who put Jordan Neely in that deadly chokehold is saying as he speaks this morning. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [06:50:32] HARLOW: So, in \"Money this Morning,\" Facebook's parent company, Meta, is being fined a record $1.3 billion for violating the European Union data protection rules. That is the highest amount any company has ever been fined for breaching those EU rules. They date back to the 2020 landmark data privacy law. Melissa Bell joins us now.

      "sentences": "No, they will appeal. They said so already, Poppy. But I think what matters here is the amount that's being levied or that the European Union is trying to fine Meta with. And it really reflects their frustration. When you look at their statement, they talk of systematic repeated continuous breaches of their GDPR.Of course, the problem here, Poppy, is that ever since the pact, the deal that allowed the United States and Europe to transfer and share the data, privacy shield, was struck down by European courts worried about the protection of European data, for instance, from things like NSA surveillance once it's on American servers, this opened the door for this particular case. Now, despite all those warnings, what the European Union says, and this is coming to Ireland because that is where Meta's European headquarters is, they felt that they've had two impose this fine to send a strong signal, they say, that the GDPR, that data protection law that you mentioned, means that European data needs to be better protected than Meta has allowed for it to be. Now, it isn't over yet. Meta says it will appeal. It has, if it fails, six months to come into line with European regulations. But I just want to read you, Poppy, the response from Meta on this question of data protection. The ability for data to be transferred across borders is fundamental to how the global open internet networks. Without the ability to transfer data, the internet risks being carved out into national and regional silos restricting the global economy. So, a fairly strong response there for Meta in terms of the fundamentals of what this means for the market and for the internet generally. As I say, there will be an appeal. So, we will find out more about what happens. But Meta have also said there will be no disruption to its service here in Europe, Poppy.",
