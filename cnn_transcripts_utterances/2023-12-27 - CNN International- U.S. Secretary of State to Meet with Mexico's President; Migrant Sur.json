The surge of migrants is very visible in Eagle Pass, Texas. U.S. border agents are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of people entering the country illegally. And thousands more are making their way to Mexico from Central and South America and beyond, desperate for a chance to enter the United States. The mayor of Eagle Pass, Texas, is demanding the White House act quickly and decisively to stop people from crossing the border illegally. And he wants the federal government to deport people. He says without that, this crisis will only keep growing. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ROLANDO SALINAS JR. MAYOR OF EAGLE PASS, TEXAS: This is unacceptable. Our city here in Eagle Pass, we've been getting slammed with 2,000 to 3,000 people a day. And it's just an unfair, unethical situation. What's going on here in Eagle Pass, we feel ignored by the federal government. I've called to the government that we need action. There needs to be a consequence to so many people crossing illegally. If somebody breaks the law, there needs to be a consequence. And right now, there are no consequences. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Kristen Holmes has the details.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) KRISTEN HOLMES, CNN U.S. NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, former President Trump continuing his quote-unquote Christmas messaging into the week, posting on Truth Social on Tuesday. Biden's flunky, deranged Jack Smith should go to hell. Now, this, of course, comes after his post on Christmas Day where many world leaders or former world leaders were calling for peace and unity in a time of war. This is what Donald Trump was doing on Truth Social, posting: Merry Christmas to all, including crooked Joe Biden's only hope, deranged Jack Smith, the out-of-control lunatic -- goes on to say -- may they rot in hell again. Merry Christmas. This is not the typical message you would see from any sort of world leader, but it is a message you would see from Donald Trump, who has made an entire political career of being the victim and airing these kinds of grievances, particularly when it comes to the legal cases. Donald Trump's agenda is to play this out in the court of public opinion, and he does believe that this rhetoric of attacking Joe Biden, of attacking Jack Smith, is working for him because he sees those poll numbers. And when you look at that, when you talk to senior members of his team, it is clear that he is not going to tone down this rhetoric or this language at any point. And it's not just these attacks that we see out on Joe Biden or Jack Smith, but it's also his aggressive anti- immigration rhetoric. As he has continued to ramp up that language, those poll numbers, at least in Iowa, have continued to rise. So right now there is no political pressure on him to tone it down, to pull it back at all. Now, obviously, this could change if he is the GOP nominee, if he does go up against Joe Biden in a general election and need to find more moderate voters. But, again, that remains to be seen.

The Israel Defense Forces says it's using ground, air and naval troops to strike at what they claim are terror targets in Gaza.And on Tuesday, dozens of its fighter jets struck more than 100 Hamas targets, including tunnel shafts and infrastructure. But scores of Palestinians have also been killed. The Hamas-controlled health ministry says the death toll in the enclave is now nearing 21,000. Though CNN can't independently verify those numbers. And now there are growing concerns over the war expanding into a wider conflict. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): We are in a multi-arena war. We are being attacked from seven different sectors, Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea and Samaria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran. We have already responded and acted in six of these decrees. And I say here in the most explicit way, anyone who acts against us is a potential target. There is no immunity for anyone. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We know, you know, confirmed by South Korean police that his death is presumed to be a suicide. We also know that his family has not requested an autopsy.Now, as you mentioned at the top there, he was currently being investigated for alleged illegal drug use since October of this year. He's been brought into police questioning three times, most recently on December 23rd, when he was questioned for 19 hours. He was released on Christmas Eve. Now, it's extremely significant to note that throughout the investigation, Lee's drug tests have always come back negative. He's also denied ever knowingly taking drugs. He claims that he was tricked and then subsequently blackmailed. He has filed a lawsuit against this alleged blackmailer. Now, on social media, in reaction to Lee's tragic and sudden death, there has been an outpour of grief and just messages of sorrow. Internationally, he shot to fame in 2019 after the release of Parasite, which was a non-English language film that won Best Picture in 2020. It also won three other Oscars. Now, domestically, within South Korea, his career spanned two decades. He starred in a number of TV shows and films, and he was really just a beloved actor in the country. And as I mentioned, there has been just an outpour of grief around the world today.",
