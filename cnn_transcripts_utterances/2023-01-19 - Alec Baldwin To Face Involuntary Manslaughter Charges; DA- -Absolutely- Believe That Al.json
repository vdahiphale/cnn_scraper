The set's armor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed also facing those involuntary manslaughter charges.The New Mexico D.A. in announcing the charges, noting that, quote, no one is above the law.

But the D.A. is saying that she looked at the totality of the circumstances here, including what appeared to be a culture of unsafe practices on this set.We know that there have been past complaints, there had been past accidental discharges. Take a listen to what she told me about what factored into her decision here. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARY CARMACK-ALTWIES, SANTA FE DISTRICT ATTORNEY: There was such a lack of safety and safety standards on that set, that there were live rounds on set. They were mixed in with regular dummy rounds. Nobody was checking those, or at least they weren't checking them consistently. And then they somehow got loaded into a gun, handed off to Alec Baldwin. He didn't check it. He didn't do any of the things that he was supposed to do to make sure that he was safe or that anyone around him was safe. And then he pointed the gun at Halyna Hutchins and he pulled the trigger. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But, obviously, serious charges here for those other two. We just got a statement and I want to read you. This is from the family of Halyna Hutchins. And they say that, \"We want to thank the Santa Fe Sheriff and the District Attorney for concluding their thorough investigation and determining that the charges for involuntary manslaughter are warranted for the killing of Halyna Hutchins with conscious disregard for human life. Our independent investigation also supports the charges are warranted. It is a comfort to the family that in New Mexico, no one is above the law. We support the charges. We'll fully cooperate with this prosecution and fervently hope the justice system works to protect the public and hold accountable those who break the law.\" And finally, Erica, I asked the District Attorney if through this prosecution, she's also trying to send a message to other movie production companies out there that there will be consequences for unsafe practices.

And that the armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed was responsible for making sure that the gun was safe.And his main question to me this summer, and his main question still remains is, how did a live bullet get on set? And the D.A.'s saying, we may never know. But he has maintained that he pointed the gun where Halyna Hutchins told him to during this rehearsal on the New Mexico set. I want to get to Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, her attorney releasing a statement today and they are saying that, \"We were expecting the charges, but they are absolutely wrong as to Hannah,\" saying, \"that we expect that she will be found not guilty by a jury and she did not commit manslaughter. She has been emotional about the tragedy but has committed no crime.\" So pretty much everyone saying, Erica, that it wasn't me, it wasn't me, and pointing the finger at everybody else. And the D.A. is saying that, at the end of the day, I guess it doesn't really matter as to how that live bullet got on the set.

      "sentences": "The U.S. has officially hit the debt limit. Secretary Janet Yellen telling lawmakers a short time ago, the Treasury Department is moving forward with what are known as extraordinary measures. Bottom line here, what does this mean for you? Well, simply put. This country is now one step closer to a financial disaster.So let's start with the facts here. The money needed has already been spent. So this is about paying for existing debts, and those include things like military salaries, interest on the national debt, Social Security benefits. So now enter these extraordinary measures, which are kicking in. So what does that do? Well, essentially, you're shifting money around. You're robbing Peter to pay Paul, deciding which bills to pay with the funds available to you. Keep in mind here, the U.S. has never defaulted on its debt. The debt limit itself has actually been raised 78 times since 1960. So you may be saying, OK, this is an issue. We've been here before, so what's different today? May not surprise you that this has a whole lot to do with politics. Republicans, with their slim majority in the House, they want to cut future spending. Here's the thing, though. The debt ceiling is not about future spending. Again, this is money that has already been spent. The bill is due. So you're thinking, hey, maybe there's some common ground here. Maybe lawmakers on both sides of the aisle will realize that this is about the greater good of the country, the debt standing, the standing of the United States. Well, the White House says no negotiations, noting that this is actually Congress's job to figure it out and get it done. So where does that leave you? Luckily, it leaves you with a very smart guest. Justin Wolfers is a Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the University of Michigan. And we always love talking to you because you make this so understandable. And this is something I think that Speaker McCarthy was really looking to do. So he compared the debt limit to a family's finances, saying, look, Congress at this point can't just keep raising the government's credit card limit. That's an analogy. I think most Americans can understand it. It's when you called Q, but you also said it's wrong. Why doesn't that example work here? JUSTIN WOLFERS, ECONOMIC &amp; PUBLIC POLICY PROFESSOR: So it's wrong because the person who raises your credit card limit is the credit card company. It's the lender. Speaker McCarthy is part of the government. The government is the borrower. The only choice the borrower makes, and we all face it every month, is the credit card bill comes due, are you going to pay it or not? So if Speaker McCarthy wants the U.S. government to spend less money, he needs to pass bills so that we spend less money. But right now, he's got a credit card bill in the mail and he's just stomping his feet and saying, I'm not going to pay it. This is the part actually where it's a pretty good analogy. Most of your viewers know that's a pretty bad idea. It's a pretty good way of getting your credit cut off, raising interest rates. And what that means is if the U.S. government pays higher interest, you and I pay higher taxes.",

That means Congress has to -- the U.S. government has to borrow. So it can't have both its spending bills that are passed and its tax bills that are passed and refused to raise the debt limit.

And that's not a term we made up. That's what they're actually called.It does buy time, but it's not the answer. So when you look at how all of this is playing out, just remind us of two things. Number one, who is -- what does this actually mean when you say Americans are going to feel this in terms of, you know, it's going to cost more to pay the bills, what does that mean for the average American? Where could they feel it first? And then also, what do you think the chances are that the U.S. actually defaults?",

It's not you, it's probably your kids who are going to have to pay higher taxes.More immediately, no one expects Congress to do this. We expect the grownups in the room to take over. If they don't, that could cause all sorts of financial eruptions. And so that could lead to a huge hit to business confidence, to consumer confidence. It could lead to financial markets to reveal new vulnerabilities that we simply don't know about right now. And so, that's the sort of extra nudge that an economy that a lot of people think is near a recession just doesn't need to have. And then I just want to think about, you know, your parents or your grandparents who right now don't know if the next Social Security check is going to be coming their way or not.

Also, just two more important points here. While in Brazil in 2003, his mother then indicated on some paperwork that she had not been in the United States since 1999. In addition, she filled out paperwork in Brazil in 2001, and that is notably just months before September 11th happened, and she said that her green card had been stolen then in Brazil.
