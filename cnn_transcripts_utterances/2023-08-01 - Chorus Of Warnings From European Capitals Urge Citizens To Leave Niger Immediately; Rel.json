      "sentences": "Hello everyone, I'm Zain Asher in New York and this is One World. We begin with a chorus of warnings fromEuropean capitals urging their citizens to leave Niger as quickly as possible. Just hours ago, France announced it would evacuate its citizens from the West African nation because of the recent violence following last week's military coup. The first flight out is expected to leave in a few hours from now. Italy has also announced a special flight for nationals who want to leave. Germany is also urging its citizens to get out as well, saying that they can escape on the French flights if they choose to do so. It comes as neighboring countries warn against military intervention in Niger to restore the ousted president. Burkina Faso, and Mali, two nations that have also seen military coups in recent years. Both say they will take up arms to defend Niger, again, if necessary. We are covering this story from many different angles. CNN's Kylie Atwood is at the U.S. State Department for us. I want to begin with Larry Maddow, who joins us live now from Nairobi, Kenya. So, Larry, I understand that France actually had to coordinate and get in touch with the junta to ensure that its citizens are actually able to evacuate as safely as possible. What more do we know about these flights?",

That is what the French are saying, that they've been given assurances by the Nigerian militarythat they will be able to evacuate their citizens and other Europeans safely. But they're also warning that they will be -- their forces will be acting in a very vigilant manner, because you know, this is a junta that's in charge of the country, but there seems to be some disagreement within the military, so you just kind of know what's going to happen. There are people right now at the Niamey International Airport that are being coordinated by French forces. This is the civilian airport. And the French tell us that they have two A330s on the ground there to evacuate the citizens, their families, those that want to. And if it is necessary, they will have a third A330 come into the country to evacuate more of them. They previously said that they expect this whole process to be over in 24 hours, the main reason being that the violence at their embassy on Sunday, the anti-French protests they have seen and the anti-French sentiment has built up -- there's a closure of the airspace, which means that anybody that wants to leave cannot leave on their own means. So, that is why. This is also a situation that's escalating as you see neighbors of Niger, Burkina Faso in Mali, supporting the junta, saying that anything that would involve a military intervention in Niger will be an act of war against them, and appear to have coordinated their message with Guinea. All these three countries have -- are being led by military junta, and it's especially striking, Zain, this message read on state television in Mali by the prime minister three times.

First of all, it appears as if Jack Smith has spoken with all the relevant witnesses or nearly all the relevant witnesses, including people in Donald Trump's inner circle. And if we look at the prior indictment that Jack Smith obtained against Donald Trump last month, in that case, he sent a target letter to Donald Trump warning him that he might be indicted. Twenty days before the actual indictment came down, Jack Smith sent Donald Trump another target letter. In this case, that was now 16 days ago. There also was this sort of last-ditch meeting between Donald Trump's team and Jack Smith. That happened three days before the last indictment. We are now at five days since that meeting happened.

Sometimes indictments can just give you sort of the wrote-charginglanguage, but Jack Smith has shown in his prior indictment that he tends to give a narrative with some evidence and with some detail. I think we'll see the same here. Based on the target letter that Jack Smith sent to Donald Trump's legal team, it sounds like the emphasis here is really much more on the run-up to January 6th. The weeks and months between the election and January 6 itself, then on the actual physical Capitol attack. It looks like Jack Smith is investigating potential charges relating to conspiracy and obstruction of an official proceeding, meaning he's focusing on the effort by Donald Trump and others to essentially steal the votes in seven states through fraud and through intimidation, and I think less so, if at all, on the actual speech Donald Trump gave that immediately preceded the physical attack on the Capitol.",

And if that's the way Jack Smith charges this case, then that will cover most of the conduct that Fani Willis, the D.A. is likely to cover, as well. She may have a different gloss on it or have a little bit different level of detail. Now, there's no legal bar to the D.A., to Fani Willis charging if Jack Smith covers the state of Georgia in his charge, but it will raise questions about is this additional charge necessary, is it duplicative, is it just sort of political opportunism.

One of the men explained he had little option but to leave his home behind, but didn't have a passport or money to get a visa. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Rapper Cardi B hurling her microphone at a concertgoer, who by theway threw his drink at her or her drink at her on stage. Police haven't issued a citation, much less an arrest warrant, but it's another strange entry in what's been a running trend lately, people throwing objects at performers on stage. And that has performers like Cardi B retaliating themselves. All right, meantime, Hollywood is mourning the shocking death of a rising star. Twenty-five-year-old Angus Cloud, best known for his breakthrough role on the HBO hit series Euphoria, died on Monday. The cause of his death is still under investigation. But in a statement, his family said he had buried his father a week earlier and intensely struggled with that loss, adding that Cloud had been open about his battle with mental health. CNN Reporter Chloe Melas joins us live now. I mean, this is so sad. I mean, this is shocking. So many people who are fans of that show are devastated. Just talk to us a bit more about Angus Cloud and the role he played on \"Euphoria\", and the impact that he had. I mean, this is a man who was waiting tables. He had no previous acting experience. He was waiting tables and was discovered by a casting director. His life changed overnight.",

He is somebody who was this breakout star in Hollywood, starringon \"Euphoria\" for, you know, two seasons since its inception with -- and he had never acted before. Like you said, he was walking down the streets of Brooklyn when a casting director approached him and said, you'd be perfect for this role. And he thought it was a joke. And then he went on to be on the show that's been in the zeitgeist of pop culture for the past couple of years alongside Zendaya and other people whose stars have risen with this popular show. We know that he had struggled, like you said, with the death of his father he had taken to social media and he posted a tribute to his dad with a photo just last week. And according to this statement from his family, he had taken it very hard and it had been a devastating time and that he was very close with his father who was living in Ireland and that they had just buried his dad last week. So, obviously an incredibly sad moment for his friends and his family who just lost the patriarch of the family. And now they're losing their son, their brother, their cousin. That is just, I feel so terrible for the Cloud family right now. And then not to mention, he had such an impact in Hollywood for the short amount of time. You know, he was just 25 years old at the time of his death and he made such an impact. This was somebody who had a very bright future ahead of them, Zain.",
