He knows a lot about these cluster bombs, but he says that the training that will go in will try to make sure that the Ukrainians only use these cluster bombs in under- populated, non-populated areas, because they're very, very dangerous. More than 100 countries, including several NATO allies, have banned the use of these cluster munitions because of the threat to civilians. Some of these munitions, they don't necessarily detonate right away, but people can find them down the road and can cause all sorts of problems, death and injury, and people have seen that. So, they're very worried about it. But he's very confident that the Ukrainian military right now in this counteroffensive against the Russians, they need these weapons. They need them badly. The Russians have been using cluster bombs against the Ukrainians. The Russians invaded Ukraine. He says the Ukrainians only need these weapons to defend themselves. They're not invading any other country as the Russians are doing, he said.

But it's pretty vast. And as we got word a couple of weeks ago that I think it had cost $9 million or something like that, that's what it takes to build conspiracies of this size.

So, when you hear that and it's starting to take hold, that was started by Coco Gauff. Frances Tiafloe did start off the name Toothpick. I used to fight them on it, but at this point, I view them as terms of endearment. I'm really close with everyone that you just mentioned and a lot of the American players, a lot of the players on tour.I think I just have a good rapport with a lot of the men and women on tour. And I think seeing them be happy for my success is probably some of the most gratifying, I think, feelings that I experienced over the past few weeks, because they understand what it's like and they know the hard work and sacrifice that it takes to be able to have results like this. And, honestly, we see each other probably more than we see our own families. So, a little bit like a second family. And when you see those people that you're competing against and competing with be happy for your success, I think it really, really means a lot.",

It's something that you dream of as a kid growing up, watching Wimbledon on T.V., saying, man, I hope to be there one day. It's a bit emotional just being able to rewatch it again. It's really special. It's something that I'll never forget.And I can't wait to just try to use this momentum that I have now and this confidence, as you spoke about earlier, into the U.S. Summer Swing leading up into the U.S. Open. The U.S. Open is a tournament that I grew up going to with my family. It's a tournament that I've always wanted to do well at.
