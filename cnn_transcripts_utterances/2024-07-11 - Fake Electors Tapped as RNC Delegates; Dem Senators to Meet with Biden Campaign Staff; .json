A few of them currently facing criminal prosecution for their efforts in trying to overturn the 2020 election. As you can see, many of these fake electors come from very key swing states. CNN's Zachary Cohen joins us.Zach, I mean, I suppose this is not surprising. I mean, a lot of those fake electors are Republican operatives. So, not surprising that they would be at the convention, but they're going to be there.",

And it shows that he's woven election denialism into the official GOP platform, right?Seven battleground states we've identified are going to send representatives who were either election deniers, they pushed those baseless claims about widespread fraud after the 2020 election, or they actively tried to help Donald Trump overturn the 2020 election results, including several who served as those fake electors from places like Georgia, places like Michigan, places like Arizona. And there's several of them who are currently facing criminal charges at the state level for their role as a fake elector. That includes Jake Hoffman who is a state senator in Arizona. He was picked to be the national committee man for Arizona. So, he's sort of the public facing Republican from Arizona. And he was indicted alongside all the rest of the fake electors in Arizona as part of an alleged conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results. Also, at the convention will be Meshawn Maddock. She similarly was a fake elector, but in Michigan where all the fake electors were also criminally charged. But at the same time, we've seen these criminal investigations sort of peter out recently and none look like they're going to be resolved before the 2024 election. And that's why you're seeing sort of this defiance from some of these individuals who will be at the convention in Milwaukee, and Hoffman is one of them. He says that his election is the RNC national committeeman for Arizona is proof positive that the Republicans are the party of everyday hardworking Americans. I think it's also proof that the Republican Party is Donald Trump. And I think everybody's expectation is that will remain true after the convention.",

Appreciate it.In the meantime, up on Capitol Hill, in just a few hours from now, the Biden campaign will meet with Senate Democrats as pressure grows for the president to end his candidacy. But so far, there's no sign the president is ready or even willing to exit the race. We're joined now by presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. Doug, great to see you as always. I do want to jump into this and what the president should do and your thoughts on all that. I do want to just take a moment, hit the pause button and just talk a little bit about what Zach Cohen was saying just a few moments ago. There are going to be delegates at the Republican Convention who are involved in the fake elector plot. I mean, it is stunning from a historical standpoint to have the former president of the United States running for president again. He tried to overturn the election. We had January 6th. And some of the people who were a part of that effort will be at the convention next week.",

We have to remember when democracy was put on the line and it was an insurrection occurred in our nation's capital and the people that were involved in it belong in jail.",

I mean, everybody now is kind of chipping in throwing a little bit of how they feel that we're having very few profiles and courage. Mainly everybody's doing smoke signals that they either want Biden to go or leave, but it doesn't have this definitive drive yet to it. Beyond Lyndon Johnson in '68, I would think about Bill Clinton in the '90s. There was a drumbeat for Bill Clinton to leave the presidency due to Monica Lewinsky and the Ken Starr investigation. Clinton used to tell people, I'm going to stay in until the last dog dies. It was a famous Clinton statement. And that's the attitude of Biden, saying, I'm going to stay in no matter what, trying to send a very loud message that he's dug in.But I think he was consequential of the way that Nancy Pelosi has shifted as of yesterday. I thought the George Clooney letter eyeballs popping open, but most importantly, when you get a group of U.S. senators, whether it's Sherrod Brown or Tester, you know, and others, you know, that's when you realize that if the Senate comes on you the way Goldwater came on Nixon, that's when Biden is in deep trouble.",

We broke the story here at CNN when Biden was telling members of the DNC on a conference call that he didn't have the emotional fuel to run. This was after the death of his son, Beau Biden. Let's listen to a little bit of that. I want to have a conversation about this.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  If I were asked to run, I have to be able to commit to all of you that I would be able to give it my whole heart and my whole soul, and right now, both are pretty well banged up and we're trying to figure out that issue. But believe me, I've given this a lot of thought and dealing internally with the family on how we do this. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But he -- you know, as you remember, Dough, during that time period, Biden was at times sounding very much publicly like somebody who was going to be a candidate and then he bowed out.And I'm just thinking about this because of what Nancy Pelosi was saying yesterday, that there are still some Democrats encouraging that he'll make a decision. Is it possible that, privately, behind the scenes, perhaps the president is not so sure he's going to run and we might see him make an announcement that he's going to bow out?

Here's a look at how the stock market is responding. Stock market likes a little bit so far. The latest inflation report out today is boosting hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates. But the question remains, when exactly will that happen?Joining me now to discuss this and more is Mark Zandi. He's the chief economist at Moody's Analytics. Mark, what'd you think of the numbers? MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ANALYTICS:  Great, Jim. I thought they were great. I mean, very close to scriptures. Inflation is cooling off nicely. The other thing I take the greatest solace in is that staples, necessities, things like food at home, gasoline, new lease rents, they haven't increased at all over the past year. You know, they increased a lot a couple, three years ago. So, people are still struggling with that. But over the good news is over the past year they haven't gone anywhere. So, all the trend lines here look pretty good. I'd say look really good, and it feels like we're getting to a place where the Federal Reserve should start cutting interest rates.",

I mean, rates are high, interest rates are high. They are a weight on the economy and you can kind of feel it most clearly in the job market. You know -- so, you know, number of hours people are working, they're down. It's tougher to get hired. The quit rates are down. The number of temp jobs have fallen, that businesses tend to cut the temp jobs before they cut their own employment.And even job growth is starting to slow and we're getting downward revisions. Unemployment is notching higher. You know, some of that is just, you know, more labor force growth, but nonetheless. So, you add that all up and it does paint a picture of a labor market that is, you know, under a lot of strain. And, you know, I would argue for -- to what end. I mean, the economies of full employment, 4.1 percent unemployment rate and inflation is right where we want to see it. So, I would be cutting rates now. But again, I think they're going to be more cautious here, wait a couple more months before they cut rates. But the longer they wait, the greater the risk they take. And if they don't cut rates in September and wait even longer, then I think the risks to the economy will rise.",

I just want to keep it there.And I think the Fed, you know, mission accomplished. They got what they wanted. Now it's time to kind of take the foot off the brake and, you know, normalize interest rates, because that would really help. You know, a lot of low-income households are paying a lot on their credit card debt and consumer finance loans.
