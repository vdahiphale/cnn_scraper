Plus, the spectacle starts.Today is day one of a House GOP impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden. Republicans promise his show and tell the Democrats retort where's the evidence. And danger nocks. President Biden is in Arizona to warn the country and revive a 2020 and 2022 campaign theme that Democrats believe worked that MAGA extremists are a singular threat to American democracy. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. Up first, a chaotic crosstalk filled Republican debate that gave us more questions and more insults, but little clarity about who if any of these candidates can truly challenge Donald Trump. The frontrunner was not there again. But in Simi Valley, you could sense the desperation among those on stage to find a breakthrough moment. You could literally see and hear that more and more Donald Trump's Republican rivals realize, they won't win by playing nice with the former president and time is running out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV. RON DESANTIS, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: And you know who else is missing in action? Donald Trump is missing in action. He should be on this stage tonight. NIKKI HALEY, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This is where President Trump went wrong. He focused on trade with China. He didn't focus on the fact that they were buying up our farmland. He didn't focus on the fact that they weren't killing Americans. MIKE PENCE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: My former running mate Donald Trump actually has a plan to start to consolidate more power in Washington, D.C. CHRIS CHRISTIE, (R) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You're ducking these things. And let me tell you what's going to happen. You keep doing that. No one up here is going to call you Donald Trump anymore. We're going to call you Donald Duck. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I know, we're not going to complain to you about lack of sleep, Phil Mattingly. But it was very interesting to be there.

It is also to keep the money flowing, and to look like somebody who can potentially stay in there for a bit, particularly for the anti-Trump sector of the Republican Party. On that note, Nikki Haley, was really trying to kind of stand out. And just like the first debate, she did. Let's listen to some of those moments. OK. I don't think we have that soundbite. So, I will just tell our viewers about the gist of what she did. She went after Ron DeSantis on fracking. She went after Tim Scott in a very big way. We do have it. Welcome to Live TV everybody.

      "sentences": "Look, I mean, those were certainly memorable lines, particularly when Nikki Haley was directly again, basically picking up where she left off at the first debate going after Vivek Ramaswamy.Saying famously, I think we'll remember this for a long time. So, everything you say makes me feel a bit dumber. But going after tick tock on policy, but every single critique and attack, Nikki Haley did was rooted in her strategy. It was not simply to throw darts. It was because she was trying to sort of have the lane in South Carolina to herself. What she didn't say last night to her fellow South Carolinian Tim Scott is, I put you in that seat. And when she was governor of South Carolina, she appointed then Congressman Tim Scott to fill the Senate seat of retiring Senator Jim DeMint. And then of course, he's been elected on his own, but that certainly was showing that she is trying to have that lien to herself. But I think overall, Dana, you hit the nail on the head about donors and money. We're at the very final days and even hours of the month of September, and the third quarter fundraising period. It wasn't just voters in New Hampshire and Iowa who were watching this debate, and they were. It was also these donors who are sitting on the sidelines, waiting to jump in to help fund and support a Trump alternative. So, that was a key audience as well, that certainly one she was playing to. I would say, Tim Scott was as well, he came out with a new sense of energy, and really a bounce in his step, if you will, going after Vivek Ramaswamy, and a backup to Nikki Haley, and on abortion and other matters. So, I thought that he was the most improved perhaps, of the night, but I think overall, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis centerstage. He also had a very strong night, and he is the leading alternative in some people's minds and a lot of voters' minds in Iowa. And he probably solidified that, at least to some degree.",

      "sentences": "You know, what I think is most interesting is if you frame what the senator told you afterwards, which I think is the best capture, obviously, he would know. It was him of what actually happened last night with Tim Scott in its entirety.Then I think a lot of the moments that we've seen play out in highlights throughout the course of this morning or in the wake of the debate. Tim Scott came out of the last debate with a lot of criticism about standing on the sidelines, not willing to engage, not doing enough in terms of throwing elbows around. He did that last night. But I think the sound you played at the top from, that was his biggest moment of the debate. When I was talking with Republicans this morning. They will all acknowledge to a person, that moment, particularly when he went straight to camera, talking about his personal experience. That is the moment that you see on the campaign trail. I know Jeff seen it up close that resonates that is the moment where voters or people who are watching him or learning about him for the first time. We haven't covered him like we all have kind of say, oh, wow. OK. This is a different kind of candidate. This is a candidate that has a real story and a story that I'm interested in. And I think that was what -- when I was talking to Republicans throughout the course of the morning, they're saying that that was the moment. And yet, everyone was talking about whether or not he could throw elbows, his willingness to throw elbows, the back and forth with Ambassador Haley. And I think that's kind of the difficulty to some degree that he has in this moment. Donors will give him a ton of money. People who know him think very highly of him within the party. But to get attention in this moment, when you're 30, 40, 50 points behind frontrunner, and there's that many people on stage, you have to try other things. And whether or not, he can be both, both the happy and the warrior, tried to demonstrate it last night, but it's a challenge.",

He is trying to elevate himself to be perceived as all but presumptive nominee and starting to frame a general election contest with Joe Biden as he was trying to do in Michigan yesterday.And yet, what you just heard in that soundbite that you played, he's well aware that there is still a nomination race to happen here. Voters have not yet weighed in, and he can't just take it for granted. And so, he'll return to Iowa this weekend. His campaign has said, they will be back in Iowa with several times throughout the month of October, because they can't lift their foot up off the gas pedal on trying to put the nomination race to bed, even as he wants to portray himself as the obits, certain nominee. And so, he's got to do those two things simultaneously. And you're right. I don't think anybody could begrudge him on the politics of it. For not showing up on the debate stage. It has been two debates now. And I don't think we see any evidence yet that it hurts him politically in any way, not to be there.",

If the speaker does not heed some of his demands, including over this all the fight over to keep the government open past Saturday.Well, Gaetz has been concerned because he believes the speaker's allies have been essentially promoting negative posts on him on social media, paying conservative influencers, especially bashed him on social media. Gaetz confronted the speaker about that this morning behind closed doors and asked him about the speaker brushes size that he has other things to worry about, then this issue. When I asked Gaetz about it afterwards. And he confirmed that all this happened. And I asked him, are you ready to move ahead with pushing for the speaker to be ousted? He said, he didn't indicate it. That is not going to happen at this point. But that is something that continues to remain on the table. Now this all comes as the fight over keeping the government open, continues to play out among Republicans, particularly on the House side. The speaker is making clear, he plans to have a vote tomorrow, to keep the government open for a short period of time. But he does not have support among his own conference. Democrats opposed it because the cuts that are in there. Republicans' hardliners are opposed to it as well as including Matt Gaetz, saying they don't want to keep the government open for a short period of time. They want longer term spending bills.

And the numbers that make it so clear that Kevin McCarthy eventually is not going to be able to do anything that funds the government without help from Democrats. I mean he's got a four-seat majority. And then you look, there's a list of hard knows that is longer than four, than likely knows longer than five. LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Yes. That's absolutely right. He is trying to negotiate with people who are never going to come to the table. And so, it makes absolutely no sense in real world situations. But for McCarthy, this is self-preservation. That is all this is about. He is afraid to turn to Democrats and find 10, 20, maybe 30 Democratic moderate votes to pass a short-term government funding bill, to keep the lights on past Saturday, because he is worried that there will be protests from the right and efforts from the right to remove him from his speakership. And so, self-preservation over governance. But I will say that there is a growing amount of frustration among Republicans about this strategy that is very transparent. I interviewed Representative Ken Buck of Colorado this morning for Washington Post's live. And he said that it is absolute, \"malpractice\" that Kevin McCarthy is waiting until the day before a government shutdown to put forward a bill to potentially short-term fund the government for a few weeks, knowing that it's probably going to fail and that not trying this weeks ago.
