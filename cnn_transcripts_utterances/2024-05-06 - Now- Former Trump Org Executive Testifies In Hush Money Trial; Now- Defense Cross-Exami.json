It is just a few seconds past New York, (Ph) Manhattan. You are watching CNN's special live coverage of Donald Trump's hush money trial. I'm Kaitlan Collins.Right now, Jeffrey McConney is on the stand. He is a Trump Organization insider. He was the keeper of that ledger that is at the heart of this case, and it includes payments from the Trump trust, his personal one to Michael Cohen, which were labeled as legal expenses, payments. The prosecutors say in reality were just reimbursements for money at the fixer. And Trump personal attorney allegedly funneled to Stormy Daniels as part of a scheme to silence her. I'm here with CNN chief legal affairs correspondent Paula Reid, and also the former Manhattan district attorney prosecutor Karen Friedman Agnifilo. Great to have you both back here. And right now, what they're walking through is basically how Michael Cohen got paid. And one thing that stands out and would be my question. Maybe if I was a juror is, well, if Trump was just reimbursing Michael Cohen as the defense is claimed, why not just do a one for one payment? Why are we looking at each of these different checks of him paying Michael Cohen $35,000 a month in the year 2017?",

During his testimony as he has been on any other witness. I think that's fascinating, right?You can read that one of two ways. One, he knows this is significant. But also, this is something that he who -- someone who worked for him for decades, the Trump Organization is paying McConney's legal fees, and he expects loyalty. But now they're going through his ledger at line by line, as you said, they are noting how each line item -- lists the retainer agreement payment to Michael Cohen. And this is significant because each of those entries -- those are tied to each of the 34 counts of falsifying business records. But I've said this multiple times this morning, the one thing that we haven't seen this morning is a direct link to the defendant to any of these documents to any of these payments.",

You have 34 counts that look just like this for a jury, right, where they have to prove the following things, intent to defraud, intent to commit another crime, aid and concern the commission of it. And of course, the false entry in all of the documents. The documents is the most important part of this, which brings you to why it's so mundane. They have to have all these different documents that have to -- really it come in as evidence, but they were actually falsified in a way. This is why this particular witness is going to be so important and thinking about all these things. And remember, it comes down to the numbers here. You're talking about a total of $420,000. Why is this important? It was all said to be put as legal fees. Now the course the prosecution wants you to think that the reimbursements were not legal fees. They were not. They were about trying to shield it from the actual general public in the campaign statements. But keep in mind who we're talking about. Jeffrey McConney, he's been here before. Testifying for days on end in the civil fraud trial, about the overinflation of assets in the past. And look at what he said, breaking down on the stand when he had for a fourth day of testimony. He talked about why he gave up his job. I just wanted to relax and stop being accused of misrepresenting assets for the company that I love working for, I'm sorry. Guess why he's here today for the misrepresentation by not himself, but by Donald Trump potentially as he's been accused of in this very notion.",

Just now inside that courtroom behind me, the cross-examination of a key Trump Organization insider has started, with Trump attorney Emil Bove doing the questioning. Prosecution step down moments after the witness. His name is Jeff McConney, identified Donald Trump's signature on a financial documents, and he had seen it many times.And my panel is back here with me. Paula Reid and Karen Friedman Agnifilo. And this is getting interesting because this is Trump's attorney questioning this longtime Trump employee. We know Trump isn't paying very close attention. And he just said, President Trump did not ask you to do any of the things that the prosecutor described to you. And McConney, this longtime Trump employee said, he did not. And he is saying that he didn't have a lot of interaction with Donald Trump. He said they did not speak directly very often. He's listening several years, asking if McConney talked to Trump in 2016, 2017, 2018 or ever. I did not. REID: This is the defense's case. We knew they were going to get up and they were going to say, Mr. McConney, did the defendant ask you to do any of these things? Because throughout McConney's testimony, he provided no direct evidence that Trump was involved. We have an update. The defense attorney says, McConney testified to a series of emails involving Cohen, but asked if he ever spoke to Cohen about any of the issues. No, talk to Michael. No. So, he's saying he did not talk to Michael Cohen. So, at this point, McConney has not provided direct evidence linking the alleged crimes to the defendant. And I think you're going to see the defense attorneys just hammer this again and again. I mean, McConney says, he didn't even talk to Trump for three years, including 2017, which is the year when this alleged criminal conduct occurred.

He has not provided, Kaitlan, that crucial link between the crime and the defendants, either knowledge about it or ordering that the documents be falsified. It's a big problem. And I'm telling you. If they don't fix this problem, what you're looking at is this kind of verdict right here of a not guilty. Even from a predominantly democratic jury, they have to follow the evidence in the case.

All occurred in 2017.So now you're going to see defense attorneys really drill down on that. How dramatically did you need to change the way you did business, once the head of your organization right had to divest from the business, pass it off to his sons and Allen Weisselberg, and also became the leader of the free world. Right now, the defense attorney asked when Trump moved to D.C. and took office, the Trump Organization internally was in flux and chaos. That's putting it mildly, McConney says. And this is really going to be significant because they're going to argue that what transpired here wasn't the result of a conspiracy. Instead, it was the result of chaos, which so often, as we know in Trump world, is the explanation or at least the defense against conspiracies.
