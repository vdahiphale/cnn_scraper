      "sentences": "Thank you so much for being with us. You are watching ONE WORLD. I'm Zain Asher. My colleague, Bianca Golodryga is offtoday. Any moment now, we are going to be hearing from U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland about the Justice Department report obtained by CNN on the shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas in 2022. The report includes really scathing, really damning details about the response by officials, by police, who could have and actually should have tried to stop the bloodshed sooner than they did. You'll remember that it took officials, it took actually police over an hour -- about one hour and 17 minutes to stop the shooter. Twenty-one people died in that massacre. That includes 19 children, two teachers. We are awaiting that press conference from U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland about that report, and we will bring it to you live as soon as it happens. All right, now to an unusual flare-up in tensions between two neighbors who share a history of insurgencies and a long and very volatile border. Pakistan launched military strikes inside Iran earlier today using killer drones, rockets and other weapons to hit what it said were separatist hideouts. This retaliatory strike comes two days after Iran fired missiles inside Pakistan targeting what it said were Sunni militants, separatist groups. This is video from Iran's Sistan and Balochistan province where the attack took place. Pakistan says it took a lot of care, maximum care in fact, to avoid any sort of collateral damage in these strikes. Iranian media report that at least 10 people were killed in the strikes, including women and children. Pakistan is saying that it doesn't want to escalate any tensions here, but its security is really its number one priority. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

So Sophia, Pakistan and Iran have long accused each other of sort of harboringmilitant groups that carry out attacks along their shared border. Clearly, there are fears of escalation here. Walk us through it. SOPHIA SAIFI, CNN Producer:  Yes, Pakistan and Iran have had a very fragile relationship ever since the inception of Pakistan back in 1947. Iran, in fact, was the first country to ever recognize Pakistan as a country. Now, it's got a long Western border with Iran, and Pakistan has said that these strikes that took place on Thursday morning were against militant hideouts. Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman, who we just heard, also said in that same press that they were none -- none of the people, according to Pakistan, who were killed or injured in those strikes of Pakistan were Iranian citizens. And Iran has said the same thing. Now, it seems that because there's been a tit-for-tat situation, this is going to come to an end. However, we would just have to -- the ball is now in Iran's court. Pakistan seems to have been caught by surprise when Iran caught -- took out those strikes deep into Pakistani territory. There's a lot of disappointment among the Pakistani public, which over the past couple of months had been very supportive towards Iran and its support for the Palestinian cause in the Middle East. So, this is something that's going to change Pakistan's relationship with Iran. We'd love to see how this unfolds.",

I'll let Hugh answer that specific question. CLEMENTS, JR.:  I would say honestly, I don't know if that's entirely true. I will tell you this report is comprehensive, it's extensive, I urge you all to read it. The executive summary, all hundreds of pages. I will say there was a -- epic, complete lack of leadership, unity of command. There was no incident command set-up --that's not the case with the Pulse Nightclub.

I mean, some of the sort of failures they laid out beyond incomprehensible. I want to bring in Juliette Kaya, CNN Senior National Security Analyst.

But what we already knew of not simply the failure for training and communication and the radio is not working. But the belief that they had, you know, that this was not an active shooter case and that somehow they had been able to isolate him. That mistake, and this is where I thought Garland was really strong, cost lives. Like there's no, there's no, you know, putting a silver lining around this. He made it clear that that delay, that absolute delay meant to not survive. And when you think about that, because remember over the last year and a half, people have wondered, well, were all the kids killed in the first seconds and they thought that they had detained a -- and the answer back from DOJ is without naming names, here's what we found by all of our investigation and then also comparative analysis in other active shooter cases.

So, when you heard Merrick Garland talk about thefailure to establish an incident command, everything flows from that. And I know this, every, anyone in my space knows this, that the incident command is going to take care of not just the actions during the event, but all the things you talk about. You know, you'll have someone who owns family unification, family communication. You'll have someone who's dealing with medical and medical surge. And isn't a command is just simply a template for putting order to chaos. And it's been around long enough, multiple decades, that everyone knows how to essentially play with it, right? That it expands if something gets really bad, it restricts if something seems less than we originally thought. And that -- and so that original failure to set up an incident commander who's deploying basically everything that one needs to -- know how to deploy and to set up an incident command structure to empower others to take charge of what they need to do in an active shooter case is -- you can't regroup from that. That's the point here. If you don't have that, if you don't have that template, that order, it's almost, you're just sort of catching up all the things that you said. You're sort of, you're saying one thing, but reality is another. These kids are -- are hurt, but they're being put on a bus. And if I sound energized or more energized than I am, you know, generally it is because, you know, it makes it sound bureaucratic, something like an incident command, but it's really a refined, sophisticated process because time is of the essence in these crises and disasters. This is what I always tell my students, right? Your runway is short. And if you don't get it right at the beginning, you can't get it right later.
