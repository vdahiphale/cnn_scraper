That sends a statement. And then let's look at the venue where this meeting is being held. It's been held at the Reagan Library, a hallmark in many ways of U.S. history. A spot where U.S. president -- were a U.S. presidential debate took place. That too sends a message. So, for those reasons, it is certainly angering China. As this is taking place, there is also another diplomatic visit that has now started earlier this morning, French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Beijing for a state visit -- a Chinese state visit with President Xi. Now it'll be interesting to see exactly how much is accomplished there. Because this is a state visit, and not that it's not serious and not that it's not formal. But there is some room for relaxation. For example, the French president will be attending a cultural festival, a Chinese French cultural festival. They may perhaps turn down the temperature of the talks and allow President Macron to talk about some very serious matters such as the war in Ukraine and China's support for Russia and its lack of condemnation of Russia's role in all of this. He's not -- he's not going to be scolding. He's not going to be scolding China per se. And, of course, there will also be some room for economic talks.
