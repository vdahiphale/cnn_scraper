But the Israeli military says a number of, quote, suspects were taken into custody. Israel had ordered hundreds of civilians sheltering in the hospital complex to leave, but doctors and medical officials say some was shot and killed by Israeli snipers as they tried to do so.

Later in the day, they held a press conference and the spokesperson saying that they actually detained three suspects that they named, that the IDF named and release photographs of who they say were involved in the October 7th attacks.They didn't release any additional information to prove that claim. They also said that there were other people who were arrested that they'd be releasing information on later in the day. The IDF, however, didn't find what they initially went in there to try to find which was the follow up on that credible intelligence they said that led them to believe there could be bodies of hostages buried in the hospital grounds. According to hospital officials, the IDF were digging up parts of the hospital compound looking for those bodies. But in the chaos when the IDF went into the hospital that was damaged, there was debris falling from the ceilings according to the hospital. At least one person was killed. The oxygen lines in the orthopedic unit were ruptured. The hospital saying they were concerned because those oxygen lines feed into the ICU, the intensive care unit. The Ministry of Health, the Hamas-backed Ministry of Health at the end of the day, saying there was some 200 patients and about a similar number of hospital staff and dependents left in the hospital. They say that they were short of food, short of water. And during the operations during the day, the IDF filtering people as they came out of the hospital. Doctors Without Borders who had medical personnel in the hospital say they were forced to leave the hospital as well. They said the IDF had told the hospital authorities, that medical personnel and patients would be safe. And MSF Doctors Without Borders saying that when their staff left through that same IDF filter process system, one of their MSF workers, medical workers, was detained by the IDF.

      "sentences": "U.S. prosecutors charged a former FBI informant with lying about corruption claims against President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, and business dealings with the Ukrainian energy company, Burisma. The charges against Alexander Smirnov undercut a major part of Republicans corruption claims against the President and the impeachment inquiry that they've launched against.Smirnov was behind two FBI memos in 2017 and 2020. The latter one came after Joe Biden launched his campaign for President. And it included explosive allegations that a Burisma executive claimed that the company paid Joe Biden and Hunter Biden $5 million each during the time that Biden was vice president in exchange for assisting the company's business interests. The indictment in federal court says that Smirnov's allegations against the Biden's were, quote, a fabrication and amalgam of otherwise unremarkable business meetings and contacts that actually occurred but at a later date than he claimed. And for the purpose of pitching Burisma on the defendant's purpose -- services and products, not for discussing bribes to Joe Biden when he was in office. Smirnov appeared for an initial court appearance in Las Vegas, where he was arrested. And CNN has been unable to reach an attorney representing him. Congressional Republicans have touted Smirnov's claims and they fought with the FBI to release the memos of his discussions with the FBI. The indictment against Smirnov cites those very same memos as proof that he allegedly made false statements and created fictitious documents. James Comer, the Republican chairman, who has been leading the investigation of the President, released a statement dismissing the importance of Smirnov to his inquiry and saying that there's more evidence that Republicans have uncovered. The case against Smirnov is being brought by Special Counsel David Weiss, who is also prosecuting Hunter Biden on tax and gun possession charges. It's unclear why is this taken nearly four years to bring charges on the allegedly false claims? Evan Perez, CNN, Washington.",
