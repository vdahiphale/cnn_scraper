We've learned Trump's former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has testified before a federal grand jury. Now it's unclear whether his testimony was part of Smith's classified documents probe or his January 6 investigation. Maybe both. But Meadows could prove to be a critical witness. Asked about this development, a lawyer representing Meadows said in a statement, \"Without commenting on whether or not Mr. Meadows has testified before the grand jury or in any other proceeding, Mr. Meadows has maintained a commitment to tell the truth where he has a legal obligation to do so.\"So, I want to turn now to our CNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig. He's a former Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and a former New Jersey state prosecutor. All, Elie, decode this for us. How important is Mark Meadows in one or both of the investigations that are ongoing right now?",

Meadows was Donald Trump's White House Chief of Staff for the last 10 months or so of Trump's presidency. Meaning he was there through the election, he was there through January 6, he was there up until the final day.Now, just as one indicator of how important Mark Meadows was. As the January 6 attack was happening, that afternoon dozens of powerful people were texting Mark Meadows desperately trying to get him to get Donald Trump to call off the rioters. One example, Representative Chip Roy said it simply, fix this now. Also, we remember the testimony last year of Cassidy Hutchinson in front of the January 6 committee. Cassidy Hutchinson was one of Mark Meadows senior aides. And she said that on that day, there were several conversations that Meadows had one on one with Donald Trump. Now she didn't know exactly what we said. You know who does? Mark Meadows. He will be questioned about those conversations. Now, also, one more place Mark Meadows pops up. We remember the infamous phone call Donald Trump made to the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. That could be a key part of the Fulton County case where Trump asked Raffensperger to just find votes for him. Guess who else was on that phone call. Mark Meadows. He introduces the participants. And finally, again, we don't know exactly what he testified about. But let's remember, Meadows was the chief of staff when the White House was being packed up. And he was a key liaison between the White House and the Archives. So, he may know something about what was packed, what was classified, was anything declassified?",

The court said, no, this is part of a criminal grand jury subpoena. Then it got appealed by Donald Trump up to the Court of Appeals, DOJ won there.

It could just be ministerial. It could just be there some witnesses, they want to get the testimony down in Florida, you can then just read it to your main grand jury in D.C. or it could be something bigger.There's a concept called venue which says that federal prosecutors have to charge a crime in the federal geographic district where at least some part of the crime happened. If there are some people perhaps who work at Mar-a-Lago who may have criminal liability, it may be that they only did things in Florida, not in D.C. Now, the bigger question is, could it be that DOJ, the Special Counsel might try to charge Donald Trump in Florida instead of D.C.? Now, there's a stronger case for venue in Florida. There's a sort of weaker option in D.C. but there's a big difference here, which is Donald Trump won Florida. He's going to have a much friendlier jury pool in Florida. You know how much he got in D.C.? 5.4 percent of the vote. Meaning, 94.6 of people voted against him in D.C. So, Florida is a much better jury pool for Donald Trump. D.C. is a much better jury pool for prosecutors.",

He will be going under a general anesthetic. So that's always of course dangerous for someone his age, but we don't know.

I mean, when you're conducting a combined arms offensive, which means heavy armored forces, mechanized infantry, artillery, et cetera, it would be helpful to have a long-range strike aircraft that could hit target state, tactical air support from those units as well and then help clear the skies of Russian aircraft. But that won't be available. And I think, look, the administration is to blame for being late in terms of delivering the most vital items, whether it's Abrams tanks or F-16 aircraft.",

It's unclear whether they have the numbers of tanks they need. But look at this point, they have to move forward on the counteroffensive.They need to push the Russians back.
