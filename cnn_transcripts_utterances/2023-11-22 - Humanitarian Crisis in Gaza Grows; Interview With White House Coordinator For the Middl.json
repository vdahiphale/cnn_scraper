I'm Boris Sanchez in Washington, alongside Wolf Blitzer in Tel Aviv, Israel.We're tracking the critical deal between Israel and Hamas to free dozens of women and children being held hostage in Gaza. Next hour, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and members of his war cabinet will provide an update on this diplomatic breakthrough. It's set to become a battlefield of reality at 3:00 a.m. Eastern time here in the United States, 10:00 a.m. local in Gaza and Israel. A four-day pause in fighting will be enacted, which will begin the process of getting 50 Hamas hostages safely to Israel in exchange for the release of 150 Palestinians in Israeli custody -- Wolf.",

In moments, we will hear from a top White House official who was inside the room for the hostage negotiations, and I will speak live to someone holding out hope that Hamas will free their relatives under this agreement. But, first, let's to go CNN's Oren Liebermann. He's here with us in Tel Aviv right now. Oren, how do we expect this to play out? What will happen when the clock strikes 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning?",

In previous rounds of fighting between Israel and Hamas or Israel and Gaza, the fighting, frankly, continues up until the cease-fire or the pause goes into effect. That does not mean the deal is off. Every indication we're getting from the Israeli government, from the U.S., from Qatar, from Hamas is that this deal is very much on. So, at 10:00 tomorrow morning, the fighting stops, and then a short time after that, 50 Israeli hostages, women and children held in Gaza, will begin to make their way out. It's unclear exactly how or where they will cross into Israel, whether it's directly into Israel or whether they will first go through Egypt. At the same time, there is another process there; 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli jails, they will start to be released. And this plays out in stages over four days. It will be 10 to 12 Israeli women and children a day in exchange for, we believe, a portion of the Palestinian prisoners released each day. At the same time, the fighting will stop, more humanitarian aid expected into Gaza, that very much a demand not only of Hamas, but also of the World Health Organization and so many who are trying to deal with the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza.",

They're working on trying to focus in and essentially consolidate their gains and push harder against what they see as Hamas strongholds there sort of east of where we were in Gaza over the course of the last couple of days. We have seen red alerts coming from Gaza indicating incoming rocket fire. So we very much expect that fighting to go up until perhaps the very last minute. It is also worth, at the same time, keeping an eye on Israel's northern border and Hezbollah on that side, as well as off of Israel's Southern border, the Houthis in Yemen. Both have engaged in attacks on Israel, Israel defending itself and striking back, at least on the northern border. They're obviously not a party to this agreement or this pause in the fighting.

And it is a detailed -- without anything really being left a chance. I think everybody understands exactly what they need to do. There's a very detailed text of what has to happen once this goes into place tomorrow morning. But, look, I mean, I have to be honest. We're dealing with Hamas. So even though we have this agreement, it is a major, major breakthrough. The president has been directly engaged over the last five weeks with 14 engagements with President Netanyahu, with President Sisi, with the emir of Qatar, really kind of driving this towards an agreement. We finally have it. But now we actually have to implement. And the onus is on Hamas to release these hostages. I would just make one more point. This deal is structured to incentivize the release of all hostages. And we could not have gotten this deal under these terms even two to three weeks ago. So we expect to see, under the terms of the deal, 50 women and children come out over the first four days of this humanitarian pause period that we hope will start tomorrow. That includes toddlers. It includes babies. It includes a 3-year-old American toddler. But then, if you want the pause to continue, the onus is on Hamas. For every 10 additional hostages, the pause will continue.

It eventually came forward with a list of 10 names, 10 women and children. That was inadequate. It eventually, then, over weeks of very difficult negotiations, and, frankly, as Hamas came under increasing military pressure, came forward with a list of 50 women and children that it could identify with identifying characteristics that would come out in this first phase. But, no, we demand proof of life and to understand the conditions of all these hostages. And, to date, that has not happened. I was asked earlier, do we know if the 50 are alive and well? We understand they're alive, but they're certainly not well. These 50 women, children, again, toddlers, it's just unimaginable what they have gone through.

At that time, nothing was getting in. And we have since ramped up to about 100 trucks a day. I just spoke with David Satterfield, our humanitarian coordinator on the ground. We are working to get as much in as possible. But it has always been the case that, if you talk to the humanitarian groups who are facilitating this aid, that you need a pause in hostilities to really significantly ramp up. So we have been preparing for this moment. We're hopeful that, starting tomorrow, you will see a significant increase in aid. That's something we want to sustain. But we're ready for that. But this won't go perfectly. This is a very, very difficult situation. We do want to make sure trucks are inspected, obviously, so that Hamas cannot rearm during this period. But we have those inspection mechanisms in place. And I'm very hopeful that you will see a significant increase in aid, which is needed.

And that kind of rigorous inquiry is how we are dealing in our partnership here with the Israelis. It's constant. It's ongoing. I have to say, they adjusted the land invasion plan to account for this hostage process, because we were hopeful to get a hostage deal, that they would be able to pause and support a pause in operation should we get it. And we got it. But, yes, as we go forward, we will be in very close consultations with the Israelis. We want to see Hamas separated from the Palestinian population. And civilian protection is fundamental. So this is something that we are very much engaged in. It's also a very difficult situation, because Hamas is using hospitals and civilian infrastructure for its war aims. That's just an undeniable fact. And Hamas started this war.
