That is the big question, tonight, as a federal judge today ruled that Mike Pence must appear, before a grand jury, and reveal his conversations, with Trump, in the run-up to the Capitol attack, despite his efforts to avoid doing so. In moments, we have new reporting, on Pence's next step, and you'll hear what the former Vice President himself, has to say, about this ruling. But obviously, this is a win, for Special Counsel, Jack Smith, who is investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Now, Pence, of course, presided over the certification, of the Electoral College vote. And, according to witnesses, before the January 6 committee, Pence was on the other end of a quote, \"Heated\" phone call, the morning of the attack. Also tonight, in another investigation, into Trump, we're learning of a new development, and the potential looming indictment, in the hush money case, in New York. But first, let's begin with the judge's ruling, involving Pence. CNN's Paula Reid is here. This is truly significant. This ruling, we should note, is still under seal. But our reporting indicates, the judge said Pence has to testify. It's more narrow that the judge did acknowledge that Pence - the Speech or Debate Clause that Pence had been arguing. But the bottom line, as I'm told by a source, close to Pence, is that he's undecided on whether he's going to appeal, and that this opens the door to more questions, from DOJ than Pence would have wanted.",

So, here, investigators, they want to hear about this pressure campaign, not just from Trump, but also from his allies. You may also remember, Pence wrote about a lot of these conversations, in his book, as part of an effort, to move books, to make sales. So, it's unclear if he's going to be able to share additional details, if there are additional details. But it's so critical for the Special Counsel, to get a record of this, under oath, as he moves forward, on any potential prosecutions.",

KAREN FRIEDMAN AGNIFILO, FORMER CHIEF ASSISTANT MANHATTAN D.A.: No, he's going to have to testify, before the grand jury. He's going to have to provide his testimony, about the conversations, leading up to January 6. What the judge ruled today, what we're hearing, because it's under seal, was that he - it's only limited. The Speech and Debate Clause, which is usually only limited, to Representatives or Senators, because he has the role, of being President of the Senate, in that limited role, when he was certifying, the election, he doesn't have to testify about that. But all of that January 6 is on video. So, really, what's important, and what they need, in the grand jury, are what, were the conversations before that, and the pressure campaign that Donald Trump put, on Mike Pence, to not certify the election, and potentially, potentially, provide evidence that would show Donald Trump was committing a crime. So, I think, he might want to say this is a victory, because it did say that the Vice President, which is normally in the - gets the executive privilege, which he also doesn't get, in this case? That was also rule does not apply. But this is the first time anyone's ruled that the Speech and Debate Clause does apply.",

I think it's also a basis for him to appeal it, if he decides to.Remember, we haven't seen the order yet. But Judge Boasberg is a very well-respected judge. I'm sure it's very well thought-out. The reason, I say, it's a partial win, is it is true that the judge apparently found that the Speech or Debate Clause applies to the Vice President, sitting in his role, as President of the Senate. The Justice Department has taken that position, with respect to Mr. Pence, in a couple of civil cases, already. So, I think that was an appropriate decision, from any perspective. I think the reason I say, he has a basis for appealing it is the Speech or Debate Clause is generally very broadly applied. So, in other words, in the Bannon case, in D.C., the judge applied it to the members, and to all of their staffers, and including press - statements to the press, things like that. Under the Gravel case, it really should apply to statements that are integral part of the deliberative or communicative process.",

He also, he doesn't speak like a lawyer, in these cases, or doesn't pretend to. He speaks from advice that he's gotten, from lawyers, all that. So, I think, when he refers to what he could have done, the documents, he means that he had the power, when he was President, to declassify those documents. Remember, all of these issues don't turn, are on their classified status.

But we also know last week, the prosecutors were thrown for a bit of a loop, when defense attorneys asked them, to please put attorney, Robert Costello, before the grand jury. Then, we learned, following that, our colleague John Miller learned that they were contemplating whether they needed to bring someone, back in, to rebut Costello's testimony, attacking Michael Cohen, undermining his narrative, of how these hush money payments were arranged.

He was involved in these so-called catch-and-kill deals for years.And an agent, for Stormy Daniels, had reached out to AMI, the company that he was in charge of, at the time, in October of 2016, one month before the presidential election. He put them in touch with David - with Michael Cohen. And Michael Cohen, of course, then eventually did finalize this deal, and issued the - make the - facilitate the hush money payment. So, he really is a witness that can come in, and kind of reset the table, after Costello was in, and say, \"Remember, this is how this started,\" and explain to the jury why this came about, and I'm sure, the urgency of this. I mean, about two weeks, before the election, the deal was still not done. And Pecker reached out to Cohen, over a secured and encrypted app, and had said to him, they need to get this deal done, or quote, \"It could look awfully bad for everyone.\" So remember, David Pecker received immunity, for his testimony, in this case, and also in the federal case, alleged charges against Michael Cohen. So, he certainly is a witness that can kind of bring them inside the room, and set the table, for what the urgency was, right before the election. BROWN: All right. Kara Scannell, Paula Reid, thank you both. Well, ever since Donald Trump posted on social media, about what he insisted was a pending indictment, his lawyer has been all over television.

He doesn't even have the time to speak and complete thoughts to be like, \"Oh, no, that was just some idiocy, he rattled off. It wasn't meaningful.\" But you guys know this well. One thing he is intentional about is words, whether it's words he uses in tweets, or in Truths, or that he uses in speeches. So, when I was watching this Waco speech, this was very orchestrated. It was planned. He wanted - he chose that location, for a reason, a historic extremist site that has cult-like ties to it. That is stuff that is planned with him, and you can't disconnect those things. And I was struck that this rhetoric is significantly harsher than we even saw leading up to January 6. So, we remember, \"It's going to be wild,\" ahead of the January 6 rally. Some of what he's been saying is going much further now. But what's striking to me is it's not connecting. And thank God that it's not. We've not seen massive protests, massive rallies, because of the indictment. And I think, the disconnect is he lied to the public, at January 6, and said, \"Your vote was stolen, the election was stolen.\" So people came out to fight for their vote, in their election. It was a lie. This is him airing his grievances. And it's not - it's not connecting. That doesn't mean it's not - people aren't going to support him. It doesn't mean he's not polling well.

I think what he's arguing is that being a former President, maybe a future president, is not a reason to not charge someone. It does make - the point has been made repeatedly, that treating Trump differently, because he was a president, and because he is a candidate now, is letting him be above the law, is giving him a different standard. And we have had that precedent, in this country. There have been other cases of people, who may have been indicted and weren't, because the decision was it would rip the country apart.

I mean, he's a person, who's defied norms, and he's defied reality. And he's continued to move up in the poll, despite half a dozen civil, criminal, federal and state investigations going on. The fact is he is a candidate that his base loves. He has a rock-solid hold on about 30 percent of the Republican base. But this is a man who I at least believe is highly unelectable, in a general election. I hope that my party learns the lesson that we should have learned, in 2020, which is you can nominate him, but you will lose. This is a man, who incited an Insurrection. This is a man, who is under countless investigations. He's not going to win a general election. But again, he's outperforming Ron DeSantis.

But the bottom line is these investigations were still ongoing. And it's so interesting, though, that now he is saying, \"Well, this is election interference,\" when these investigations predated, right, when he launched another run for the White House. It's interesting also hearing Republicans, like James Comer, calling Bragg, saying that this is political interference. Again, it predated, the investigation predated Trump announcing.
