This hour, opening statements could begin setting the stage for this historic defamation case to play out. The 12-person jury has just been selected and officially sworn in. CNN's Danny Freeman is tracking it all for us from Delaware. Danny, what is happening right now?DANNY FREEMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (on camera): Well, as you said, basically at 11:00 a.m. on the dot, the jury was sworn in for this historic trial. And I should say that there are 12 primary jurors and 12 alternates as well. Six men, six women, and according to our producers in the room right now, nine of those 12 jurors on that primary jury are people of color. Now, as you said, we're expecting opening statements potentially in the next hour, but they have not begun at this point. And that's in part because earlier, there were some objections that both sides made to some of the slides that were going to be presented in the opening statements so the judge said that he will take care of that before opening statements officially begin. But we were able to actually get a preview of what some of the arguments will be coming up. Hopefully this afternoon. Dominion provided a statement this morning saying in part in the coming weeks, we will prove Fox spread lies causing enormous damage to Dominion, and we look forward to trial. Meanwhile, Fox in these dueling statements sent out one earlier this week saying, \"Dominion's lawsuit is a political crusade in search of a financial windfall, but the real cost will be the cherished First Amendment rights.\" Now at this point, we're looking to see if there will be any witnesses on this particular day. But as far as we know, for now, we should be sticking to opening statements. Again, now the jury selection is complete, they should be happening within the next few hours. Back to you.",

The Department of Justice says this is the first known overseas police station in the United States. It has been shut down since a search warrant was executed last fall.Here with us now is CNN Chief Law Enforcement and Intelligence Analyst John Miller. Can you say I'm glad you're here because I need you to explain to me exactly what these guys are charged with doing and what the law says about this kind of activity? JOHN MILLER, CNN CHIEF LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; INTELLIGENCE ANALYST: Well, so let's imagine the whole thing in reverse, which is supposing the NYPD or the FBI opened a police station in Beijing and said we're here and we're going to track down Americans in China who are tweeting bad things about the US government. China would have a problem with that. America would have a problem with it. Everybody would. But in this case, you had this Chinese National Police facility. So, it's part of the Public Security section of the Ministry of Interior, operating in a nondescript building in the outskirts of Chinatown at the northern reaches where you had 34 police officers, you had a couple of supervisors there. And they were tracking down Chinese dissidents that were known to be in the United States, tracking down people who were critical on social media. And in the background, they were running a troll farm that was pushing anti-American Chinese propaganda. They had an executive at Zoom who was actually knocking off people from the zoom platform who were critical of China. So, you had a multifaceted Chinese counterintelligence operation operating that was not registered with the State Department as being a government operation and hiding in plain sight almost.",

CNN's Natasha Bertrand is at the Pentagon with the very latest. You and one of our other colleagues, Tim Lister, put this story out just moments ago. Tell us what you learned.NATASHA BERTRAND, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY REPORTER (on camera): Yes, Sara. So, we're learning that the Department of Energy's Office of nonproliferation policy sent a letter to Russia's state-owned energy firm Rosatom in March telling them that essentially, the U.S. has sensitive nuclear technology inside the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine, and warning them that Russia does not have the authorization to access it or to touch it at all. Now, this letter was sent to Rosatom's Director General and it is unclear whether Rosatom has actually acknowledged receipt of this letter or whether they are going to comply. But the U.S. in this letter was very adamant. That's because a lot of this sensitive nuclear technology is subject to export controls, which means that its unauthorized use could undermine U.S. national security interests. The Russians are not authorized. They're not part of an authorized list of recipients to actually access it, control it, do anything with it in any way. And, of course, the Russians currently are in control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine. They have been for about a year now. And they control the entire area really where that nuclear power plant sits. And Rosatom oversees that entire power plant even though Ukrainian workers are actually still physically kind of operating on a day-to-day basis. So, the U.S. bottom line here is very concerned about what would happen if Russia got its hands on some of this very sensitive nuclear technology. And they're telling Russia look, you better back off here. But, of course, it is very unlikely at this point that the Russians are going to comply, Sara.",

If the answer is no, then you're basically left with this. This was a rare occurrence. But right now, there's nothing to suggest that his likelihood of having this happen again is any higher than the general population, which I know again, that's scary to hear about because he went through it. He had a cardiac arrest. And essentially, he had this massive resuscitation on the football field. And again, lots of testing in the months after. But after doing all that, the conclusion is that he should be clear to play and that his risk isn't really higher than anybody else's. I will say -- I will add that if you look historically -- and Commotio Cordis again, that's the presumptive diagnosis, I don't think we have heard for sure.

We've all heard that you know, kids share each other's Adderall or other ADHD medication in order to stay up for an all-nighter to write a paper or study for a test. But these researchers said, let's try to quantify that and see how often that's happening. So, they reached out to about 3200 middle and high schools. What they found is that out of those 3200, there were 58 schools where one in four -- about one in four students was misusing Adderall. So, it might have been a child who was prescribed it, but they were taking too much of it, taking it when they shouldn't be taking it, or it might have been a child who wasn't prescribed it at all but got a pill from a brother or a sister or a friend or somebody.
