The U.S. Coast Guard is announcing, they just announced this moments ago, that a debris field, a debris field has been discovered near the Titanic in the submersible search area. We don't know much, but at this point, it is just that a debris field has been discovered. That is what they're saying at this point in time. They're saying that it was discovered by a remote operated vehicle, okay, an ROV, and that they are evaluating the information. That's all we have at this point in time. But of course with every hour, the situation is growing more dire for the five people on board lost in the cold, dark waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The amount of air is -- the amount of breathable air, rather, the amount of oxygen is dwindling in this tiny sub. There was an estimated 96 hours worth of oxygen on Sunday when the vessel descended to explore the wreckage of the Titanic that was on Sunday. A massive amount of resources including ROVs, Remotely Operated Vehicles, are already at or being rushed to the search area right now. And the U.S. Navy plans to send a deep water winch system that could bring up the sub if, if and when it is found. Meantime friends and loved ones of those on board are hoping and praying at this point for a miracle. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The U.S. Coast Guard is tweeting that just moments ago, a debris field has beenfound -- a debris field has been found near the Titanic search area. Of course, they're looking for this missing submersible. They've been looking for it for five days. Apparently, an ROV, remote operated vehicle, discovered this debris field just moments ago. As I understand it, the U.S. Coast Guard is going to be holding a press conference on this discovery in about three hours or so from now. All right. We the people, the leaders of the world's two largest democracies, referred to that key phrase in their country's constitutions as they met at the White House today. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi got a rousing welcome on his first state visit. A relationship President Joe Biden describes as one of the most defining ones of the 21st century. They'll speak to reporters later this hour, a rare event for Mr. Modi, and later he'll address a joint meeting of Congress. Washington sees New Delhi as a pivotal counterbalance to Beijing. It's a big diplomatic win for a man that was once denied a U.S. visa. CNN's Kevin Liptak joins us live now from the White House with more on this landmark visit. It is certainly historical, this visit, especially given that President Biden has only had three state visits under his watch. Obviously, this is the third one, however, this visit is not without controversy, Kevin, especially given some of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's record when it comes to human rights abuses and also discrimination, for example, and cracking down on journalists and free speech. Just walk us through what President Biden has to gain from this particular state visit.",

President Biden's policy towards that region really does focus on cultivating these other countries in the region, and India is certainly a linchpin. It shares a lengthy border with China, and President Biden certainly wants to ensure that Prime Minister Modi is sort of in alignment on that area, as well. The issue of Russia, of course, will come up. India has continued to buy Russian oil despite sanctions due to the war in Ukraine. And this is something that President Biden really does want to convince him to sort of take a side in that conflict. They are expected to announce a number of agreements, including in aerospace, telecommunications. The U.S. is going to announce some efforts to bolster India's semiconductor industry. But it really is this issue of human rights that is looming so large over this visit. Of course, President Biden isn't the first U.S. president to try and cultivate Prime Minister Modi. President Trump, his predecessor, actually brought him down to Houston to host this enormous rally called Howdy Modi. So, it's not necessarily at that level, but it is certainly a very red carpet, heavy visit, a lot of pomp, a lot of pageantry, and President Biden will certainly want to discuss all of these issues. We will see them in about 45 minutes when they take questions from the press. That in itself is a rarity, Zain. Prime Minister Modi doesn't regularly hold press conferences. He doesn't regularly do international interviews. This is something of a debate between the U.S. side and the Indian side, but they did eventually come to an agreement where they would take questions. So, that will be a very interesting event in the coming hour.",

As we mentioned, both leaders are scheduled to talk to reporters later this hour.And as Kevin was just pointing out there, this is something that Indian officials actually, initially resisted since Modi does not hold news conferences back home. But we will bring you that news conference as and when it happens. Former U.S. President Barack Obama says that sometimes you have to engage with autocratic leaders even when you have deep differences. CNN's Christiane Amanpour sat down with the former president for an exclusive interview. The two met in Athens, the birthplace of democracy, and they discussed a number of issues, including the upcoming U.S. elections, the war in Ukraine, and diplomacy. Here's a preview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BARACK OBAMA, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT:  If the President meets with Prime Minister Modi, then the protection of the Muslim minority in a majority Hindu India, that's something worth mentioning. And by the way, if I had a conversation with Prime Minister Modi, who I know well, part of my argument would be that, if you do not protect the rights of ethnic minorities in India, then there is a strong possibility of India at some point starts pulling apart. And we've seen what happens when you start getting those kinds of large internal conflicts. So, that would be contrary to the interests not just of Muslim India, but also Hindu India. So, I think it's important to be able to talk about these things honestly. You're never going to have a -- things are never going to be as clean as you'd like because the world is complicated.

Now, what's also significant, and it does appear that, at least according to what the officials in Russian-occupied Ukraine say, is that this was, they were using a storm shadow missile, a cruise missile. This is a cruise missile jointly manufactured by Britain and France that has a range of more than 250 kilometers. And this is clearly going to complicate the war effort launched by Putin back in February of 2022.

It's still too dangerous for civilians to return to these once tranquil farming communities, and there isn't much left for them to return to.

Far better than the old Soviet ammunition, says Andriy. Amazing. They're just great, he says. They hit the bullseye. My favorite. Throughout the day shelling echoes around them, the Russians may have left the village, yet they're still nearby. Yuri's mortar training in Britain didn't prepare him for the front.

And I want to welcome our viewers -- our international viewers from around the world nowas we watch and try to learn what is happening with this very much international story, it's very much of an international story, has international implications for just in short term because of who is on board. Stephen McGinty is the author of \"The Dive\", the untold story of the world's deepest submarine rescue. So, let's just pick up where Miguel left off talking about what the Coast Guard has said and trying to read the tea leaves on their statement. STEPHEN MCGINTY, AUTHOR, \"THE DIVE\":  I think that anyone hearing the news that the Coast Guard has put out that the remote operating vehicle has found a debris field. The natural conclusion would be that the Titan, that the submarine has got to a certain depth and suffered some kind of catastrophic depressurization, which has led to the submarine effectively collapsing like a tin can. And I mean, that would be the deepest fear effectively and which would mean that it will soon be moving to a recovery phase of the process because no one could survive that. I mean, that's one option. To be optimistic about it is potentially to read that it's a debris field related to something else, as one of your other contributors said, and that the submarine is intact at some other location. And what they're -- then it could still potentially be a recovery, but clearly we're at a time where the oxygen window, so to speak, has already closed and it would be then dependent on them finding some way to extend the oxygen in the vessel. But even then, if they would have to find them, they would have to secure them, then it would have to winch them two miles to the surface. So, I think the fact now is looking exceptionally bleak.",

These are some of the many questions that we are going to have for the rear admiral when he begins the press briefing which is scheduled to get underway here at the o'clock. Again, the U.S. Coast Guard's reading out that a debris field has been found near the Titanic. They are analyzing the debris, but there are so many indicators here that this is something significant simply because first and foremost we've got the rear admiral who's going to be speaking about this, whereas in the past, when we were out here for briefings, it was one of the captains here who was conducting the briefings before that. Again, the U.S. Coast Guard saying that an ROV, one of the remotely operated vehicles, came across the debris field. These ROVs, which, Dana, we've been speaking about for the past few days, are equipped with cameras, equipped with robotic arms, and when you think about the Titanic, you think about those who have been down there before. I mean, this is a deep area of the ocean, some two miles or so down beneath the surface, some 13,000 feet below the surface. It's a dark, desolate area, but it's an area that has been mapped, that has been clearly sort of indicated in the past, people who have been down there, there have not been that many. They know what's down there. They know what they're looking at. And so, logically thinking, if a Coast Guard is going to put out a tweet like that, one would have to think that they know what they're looking for when they get down there.

What was very interesting was that yesterday we heard from the Canadian officials telling us that the John Cabot, a Canadian ship that had what they call a side scanning radar capabilities, mapping capabilities, would be on location and they started to actually try and coordinate with the noises that they heard with the mapping and trying to determine and geolocate exactly where they came and determine what they were. Could they be explained some other way or could possibly these noises be coming, you know, quite deliberately from the Titan and they were in the middle of that. As far as we understand, Dana, they're still doing that. But John Cabot is still out there, still working on this at this very minute. And they really tried to pre-position and then deploy every resource that they possibly could, given what the U.S. Coast Guard said were challenging circumstances and a remote area. I do want to add, no matter what they found down there right now, the weather cooperated, Dana. I've been out in the North Atlantic. It can change on a dime. It didn't. It went from kind of okay with some fog in the early hours to much better weather. And that has certainly helped for them to get all of this data back even from that remote operated vehicle. Yeah. Mother Nature is cooperating in that sense for sure. Paula, thank you so much. CNN's Gabe Cohen is still with us.

And when they actually started lifting them from the seabed, the ship that the winch was attached to was going up and down by maybe 20 --30 feet. So, they were being smashed about inside the submarine. So, if, the fact that it is good weather on the surface means that if God willing, there is still a potential rescue operation, then that can only be in their favor.

And we're talking about five people who are on board, Stockton Rush, the CEO of course of Ocean Gate. In addition to that, British-Pakistani Businessman Shahzada Dawood, his 19- year-old son Suleman also on board the Titan. Paul-Henri Nargeolet, the French national, and Hamish Harding, the British billionaire. Five lives, five people on board the Titan, their families, of course, watching for everything that's going on. We've been told all along that the Coast Guard has been keeping close contact with the families as they've been going through all this. The Titan went into the water 96 hours ago, four days ago, and this was the day, quite frankly, that the air was literally running out for them.

The depth is beyond anything that a human being could even exist in. That depth, if you're exposed to the water, you'll just be squashed. The pressures are immense. And even if you can get them to the surface, unless there has been a leak on board the submarine, which would have affected them anyway, once they come out, the atmospheric pressure so they won't have been under any sort of pressure. So, they won't need a recompression chamber.
