Ahead on \"CNN Newsroom.\"Putin is watching, a stark warning from one U.S. senator to fellow lawmakers, as he urges Congress to pass aid for Ukraine. We'll discuss how inaction from Congress is impacting Ukraine's front lines. And Israel sets a deadline for the release of hostages before it expands military operations in Rafah. Plus, a Minnesota town is grieving the loss of three first responders. Details on the domestic incident that ended in tragedy. We begin in a town in eastern Ukraine. Russian flags are now flying over Avdiivka, after Kyiv withdrew its soldiers after several months of intense battles. Ukraine is now waiting anxiously for U.S. artillery, as a key aid bill remains stuck in the U.S. Congress. But U.S. House Republicans are on a two-week recess instead of pushing along that bill. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says U.S. President Joe Biden reiterated America's support for Ukraine during a phone conversation. But Mr. Zelenskyy says that aid is critical to stop the Russian president's plans. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) VOLODYMYR ZELENSKYY, UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): The conversation with President Biden, very important points, including about Avdiivka and the need for continued, principled and sufficient support for Ukraine. And each conversation clearly confirmed the key point. Ukraine alone can stop Putin and create conditions for him to be punished for all the evil he has done. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And Vladimir Putin, quote, \"is watching\". A spokesperson for Alexei Navalny said his mother and lawyers were denied access on Monday to the morgue where his body is allegedly being held. A Russian human rights group says nearly 30,000 people have signed a petition demanding that authorities release his body. Officials say Navalny died Friday after losing consciousness. The exact location of his body still remains unclear. Well, meantime, people around the world are expressing their outrage over the activist's unexplained death. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the center of Berlin to pay tribute to Navalny. They blamed Vladimir Putin for his death. Well, in London, a temporary shrine outside the Russian embassy has been growing by the hour. Supporters have left hundreds of bouquets and condolence messages for Navalny and his family. For more, let's go to CNN's Clare Sebastian in London. Clare, those hundreds of people in Russia laying flowers, holding vigils, dozens now in jail, this real act of defiance, you know, they are coming out despite knowing the consequences of their actions.

The number of convictions is up 50-fold in the last 10 years, and in the first six months of 2023, there were more convictions for planning or carrying out terrorism-related crimes than there were during any entire year over the past decade. So you can see that there. But look, this ever-expanding toolkit that the Russian state is equipping itself with to stamp out any kind of dissent involves not only laws that existed before the war, but new offenses like the wartime censorship laws, discrediting the army, spreading fake information about the army. Those have been added to that toolkit, and we've been taking a look at how that has changed the landscape of life in Russia. Take a look.

Hers is one of a steady stream of lives turned upside down by Russia's wartime censorship laws. Her alleged crime, spreading knowingly false information about the Russian army, one of several new offenses created in the early turbulent days of Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine. Now, along with discrediting the army, they form a key pillar of the Kremlin's effort to stamp out all dissent and independent media.

They just want everyone to be silent. SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Almost two years in, thousands of civil cases have been brought under these laws, and more than 400 criminal cases, according to human rights group OVD-Info, some resulting in long prison sentences.

He suggested on his social media platform that he's being targeted by the Biden administration the same way Putin went after Navalny. Earlier, I spoke about that with Thomas Gift, director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) THOMAS GIFT, DIRECTOR, CENTER ON U.S. POLITICS, UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON: Well, it's a completely absurd analogy, Anna, but it's something that you would expect from Donald Trump. I mean, Trump's playbook with the court cases is fairly predictable at this point. Complain that it's election interference, blame it on a left-wing conspiracy, show no contrition, then declare that an attack on him is an attack on all Americans. Every single piece of evidence that we've seen so far is that embracing that martyrdom complex works for Trump. So he's going to keep on exploiting it. I think for any other politician, a case like the one that we just saw would crash and burn their political career. For Trump, it's just business as usual. And, you know, for Republican voters, every guilty verdict just reinforces this narrative that they've come to adopt. It doesn't matter if Trump's lying. They just think that sort of facts are rigged. And so they're going to support him. COREN: I mean, it shouldn't surprise us that Trump made Navalny's death about himself.

And so the variety of weather threats, primarily we're expecting heavy rainfall in a lot of these areas that have already seen significant rainfall totals like San Francisco, about 11 inches of rain so far this year. There could be an additional two, three, four inches of rainfall expected there. But it isn't just the rainfall, it's also the wind and the snow.

Because some of those ridge tops, we're looking at snowfall in feet and wind, 75, 80, maybe 90 mile per hour winds. So be careful if you're traveling up in that direction, it's going to be rather treacherous. Also treacherous on the roads down into Southern California, where the threat once again prevails. We could see the potential for heavy rainfall, could see downed trees, downed power lines, mud flows, debris flows. There's a lot that could happen here over the next couple of days.
