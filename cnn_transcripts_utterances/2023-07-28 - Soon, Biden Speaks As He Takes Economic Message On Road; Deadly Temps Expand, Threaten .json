Kayla, first and foremost, welcome to CNN. It's your first time on the air with us. We're grateful to have you. Bring us the details of President Biden's economic message.",

More than 150 million Americans remain under heat alerts.Nearly half the country, with many facing triple digits all the way from the southwest to here in the nation's capital. It's hot here, too. In Arizona, the record-breaking temperatures are so bad that even cactuses can't take the heat. The Desert Botanical Garden in Phoenix said its saguaros cactuses are rotting from the inside-out, collapsing due to their own heat-related stress. That's cactuses. The city's record streak of temperatures over 110 degrees is now in its 28th day. That triple-digit heat set to take over parts of the northeast and Midwest now. CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers is in the Weather Center. Chad, listen, we talk about this a lot. It is really bad. How bad, for how long, and what do we do about it? A lot of questions for you.",

New York, Philadelphia, D.C., you're probably looking at another 36 hours before the front gets down to you.The temperatures are already in the 90s and we're just after the noon hour here across parts of the Midwest. And the heat index, the current heat index in my hometown of Omaha is 111 to 112 degrees at this hour. And high temperatures will be hot coast to coast today. And because we're talking about these 150 million people, it isn't that it's hot here. It is that it is hotter than it should be. They don't post these boxes here simply because it's hot. It's a threshold above where you should be. The good news is, for Phoenix, you're cooling down. That will be a big help. Even from the 85-plus record highs we'll get over the weekend, this is going to help. Although it will be a severe weather event tonight, even for you, Chicago, Milwaukee, toward Rockford, and even toward, I would say, Detroit, and Cleveland, Toledo by the morning hours, this is the area that will push all this humidity out. You're going to get severe weather after dark, Chicago. But what look it does. You go from 95 this afternoon to a morning low Sunday morning of 61?",

Let's read the rest of that doctor's statement. Saying, \"He arrived at Cedars-Sinai Center fully conscious, neurologically intact and stable. Although, this work up will ongoing, we are hopeful for his continued progress and are encouraged by his response, resilience and his family and community support, of which there is a lot.\" Remember, this happened Monday morning during basketball practice at the Galen Center at the University of Southern California. By Tuesday, we learned that he was out of ICU and in stable condition. Yesterday afternoon, we learned that he was able to go home. This is an incredible event to have happened. And a lot of people are wishing him well. The team earlier in the year had announced they were going on a tour to Europe starting August 5th. That's likely what they were practicing for. The USC medical staff also are experienced with this. Because this happened to another player just last July. A player had a cardiac arrest during practice. And according to the \"Los Angeles Times,\" the staff really surrounded that player within 45 seconds to really respond to that situation as well. And he ended up recovering and coming back to play -- Boris?",

The State Department is ordering all nonemergency staff there and employees' family members to get out of country along with advising all U.S. visitors to Haiti to leave immediately. Haiti has been in even deeper chaos since its president was assassinated two years ago this month. Gang violence has overwhelmed the country. The crime rate has doubled. The State Department warns that kidnappings are widespread. And a hero's welcome home for a Louisville officer, Nicholas Wilt. The 26-year-old, you may remember, was shot in the head in April in a mass shooting at a bank there. Days earlier, he had just graduated from the police academy. Wilt spent just 190-- he spent 109 days in the hospital. He was in critical condition there for a month. His family overwhelmed with gratitude. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ZACK WILT, OFFICER'S BROTHER: Because of the work they did, we get to take our brother home today. Nick gets to go home, sleep in his own bed, watch his own TV. And he's been asking for a steak dinner and we're going to get him a steak dinner tonight. He has a long road ahead of him. With the help of Dr. Kalan (ph) and everybody here, he is going to get back to it. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They want a judge to force the suspect Bryan Kohberger's defense team to share information about his potential alibi.Just days ago, his lawyer suggested Kohberger was not at the scene where four students were murdered last year, you'll remember. His attorney also filed a long-shot motion to dismiss the case entirely, claiming that the grand jury was misled on a technical issue. CNN's Veronica Miracle joins us now. Tell us about this court filing, specifically about the alibi. And do we expect the judge to order the defense team to share more details?",

There has been a lot of back and forth between the defense team and the prosecution over this last week, including the alibi.As well as the fact that the defense team wants this case thrown out. They're arguing that there are problems with the grand jury proceedings, which led to the indictment, and therefore the indictment should be dismissed. In reference to that alibi, Bryan Kohberger had a deadline earlier this week to provide his alibi of where he was on the night of the murders. And in a court filing, this is what his defense team said. They said, quote, \"Evidence corroborating Mr. Kohberger being at a location other than the King Road address will be disclosed pursuant to discovery and evidentiary rules as well as statutory requirements.\" [13:54:59] So, they're suggesting he was not there, but they did not provide exact concrete details as to where he was. So the prosecutors have come back and said, this is simply not enough. If he was not at the home the night when four University of Idaho students were murdered, they want to know where he was and they want that evidence now. So the preliminary hearing will be in October. It is expected to be six weeks long. We'll have to see if both sides will be ready at that time. Usually, in cases like these, there are delays. And also important to remember this is a death penalty case, and so it is certainly complex -- Jim?",
