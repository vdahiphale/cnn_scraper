Talk to us a little bit about how it came to this tit-for- tat between Iran and Pakistan and Iran.",

      "sentences": "Listen, think about it. The last thing you need in the region right now is another cross- border attack or conflict on any scale.Here's where it's taking place down here. Iran and Pakistan shooting in opposite directions here. It started with first strikes from Pakistan hitting separatist fighters inside Iran. It has been contending with these. They are Balochistani. It's a region of Pakistan, an independence group, a separatist group. They've been dealing with this for some number of years, and they've been striking for some number of years. Iran responding to some degree by striking an ISIS-tied group inside Pakistani territory, perhaps connected to that ISIS strike we saw a number of weeks ago inside Iran. Notably, the Iranian foreign minister said today that its strike was against -- that Pakistan's strike inside Iran was not against Iranians, seeming to say this is not really a strike on us, perhaps a path to tamping things down a little bit. But here's the problem. When you look at the region right now, you have a hotspot right here. You, of course, have a hotspot here we're going to talk about, which are the Houthi attacks on shipping. You have the ongoing open war between Israel and Hamas. You have increasing attacks between Hezbollah and Israel on the northern border. You have Iranian-backed groups in Syria and Iraq striking U.S. forces there. So you have all these flashpoints already heating up, and the concern, of course, is that one of them expands into something bigger. KEILAR: Yes, if it sort of explodes there. And as you mentioned, there have been all of these attacks by the Houthis on this key shipping lane. The U.S. struck for the fifth time taking on the Houthis.",

CNN's Omar Jimenez is live for us in Henniker, New Hampshire, where preparations for the Town Hall are underway for tonight.

And that was in response to being asked about some of the many issues and the many attacks that Trump has waged against Haley, even more so over this past week, clearly indicating he sees her as a real threat here.

Of course, in the tradition of Congress's past, this really does just kick the can down the road. It sets up new deadlines of March 1st and 8th. But it does give lawmakers a little more breathing room to negotiate a deal on spending. So we'll be keeping a close eye on this -- Boris.",

First time jobless claims fell to the lowest level since September 2022, far below economists' projections. And also falling mortgage rates. They're the lowest they've been since May. But these trends don't necessarily mean that Americans feel at ease.Let's go to CNN's Matt Egan now. Here's a closer look at the numbers and what they mean. Matt, should we be encouraged by the numbers we're seeing?",

This is historically low. If you remember back in 2020, during the peak of the COVID crisis, this metric spiked to above 6 million. I mean, that was crazy high. But really anything above 300,000 would be flashing a recession warning. But clearly we are nowhere near that level for a simple reason, right? Bosses, they can't let go of the workers they have because they need them to keep up with all of this strong demand. Look at really very robust retail sales in December. Bosses are also worried that if they let go of workers, they won't be able to find new ones. So clearly the jobs market is in a very good place. I mean, unemployment below 4 percent. Hiring is steady. And paychecks are finally starting to rise faster than prices. But, Boris, as you know, this economy does not have a jobs problem. It's a cost of living problem. Even White House officials acknowledge there are real affordability challenges out there, cars, child care, and of course housing. And there's nothing about today's numbers that are going to solve any of those issues.",

That is the lowest level since last May. You can see on that chart starting to go lower, but obviously not at all low. I mean, we're still talking about rates that are twice as high as two years ago.Now, remember, homebuyers, they've been really hit by a double whammy, record high home prices and punishing borrowing costs. I mean, that is why this housing market is historically unaffordable. I recently spoke to a woman in Georgia who told me at these prices and these rates, she doesn't know if she'll ever be able to buy a home. And there's a lot of people out there who have those same frustrations. No coincidence that President Biden today in a speech in North Carolina, he mentioned mortgage rates, talking about how they are falling and predicting that they're going to go lower. Of course, that is not up to the White House. That is really up to the market and the Federal Reserve. And Fed officials they are signaling that rate cuts are probably coming. But, Boris, there's a lot of debate over when the Fed will be able to start cutting rates and by how much. And there's a lot at stake there, especially for all those homebuyers out there.",
