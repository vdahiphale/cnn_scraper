Mr. Biden gave a speech, marking a quarter century of the Good Friday agreement, which ended a violent era known as The Troubles. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Thousands of families have been affected by The Troubles. Losses are real. The pain was personal -- I need not tell many people in this audience. Every person killed in The Troubles left an empty chair at that dining room table and a hole in the heart that was never filled for the ones they lost. Peace was not inevitable. We can't ever forget that. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And in many ways, it's quite symbolic in that President Biden's family in County Louth, which is a border county, in many ways symbolizes much of the dividend that has emerged from the Good Friday agreement. I mean, his great-great-grandfather, Owen Finnegan, would have come from the Cooley Peninsula, which is really straddling the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. And much of the good work of the International Fund for Ireland, which has been funded by the United States along with other governments, has been to develop reconciliation along the border and between different traditions and different communities. So President Biden's ancestral heritage, if you like, is right in the middle of the reconciliation process and the reconciliation agenda that has been at the heart of the Good Friday agreement.

The war on Ukraine, the energy crisis, hybrid warfare, the climate challenge:  that requires countries, who adhere to the rules-based international order, to be in sync together, to be aligned -- the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other like-minded states. And as foreign minister, I'm particularly focused on that and I think the Windsor agreement does give that opportunity for that alignment and for that constructive relationship between, in particular, the United Kingdom and the European Union. And I believe British prime minister Rishi Sunak is very keen on this, is very committed to this, with the European Union, with Ursula van der Leyen, the president of the commission. Indeed, Vice President Sefcovic, who did a lot of good work in reaching out to the business and industry and political parties in Northern Ireland, to get a stronger understanding and sensitivities of the issues around the trading relationship.

There will be some of their supporters that feel that they have been sold out, that they're now going to be less British. The party is unlikely to do that ahead of the election. So I think that's the political space that he is talking about there. Micheal Martin, certainly, now as foreign minister, was the taoiseach, was the prime minister before, has to deal with international partners. And it was interesting that he was talking about that alignment, whether it's climate, whether it's Ukraine, whatever it is. But it's important to have that alignment in his assessment that Rishi Sunak really wants to be part of that alignment, along with the E.U. on all these global issues. So I think, you know, outside of the context, the micro context, you might say, of the politics here in Northern Ireland, the consensus between Ireland and the U.K., Dublin and Westminster, is right now in a relatively good place. And, of course, the Downing Street declaration that gave way back in 1993 to the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 was, at -- in its time, a symbol of that goodwill between the two countries. So the context has been created for a decision to be taken. And that gets to his point. It's so important to get the power sharing assembly back up and running.

President Biden came into his speech, understanding the sensitivities, that withinthat Unionist community, the one that Jeffrey Donaldson represents, the biggest party, the Democratic Unionist Party, there's a perception that President Biden is too much pro the other community, pro Irish, pro nationalist, pro a united Ireland, something that's an anathema to the DUP. President Biden, in his speech, tried to lay that to rest a little, talking about his English roots, going back to a relative, Captain George Biden, he said, who was born in either 1828 or 1842. The president wasn't quite sure. So I think he tried to play down or play up, if you will, his English roots to say that he is not being partisan. So what we've heard from Jeffrey Donaldson is not a surprise. I think that he didn't want to be pressured by the president. The president didn't pressure him, chose some sensitive diplomatic language. And Jeffrey Donaldson also seemed to recognize that when he said, look, I agree with President Biden that the economy is important here. But I see it through a slightly different light, in essence is what Jeffrey Donaldson said. I see the importance of the economy. And simple trade between Northern Ireland and mainland U.K., the way that it used to be, the way it was before the Northern Ireland protocols, Brexit and the Windsor framework. Of course, Donaldson's party was the main party here that voted for Brexit and the majority of people in Northern Ireland didn't vote for Brexit. So there's a lot of political pressure and focus on Donaldson right now. But his immediate answer to Biden, what you've said doesn't shift me, doesn't shift my party at all, the local elections in a few weeks, early May, the dynamic may shift for Donaldson, may shift then.",

Another purportedly shows a Russian fighter cutting off a Ukrainian soldier's head with a knife. Kyiv has opened up a war crimes investigation. And the Kremlin responded by questioning if that video is authentic. CNN's Ben Wedeman is in Eastern Ukraine for us. Ben, great to have you on. What can you tell us about these videos? BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, first of all, Eleni, we should warn our viewers that some of the details with -- regarding these videos are fairly graphic and grim. There are two videos. One of them, which appears to have been shot fairly recently and purportedly in the area of the city of Bakhmut, was posted on pro Russian social media channels. That video shows the beheaded bodies of two Ukrainian soldiers on the ground next to a destroyed military vehicle. Also it appears that their hands have also been cut off. Now in that first video, you can hear a voice off camera saying, \"They killed them. Someone came up to them. They came up to them and cut their heads off.\" Now the second video appears to have been shot in a different season, perhaps in the summer. And of course, in both -- the case of both videos. CNN cannot verify the location where these occurred. But what you see in the second video -- and it's somewhat blurred -- but there is a Ukrainian soldier and somebody, a Russian soldier, we believe, takes a knife and cuts off his head. Now, from the sound of the video, it appears that the Ukrainian soldier was alive when he was being beheaded. Now reaction, obviously, has been one of horror and anger at this. We heard the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, saying, \"How easily these beasts kill.\" Now the Ukrainian human rights commissioner says they're going to be investigating. this. This is obviously not the first incident of this kind. There have been other incidents, where the dead or prisoners have been executed on camera. Now the Kremlin has denied, has said, basically -- we've heard from Dmitry Peskov, the spokesman for the Kremlin -- has said that the video is terrible but they cannot verify that are -- its very -- its authenticity should be verified.",
