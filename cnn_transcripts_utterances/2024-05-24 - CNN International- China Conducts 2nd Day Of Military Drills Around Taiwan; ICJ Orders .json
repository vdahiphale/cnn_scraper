Today, China began a second day of war drills around Taiwan. The Chinese military says its goal is to test its ability to, quote, seize power, and occupy key areas. That's quite a statement from China, given concerns in this country about its ambitions. Joining me now to discuss is Republican congressman from Illinois, Darin LaHood. He sits on the House Intelligence Committee, also, the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. Congressmen, thanks so much for taking the time. REP. DARIN LAHOOD (R-IL): Jim, good to be with you.",

And we have to take them at their word.But when you see the type of provocation with these drills, you see the buildup of their military, you see the provocation in the South China Sea with the building of islands and the adversarial approach, they've taken to our allies there, of course, you have to take it seriously. The other point that I would make, Jim, is, you know, China feels like they've won in Tibet. No one talks about Tibet anymore, after all the international pressure. They feel like they won in Hong Kong, right? Hong Kong is not the same place it once was. And so Taiwan is next on the list.",

That's a positive step in the right direction. We've also heard a lot about fortifying out Taiwan with the amount of military supplies that were going to give them and the equipment that they need, whether that's harpoons and javelins and lots of other things. I think we also have to think about things like we did with Australia with the AUKUS Agreement, China hates the AUKUS Agreement, right? The building at nuclear submarines with Australia. But the other part is we have to work with our like-minded allies in the region that care deeply about the aggression of the Chinese there and build up our naval operations in the region, too. All that is going on but we have to send the strongest possible message. We're not going to allow China to take back the democracy, which is Taiwan.",

Ive heard, you know, the former DNI, Radcliffe, talk about China having a plan to replace the United States.So I think President Trump has a superior national security team around him now, and I have strong confidence they'll make the best decisions. But Xi Jinping does not want to see, in my view, President Trump being the next president. I think he preferred to have Biden and the appeasement of the Biden administration than he would President Trump. The thing is though Biden is the one who has said explicitly he would defend Taiwan militarily. John Bolton described to me that the Trump in the Oval Office would say Taiwan has no chance against China, and therefore, the U.S. should not put itself in-between them in effect, Biden has made that commitment. Trump has not. Should -- should Trump as he's running to be reelected, say that he would defend Taiwan militarily?",

And I think you'll see a strong approach from the Trump administration towards China. President Trump knows that China is the biggest threat to America for the future.

H.R.2 would put back in place to remain in Mexico policy, secure the border, support our border patrol agents. We pass that in the House. Chuck Schumer never called it up for a vote. I'm -- I agree with you. We need to do this in a bipartisan way. But when you play games like that, when you don't even bring up H.R.2, that leaves us with not a lot of options.

These accusations of genocide, this is what they're saying.This is in essence the ICJ, the world's top court, calling for a ceasefire. To your point, you know, it does seem to bind together Israeli officials. The prime minister today, having that phone conversation with cabinet members, including the head of a National Security Council. National Security Council saying there is no way that what we're doing, our operations in Rafah in any way endanger, the population, the people of Palestine, or Palestinians rather within Gaza, that is the language of the context of what genocide is. That's not happening. You know, the language that's being used against the ICJ by Israel is very strong and it's very rough and particularly from the hard right within the government, even tougher, the response from Ben-Gvir, national security the minister, was the response to the ICJ should be two occupy Rafah.

That is 4 percent higher than last year, 2 percent higher than 2021 before the pandemic. We're talking even bigger than 2005, widely known to be a huge year for travel. That's the year the travel really fully rebounded after the slumped caused by 9/11. The biggest since 2000, according to AAA, think in sync, but you couldn't play it on your iPad, on your iPods, excuse me, because the iPad wasn't going to come out for another year. This is really in the context of so much economic news. There's been some grim economic news on the retail front, although AAA says people are really prioritizing spending on travel, especially now that were fully out of the pandemic, this whole idea of revenge travel that became a buzzword in 2022 and 2023, that is here to stay and people will keep spending and spite of these gas prices that if you have a memory that's worth a little bit, 360 is the national average for a gallon of regular, it was about the same this time last year.

He's the father of Davy and the father-in-law of Natalie, who you showed there that young couple and he essentially was saying that he was on the phone between these two attacks and described how his son was tied up and beaten, and then called his father short time later.That missions in Haiti, that group that the Lloyds founded and that that young couple was served as missionaries four reported that the couple was killed along with a third person, a Haitian staffer, goes by the name of Jude who was part of that attack and lost his life as well. So how did this all play out? As we know? Gangs have their grip over Port-au-Prince, more than 80 percent of that capital city is controlled by gangs and it's multiple gangs dozens within Haiti's capital alone. And so, when you talk about this missionary group serving in one location, its very likely for what we've been seeing that that is part of one gang's territory, we're not quite sure if a second gang then came in or something with that one gang that was allowing them to operate their turned. We're working to get clarification on what exactly happened that then led to this ambush that lasted several hours and force these missionaries to then barricade themselves. Of course, this is an area, Jim, that we have visited several times, Port-au-Prince, in particular trying to get into some of this gang territory can be next to impossible. And quite frankly, most folks don't leave or want to attempt it even with B6 level armored vehicles and heavy security team. But these missionaries are operating across us that country and very dangerous areas. And this shows you how treacherous it can be.",

So he was beaten by these gangs and so it also appears that the way that they're able to communicate, we experienced is there to is it's hard with sometimes with cell tower to get signals. So they have Starlink that they're able to then lock onto and because this was on the Lloyd family compound, they were able to be in touch with family who at this point were outside of the country and we believe were in the U.S. at that communications was playing out at that time.So it's incredibly tragic when you think about that, of course, Jim.",

The international rescue committee has been on the ground in Kharkiv in the northeast to help those fleeing their homes.Joining me now to discuss and other challenges with the many millions of refugees from Ukraine is the International Rescue Committee's vice president for emergencies, Bob Kitchen. Bob, thanks so much for taking the time. BOB KITCHEN, V.P. FOR EMERGENCIES, INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE: Thanks for having me. SCIUTTO: So you've been working with families that have two evacuate this advancing Russian force, which has already shown its capacity to target and kill civilians repeatedly throughout this war. Can you tell us what these refugees have been telling your team as they flee to what they hope to be safer areas?",

So it's been quite a lot of work in the last few weeks though, more than 14,000 people have been forced to flee their homes. And as you say, often on very short notice, one colleague was recounting that we had had to help, a young woman who'd had to flee in our pajamas. And that's all she had with her.So, being able to help her register for aid, to give her some clothing, some non-food items, and warm blankets to be okay was something that we were able to do. But that's really the story people feeling, hearing the fighting getting closer and closer, and having to make a heart-breaking decision that they may have to run for their lives away from their homes and all of their belongings.",

Many countries have accepted tens, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians. But the lion share that 2 million people at one point were in Poland, saw more than a millionaire, 90 percent of which are women and children who are trying to stay close to Ukraine because their men fought still in country, still fighting the war.So that welcome endures, it has changed over time. Of course, there we are working hand in hand and with the Polish government, the IRC on the ground to help Ukrainians become contributing members of the Polish society, while they're there so helping them find work, helping them attend school as you say, helping them contribute to not be a burden on society, which helps extend that sense of welcome.
