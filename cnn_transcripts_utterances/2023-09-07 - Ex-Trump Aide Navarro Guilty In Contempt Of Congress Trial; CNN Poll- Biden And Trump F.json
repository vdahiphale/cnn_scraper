This hour, the prison sentence for one of the stars of the hit sitcom \"That 70 Show\" Danny Masterson at least 30 years behind bars. How his Church of Scientology played a major role in this case, possibly slowing down the prosecution.Plus, growing calls to disqualify Donald Trump in the race for 2024. One top state election official from a battleground state joining me says his office has been flooded with e-mails and letters and calls making a case to question Trump's eligibility. And leading this hour, the major verdict in just moments ago for Peter Navarro, the former Trump White House trade advisor, a jury finding him guilty on two counts of contempt of Congress. Let's start there with CNN's Paula Reid. Paula, walk us through how Peter Navarro got here.",

He refused to comply, which is how today he ended up being convicted of two counts of contempt of Congress. Now, he is going to be the second Trump advisor who has been convicted of contempt of Congress.Today, in closing arguments, the Justice Department argued that it's not that hard to follow along with a subpoena, and that Navarro here made a choice not to comply. And they insist that the government only works if people follow the rules. Now, there are, of course, some exceptions to having to comply with a subpoena. Navarro previously argued in pretrial proceedings, unsuccessfully, that he didn't have to comply because former President Trump had asserted a privilege. Now, in court, his lawyer made other arguments, including insisting that the subpoena was actually not that simple and that it did not specify where he needed to go in the Capitol complex. They also argued that prosecutors had not established that Navarro did this intentionally and that it wasn't just an accident or a mistake. Now, again, he is the second Trump advisor to be convicted of contempt of Congress, the first, of course, being Steve Bannon. But Bannon has appealed his conviction, and it's expected that Navarro will do the same. His lawyers have signaled that they will put up other legal challenges if he was convicted.",

Peter Navarro's defenses here were a bit shorthanded because the judge cut him off before the trial and said, I'm not going to allow you to say the reason I defied that subpoena was because Donald Trump told me to do so. Because the judge had a whole hearing on this and said, there's just no evidence that actually happened in a specific, detailed way.So Peter Navarro was left with this sort of hodgepodge of defenses. He said, well, the subpoena didn't specify which room I was supposed to go to within the Capitol complex, and the prosecution didn't establish that I knew of the subpoena and knowingly defied it.

Now, the two counts that Peter Navarro has been convicted on are both federal misdemeanors for contempt of Congress, meaning the maximum sentence for each of them is one year in prison. But this is also a really unusual federal misdemeanor where there's a mandatory minimum of one month on each count. Now, that minimum can be run together, but this judge, when it comes time for sentencing, usually happens a couple of months down the line, has no choice or to at least one month in federal prison, that's a mandatory minimum.",

While Mr. Biden leaves behind a host of worries at home, one of his biggest, his son, Hunter Biden and a possible impeachment inquiry brought on by House Republicans. Brand new CNN reporting out today shows more than a dozen House Democrats and aides are confident they can defend Biden but they want guidance on how, something that the White House is not willing to give as of now.In a new CNN poll today, the public perception they're up against 44 percent of Americans believe that Joe Biden's actions regarding the Hunter Biden investigation have been appropriate compared to 55 percent who say Joe Biden's actions regarding Hunter Biden have been inappropriate. Let's go to CNN's Kayla Tausche at the White House. And Kayla, you have some new reporting, some Democrats are frustrated with Biden. Why?",

      "sentences": "Well, they're frustrated, Jake, because they feel like it's a missed opportunity to fill the air with their defense for why the President, in their view, acted appropriately and to try to dismiss some of those allegations. You know, it's something that a lot of Democrats have been talking about behind the scenes. And now the frustration is moving toward a fever pitch where many of them went on the record with CNN telling Annie Grayer and Lauren Fox, things like, it's a missed opportunity or it creates the possibility for a false equivalency with former President Donald Trump and some of the allegations and the indictments that he's facing on the other side of the aisle. All of that has led them to seek more coordination from the White House so that they can be singing essentially from the same hymnal, so to speak, and to try to bat down many of these concerns.But the White House, for its part, is not willing to go there. A senior Biden aide telling me that the White House is just simply not willing to engage on anything that could be seen as impacting ongoing legal proceedings or intervention in a proceeding like that. That being said, Jake, impeachment is a totally different animal. They see that as a political maneuver by Republicans and they're preparing a playbook behind the scenes to intervene to essentially flood the zone if Republicans start to move in that direction more than just talk and if McCarthy actually conjures up the votes to move forward with a formal impeachment inquiry. All of that is still sort of an amorphous effort at this stage. But I know that it's one that White House aides are watching closely. But it's something that Democrats are frustrated with. The White House says essentially, look, you can pick up the phone, you can call us anytime, but there are some issues that we just simply will not engage on. [17:10:09] TAPPER: All right, Kayla Tausche at the White House for us. Thank you so much. I want to bring in Biden campaign co-chair, Cedric Richmond. Good to see you again. The latest CNN poll shows President Biden in a dead heat with Donald Trump, 47 percent for Donald Trump, 46 percent for Joe Biden. President Biden, nearly seven in 10 Democrats say they want a candidate other than Biden to be the Democratic nominee. And then there's this, voters say Biden and Trump are both equally favorable and unfavorable. Now the Biden campaign has argued that he is the Democrat best positioned to beat Donald Trump, in part because he beat him in 2020. Is it possible that that's just not the case anymore? CEDRIC RICHMOND, CO-CHAIR, BIDEN RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN: No, I wholeheartedly disagree with that argument. I also take some issue with the CNN poll, Jake, that you all have been running all day. So you're saying that President Biden and the former president are tied, you even mentioned Nikki Haley, or at least the channel did earlier. But what you're not talking about are the positions. When you talk about the fact that they want a nationwide abortion ban, that changes the number. When you talk about the fact that the President capped the price of insulin at $35, that increases his numbers. The fact that he took on the NRA and won, the fact that he's created 13 million jobs, that's what the campaign is for. And we believe that when you tell people about those accomplishments, those numbers change tremendously.",

I think an ad will run tonight during the NFL game that talks about the 13 million jobs that were created, 800,000 manufacturing jobs.So we have a great story to tell. And we know that when we tell that story, the numbers change. We saw it in 2020 when everyone predicted a red wave, including CNN, and I think you did a show on a red wave too. We proved that it didn't happen. It's because we talked to voters about abortion ban, about freedoms, about the economy, about building the middle class from the bottom up in the middle out.

Seventy-three percent of voters are worried about his current mental and physical competence. Now, former ambassador and governor, Nikki Haley, who is the only Republican candidate we have as of now, who actually beats Biden in the poll, who's outside the margin of error, he's basically in a dead heat with all the other Republicans. He might be up one or down one, but within the margin of error, all the others, not Nikki Haley, she beats him. Haley has argued that a vote for Biden would really end up being a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.

Voters will see his accomplishments. If you just look at his schedule, he's traveling around the world over the next four and a half days to continue to show American leadership on the world stage. So, when they compare President Biden's travel to that of Republicans, even Republicans that are running for president, he's traveling almost 30 percent more than they are. But more importantly, this is about American families. And I think American families going to look at the issues they're faced, and they're going to look at who's addressing those issues, who's talking about those issues, and who's doing something about it.

Those are the things that -- I believe those Senators are talking about, we need to go out and talk about.

So, of course, the poll numbers show Republicans highly question it.But we have to go out and talk about the accomplishments just as much as they talk about lies and misdirection and red herrings. We have to be solely focused on what not only this President and Vice President, but what this Congress has done, the Democratic Senate and the Democratic House when we had it.

I'm joined right now by two Secretaries of States, Steve Simon of Minnesota and Jocelyn Benson of Michigan. Both are Democrats. Secretary Benson, let me start with you.

We have a vehicle in law for people to make these kinds of challenges.

And now we see other cases popping up around the country that will ultimately ensure the proper place for this determination is made in the courts, which it should be. So it's something we're seriously looking at. And I've been talking with colleagues in other states as well about this as we proceed to create a process that ensures any precedent here does also not allow this to be misused in the future by officials who might want to block candidates from the ballot simply because they disagree with them politically. Ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court on a national issue like this is going to be the final arbiter.

Previously, you know, they've been very, very focused on issues that directly relate to China, so oftentimes pushing out pro-Chinese propaganda.
