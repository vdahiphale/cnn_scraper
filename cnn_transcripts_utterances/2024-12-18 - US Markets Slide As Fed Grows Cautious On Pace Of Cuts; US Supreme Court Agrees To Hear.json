If rates stay higher, corporate profitability stays lower. The economy stays slower, but why should rates stay higher? What is the problem in terms of inflation that the Fed is now so worried about? Well, Jay Powell now says some Fed participants are beginning to account for Donald Trump's proposals. Donald Trump ran on policies that economists view as inherently inflationary. So you've got tariffs. That's the big one, because tariffs means that somebody has to pay more for those tariffs. Eventually that will be passed on to the consumer. And business leaders have already said that will mean higher prices in the shops. And Donald Trump has also promised to expand tax cuts from his first term. That puts more money into consumers' pockets. They spend, inflation goes up. So Jay Powell, the chair, was asked if the new administration had factored into the Feds' forecast for next year.

But you throw into the mix, as you said, I think fuel on the embers on the fire and that's the Trump policies that I think is now raising a lot more concern about inflation going forward, and the reason why the Federal Reserve, you know, they're not raising interest rates, but I think they are doing the right thing.

If anything though this might be even more hawkish than people had been anticipating including, yes, how blunt Jerome Powell was about the fact that they need further progress on inflation before they are ready to cut interest rates. And this selloff that we are seeing in the financial markets really began even before Powell started talking. It began when we got those projections, the projections that show the Fed removed not just one, but two interest rate cuts from their forecast for next year. They bumped up their 2025 inflation forecast. They don't see getting back to the two percent target until perhaps the end of next year -- I am sorry, until 2027 actually, so that could be a bit. It shows that this last mile of inflation is proving to be a bumpy one and all of these projections have really spooked markets. Market veteran, Art Hogan told me that these projections hit the market like a punch in the face. But Richard, we should also just point out that the market remains pretty close to all-time highs at this point. So, seeing some chips taken off the table isn't all that surprising.",

That mass deportations would also potentially increase prices and that tax cuts at this point could stimulate an economy that doesn't need to be stimulated, all the while adding trillions of dollars in debt. So these are all of the uncertainties that Jerome Powell has to sort of navigate right now. So when you think about it, it actually makes a lot of sense for them to try to pause at this point because they don't really know what is going to happen next, what kind of policies are going to be rolled out from the incoming Trump administration, and what the economic impact is going to be -- Richard.",

But in Poland, the price of butter has been soaring, along with it temperatures and tempers. The government is blaming a milk shortage, and Poland is now tapping into its strategic butter reserve to give consumers some relief. Our sister network, TVN Poland, has the buttery story. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CEZARY KROLAK, CORRESPONDENT, TVN24: This is really unusual situation in Poland when government decides to sell butter from strategic reserves. But the price of butter is a sensitive topic in Poland, especially in Christmas season when we prepare our traditional meals, especially cakes. The government wants to bring the price down from current level at around $10 per kilo to some $7 per kilo, which is more acceptable to the public. And the government wants to also wipe out the acquisition from the opposition parties, which say that the government cannot keep the prices under control. And inflation in Poland generally is still high. But the prime minister, Donald Tusk, has just said that this intervention is big enough to keep prices under control. And he hopes everything will be OK with these prices. For CNN, in Warsaw, I'm Cezary Krolak, reporting. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Move everything out to the east for a modern financial district. And that's what they did. The Reichmann brothers, they built it all up. It nearly went bust. Well, it did go bust, but let's not dwell on that because over the last 25 years it has been extremely successful.

Now this skyline could look very different in a couple of years. HSBC is moving back to London. JPMorgan is considering but at the moment is staying where it is for the time being.

But to your point, Richard, the S&amp;P 500 is only about 3.6 percent off of the all-time highs from earlier this month. There have been the proverbial animal spirits in this market because of the Trump victory, the Republican Congress, and also remember the Fed's last meeting was a couple of days after the election, and it was a much more upbeat one.

The Fed basically, the miserable one, that told us that inflation hasn't gone awayand that next year it's going to be higher and they weren't going to cut interest rates as much as everybody had thought. Well, that's not particularly good news for Donald Trump because, of course, his policies are likely to exacerbate inflation and increase the debt, raise government borrowing and keep interest rates higher. That is the scenario that we are facing. And the way I look at it tonight is that 2025 could see that battle between fiscal policy. In other words, the administration and its tax policies and monetary policy. The Fed is looking for 2 percent inflation and unemployment down at 4 percent. That's the dual mandate. The two are in conflict next year. You can take that to the bank. Now who wins that conflict, it'll be dressed up in a million and one different ways. And the market will have to balance who they think is stronger at any given point. Perhaps the saving grace is what Paul La Monica just told us, which is as long as earning growth remains, heavy and strong, up to 20 percent, then the market will discount this tussle between monetary and fiscal. But I wouldn't necessarily put money on that. I think we're in for some rocky days ahead as we battle inflation along with unemployment, and the two go head to head.
