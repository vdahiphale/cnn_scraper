      "sentences": "Well, Jack Smith calls Donald Trump's bluff. Next stop, the Supreme Court. Tonight on \"Laura Coates Live.\"So, this is a very big deal. You've got nine justices, you have them appointed by the then-president, Donald Trump, and they're being asked to decide what comes down to one very simple question: Is a president of the United States above the law? Now, it should be simple. You've heard that phrase how many times. And, of course, we say nobody is above the law. Correct? It's why the lady justice wears that blindfold. But that's not what Trump's legal team thinks. They've been arguing for a long time along the lines of what you'd call maybe the Nixon Doctrine. If the president does it, it's not illegal. You know how that worked out for Richard Nixon. Don't we? But how will it work out for Donald Trump? Well, Jack Smith does not want to sit around and wait to find out. He's going straight to the Supreme Court to decide whether Trump is, in fact, protected by the presidential immunity in the election subversion case in Washington, D.C. And tonight, a preliminary win of sorts will explain why, for special counsel, they are saying now they're going to fast track at least the pondering of whether to actually take on the request for information and a ruling. Let's read the tea leaves a little bit tonight because the Supreme Court is about to make a very big decision about what a president can and cannot do, what is presidential behavior, what's covered and all of these things and, of course, what does it mean for Trump's other cases. I want to bring in now to you a legal analyst and former federal prosecutor, Elliot Williams. Also, here, Ian Millhiser, a senior correspondent at Vox focusing on the Supreme Court and the author of many books as well. I want to begin with you for a second because you and I have talked a lot about the Supreme Court over the years and what's taking place there. This is significant to go from the district court's ruling that says, you do not have presidential immunity, Trump. Everything you did is not presidential, so to speak, to saying now the Supreme Court will rule. I mean, look at how a case normally goes through to get to the Supreme Court. This is significant, Ian.",

You want narrow dissent. That's not just because I don't like the Supreme Court. I mean, that's good judging. You don't want judges to overreach. You don't want (INAUDIBLE).

I'm talking about Georgia and also Michigan which, by the way, were two of the five that Biden turned from red to blue in 2020, if you can remember.The new number shows President Biden may have quite the Achilles heel. And according to CNN polls, the majority of voters in both Michigan and Georgia say that Biden's policies have contributed to a worsening personal economic view for them. Joining me now for more perspective, Shark Tank judge and chairman of O'Leary Ventures, Kevin O'Leary. So good to have you here today. Thanks for joining me tonight. I want to talk to you because you are the absolute expert on this. I want to talk about feelings, about everyone's feelings. I know you know them well. But the feelings that people have when it comes to the economy. Despite that there are some positive signs, people don't feel like it's going well. Why is that? KEVIN O'LEARY, CHAIRMAN, O'LEARY VENTURES: Well, let's think about something that occurred over the last nine months, 10 months actually. So, if you think about the economy, we've never taken rates from basically zero up this fast before, to five and a half percent terminal rate. And so, there's a hundred million people in America, third -- almost a third of the voting population, that have never lived through inflation, never seen rate hikes like this, never dealt with the consequences of them in housing and food costs and everything else. And now, their feelings are hurt because they don't know what this is, never lived through it. They're the younger cohort, but they vote. And they're not feeling so good right now. And that poll, you're talking about the Wall Street Journal poll, I think, which, by the way, went all around the world in the last 48 hours, had some real consequences in terms of what's going to happen next.",

Because as you can imagine, yeah, there are the primaries, there are the votes beforehand, but until the next president is installed, not a lot of that policy can actually get fully implemented.O'LEARY: No, you're right. But, you know, think about this. If you're trying to allocate capital, I do this every day, I have to take chances, I have to make bets. And right now, I looked at those poll numbers and that -- by the way, those results, I've never seen so many phone calls from countries outside of -- I'm an investor, so I'm a sovereign wealth advisor, et cetera. So, that thing went out there and people went, wow, hmm, what do we do about this? Why don't we put some bets on? Not all of it. Let's say you're going to allocate 40% to the U.S. Maybe I'll put 15%, 20% to work. And that's what's happening. Nobody knows with certainty and elections are crazy outcomes as we know with certainty. But let me give you an example. Go back to the numbers in that poll. There are material differences around the economy around crime, border security, inflation issues, the war, all that stuff. And again, you don't care about the politics, you care about the policy.",

But if you're betting money, you're starting to realize that, wow, this outcome is at least 50-50 and you're going to put 20, 30% to work now before January 15th.

Doctor Karsan asked a court to pre- authorize the abortion, yet she could not or at least did not attest to the court that Ms. Cox's condition poses the risks the exception requires.\" I'm talking obviously about the language in the statute in Texas that suggests that they must have an emergency abortion or a medical emergency in order to have one.

But the way the Texas Supreme Court appears to be reading this is it only applies to life-threatening physical conditions. So, this whole other part of the exception, I don't know what it means anymore. The other thing that I think has really made clear from this decision is, even if a doctor believes, strongly believes that their patient fits within the exception, politicians, district attorneys, the state of Texas can come back and second-guess their judgment. And even if you go to court and get approval from a court, Ken Paxson is going to come after you anyway.
