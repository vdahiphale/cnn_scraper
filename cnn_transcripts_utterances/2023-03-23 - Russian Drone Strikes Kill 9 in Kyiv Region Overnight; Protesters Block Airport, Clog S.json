Those Shahed Iranian drone striking civilian areas. And also in Zaporizhzhia, with a missile strike, a dramatic and tragic strike on an apartment building, a nine-story building, partially destroyed maracas. It seems at this point, only one dead, many injured, though, John, and it comes as President Zelensky has been on this tour over the last few days to frontline regions. He was in the east and then in the northeast, and now his close to where I am to the front lines, inspecting damage from previous engagements and areas that Ukraine took back months ago. You do get a sense that everyone's wondering and waiting to see if that counter effective does, in fact, begin soon -- John, Erica.",

And you're quite right. This isn't just about the number of people they're going to get on the streets of cities like Paris today, but also about those blockages.What we've been seeing over the course of the last few days as a result of these many weeks of strikes not just garbage piled high here in Paris, but people actually starting to have to line up outside gas stations because of those blockages were seeing at oil depots and oil refineries. And that's the point is that although this retirement age, raising of it from 60 to 64 is going to become lower, now just has one constitutional hurdle to go. They push it through parliament without a vote, which is finished to drive these people pretty crazy that lost constitutional hurdle. Beyond that, it will become law and the point of the unions and the people out protesting today is to try and cause as much trouble to the everyday life of France as they can. They believe that they still can get the government to back down. Emmanuel Macron has said no way, this will be law by the end of the year. And this is the sort of arm wrestle that's now set to go on. We expect for the next few days, certainly, and possibly if the unions get their way for the next few weeks -- John and Erica.",

He just wanted to come here and really look at what the Poles continue to do to support the Ukrainians, and it is his first visit overseas in this new, you know, elevated title of Prince of Wales, and I think it's been interesting to see how he's using that. He clearly sees himself now as some sort of global statesman like figure promoting Western values because it's a political issue he's walking into.He doesn't seem to be at all afraid of that. So he met the troops down there in the southeast yesterday, thanking them for supporting Ukrainian freedom, which he described as all of our freedoms. He then went to see the president today, President Duda, and thanked him and the Polish people for supporting Ukraine. So he's there representing a sort of Western democratic figure in many ways. He then came here to this food hall to meet Ukrainians who had settled here. I went in afterwards, chat to a couple of them, and they got very powerful stories about how, yes, they're OK, because they're here. They've been hugely grateful to the Poles for supporting them, but it's really difficult every day, sometimes getting up, and trying to survive here when they just want to be home. And hearing all these stories about the tragedies back in Ukraine, and he was quite affected by that as well. He was very keen, but we sort of talk about these stories. Continue talking about how much Poland is doing to support Ukraine. They've got something like 1.5 million Ukrainians here who have been given full access to public services like schools and hospitals, and it's a huge pressure on Poland. So that's what his visit was really about, highlighting what Poland is doing in relation to Ukraine and supporting all of our values.",

And there are two pilots typically so just one pilot left in the flight deck. That is when a passenger who was on board the flight, also an airline pilot from a completely different airline, was pressed into service and Southwest says they came up into the flight deck and helped out. This is the statement from Southwest Airlines, \"A credential pilot from another airline who was on board entered the flight deck and assisted with radio communication while our Southwest pilot flew the aircraft. We greatly appreciate the support and assistance.\" So a pretty great coincidence here but also a pretty serious incident that the FAA is now investigating. I want you to listen now to the air traffic control audio here.
