      "sentences": "Today on Inside Politics, campus clashes. The Biden administration is struggling to respond to tense pro-Palestinian protests. They're growing and getting uglier with police stepping up arrests, and in some cases devolving from war protests to blatant displays of Jewish hate.Plus, Hunter Biden versus Fox News. We have new reporting on a stepped-up strategy by Hunter Biden to fight back against his critics. This time, Fox News. The president's son is accusing that network of defaming him and violating revenge porn laws. You're going to hear those details first, right here this hour. And Michael Cohen, Stormy Daniels and Hope Hicks. They're all expected to testify at Donald Trump's hush money trial, but who will the prosecution called next? We're going to tell you what to expect when court resumes tomorrow. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at Inside Politics. First step the kids are not all right. I'm talking about so many children, students on college campuses across the U.S., some are peacefully protesting Israel's retaliatory war against Hamas terrorists. Some have been pepper straight -- sprayed, arrested and suspended when protests got out of control. And many on campuses, their anti-Israel sentiment is blurring into antisemitism, with far too many Jewish students hearing things like, calls for another October 7 massacre, seeing signs for a quote, final solution. And they are scared for their safety. Moments ago, Columbia University notified protesters that, if they don't leave their encampment by 2 p.m., that's just under two hours from now. They will face suspension. CNN's Omar Jimenez has been reporting extensively from Colombia. Omar, what's happening now?",

      "sentences": "Yeah. So, right now we're awaiting that 2 p.m. deadline where the university has given students the chance to voluntarily leave the encampment or face suspension at the very least in eligibility to finish the semester on good standing, unless they leave and sign on that they will follow the university's policies.Now of course, this is one of the most concrete steps we've seen from the university. After this morning, the university president put out a statement saying, negotiations between the student protesters and the university failed to reach an agreement after they started last week, which means as the university made it clear, the university will not divest from Israel, which of course, was one of the central components of why this encampment actually started here. That said, the university did announced they will invest in healthcare and education in Gaza. But also, they said that while they have tried to foster an environment of constructive dialogue and protests on the campus, that many Jewish students just have not felt safe, at the very least, not welcomed. And it's a dynamic university president called tragic and we're seeing that dynamic play out even in a new lawsuit that was filed by an anonymous Jewish student who alleged that the campus has now become too dangerous to provide Jewish students the education they signed on to receiving. In particular pointing to the decision to go to hybrid learning as safety was listed as a priority by the university. Now, back to that deadline that I was mentioning 2 p.m., of course, local time quickly approaches. And now suspended student group or previously suspended pro-Palestinian student group is encouraging students to actually show up at noon to protect the encampment as they have described, they're telling students not to sign on to anything. And that of course, will be the question of what happens next because the student -- the university has given this deadline. Obviously, there may be some -- there may be some students that actually sign on but for those that don't, we have yet to find out what the university will take as far as next steps there, Dana, as graduation is just a little more than two weeks away.",

It's worry -- you know, sort of celebratory scene here right now, much different from what we saw last Thursday, which was the site of a ceasefire demonstration that turned violent. 28 people were violently arrested. 20 of them were affiliated with the university, including a prominent economics professor (Audio Gap) and 27 others, they spent the night in the DeKalb County jail were bonded out on Friday afternoon.But what happened here and those dramatic scenes, those violent arrest by Georgia state patrol and Atlanta police officers has led to a sort of reckoning here on campus. The tenured faculty held the meeting last week to push forward a no confidence vote against the university president here -- President Fenves. Those ballots now will make their way to the rest of the faculty here at the College of Arts and Sciences. And that referendum will be tallied up on Wednesday. But another thing that's happening here since really October 7, is that Jewish students have expressed their concern about their (Audio Gap) caught up with two Jewish law students who talked to us about those safety concerns.

I mean, we have seen protests pop up here and there over the last six months. But this is different. And this is expanded, and this is caused -- and this -- to bring it back to Inside Politics.

That was when college students will go back home for break, while the build-in the summertime we get around the conventions. And then the fall.If they were still in this -- the heat of this war and we're still things have not changed. How much does it grow as we head into November elections? The question ultimately to is the impact that says, will have course electorally on the president. There was a poll last week from Harvard, suggesting he was low on the list of issues, driving concerns of younger voters, the economy, ranking high. The new CNN poll showing the economic issues are really what is driving a lot of the concerns by younger voters. But ultimately how much more this has become a voting issue. And the president and this party is going to have to realize that these are -- this part of this coalition. And if they're upset with his handling of this, that could be a big problem in November. LAURA BARRON-LOPEZ, WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, PBS NEWSHOUR: That poll as well as one today from CBS that shows that a number of young voters who want President Biden to take a different position towards Israel, still plan on voting for him at similar rates to the larger youth vote. And I was just in Michigan and that's essentially kind of what I found on the ground, too. I spoke to a number of young voters, some of whom -- their campuses had encampments that were launching when I was there last week. And yes, there was one voter who was uncommitted, who said that she voted for President Biden in 2020 and that she was decided that she wasn't going to vote for him again in 2024. But a number of the other young voters that I spoke to said that other issues, democracy, economy, abortion were things that they were thinking about heading into November. (CROSSTALK)",

I mean, that's pretty overwhelming when it comes to the 18 to 34-year-olds.But the second point you made, Laura, about how people prioritize the war versus other issues that are driving their votes. I mean, it's pretty far down 26 percent versus all of these other of course, starting with the economy and protecting the democracy exactly what you said. What are you hearing from the Trump campaign about whether they think there is any way to capitalize this -- on this?

But I think they know the actual issue that's not something that they're going for.However, the Trump campaign is trying to take advantage of this. In Michigan, they barely have a ground game, but they already have people reaching out to Arab American communities, trying to create relationships with them, whether or not they're going to be successful.
