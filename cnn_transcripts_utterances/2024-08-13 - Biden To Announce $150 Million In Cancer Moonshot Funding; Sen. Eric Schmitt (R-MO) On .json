This is part of what has been dubbed Joe Biden's Cancer Moonshot initiative. And this will be Biden's first official travel since he ended his re-election bid.CNN's Kevin Liptak is at the White House, and he has more on this for us. Kevin, the Cancer Moonshot initiative -- this is personal for President Biden as well.",

      "sentences": "Yeah, it really is. And this event today really does give you a good indication of how President Biden plans to spend the remainder of his term, really zeroing in on these items that are so important to him.Remember, this Cancer Moonshot he actually began when he was vice president following the death of his son Beau Biden from a particularly aggressive form of brain cancer. He revived it when he returned to the White House and he has made the goal of cutting cancer deaths in half in 25 years, which is an ambitious goal, but experts say it's achievable with the right resources behind it. And that is exactly what President Biden will be doing today in New Orleans. He'll tour a medical facility at Tulane and announce $150 million in new research initiatives trying to develop technologies that would allow surgeons to develop procedures that would better remove tumors from cancer patients. It's part of an initiative that he put together with Republicans and Democrats at the Department of Health and Human Services, and it's all part of what he has called this unity agenda, trying to find areas where Republicans and Democrats can agree. And certainly, the Cancer Moonshot is one of those things. I think this is certainly something that President Biden will want to talk a lot about in the months ahead in this reshaped version of his presidency. Of course, he's no longer campaigning for president. Now he really does want to focus on things that will comprise his legacy, and this is one of those. His aides have really kind of been recalibrating what he will be working on for the next several months. Part of what he's trying to do is ensure that these initiatives have money going out the door in order to fund them, and this is certainly one of them. He'll obviously also be focused on foreign policy -- the war in the Middle East, the biggest item there. And he will also be focused on helping Kamala Harris get elected. We will see the pair of them out on the road this week in Maryland talking about the economy, Kate.",

The problem with the DDoS attack, Sara, is that it often looks very much like just a very popular event. And so, we're just sort of having to take Musk's word for it. There has been third-party reporting that suggests it wasn't a DDoS attack; it was just X's systems responding to a flood of interest in this interview. But that actually speaks to some of the success of this interview,right? It was 40 minutes of delay of glitches but once it got up and running you had -- I saw over two million people joining the space live. You had over 50 million people who viewed it. Now, views are not the same as how we count them in television, but it still got a lot of traction. And I think part of that was because people wanted to hear from the president. I think the other part is people like listening to this bromance go down. You know, Elon Musk isn't a journalist. He's not trying to press him on hard questions. And you did see some sparks fly in that conversation. At one point, the president sort of suggesting that Elon must come and join his administration. We'll see where that goes.",

And by the way, when she ran in 2020, I don't even think she got, like, six percent of the vote. Now, all of a sudden, she is the second coming and the mainstream media is sort of doing this coronation. And they'll cut -- reach its apex next week at their convention. But when that's all said and done and this honeymoon period is over, the American people are going to be left with a choice. Are they better off now than they were four years ago? And Kamala Harris has her fingerprints all over the destruction that we've had, whether it's the southern border or inflation. So I do think it's odd -- it's strange, honestly, how they got to this point. You know, right before the debate they were saying his mental acuity was great then all of a sudden, they dumped him.

She doesn't do that.And so I think what you guys led into the X interview with Elon Musk yesterday -- that was an hour and a half discussion. I am confident Kamala Harris could not talk about policy coherently for an hour and a half. The American people deserve that. So I think when they roll into that debate focusing on the issues. We talk about struggling families. They're paying more at the pump. They're paying more at grocery stores. So I think obviously, tying her to her record, she was more liberal than Bernie Sanders. She was the tiebreaking vote for the American Recovery Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, which was $2.4 billion -- trillion dollars -- trillion dollars in spending. Budget-busting stuff. She's for the Green New Deal. Her record is very liberal. And then, in her first major decision, John, she chose a self-avowed socialist as her running mate.
