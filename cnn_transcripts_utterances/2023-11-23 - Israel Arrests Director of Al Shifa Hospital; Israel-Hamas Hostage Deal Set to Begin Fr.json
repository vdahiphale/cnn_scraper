Qatar officials just held a news conference and laid out the details as they're known right now. The truce begins at midnight Eastern time tonight. Then, roughly nine hours later, the first group of hostages will be released. Now, the list of names of those women and children to be released in this first group is now in the hands of Israeli officials. The prime minister's office says now, with that list in hand, they are contacting the families of all of the remaining hostages. And just last hour, one family received word while live on air with us that their loved ones are not part of this group.",

But, in the meantime, the fighting is indeed continuing. We have been watching from our position here right along the Gaza Strip, as Israel has continued to fire into Gaza. We have been hearing small-arms fire in the Gaza Strip. We have been hearing and seeing strikes, Israeli strikes into Gaza. And just a couple hours ago, we heard from an Israeli Defense Forces spokesman, who made clear that the Israeli military will continue operating in Gaza up until they get the order to stop and that, for right now, everything is business as usual, as you can hear right behind me a very loud explosion going off. But we do also have now more details about exactly when and how some of these hostages are going to be getting out of Gaza tomorrow. In less than 24 hours, the first of those 50 hostages, 13 of them tomorrow, could be coming out of the Gaza Strip and crossing into Israel. We expect that this exchange will happen at three different crossing points. And we expect that Hamas will initially hand over those hostages to the Red Cross, who will then hand them over to the Israeli military. From there, children who are under 12 are expected to meet their parents at designated locations near those crossing points. Those who are above 12 and those adult women are expected to go directly to hospitals in Israel. And, from there, after -- they will undergo various medical examinations and then be reunited with their families. The hope, of course, amid all of this is that it will not just be 50 hostages. It will not just be four days of a pause in fighting. The hope is that, these first four days, these first 50 hostages can be a proving ground, effectively, to continue freeing more hostages, to continue providing more relief to the people inside of Gaza who are, of course, also very eagerly anticipating this pause in fighting, not only because it will mean a reprieve from the constant bombardment that the Israeli military has continued to carry out in both Northern and Southern Gaza, but also, of course, because it means a lot of aid trucks are expected to enter the Gaza Strip. That part of the deal will begin as soon as that pause in fighting begins tomorrow morning our time.",

They're repositioning, making sure that they're going to be in a spot where they can protect themselves, because they're going to be somewhat vulnerable. They're going to lose some momentum in their fight. They had the upper hand going on there for a while. So, as I look from that perspective, that's the first thing. Then, once the truce starts, there's this nine-hour window of what's going to happen then, OK? There's likely going to be some people and some soldiers that will fight. There will be small-arms fire. There will be violations potentially of this. The question is whether they can work through those, and we will find out at 4:00 local time there as to whether or not those hostages get released or not.

So, again, there's just -- we're at the beginning of the beginning. There's so many things and so much time before those hostages actually get released. I think cooler heads will be there on one side or the other with regards to this. I'm concerned also how communication is even taking place from Qatar to the ground soldier there in Gaza, whether or not they want to. There's -- both sides probably don't want this to happen, let's say. And, again, lastly, from a military perspective, this pause is going to give Hamas a chance to breathe a little bit.
