A short time ago in Beijing, officials announced testing requirements are being slightly loosened. In the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou, lockdowns have just been fully lifted in four districts and mass testing there scrapped. Guangzhou is home to the largest iPhone factory in the world. It is one place the Chinese authorities have not been able to stamp out these protests. In a dramatic standoff on Tuesday night, protesters threw bottles at police and security forces responded with tear gas. CNN's Ivan Watson has been covering these protests since they began. He joins me tonight from Hong Kong. Many of these protests have been shot down by authorities but they do continue in some places. Is the easing of restrictions in Beijing and Guangzhou now a sign that the protesters' message has at least been heard?",

That's while Guangzhou is still counting more than 6,000 new cases a day, which makes it a hotspot by Chinese terms. Beijing relaxing some restrictions. Shanghai lifting lockdowns from 11 out of 24 districts that have been under lockdown. So again, this twofold approach, trying to deal with the biggest display of anger at the authorities across the country that China has seen in a generation. Let's move to another development here. The protests aren't getting on the front pages of Chinese newspapers. But what is is the death of the former Chinese leader, Jiang Zemin, who passed away today at the age of 96 from leukemia. His death is being marked by the most senior Chinese officials. Xi Jinping, the leader, calling for deep condolences, saying it is time to turn grief into strength. And we can anticipate a state funeral in the days or week ahead. But one big question is, will the Chinese authorities allow Chinese people to gather at this tense moment in the country, for vigils to show their own condolences, for a man who led the country into opening up to the outside world, as opposed to the current leader, who has been pulling China away from the rest of the world? It is very hard to get a visa to get into China right now because of the COVID restrictions -- Becky.",

CNN has been bringing you live coverage of the 2022 FIFA WorldCup, the most popular sporting event on the planet, watched by billions of fans worldwide. Qatar isn't only hosting a major football tournament. It is also playing a pivotal role in the global energy market, especially as Europe looks to slash its dependence on Russian energy supplies. Qatar has announced it will supply liquefied natural gas to Germany under two new deals. Berlin saying it doesn't, quote, expect any energy from Russia anymore. This comes a week after QatarEnergy signed a 27 year deal to supply China's Sinopec with liquefied natural gas, calling that the longest gas supply agreement in the history of the LNG industry. Following the Kremlin's invasion of Ukraine, competition for other LNG supplies has become intense. That's why I want to bring in someone who could speak for one of the world's largest producers, Qatar's energy minister, Saad Al Kaabi, joining me in Doha. Of course, you are the head of QatarEnergy. It's great seeing you here. Firstly, congratulations on what has been a fantastic tournament so far.

So having a secure gas deal, if you look at Poland and what they've signed with us, an energy deal a very long time ago; you look at Europe, you look at Italy, some of these countries that have signed the long term deal with us, today enjoy a price much cheaper than the price in the market.

Russia has bombed more than a third of Ukraine's electricity and water supply in the past few weeks.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  What we're seeing, to put it in one, word is barbaric. And precisely because Putin is not able to succeed on the battlefield, he is taking the war to Ukraine's civilians. And he is doing it in a very deliberate way, going after the entire energy and electric infrastructure, to turn off the lights, to turn off the water, to turn off the heat. And that, a time when, of course, Ukraine is heading into winter. The head of the NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, talked about weaponizing winter. And that is exactly what Putin is doing.

KRISTIN FISHER, CNN SPACE &amp; DEFENSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well, right now, the United States is looking at ways to get a new commercial space station up and running once  the International Space Station retires in about 2030. What happened was a very big moment for China's space agency, really the entire country because, up until this point, it was only the United States and its international partners at the International Space Station that had the technical prowess and the money to pull this off. A continuous human presence in low Earth orbit, that was something only they had done for more than two decades. That all changed yesterday with this launch right there and that change of command ceremony. What this means is that China will be able to conduct experiments in low Earth orbit, in microgravity. Who knows what kind of experiments they might be able to do that we are not ethically allowed to do by the U.S. and its partners? But perhaps, Becky, the bigger picture here is they will use this space station as a training ground to get to what they really want. And what China is aiming to do here is built a base on the south pole of the moon, because that is where you will find water in the form of ice. Becky, incidentally, that is also where the U.S. and its partners are hoping to land astronauts sometime in the year of 2025 on the south pole of the moon. So you are setting up this competition of sorts, for resources. And the training for that always begins at the space station, which is why the new Chinese space station is so important, Becky.",
