It was in trouble before this latest incident. This just makes it abundantly clear to anybody paying attention that we have one political party that unfortunately is in absolute hostage situation with its most extreme members. And Kevin McCarthy, who, you know, I have no, you know, relationship with of any kind. But when he actually did the right thing for the country and kept us from going into a government shutdown, he was punished. And he was punished because he worked with Democrats. He worked for the good of the country. He was not continuing to be captive to the far-right extremists. So they toppled him. It was a very small number as you look at the vote, but now we're, you know, reaping the consequences of their misbehavior.",

When you look at the extremists in the House, they certainly don't represent a majority of the country.And, you know, somebody has to stand up and say, enough. You know, we can have disagreements. I'm all for that. I was in the Senate for eight years. I worked with a lot of Republicans and, you know, oppose them when I didn't agree. But at some point, there needs to be a backlash against the control that this small group of extremists have. And I don't know who will lead that.

Understand that a democracy is struggling against an autocracy that is conducting a barbaric invasion and committing crimes against humanity and genocide has to be defeated. So I think a majority of the Congress just like still a majority of the public is in favor of helping Ukraine.The challenge will be if whoever is elected Speaker somehow controls the floor, so you can't get a vote. So we have a majority, just like we had a majority to keep the government open until, you know, finally, McCarthy allowed there to be a vote with Democrats and a big number of Republicans. So they'll have to be an enormous amount of pressure and maneuvering to get that vote because the Senate will vote to continue to fund Ukraine. The Pentagon will be asking to continue to fund Ukraine, they understand the stakes. So the, you know, the struggle will be in the House. And we'll all have to do everything we can to force a vote because if we get a vote, Ukraine will be given the aid it needs. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And we cannot, as a country, do anything that would embolden the kind of people, i.e. Vladimir Putin who would do that kind of attack.And she also had some very, very sharp words for what she called would be appeases in Congress, in the House. And liken them to the America first brigade during the Second World War, who were appeases of Hitler.

And Biden has done an amazing job by any measure.You know, people have talked about infrastructure forever, he passed the bill. People have talked about losing advanced manufacturing to China, he passed the bill. People have talked about getting clean energy, actually to produce even more and more jobs, he passed the bill. Negotiating for drug prices, all of these things, which many of us have tried to get done in, you know, the Senate and beyond, he's gotten done. And it's going to change Americans lives for the better, and it's going to enhance and grow our economy. And when people say, well, I don't know, pay attention, please.

She's a journalist. She's been in and out, Narges Mohammadi. For a long time, she's currently serving another long sentence. And in the wake of what happened to Mahsa Amini, as we remember a year ago now, killed in the hands of Iran's morality police. The world's attention has been on Iran and on women around the world. So this is a really huge moment. And just to say, my conversation with Hillary Clinton was at Georgetown at the Institute for Women Peace and Security that she supports.
