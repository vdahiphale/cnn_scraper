In her new book, Cheney says McCarthy wentto Mar-a-Lago after January 6 because Trump was depressed and not eating. She calls House Republicans \"Trump's enablers and collaborators\", once she says -- even called Trump \"Orange Jesus\". CNN has an exclusive look ahead. Plus, President Biden comparing himself to the alternative in Colorado, touting his infrastructure achievements and attacking those he calls MAGA Republicans. And as the clock runs out on the Israel- Hamas truce, some Democrats in Congress want to put conditions on aid to Israel. I'll ask Democratic Senator Michael Bennet about that. Good day, everyone. I'm Kasie Hunt to our viewers watching in the United States and around the world. It's 11 a.m. here in Washington, Wednesday, November 29. There are 47 days until the Iowa caucuses, just 341 days until Election Day. This is today's State of the Race. Welcome. We're going to get into all things politics and the 2024 election this hour. But, we want to begin with a critical day in the Israel-Hamas war, an extended truce due to expire within hours. And while we are expecting another exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners soon, it could be the last unless the truce is extended once again. Qatar which is spearheading negotiations involving the U.S., Israel, and Egypt, says they're hopeful an extension will be announced by the end of the day. A senior Israeli official says his country is trying to see whether there is a possibility to extend it. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is on a diplomatic mission that will take him to Israel. He says continuing the truce is a top priority (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We will be focused on making -- doing what we can to extend the pause so that we continue to get more hostages out and more humanitarian assistance in. We'll discuss with Israel how it can achieve its objective of ensuring that the terrorist attacks of October 7 never happen again, while sustaining and increasing humanitarian assistance and minimizing further suffering and casualties among Palestinian civilians.

      "sentences": "Right. Well, I think, to be frank, we are going to probably see Israeli -- Palestinian civiliansbeing killed again, because until this truce took place, in about six and a half weeks of fighting, the Israeli Military killed more than 14,800 people in Gaza. That's according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health out of the West Bank. The Israeli government, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has made it clear that once the truce ends, he wants to resume the military operations. And if they continue the way they were going before this six-day pause, then we can assume that the death toll, the Israeli slaughter of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, 14,800 people in six and a half weeks, more than 6,000 of them, children, will likely resume again. And on top of that, there is a second major threat to the civilian population there and that is disease. The World Health Organization says that more than a million Palestinians in Gaza have been displaced, and that disease is running rampant, acute respiratory illness, diarrhea, chicken pox, jaundice, lice. And we have senior officials in the WHO saying even now that more people could die in Gaza of illness than from the Israeli bombardment. If you add conflict to that, the situation is dire indeed. So, let's turn to the Qatari government, which is sounding this note of optimism that perhaps there could be news, I mean, extension of the truce. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DR. MAJED AL-ANSARI, QATARI MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SPOKESPERSON: We don't have people on the ground. We get the information on the hostages from Hamas day by day, according to the list agreed between both sides. So, what we are quite sure of right now is that there is very positive news regarding the availability for the hostages that can be released in the next couple of days. But, I can't comment on the details of what's happening in the negotiating room at the moment. But, it is happening in a positive environment, and it fills us with hope that we will be able to announce something positive by the end of the day. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

That means after we get most of the women and children out of Gaza, at least the ones that Hamas knows where they are, then what? We're talking about the soldiers, the military-age men, some of the dead bodies that Hamas has in its possession, in exchange for Israeli-held prisoners that may also be man or military members. That seems like the way forward with one sticking point. Hamas wants that to lead to an end in the siege and an end of the military operations. Israel is not going to agree to that. So, eventually, the truce will end. Best case scenario, I think, is it goes on for a few more days. More lives are saved. More humanitarian aid gets in. But, on that fundamental point, which is, are the operations are going to continue or not? No matter what Bill Burns or Antony Blinken says, the Israelis are going to go back in and they're going to keep going. The question I think is, how hard and how long and whether or not they do to the south of Gaza what they did to the north of Gaza, which is creating the humanitarian catastrophe that we see today?",

Seung Min Kim, I mean, what he just laid out there is a central challenge for the Biden administration, and they are beingpressured on their left by young progressives in the party who see what's happening, and perhaps for different -- the Colonel just kind of laid out, the military and strategic reason for not necessarily going about it this way, because you don't want to create -- radicalize more people who are seeing these horrible things happen. But, there is a political imperative for the President as well at home. SEUNG MIN KIM, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS, &amp; CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Right. It's actually been really interesting to me how the White House, how the President has responded to that pressure from the left. You do have them assuaging people privately, Muslim American leaders in private meetings, even members of their own administration who've been really distraught about the bombing campaign in Gaza. But, in terms of their overall strategy, aside from maybe rhetorically highlighting the need for humanitarian aid, their strategy hasn't changed. President Biden is someone who has strong convictions on this issue, and no kind of pressure from the progressives in his party have changed that. What I thought was really interesting last week was when he said, I was traveling with him in Nantucket for the holiday, obviously, a lot of that Thanksgiving holiday taken by the news of the hostage deal and the progression of that, he was asked about the debate in Congress and in the party about conditioning aid to Israel. He did tell us that he thought it was a worthwhile thought. But, he then added, but I don't think I would have gotten this far, that we would have gotten this far in terms of the hostage agreements and getting people out if I had endorsed that at the beginning.

Her crowds have gotten larger. We've seen that here in New Hampshire as well as Iowa and South Carolina, the first three early voting states. So, she does have momentum. The question is, what does that mean? The quote from her you just heard, you just played is a real interesting example of her task here. She is trying to walk a very fine line, trying to take a velvet hammer, if you will, to the former President. I call it the Trump tightrope. She is trying to win over the -- anyone but Trump Republican voter, and she is doing a pretty good job on that. However, her challenge is trying to win over some Trump voters, some Trump supporters, because he still controls the vast majority of the Republican Party. So, that is the task ahead of her. We all know endorsements don't win campaigns. But, they do create a sense of a momentum, as you said, and that can help win campaigns. So, certainly, this is not game over.

One metric I'm looking for is next week. Does Chris Christie, the former New Jersey Governor, qualify for that Republican debate, the fourth debate in Alabama? As of now, he is not quite reaching the threshold in terms of the Republican National Committee qualifications for the polling. So, if he does make the stage, that's a sense that he lives to fight another day. If he does not make the debate stage, we've seen what happens to other candidates when they don't qualify for the debate. So, that is certainly something we're keeping an eye on. Also here in New Hampshire, what does the Governor do? What does Governor Sununu do? Does he decide to offer an endorsement? And if it's not him, Chris Christie. If it isn't Nikki Haley, that's another sort of challenge for Chris Christie. So, there are 55 days until the New Hampshire primary. I think a lot will happen between now and then for Chris Christie. So, we will just wait and see how that goes. But, there is no doubt he could be in her way here. Just as an Iowa, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Nikki Haley are head to head.

The plausibility of that, I will say, I covered Nikki Haley's race for Governor. She was a distant third.",

And so far, the other candidates not named Trump in the race, have been so resistant to do that, which is why we were talking about Governor Chris Christie earlier. He said on State of the Union earlier this week that that's not how voters vote. If I drop out, the New Hampshire voters who support me aren't necessarily going to go to Nikki Haley. And while that may be somewhat true, I defer to you, you two experts on that. The fact is that the other non-Trump candidates in the race aren't giving voters that option because they are continuing to stay in the race. So, how much Nikki Haley can mobilize all the additional momentum that she has behind her right now to an actual victory over Donald Trump? I still think it's a far way to go. But, one thing I'm watching for is if the Biden campaign starts to single up Nikki Haley a little bit more. They're not doing that quite just yet. But, we'll keep our eyes peeled at that.",

Because LizCheney has written a book, and I just want to bring up some of the -- our Jamie Gangel was the first to get a hold of this in a CNN exclusive. And I think the one that -- it's getting the most attention, and I think you'll understand pretty easily, why is a conversation that Cheney recounts that occurred between her and McCarthy in the immediate aftermath of January 6? Because you'll remember, Kevin McCarthy went down to the House floor, laid blame for the insurrection at the feet of President Trump, and just weeks later, went down to Mar-a-Lago and took a photo of himself standing next to Donald Trump. Now, a lot of people say this was a resurrection for Donald Trump. I think it's possible the narrative is a little more complicated that McCarthy had realized that Trump still had a lot of power in the Republican base and was trying to resuscitate himself. Either way, it's a critical moment. So then, this conversation plays out. Cheney, when she finds out he has gotten to do this, says, \"Mar-a-Lago? What the hell, Kevin McCarthy?\" McCarthy says \"They're really worried. Trump's not eating. He is not eating, so they asked me to come see him. The conversation then continues. Cheney, \"What? You went to Mar-a-Lago because Trump's not eating?\" McCarthy, \"Yeah, he's really depressed.\" Matt Gorman, I mean, there is the picture, right? There is the picture of the two of them. I mean, I mean, I remember -- I honestly remember where I was when I saw that pop up on my phone. And I was like, yeah, I mean, having been at the Capitol, and you know, a lot of people that were there were still pretty traumatized at the time that picture was taken.
