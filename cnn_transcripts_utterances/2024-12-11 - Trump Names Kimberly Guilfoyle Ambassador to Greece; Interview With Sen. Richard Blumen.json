      "sentences": "The NYPD tells CNN that wanted posters have been seen around the city since last week's murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO on a Manhattan sidewalk, wanted posters apparently of corporate executives? Could that raise in crime inspire copycats?Plus, a notable new role for Kimberly Guilfoyle, where president-elect Donald Trump is sending a loyalist who is engaged to his oldest son. And, later, is Bill Belichick about to enter the college ranks? \"The New York Times\" says the legendary Super Bowl coach is considering it. Hello. I'm Jim Acosta, and you are live in the CNN NEWSROOM. All right, we do begin with the breaking news this hour, a major new development in the ambush killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Two law enforcement officials tell CNN that fingerprints from the murder scene match the suspect 26-year-old Luigi Mangione. Also new, a law enforcement source tell CNN Mangione was found with a notebook of a hand written to-do list for carrying out a murder. The source says one chilling notebook entry says, what could be better than -- quote -- \"to kill the CEO at his own bean-counting conference.\" This is Mangione right here just before his arrest munching a hash brown at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania. An employee there alerted police. This is his latest mug shot. Mangione faces five charges, including second-degree murder. He is fighting extradition back to New York and has been denied bail at the time being. Let's discuss all those and more with CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller and CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig. He's a former state and federal prosecutor. John, what are we learning about these fingerprints?",

But then they were able to take those prints, which they didn't have access to, because, remember, prior to this, he didn't have any serious criminal activity or arrests that would have caused his prints or DNA, for that matter, to be in the system. They took the booking prints. They compared them to the latents that they recovered on the evidence at the scene and they say they have a match. That is a step forward, because there is always the argument -- and it's inherent in the failure to wave extradition -- that that's not me. Tying him to the scene is the first forensic scientific clue that says, beyond all the circumstantial evidence, that's him and he was there, allegedly.",

It's important that people understand, as you said, Jim, this is a constitutional right that a defendant has. He can challenge his extradition. But the question here is not, is the person guilty? The only question is, is this human being sitting here in this courtroom in Pennsylvania, is this the same Luigi Mangione who's been charged with murder and other crimes in New York? It's a very low legal bar. Even the fingerprint alone can probably prove it or the other notes that you just referred to, Jim, would probably be enough to prove it to link him to that crime scene to say this is the guy. He will wind up back in New York and there he will face murder charges.",

Was it their insurer or did his medical insurer do something that disappointed him so much that it turned him against the industry in general and UnitedHealthcare was just the biggest? No mention in anything that I have either seen or heard about of Brian Thompson specifically. He seems at least at this point to be a symbol of the health care industry, because he heads the largest.",

There's all this online chatter elevating, putting this Mangione character on a pedestal and so on.

And here's why. There's two reasons. First of all, we have a jury selection process. This case will go to trial, in all likelihood, in Manhattan for murder. And so people who are obviously biased, people who are posting these wild sort of praise of this guy on social media, they will be filtered out. The other thing that people need to understand is, it's one thing to pop off on social media and praise this guy or try to make him some sort of hero. It's another thing to walk into a courtroom. It's a very solemn, serious, formalized setting to get sworn on to a jury to take an oath to do your job, to judge the case impartially, to be instructed by a judge that these are the laws you have to follow, to sit there with 11 of your fellow civilians and to say, because I like this guy or think he's cool or something like that, I'm going to let this guy go on murder. I just don't see that happening. Maybe I'm being overly optimistic from the prosecutor's point of view. But I think there's a big difference between expressing social media memes and actually going into a courtroom and tanking a murder case.",

That's what Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said about Donald Trump's defense secretary pick, Pete Hegseth.The former FOX News host is back up on Capitol Hill today trying to lock down support after serious allegations of misconduct emerged against him. Hegseth will meet with three key senators who've been critical of the president-elect in the past. There they are right there. Joining us now to talk about this, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut. He's on both Armed Services and Veterans Affairs committee. Senator, what are your concerns about Pete Hegseth? And have you picked up on something that we have been hearing in the reporting about Pete Hegseth? And that is that Trump world is putting a lot of pressure on some of these Republican senators to get to yes on Hegseth. Are you hearing any of that? SEN. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-CT):  There's no question that Donald Trump is heightening the heat, turning up the screws, and, to some extent, turning the tide for Hegseth. Part of the threat is that they will encounter primaries in their states. Their fear is not Democratic opposition in these red states. It's the threat of a primary against them, inspired and supported by Donald Trump. But they remain deeply concerned and troubled -- I think that's an understatement -- by his clear lack of qualifications and the serious allegations of alcohol abuse and sexual impropriety. He's never managed an organization of larger than 50 or so employees with minuscule budgets, compared to the $900 billion budget and three million military men and women that he'd be responsible for as secretary of defense. And those organizations that he has run, actually, he has run them into the ground, squandering assets and revenues. So I think that the tie between financial mismanagement, sexual improprieties, alcohol abuse, we don't want a secretary of defense who's impaired for one minute, because he's on call every minute of the day and night. And I think those concerns continue to be on the minds of my Republican colleagues. And Donald Trump has yet to overcome them. So I think there is still a significant chance -- in fact, I might even put it better than 50/50 -- that Hegseth will not be confirmed.",

I'm a former prosecutor, United States attorney, chief federal prosecutor in Connecticut, and state attorney general for 20 years. I know and people should know that walking into a courtroom and making charges is far from proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no evidence of wrongdoing against those members of the January 6 committees who brought those impeachment articles or who prosecuted them. And the likely beneficiaries of preemptive pardons would be the top echelon, and the underlings would still have the fear of that kind of prosecution. But let's have faith in the criminal justice system and the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. I think any such unfounded, unjust charges against people who simply did their jobs would ultimately cause a backlash against Donald Trump, because there will be acquittals and the costs of their defense or investigation, I think, should be borne by a defense fund. I would certainly contribute. Or by a pro bono legal team. I'd sign up.
