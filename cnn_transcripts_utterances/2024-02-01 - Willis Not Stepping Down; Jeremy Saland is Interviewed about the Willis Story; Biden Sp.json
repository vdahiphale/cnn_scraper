Sources telling CNN that Willis is worried her departure would effectively end the case. The Fulton County DA is facing scrutiny over allegations she's been having an affair with the lead prosecutor she appointed in the case, Nathan Wade. Willis and Wade are among nearly a dozen potential witnesses who have been subpoenaed to testify at an upcoming hearing. CNN's Zachary Cohen brought us the exclusive reporting this morning. Zach, a lot of drama going on here. Not a good look because this case is dramatic enough on its own. But tell us what we're going to sort of hear and what we imagine might be the response after some of your reporting.",

And, look, that sets up a crucial couple weeks here that we have coming up here. On February 2nd, tomorrow, Willis faces a deadline to file her written response to these allegations that she engaged in an improper romantic relationship with her top prosecutor.And it will really be the first time we've heard from Fani Willis since these allegations first surfaced. She spoke a couple weeks ago at a church in Atlanta, but since then has been silent. I'm told that she has been working behind the scenes, intimately and directly involved in crafting this written response. So, we're going to see what that says. I'm told it will focus mostly on the legal arguments, though. It's going to try to undercut this claim that she should be disqualified based on the allegations. She's not expected to really refute them, tough, directly. So, we're going to have to see how she balances that and what that will mean for an upcoming hearing on February 15th where Willis has been subpoenaed to testify. As you know, Sara, all the hearings in this case are broadcast live on video. So, if Willis does take the stand on February 15th, we would be able to watch it live.",

His first since his unannounced hospitalization due to complications with cancer.It comes at U.S. officials now say Iran is getting increasingly nervous about their proxy groups as attacks on U.S. forces in the region escalate. Overnight, a new round of U.S. strikes destroyed a major hub for Houthi drones in Yemen. This is as President Biden's retaliation still looms for the killing of American soldiers, three of them in Jordan. And in the Red Sea we're now learning a Houthi missile came within one mile of this U.S. warship that you are looking at over my right shoulder. Past attempts have come no closer than eight miles. Natasha Bertrand is following all of this from the Pentagon. Natasha, what are we seeing here because everybody is waiting for the response to the killing of those three soldiers in Jordan, but we're seeing that Iran is being reportedly concerned about their proxies.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Sara. So, what we're learning from U.S. officials is that Iran does not want to get into a direct war or direct conflict with the United States. Yes, they train, support, equip these proxy groups in Iraq, Syria and in Yemen with the Houthis, of course, but really the goal of that support has always been to kind of harass U.S. forces and not engage in the kind of escalation that backs the U.S. into a corner and then forces the U.S. to respond in a very significant way, potentially striking Iran itself, as we see Republicans have been calling for in recent days because of that attack on Jordan that killed three U.S. service members that the U.S. is now attributing to Iran-backed militias.And so what we're learning is that the Iranian leadership is becoming a little bit nervous about what these groups are doing because we have to remember also that Iran doesn't have perfect command and control over these groups in Iraq and Syria. And so the question now is, is Iran going to do anything about it? That remains completely unclear. Are they actually going to try to rein in these groups because, again, you know, the question of Yemen is a really good example of this. They don't have a lot of control over the Houthis and their attacks on commercial shipping either. And that is hurting Tehran's bottom line because it's angering some of Iran's closest and really only allies, including China and India. And so the question is, are they going to actually take -- make a move to rein in these groups. That remains to be seen. The U.S. has conveyed to the Iranians privately that they do expect them to try to control these groups a little better, but it's unclear if they actually can. And so when -- as the U.S. is weighing their response, of course, Iran has anxiety about whether the U.S. is going to go as far as to strike inside Iran directly. That is very unlikely at this point we are told, but, still, the U.S. response is expected to be multi-faceted and potentially even sustained over time in multiple countries, Sara.",

Cedric, we don't know exactly where this U.S. ship, the USS Gravely, was attacked inside the Red Sea, but we do know what it used to repel this Houthi missile, which is a close-in weapon system. Explain to us what we are seeing right here and what it tells us about how close this Houthi missile got to the U.S. vessel. COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Yes, John, the close-in weapon systems, or CIWS, is an automated machine gun basically. And what it does is it's a close-range gun that is used when no other system has been able to engage a target successfully. So, what that means is, that Houthi missile got really, really close to the Gravely, the USS Gravely, which is the destroyer that we pictured earlier. And that is one in very, you know, close situation. And it's the first time -- as Sara mentioned, that's the first time that we've had a situation like this in this particular operation.",

And those would be the most important because those two things are really what Ukraine needs right now.We have seen how much the Ukrainians have actually had to scale back on their operations, even their defensive operations. With ammunition they can improve their defensive operations and they can also potentially go on offense in selected sectors there. And, of course, air defenses are critical because the Russians are targeting the civilian infrastructure of Ukraine. And if they can spread out their air defense architecture within Ukraine, what that means is they can protect more people, prevent more deaths, and that then will allow the Ukrainians to have a much better effort in terms of being able to counter the Russians than they've had in the last few months.",

We also have a system IRIS-T, which is a German made system. And then we have the NASAMS system, which is a joint U.S./Norwegian system designed for more close-in air defense type operations.
