But I'll say I think it more has to do with the fact that people are waiting for the Trump administration to deliver on economic promises. If you look at the election, I think it was largely about the idea that Trump would deliver on bringing inflation down. And that's something people feel in their daily lives.

All of these people had to be evacuated while police are conducting these sweeps. This is a large area, the Three Powers Plaza. It has both the Supreme Court Congress and also the Presidential Palace. Now we are also learning that as this is being investigated as a suicide attack, they don't think there's anyone else involved here.

Hundreds of people were arrested. Those investigations are still ongoing at the Supreme Court in fact. And former President Jair Bolsonaro himself is being investigated for his potential role in these protests. It's just of course this area is usually under a law lot of surveillance.

The Lebanese Health Ministry says airstrikes across the country have killed at least 20 children since Sunday.In total, more than 2,600 people have been killed since Israel stepped up its campaign against Hezbollah in mid-September. Paris, meantime, is ramping up security in the city ahead of a soccer match between France and Israel on Thursday. It comes after violent clashes in Amsterdam last week between Israeli fans and pro- Palestinian supporters, prompting a ban on public protests. Pro-Palestinian groups gathered in Paris on Wednesday to oppose a controversial pro-Israeli gala by a far-right Israeli association. Now, in the coming hours, thousands of officers will be deployed to ensure security in the city. CNN's Melissa Bell has details now from Paris. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

It had already been described as an event that was likely to attract tension, but the events of last week in Amsterdam, which saw more than 70 people arrested after a night of violence against Israeli fans in the Dutch capital, has led to renewed fears that these kind of sporting fixtures can become lightning rods for pro-Palestinian support and possibly, as we saw in Amsterdam last week, tension and violence. That's why French authorities are taking no chances: 4,000 policemen and -women, but also more than a thousand stewards in the Stade de France. Twenty thousand tickets have been sold, rather than the 80,000 that can normally be taken inside that stadium. And any pro-Palestine signs have been banned. The only signs that will be allowed are either Israeli or France flags, and French authorities say that will be closely monitored. We saw earlier this week a basketball match in Greece attended by a Tel Aviv side, where the fans had displayed large \"Free Palestine\" signs. That is the kind of expression of support that the French are keen to avoid this time.",
