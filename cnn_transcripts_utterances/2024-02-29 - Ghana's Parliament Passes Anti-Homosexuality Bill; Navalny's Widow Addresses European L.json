That is, according to new numbers just released by the Ministry of Health in Gaza. It does not distinguish between civilians and fighters, but has recently said almost three quarters of the casualties in Gaza are women and children.The Biden administration has become increasingly critical of how Israel is conducting the war, with President Biden saying its response has been over the top. And with communications blackouts and restrictions on journalists, it's difficult to get a true picture of what's happening in Gaza. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh and a team of CNN journalists documented an attack that killed more than half the members of one family and found a mystery that took weeks to unravel. We must warn you parts of her report contain disturbing and graphic images. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voiceover): Every patient here has a harrowing account of survival. But it is the story of this one young woman that, as you'll see, would become key to uncovering an atrocity that, until today, had been hidden in the dark They're all gone. I have no one left,\" 18-year-old Roba Abu Jibba told us. She offered few clues as to what had happened to her and her family. But a week later, a camera man working for CNN in Gaza was out filming as he's done every day for months. He was one of the first to arrive in this area just after Israeli forces had withdrawn. It was on that date, January 14th, when he stumbled upon the scene of a horrific incident. At first, we had no idea this was connected to Roba until they start pulling documents from the rubble. It's Gaza's grim routine of trying to identify the dead. Then the startling discovery. Later that day, CNN producer Abeer Salman screens the footage and sees Roba's I.D. This is where she was critically injured and the bodies are the remains of her family. The images tell of the brutal force that was unleashed here. And people speak of a massacre of civilians. With the stench of death in the air, they pull body after body. Tiny corpses carried on blankets. And in the corner, a woman sits, covered in flies. In her decomposing arms, a young man. But we still didn't really know what had happened here.",

And you can find much more about Robert's story and our investigation on our Web site @cnn.com.With the humanitarian situation in Gaza worsening by the day, the U.S. is looking into additional ways it can help. Two officials tell CNN the Biden administration is considering possible air drops into Gaza, France, Jordan and several other countries airdropped aid parcels into the territory earlier this week. Some Gaza residents say they've been forced to eat animal food and ration their supplies to make sure that their children get at least one meal a day. Concern is reportedly rising within the Biden administration about a possible Israeli ground incursion into Lebanon. Multiple officials tell CNN it could come by late spring or summer if diplomatic efforts failed to cool tensions with Hezbollah. Months of daily cross border attacks have forced about 80,000 Israelis from their homes in the northern part of the country. So let's go to journalist Elliott Gotkine who joins us live from London. Good morning to you, Elliot. What more are you learning about these rising concerns in the Biden administration that Israel may launch an incursion into Lebanon?",

They are going to be a lot of places where that could happen with, you know, 1.3 or so million people in Russia right now, it's very clear that there are a lot of opportunities for mischief to be made on both sides.And the risk, of course, is that a lot of civilians will get caught in crossfire. And that, of course, compounds the difficulty of conducting military operations there. But it's going to be extremely hard for the Israelis to achieve any of their military goals just because of the sheer number of people that are involved here. But also, it's going to be very hard for there to be any kind of resolution to this if they don't have a viable plan to move people out of Rafah. They say they have a plan.

And as always, we can tell right now, the alternatives that the Israelis have spoken about are not necessarily improvements over the current state of affairs that these civilians these Palestinians are experiencing at the moment.So, Egypt is not set to open up its border with Gaza to take in refugees. The Israelis have talked about moving people to closer to the coast than they currently are. That would, you know, potentially allow for certain things to happen. But it would also create some other difficulties, potentially logistically and none of these places seems to have been prepared as a campsite or as a staging area for any kind of movement of this type. So, this is a -- this does not seem to be a well thought out plan. At least you're looking at it from the outside. And it really begs the question whether or not they can pull something like this up in time for a meaningful cessation of hostilities. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now we're still waiting for the court's ruling in another separate case.

This is a very worrying development in Ghana but the proponents of the bill say that it's important to push for, \"family values.\" And it's no coincidence that the issue of \"family values\" is comes up in countries like Ghana, Uganda and Kenya with a proposed bill.

      "sentences": "It's a complicated answer to that question. I think there is considerable leverage in terms of cutting financial ties with Ghana. Ghana is a critical ally of the U.S. and West Africa. The U.S. alone gives more than $150 million in assistance from various agencies. That is a stick that they can hold over the President, in terms of not signing this bill. Now, President Akufo-Addo has said very little about whether he will sign this bill.But where the limits of leverage come, I think is on domestic politics. This year in Guyana is an election year. There's clearly an agenda beyond just the conservative agenda of trying to squeeze out LGBT rights here. And that is to force the president to react on this issue and to sign the bill. Now, you already mentioned the State Department talking about this bill. And speaking about constitutionality. I think that's where there might be an elegant solution for the president should not want to sign this bill because this is a private member's bill brought up by opposition members. There haven't gone through the process of costing out how much this will impact the purse strings of treasury in Ghana. Now that sounds very inside baseball. But it does have an impact because he can then say, without doing that he cannot sign this bill and delay the signing. This means though, that the continued conversation of trying to push against gay rights in this country and other parts of Africa is having a meaningful impact on everyday lives of people. The head of UNAIDS, the AIDS wing of U.N. agencies said that this will even stop health going to the people who need it most in that country and others. They say that what needs to happen is a robust conversation and the international community at least I think is unified in trying to stop this bill being signed into law.",
