I thought that was really interesting, given the dynamics right now. There's a lot of uncertainty. There's a lot of questions about whether Johnson is going to be able to get there and how quickly he can get there. But a lot of his closest allies making it very clear to the press that they see this is a very different situation than what we saw in 2023. Obviously, time is going to tell, Jake, whether or not that is true, but there is a lot of members who are just frustrated right now about the fact that they want to get to legislating. They want to get through what is supposed to be a very first step process, something that's supposed to be pretty easy, something that Republicans could rally around. A lot of them were really hoping that Donald Trump's endorsement was going to make a huge difference here. And while Johnson got very close, he was not able so far to clinch this in the first round. Obviously, there's a lot of conversations happening behind the scenes right now, Jake, and we're keeping a close eye on whether or not there's anything that Johnson can do in this moment. I would just note that this morning when I asked Speaker Johnson whether or not he would make Chip Roy the Rules Committee chairman, that's something that some conservatives have been pushing for.

He said it was important and Trump followed that lead. Now, I did speak to a number of senior advisers and allies as we watched this vote unfold, who all said that they believe Johnson will ultimately still be successful. They pointed to various numbers. They reminded me that they didn't know about several of these holdouts, how they were going to vote, but ultimately they did come around. They also believe that it is going to be possible to flip at least two of those no votes. One source is telling me, look, Massie is the only hard no. Everybody else, the other two, they want to make a point. Okay, point made. We still believe Johnson has this. We are still backing Mike Johnson at this point. So whether or not it ends up being this round, if it ends up being another round, they would not speculate as to how long this could take.

What do you need? What can we get for you so we can bring you into the yes column? With Thomas Massie? We know that there's nothing. With the other two, then the other six, right? So we now total the nine who voted not to elect the Speaker. You're trying to get them to yes. And the problem, I think the challenge that we have right now for Speaker Johnson, and I do expect that he'll -- he'll ultimately win on this next ballot, is that we've seen these same tactics played time and time again. We were talking earlier about John Boehner's election in 2013, and I was reminded of the very famous quote by Ron Burgundy. We've been coming to the same party for 12 years, and in no way is that depressing, except this is depressing. It's demoralizing as a Republican.
