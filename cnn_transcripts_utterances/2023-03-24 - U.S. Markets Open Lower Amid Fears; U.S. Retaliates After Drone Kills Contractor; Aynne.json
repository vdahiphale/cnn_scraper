It doesn't affect all the banks the same, all the customers the same. So we're in kind of a tumultuous period right now.I keep saying that the Fed's decision is in our rear view mirror, but I'm looking out the windshield and it's just as cloudy as it was last week. We still don't know if inflation is really under control. We don't know how this medicine in the economy has worked overall. We think the banking system is solid because all these central banks have basically vowed that they're going to make sure that things are OK here. Investors, though, are -- are a little skittish. I will say, though, I -- watching the -- the interest rate gauges, next week we're going to get the PCE. That's the Fed's preferred, you know, inflation gauge. And we'll see if that's cooled off a little bit. But mortgage rates have cooled off. Second week in a row that mortgage rates now -- a 30 year fixed, 6.42 percent, which I think is -- is sort of telling. And we're heading into the spring buying season.

We are learning that all of the U.S. service members injured are in stable condition.

CNN's Nic Robertson is with me now. And, Nic, I was surprised to learn there have been 78 drone strikes since 2021 from these Iranian proxy groups. That's an awful lot.

If you press down on the Iranians in Syria, do they get their proxies there to start up? Do their proxies in Hezbollah -- in -- that proxies -- Hezbollah in Lebanon start up and create increased tensions with Israel. There's anyway that Iran can ramp up.But, primarily, that beef, if you will, their issue with the United States is they want them out of the region and will continue through proxies to try to attack, to try to diminish the will to stay. But the U.S. troops in Syria are there predominantly to tackle ISIS. And ISIS, until recently, has been more deadly against U.S. forces in Syria than the Iranians have. Again, it's a very, very complex situation. But to your point, 78 attacks since 2021. That's an average of one almost every 10 days. That's significant. And it can't be overlooked. And I think that's very clearly why there was such a fast response,  not just that the president said, yes, do something quickly, that there was a target list ready to go to. You've seen in the video those sort secondary explosions. And in the past when there have been response strikes by the United States, they've targeted ammunition dumps.
