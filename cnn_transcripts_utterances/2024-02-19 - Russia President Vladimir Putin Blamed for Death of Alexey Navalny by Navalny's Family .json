I think we might have some of her own words we can play you here.Thank you. So here you're saying -- she's saying, if I translate roughly for you, that they're pushing the blame directly on Vladimir Putin. Now, I should point out the death of Navalny has put the conflict here in Ukraine in very stark focus, certainly, the minds of the western leaders who are in the Munich Security Conference over previous weekend. And to compound that, Ukraine has had to accept over that weekend the loss of a key eastern town Avdiivka, which has been fought over by them for months, indeed. And now we've seen that withdrawal on Saturday, and concerns rippling across Ukraine that this might be the first of a number of places potentially to see direct impact of the slow, or not happening of western aid, $60 billion yet to be approved by the dysfunctional Republican-held Congress. And so today we've also seen President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine visiting a town to the north of Avdiivka near Kupiansk, essentially to bolster morale there. But he does so as a number of reports emerge from how some Ukrainian wounded troops were indeed left behind in the evacuation from Avdiivka. Not uncommon, I should say, in warfare when situations get desperate, but their final messages, their final pleas, their final video indeed being circulated a lot among social media channels here, and I think adding to a sense of Ukraine realizing that its situation is growing, to some degree, desperate. We know there are ammunition shortages here. It doesn't feel that way here in Kherson where every minute or so we here artillery in and out and continued exchanges. This place has been liberated, but still Russia bombards it relentlessly. And I think there's a wider concern that that dysfunctionality, the political games that Vice President Kamala Harris referred to it when she was in Munich, is already having a direct effect here. It's costing Ukraine lives, certainly. It's costing them land in terms of Avdiivka. And in fact, slightly further east from where I'm standing, one of the key towns that was gained in the counteroffensive over the summer -- town, I should say. It's a tiny village called Robotyne. There are persistent Russian bids now to push back and try and recapture that. So multiple areas of the Ukrainian front line here, deep concerns there that we may start seeing further Russian gains. We are now into the month before Putin essentially gets his next presidential term rubberstamped by an election in Russia, and real concerns here that this may be the beginning of Russia picking up again its military campaign here. And it's really those billions of U.S. aid, they're allowing this to happen because they haven't arrived, and that's directly impacting what Ukraine can do.",

You knew him for a long time pretty well, what do you think that number means to him? MICHAEL COHEN, DONALD TRUMP'S FORMER PERSONAL LAWYER:  That's a total -- it is like the death touch to Donald. They don't have that available cash.  I've read in several different articles that he has a substantial sum of cash, it's not true. I would highly doubt it. He is probably looking at RNC money. He is probably looking at super PAC money again, as part of money that he would use. But no matter what happens, he does not have enough and there will have to be a liquidation of his assets in order to cover this amount, because you're right, it is not 354, it is into the 550 million, especially with the E.
