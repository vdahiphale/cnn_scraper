      "sentences": "OUTFRONT next.The breaking news, Kamala Harris about to make one of the biggest speeches of her life. The closing arguments one week exactly before Election Day in front of what it looks like, it could be her biggest crowd so far. We're live on the National Mall and we'll bring you Harris live. Plus, Trump calling his Madison Square Garden rally, a love fest. His honor, he says, to be involved. Of course, that's the same rally where the comedian insulted Latinos in crass and graphic terms and taking on Elon Musk. The district attorney who is suing Musk for that voter lottery of a million a day, asking a judge to speed up the case. So what could happen? Let's go OUTFRONT And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. And OUTFRONT tonight, the breaking news, Kamala Harris is about to take the stage for her closing message in this campaign. We have just obtained parts of her speech in which she will say, Donald Trump is unstable Donald Trump has a list of enemies that he plans to put in jail, but she will give those who disagree with her a seat at the table. And this is a live picture of where Harris will be speaking in just a few moments happening and a historic spot because you can see behind the podium where she'll be standing, which is at the ellipse in Washington, D.C., that she will have the White House behind her. Now, this spot, this angle is exactly the same one Donald Trump hat on January 6, he -- before some of his crowds marched on the Capitol. But, of course, he had the White House behind him, the power of that day and place. Harris now choosing for herself off tonight and the crowd tonight, huge. Police say they're expecting upwards of about 52,000 people at Harris's speech, and that number is not just on an absolute basis, huge, it's also relatively much more than the campaign had anticipated. They'd initially applied for a permit of 7,500 people a week ago. Then they upgraded it to 20,000, and they upped that again to 40,000. Now, police, as I indicated, are expecting many thousands more than that. And as I said, we've gotten parts of Harris's speech. She spent the day editing it. She plans to say about Trump and I quote from what we've obtained, he has an enemies list of people he intends to prosecute and quote, he said, one of his highest priorities is to set free the violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers on January 6, and then she will go through specifically providing these adjectives for Trump: unstable, obsessed, with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power. Now, of course, this is a message sure, to satisfy the Democratic base and voters who already dead set on voting for Harris, right? To think this is all about turnout. But the Harris campaign says no, that the goal tonight is actually still to persuade, still to sway undecided voters and that they aim to do that with what they are billing as an optimistic and hopeful message which from the parts of the speech we obtained seemed to come where Harris writes and I quote, I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to make your lives better. I'm looking to make progress. I pledge to listen to experts and to people who disagree with me. Unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at my table. Again, that's a quote from the speech that we anticipate Harris will be giving and, of course, that's coming up in just a few moments here. So, first, let's go to Priscilla Alvarez OUTFRONT in Washington at the Harris rally. And, Priscilla, obviously thousands of people gathering. We're told maybe it could be upwards of 50,000. What are you seeing there now?",

Everyone's here with me now. So, David, does this sound like from just the excerpts that we have and they're just excerpts we anticipate it's going to be a little bit longer than the stump speech that she has been given, which has been running sort of 18 to 22 minutes and very consistent, this is going to be a little longer. We anticipate over half an hour. Does it sound like the closing argument she needs to make?",

I'm going to come with a to-do list was a very effective frame. Now she has to fill in that to-do list, and she has to make the case that these things are not going to happen with a president who's consumed by his own self-interest and by demonizing all of the people he has to work with. I will work with people to get these things done and that will touch people's lives. If that's the message, I think it's the right message.",

I mean, I'm just reading into the signs that I see that that's what the campaign wanted to hand out.What about the turnout though they start with 7,500, then they up at 20 than they up at 40.

They're talking about the issues they want to, and they're doing so on the terms, because Donald Trump has frankly gifted them after the rally in Madison Square Garden. They want to be to have a message that can appeal to independents, Republicans, and they have made this ideological pivot pretty clear.Her campaigning with Liz Cheney, I think was the clear indication that they see their more direct path is recreating the type of anti-Trump coalitions that have come out for Democrats consistently -- consistently in the last midterm and the last presidential election. But, you know, to David's point, it won't just be anti-Trump. And I think that's a lesson Democrats have learned from 2016. They want to make this a referendum on the other guy, but they want to also say that -- that his distractions, his grievances stop him from providing for American people. And that's the thing that she will do most clearly. So it's a pivot -- it is an anti-Trump message for the one that's coupled with delivering for people. And that's the way that I don't think they were doing for us.",

She critique the Madison Square Garden rally that he did by saying there was no effort to even reach out to women, never -- never mind Nikki Haley, maybe never Trump type Republican voters. So the seat at the table, I know she's going to appear with someRepublicans tonight who've endorsed her, showing that she wants to be a president for all people, showing that she's willing to compromise and is going to be a more bipartisan president than I think a lot of people perhaps have seen her as in the past when she run previously, I think that's important. And I also think twofold optics here. Of course, reminding people of January 6 and that rally on the ellipse, but also showing her a woman men in front of the White House and telling Americans, we've never done it, but it's okay.

And it's about chaos and the chaos in this is she needling Donald Trump as much as she is making her closing argument. She is at the place that is one of his weakest spots personally, I think -- I think it's a sore spot for her to stand there.

They aren't particularly tuned into all the elements of the campaign, but they're very self- interested because their lives are -- are -- they're scuffling to get along out there and their thing has been Donald Trump may be not my cup of tea, but I did better when he was there.

On people understand about Liz Cheney and those who have already spoken, is there somebody else that can come?

I think change -- there's two different kinds of change at play here. One is changed linear change, change from the Biden agenda and the Trump campaign has tried to make the point that she would be an extension of them. She's talked about where she wants to go. But the other changes can page from Trump's style, change from Trump's politics that is -- that is so disruptive and in some ways destructive would hence the setting that our priority is will never be heard.

And that drops are down to 255. But if she wins in Nevada and wins in Arizona, then she can still get to 272 electoral votes. So winning Arizona, Nevada leaves that for her, but also lets just say we turn Pennsylvania red and Wisconsin red, well then Trump still short at 263 because he loses in Nevada and Arizona. And then, of course, there's Georgia and North Carolina. If those go blue as well in the Sun belt that would get Kamala Harris to over 270 electoral votes.

REP. STEVEN HORSFORD (D-NV): Well, thank you for having me on, Erin. Look, I know polls are about margin of error, but this election will be won based on a margin of effort. And Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are putting in a full court effort and all well, the battlegrounds, including my home state of Nevada. And you can feel it here today with the energy and the fact that she's going to talk about a vision for him America, how we bring Americans together by building coalitions, she has a to-do list while Donald Trump has an enemies list. Her to do list includes passing an opportunity economy that will lift up all of Americans, creating economic opportunity to afford to buy a home, to take on corporate gouging, to reduce cost of groceries and childcare and to protect a woman's fundamental right to make decisions about her body.

And her willingness to do that, I think has basically tied them together on the administration front. Without that -- without doing that, they have made this a kind of anti-coalition -- anti-Trump coalition referendum style race. And she is a better vessel than Biden for that, for the points about energy, for the points about I think like being able to get parts of the Democratic base that could not see past age.
