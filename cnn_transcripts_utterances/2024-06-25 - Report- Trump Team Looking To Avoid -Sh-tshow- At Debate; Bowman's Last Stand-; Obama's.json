Tonight, Trump telling \"The Washington Examiner\", quote, I was very aggressive in the first one. The second one, I was different and I got great marks on the second one. And in the final two days before Thursday night's debate, the former president says he is not hunkering down, is not spending hours upon hours preparing, saying it's very hard to prepare. You've got to know this stuff from years of doing it. And I know all the leaders and I know what I know. It's largely based on common sense. I think debating is an attitude more than anything else. That attitude will be put to the test as we are now learning the two podiums will be eight feet apart. Now, eight feet apart, think about that. That's not very far. It is much closer than the last Trump Biden debate during the COVID pandemic when they, when more than 12 feet apart from each other could be the closest they've ever been, maybe at inauguration, it was closer, but it's really close. As for Biden, he is leaving nothing to chance. He is ready to push back and he is engaged in formal, traditional debate prep. Our MJ Lee is reporting the Biden's team believes if and when foreign policy comes up, there is no starker contrast. We even know what one of Biden's comebacks might be when pressed.

And so, we have a little sense of the things that he's interested in talking about, or preparing to talk about. One of them is abortion. Foreign policy is another. Immigration, obviously, another, and trade. So what he does and how we respond to some of these other questions, like its going to be in Georgia.

He was suggesting the DOJ should not appeal, but should have the U.S. attorney in Florida refile the same charges and a new case, hope that it gets assigned to a different judge, not Cannon, a different judge.
