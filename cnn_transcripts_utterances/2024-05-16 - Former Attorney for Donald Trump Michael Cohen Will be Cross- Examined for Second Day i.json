And we're now T minus 90 minutes away from a morning that has the makings of some very fiery fireworks in Donald Trump's criminal trial. What is going to happen today? Round two of Michael Cohens cross-examination will be getting back underway. And sources tell CNN for the first time today, Donald Trump's lawyers will directly go after testimony from Cohen about Trump's alleged falsification of business records. Testimony, the prosecution says, directly implicates Donald Trump across 34 criminal charges.How does the defense challenge Cohen this time? And who will the jury believe? CNN's Brynn Gingras is outside the court for us with all of these details. Brynn, where are they going to go today?",

He has told the entire narrative of what the prosecution said that these charges are against Donald Trump. And we're understanding from sources, our colleagues are hearing that Todd Blanche is really going to be zeroing in on things that Michael Cohen has said in the past, sometimes under oath, and challenging what he has said, trying to again reiterate to jurors that he really just cannot be trusted.We're also understanding that he is going to be bringing up conversations that Michael Cohen has said he had with Donald Trump when it comes to these hush money payments. So that does look like to be what is going to be the focus of today, a little bit less attack dog, a little bit more focused on these charges that are against Donald Trump. Now, as far as timing, we're understanding that Michael Cohen could be on the stand getting cross-examination for the entirety of today. As one source told our colleague Kara Scannell, they said that takes a long time to get through the lies. We're hearing it's possible this could even go into Monday, because tomorrow there is no court because of Barron Trump's graduation that Trump said -- sorry, the judge said that Trump could go to that, so there will be no court tomorrow. So this could go into next week with Michael Cohen on the stand. We're understanding there's going to be about a half-a-dozen or so lawmakers who will be in the courtroom today again, supporting the former president as his former friend turned foe is on the stand. And then from there, we don't know yet. We know that the defense will have its turn. It's unclear who they will call. However, we do know that the defense attorneys are going to be asking a judge about some questions about what could be admissible if they call an expert witness. So that'll be addressed today in court as well. So it's possible we'll see the prosecution maybe rest at the beginning of next week, possibly today, but it's still unclear.",

That was one of the disagreements that he apparently had with the government of Roberts Fico. And they say after the election of Robert Fico last year that he decided right after that election to carry out this assassination attempt. Now there is one more important ripple to all of this, Kate, and that the government is now also saying this is in the form of the interior minister, that this person was not part of some wider network, but rather this was a lone wolf who had these disagreements with the government and so therefore, they don't think that there is a wider group behind all this. Nevertheless, one of the things that we do have to mention that Slovakia, like a couple of other European countries actually as well, they do have pretty deep divisions in their society and they are quite concerned that all of this could make those divisions even worse, and as far as Robert Fico is concerned, you're absolutely right, he is trying to recover here in this hospital in the northern part of Slovakia. They came out earlier today and they said that he was in surgery for around five hours because the wounds that he suffered from being shot point-blank. We of course saw that very troubling video of him being then brought into that car and then later helicopter here to this hospital. The wounds were so complicated that it required two teams of surgeons to come to terms with it.
