      "sentences": "Yes. This is a major change in American policy. And it comes at a critical point in the war in Ukraine as Russian forces massed in the city and around the city of Kursk, as they prepare for an offensive there. And as North Korea has sent thousands of its troops to fight alongside Russia in that conflict.President Biden, making this decision to allow Ukraine to fire the American attack missiles inside Russia for the first time. And this had been the subject of a long-running debate inside the American government about the wisdom of allowing Ukraine this new capability. There were officials who were concerned about the risk of escalation in this war. Thats something that President Biden has been concerned about throughout the conflict. You also heard officials worry about the stockpiles of ATACMS. These are not resources in endless supply. At the end of the day, the addition of the North Korean troops to this conflict certainly has created a new sense of concern in Washington about where this war could be headed. It's a subject of conversation that President Biden has had throughout his trip. This week in South America, he discussed it earlier in Lima, Peru with the leaders of Japan and South Korea. He also discussed it yesterday with the Chinese President Xi Jinping, trying to apply pressure on Beijing to apply pressure on its largest -- or on North Korea, which is China's largest trading partner to try and convince Kim Jong-un that this was a mistake and that it could put his own troops at risk. But now, this decision I think, certainly for American officials, they do hope that it could help turn the tide in this conflict. But also send a signal to countries like North Korea that it sends its troops into this war at their own peril, Fredricka.",

The Ukrainians would perhaps provide a list of targets that they would like to hit, and then they would say, yes, you can use these weapons to hit those targets, or no, you can't hit those targets. One thing that would definitely be off the list would be nuclear installations or anything that would affect the strategic warfighting capability of Russia that would most likely be off the list at this point in time.",

It's also true that the Russians will probably try to respond one way or another. They may not do so in a direct way, one that we would notice right away. It could be a cyberattack. It could be sabotage. Those are the kinds of things that we could expect Russia to do. But we would hope that they would not escalate to, you know, to a point of no return.

And certainly the Ukrainians are very happy that this has finally happened for them. They've been waiting for this kind of approval for a very long time, really, since the start of the latest invasion back in February of 2022. And that is something that they have sought for a long time, because they believe and I think rightly, that the ability to hit targets deep inside Russia is essential for them to be successful in their ability to not only keep Ukraine independent, but also to prosecute obviously, their war effort.",

But of course at the end of the day, the reality is that Donald Trump is coming into office and he has voiced doubts about the reality of climate change. He's named oil and gas executives to his administration in key posts. And he has pledged to pull out of the Paris Climate Accord. So certainly, President Biden does want to highlight what he has done when it comes to combating the climate crisis. But the shadow of Donald Trump is, of course looming very large over those efforts. And that really has been the backdrop to all of the president's events in South America this week. First, at the APEC summit in Peru and coming up this week at the G-20 summit here in Rio de Janeiro. Certainly, foreign leaders are trying to ascertain what exactly another Trump presidency might mean for them. And, you know, when it comes to the war in Ukraine, it does seem as if there could be big changes when it comes to American support. President Trump has voiced deep skepticism about continued American military and financial assistance to Ukraine. He has said that he could end that conflict in one day. He hasn't necessarily said how he would do it. But the implication, of course, is that it would require territorial concessions on the part of the Ukrainians. And so when you take President Biden's decision today to allow Ukraine to fire these long-range U.S. missiles into Russia, you do get the sense that the Biden administration is doing everything it can to try and put Ukraine in a position to win this war, to be in a position at least to win this war in the two months before Donald Trump comes to office with the recognition that changes could be afoot when he comes into office in January, Fredricka.",

President Biden taking advantage of these last 60 days, two months in office to try to either secure or cement measures or commitments that he's hoping might withstand any efforts the Trump administration might make to undo.Are you getting any, I guess intel from the White House that they feel like these latest measures or commitments that they're making are going to be able to withstand any efforts by the incoming administration.",

      "sentences": "Well certainly, they're hopeful that everything that they're doing can be put in a way that's permanent enough, that it can withstand any kind of Trump administration reversals.And it was interesting because this came up yesterday around President Biden's meeting with Xi Jinping of China. Certainly President Biden has advocated for a stable relationship with China, open channels of communication. But Donald Trump of course, is a hawk when it comes to China. He's taken an aggressive approach. He's vowed vast tariffs on Chinese goods, and he has appointed a number of hawks to national security roles in his administration. And it was interesting to listen to Xi at the start of that meeting, saying that China's approach wouldn't change, that it would still continue to try and reach a stable agreement with the United States to try and make sure that this relationship doesn't tip over into conflict. And we did hear from President Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, after that meeting. And he was asked again and again what assurances President Biden could give that this relationship wouldn't turn into a highly contentious relationship going forward. And he was fairly frank. He said that he couldn't actually guarantee that. He said that the incoming administration had not given the White House any assurances at how it plans to approach really any issue when it comes to the global stage. And so I think that is the dynamic that President Biden is dealing with as he's coming to these world summits. Certainly these foreign leaders have their own experiences with Trump in a certain regard. They have dealt with him for four years when he was president. But they do have some questions about how sort of the global dynamics that have shifted since Trump departed will be handled now that he is president again, whether it's Ukraine, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's the climate change in the Amazon. And I think at the end of the day, President Biden doesn't actually have a lot to say to these leaders in terms of assurances. He wants to guarantee that his legacy will be preserved. But obviously, there's no guarantee there either, Fredricka.",

It's at the lowest level ever recorded. According to UNICEF, there are over 400,000 children who are struggling to go to school because in the Amazon, you move around by -- traveling over the rivers. And if the rivers are too low, it's impossible to get access to those schools. So there was that alarm from UNICEF just a couple of weeks ago. And I think picking up from Kevin's point, I think that at this point, the region, South America is firmly divided between two camps. There are those who have been more aligned with the Democrats up in the United States and are trying to use Biden's visit down in the Amazon to raise the alarm about climate change. This is one of the regions, the Amazon, that is at the forefront of the climate change struggle, and Brazil will need to organize a COP30 up in the Amazon region next year. So that's what they want to highlight with Biden's visit, Fredricka.",

But his targeting in this no notice, no warning strike, unlike some of the other strikes that the IDF takes on Beirut on the southern suburbs of Hezbollah's facilities there, the warnings given. There was no warning this time. He had been an important confidant of Hassan Nasrallah. He was a significant figure. He ran Al-Manar TV, which is the TV station that was really you know, putting out every important and every Hezbollah message across the whole of Lebanon.
