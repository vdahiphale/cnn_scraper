Ahead on CNN NEWSROOM.Hurricane Beryl is getting stronger now a category five storm, leaving a trail of destruction as it moves towards Jamaica. U.S. president Joe Biden speaks out against the Supreme Court's ruling on Donald Trump's absolute immunity, warning that it sets a dangerous precedent for those in power. And God's Influencer, a video-gaming Italian teenager, will become the Catholic Church's first millennial saint. Hurricane Beryl has just reached category five strength. It's setting a new record for the strongest Atlantic hurricane to make landfall so early in the season. It's roaring through the Caribbean towards Jamaica with winds moving at 260 kilometers an hour. The U.S. National Hurricane Center says it's expected to bring life-threatening conditions and a storm surge to Jamaica starting Wednesday. Already the storm has made devastating landfall across Windward Islands Monday, knocking out power and destroying homes. Parts of St. Vincent and the Grenadines have no water or power, and at least one person was reportedly killed there. The prime minister of Grenada says the country's second largest island was flattened in half an hour. CNN meteorologist Chad Myers has more.",

That was earlier today.Hurricane warnings now posted for Jamaica. Tropical storm warnings posted for parts of Haiti and the Dominican Republic. Whether it's a near miss or not, there is going to be winds out there that do get to hurricane force. Do get to tropical storm-force. Here's how rare this storm is. The average date of the first major hurricane on record for any new year is September 1st. It's what, July 2nd? We are a full two months ahead because the water is really two months ahead of time. We are going to see wind through the Caribbean. The good news is right here through this stripe, there's nothing except water. But when it gets closer to Jamaica, and really could even get closer to the Yucatan Peninsula. In this water, upper 80s, middle 80s, with waves now being reported by NOAA at 42 feet. There will still be consequences whether you're near that eye or not, especially with the waves, possible surge. There's a lot going on here, and this storm really only started about 48 hours ago or so. And here's where we are right now.",

So all the forecasts for the 2024 seasonal, this '24 hurricane season have tracked to be above average, and this has been since April. We have been issuing this forecast particularly for our forecast, we issued the CSU forecast issued. An extremely active hurricane season, exactly of 23 named storms, 11 becoming hurricanes, and five reaching that major intensity category. But -- and going back to the basics, these storms feed off the ocean water and right now our ocean waters are so warm. So right now, to be exact, and where Hurricane Beryl is tracking in the Caribbean Sea, the waters are one to 1.5 degrees Celsius above average. So the waters right now in the Caribbean Sea are what we usually see on September. So definitely we're ahead of schedule and these storms speed up from the energy of the ocean, and use it as fuel to intensify. So definitely warmer oceans means there's more energy for these storms to intensify and makes it easier for them to gain a higher intensity.",

EDITH WANJIKU KAMAU, SON KILLED IN PROTESTS (through translator): I didn't go that day, because I didn't have childcare. But we always went together and came back, because the protests were peaceful. The first thing I want is justice for Ebrahim (ph) and all the kids who died, because they all had dreams. (GUNSHOTS) MADOWO (voice-over): Protests broke out across Kenya last month against a proposed finance bill, largely driven by young people, organizing on social media. [00:35:04[ But the deadliest day was June 25th, when protesters stormed Parliament in Nairobi. Human rights groups accused police of shooting dozens of unarmed protesters, including some who were fleeing. No one has accepted or denied responsibility for the killings. Our crew filmed shocking scenes like here, left of your screen. A man running away is shot in the back with a tear gas canister at close range. These protesters standing over a man who's apparently dead. Police fire a non-lethal round directly at them. Nairobi's police chief, seen here, commanded the operation. His offices clearly contravening their own rules for the use of force. CNN analyzed the deadliest two hours when most of the protesters are believed to have been killed. Keep an eye on the man in white overalls, waving his arms earlier in the day. Twenty-five-year-old Ericson Chalamatissier (ph) was supposed to be at the butcher shop where he worked, his mother said, but ended up here. CNN's camera captured him dancing until shots rang out. Police advanced towards the protesters. More shots and people run away. Amid the chaos, we spot Ericson (ph) again. He is lifeless on the sidewalk. Around him, other protesters are also on the ground. As the smoke lifts, one man has been shot in the head. People rush to help, but police keep firing at them. A bag is thrown in the air as the smoke grenade goes off. But that protester escaped. We were on the scene as this unfolded.",

We obtained his autopsy report. Ericson (ph) was shot in the back and bled to death. Moments later, another injured protester is carried away. But he is lucky he survived. That protester is 26-year-old Ian Kaya (ph), who was also hit in the back. IAN KAYA (ph), PROTESTOR: I'm in pain because from the government.

An oversight body is investigating police conduct during the protests, but many here don't believe they'll ever see justice. Larry Madowo, CNN, Nairobi. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
