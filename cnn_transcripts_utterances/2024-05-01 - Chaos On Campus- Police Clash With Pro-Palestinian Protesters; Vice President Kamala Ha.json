This is the library mall at the University of Wisconsin Madison and cleared many of these protesters. According to the school, most of the protesters left when that police action began. But as you mentioned, 34 people were arrested. The majority of them were left with no citation. Four people were charged with different types of charges, which include attempted disarming of a police officer, battery of a police officer, charges like that. But even after that clearing, again, this protest has geared right back up. So let me just kind of walk you through this scene.So these orange tents right here, you guys, this is pretty much all that was left. Initially after that police action and then everything else you see all of these other tents, this is all come up since that police action began. As you can see, there are hundreds of students out here. This is a very popular, you know, part of the campus. So basically what you see here are some students, but also some protesters who remain out here. We spoke with one student. She's a junior here at the University of Madison, Wisconsin, Madison. She's a mediator. that she heard that there was a law enforcement action. We talked to her about what she saw and how she feels about this law enforcement action that happened earlier today.

The message at the end of it was that they are going to be back here tomorrow and the day after that and the day after that until those divestment demands that they've been making for weeks now are met. You can see some of the signs that have been left here by those protesters saying no cops on campus, referencing, of course, the NYPD, dozens of officers coming onto campus into Hamilton Hall last night, arresting more than 200 students. And we heard from faculty members and students who were extremely critical of the president of the school for calling in the NYPD, basically saying that there had been peaceful protests, that the school had not been negotiating with the protesters in good faith. And that is what ultimately led to that police action last night.I want to bring you out into the street now where you can see the number of NYPD officers who are here right now because the school has asked them to stay here until May 17th, two days after Columbia graduates. They want to maintain order, but we know that the protesters are saying they are going to come back day after day. I also interviewed just a little while ago one of the protesters who was in that encampment last night who says she was handcuffed by police officers when they arrived on the scene.

And people are so vehemently opposed to the state of Israel and the existence of Israel, which is a very important thing for the identity of me and a lot of other Jewish students. And there's so much against Israel that it is anti-Semitic. And in that sense, anti-Zionism is anti-Semitism. It's one thing to criticize the Israeli government.And Israel, like any other progressive and democratic nation, has its flaws. But we see a lot of people who are not just criticizing the government, but saying that Israel as a whole should not exist.

I'll tell you guys, over the last two weeks, I've been to places like Harvard, Columbia, UCLA, USC. I've seen this firsthand. I've seen the sort of craziness manifesting on these campuses. And look, we need to have, you know, really just fierce hope for the 133 House of the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and hostages still being held in Gaza, and deep compassion for the Palestinian civilians still, you know, in harm's way. And yet, what's happening at this campus is way beyond that. When I was at UCLA on Sunday, I saw the pushing and the shoving. I saw the anti-Israel students locking arms and preventing people from passing. I witnessed it firsthand. I saw one student stepping on and smashing an American flag into the ground. I mean, it was a real reminder that there's a kind of bedlam on these campuses. And look, my heart breaks when I see police using what might appear to be excessive force, but there has to be a restoration of law and order.

So, I don't really understand, and I think the university needs to coordinate effectively with law enforcement.

      "sentences": "That's right, Alex. The Fed just announced it's keeping interest rates unchanged for the sixth meeting in a row. That means no relief for borrowers. Interest rates remain at 23-year highs. Now, this was largely expected. Fed officials, they tipped their hands in recent weeks because of stronger than expected inflation reports, but the Fed did make a significant change to its statement, adding in this line, and I'll read it to you. The Fed officials, they wrote that in recent months there has been a lack of further progress towards the committee's two percent inflation objective.Now, prices, of course, they're not skyrocketing like they were two years ago, but the cost of living does remain a problem. Food and housing, those are the big issues. But then we've also seen price increases for other things, like car insurance and the cost to bring your dog or your cat to the vet. Now, when you think about interest rates, I know that the Fed can sound kind of like a mysterious organization sometimes, but this really does matter to virtually everyone because the fact that interest rates are staying steady means if you're in the market for a mortgage right now, you're not going to be getting any sort of relief there. Mortgage rates are above seven percent, same story if you're trying to get a car and finance. Paying off credit card debt is very challenging right now because interest rates are at record highs. Now, if we look at the market, you can see not a major reaction. Markets are sort of flat from where they were before the Fed announced this. There was one change that I do think is going to get some attention from traders on Wall Street. The Fed announced that it's going to continue to shrink the size of its balance sheet but going to do that at a slower pace. And that could boost markets. Now, in the next 10 minutes or so, we're going to hear from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Two big questions that I think he's got to address: How concerned is he about inflation? And will the Fed still consider cutting interest rates later this year?",
