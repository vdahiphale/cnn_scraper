There were jeers in the crowd when he went on a rant, clearly upset about a question that she asked him. I think, most notably, he also got personal with attacks against Vice President Kamala Harris. And I think one of the big we headlines that's going to come from this is a description of her that he used when he was asked if she was a DEI hire, which is a claim that many of his acolytes on Capitol Hill and elsewhere have made. He said that the vice president used to be Indian and turned black. He said, quote, \"Is she Indian or black?

She's in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where the former president is headed to an event later today. Kristen, shortly before this event started, you are sharing with us that part of the strategy for Trump going to the National Association of Black Journalists was to put the focus back on him. There was a feeling that the vice president sucked up a lot of attention over the last few weeks since President Biden dropped out of the race, and he wanted to recapture the headlines.

Now, the big question is whether or not it did what Donald Trump often sets out to do. We know that Donald Trump sucks up all the oxygen in the room. But lately, he's had a hard time breaking into this media narrative, particularly around the enthusiasm around Kamala Harris. But it is very likely now the focus is going to be on some of these really out- there comments that Donald Trump made. Questioning whether Kamala Harris, the first black vice president, is actually black at a conference of black journalists, attacking the black journalists who asked him questions, going after, question after question, turning the narrative to be more attacks than actually answering questions on policies. Remember that one of Donald Trump's campaign's main agendas in this campaign cycle is to siphon off minority voters, particularly black men and Latino men, to bring them out to the polls. Some of these questions were legitimate questions about why black people, why they should vote for him, given some of the remarks he has said. And instead of answering those questions and using this as an opportunity, he turned this into an attack. Now, I spoke to at least two people close to Donald Trump who said they believed he was, quote, \"doing very well in what was a hostile environment.\" But, of course, Boris, that's exactly what you would expect to hear from the campaign. They're not going to say that it was a train wreck in action. But again, one thing to watch here, does this do what Donald Trump has needed to have happen for the last several weeks, which is take control of the media narrative and put him front and center? Remember, there is a belief among people close to the former president that no publicity is bad publicity. So we'll take a look and see how this actually plays out. But I think it is fair to say that, as that senior advisor said, this went sideways and it went sideways pretty quickly. (CROSSTALK)",
