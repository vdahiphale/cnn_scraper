We're live from the region.Also ahead, could Artificial Intelligence soon be more intelligent than us? Those fears aren't unfounded as a key A.I. pioneer speaks out against the technology he helped create. And New York's Annual Met Gala delivered the glitz, the glamor, and the unexpected felines. The best moments from fashion's biggest night coming up. United Nations is painting a dire picture on the ground in Sudan, a day after warning, the conflict there could turn into a full-blown humanitarian catastrophe. The U.N. says more than 330,000 people have been internally displaced by weeks of fighting between rival military forces, and at least a 100,000 refugees have escaped a neighboring countries. It also says the global aid appeals have fallen $1.5 billion short of what actually is required. Meanwhile, as warring generals talk about peace, the deadly violence ignited by their power struggle appears to be getting even worse. Foreign governments are still racing to evacuate their citizens from Sudan, but that window is closing. CNN's Larry Madowo joins me now live in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. This has really become ground zero for the evacuation.",

      "sentences": "It has become ground zero for the evacuation, mostly because the only safe place that most people can get to in Sudan is Port Sudan. It's still a long journey. Sometimes it can take up to 30 hours to travel that 830 kilometers more than 500 miles.And when they get to Port Sudan, if they're lucky, they can get in a ship across the Red Sea to get to here in Jeddah. The biggest shuttle service operator, so to speak, has been Saudi Royal Navy doing these trips back and forth and bringing in more than 5,000 people so far. But also we saw yesterday, the first U.S. operated naval vessel arrive here at the U.S. and that's Brunswick, and they're likely to be more people still angling to get across the Red Sea, into Saudi Arabia and then out to safety. And even that is still adding need to point out is only the most privileged people. They are dual national, so they're Sudanese and German, Sudanese and British, Sudanese and American, or they're permanent residents in another place, or they have valid visas to go to other places. There are so many Sudanese people who are at Port Sudan who have not been lucky to get on one of these boats. Which is why that number from the U.N. Commission for Refugees is important. A 100,000 people, they estimate have so far led the country into neighboring countries like Egypt and Chad and South Sudan and Eritrea and Ethiopia. And they are projecting that if this continues, as many as 800,000 people might flee Sudan. And this is only two and a half weeks into this conflict. The longer this drug's on, the more people will want to leave because they can't find the most basic necessities, food and water and medicines. Sometimes power and water lines have been bombed. They fear for the safety of their families and their kids, and that's why this all in a race to try and get out. We're expecting another ship from Port Sudan arriving in a few hours here in Saudi Arabia. This is almost a dozen ships so far. And I expect that this will continue, Max, as long as the conflict is still running.",

He was detained in February on suspicion of being a member of a terrorist organization. Palestinian detainees and a military prison in the West Bank have now begun a general hunger strike in protest. The Israel Defense forces also say several rockets were fired from Gaza, landing in open areas,. Hadas Gold is in Jerusalem with the very latest.

      "sentences": "Yes, very familiar for many Palestinians here. Khader Adnan used to be a spokesperson for the militant group, Islamic Jihad, that is mostly based out of Gaza. He had been detained more than 10 times since 2004.And this was not his first hunger strike. He had been on several other hunger strikes in the past, but I do believe this was the longest one at 86 or 87 days. [08:05:06] The Israeli prison authorities announcing this morning that he had been found unconscious in his cell. This morning, they said that he had been refusing medical treatment. But his -- but Khader Adnan's attorney Jamal Kathib told Army Radio that they had been trying to get these Israeli authorities to move Khader Adnan to a civilian medical facilities saying that the prison medical facilities they said were not sufficient. At the time of his death, he had been detained under what's called administrative detention. This is something that's often used by Israeli authorities. This means that he had not yet faced charges or trials. Israeli authorities often used these sorts of detentions they say for security purposes. The reaction, though, has been quite strong from the Palestinians. We saw at least three rockets fired from Gaza towards Israel, most likely by, Islamic Jihad. But the Israeli authorities say that they, landed in open areas that did not cause any damage. There are widespread general strikes, both in the West Bank and Gaza. This means everything from stores and shops to schools are closed as a result. We are also hearing from Khader Adnan's wife, and she actually said she does not want rockets to be fired as a result of her husband's death. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RANDA MUSA, KHADER ADNAN'S WIFE (through translator): Not a drop of blood was spilled during the previous prisoner's hunger strikes, and today we say with the rise of the martyr and his accomplishment of what he wished for, we do not want a drop of blood to be spilled. We do not want someone to respond to his martyrdom. We do not want rockets to be launched and then for Gaza to be struck after. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

There are at least, nearly 5,000 Palestinians in Israeli prisons. About a 1,000 of them, according to the Palestinian Prisoner Society, are being held under similar administrative detention is cutter on, and that means that they have been brought to trial or charge.

First of all, that they are trying to lay the groundwork for that COP 28 summit that's going to happen in the UAE later this year. And that's certainly something where you did feel from Germany, which was the host of the conference that happened here today, that they did feel a sense of urgency in order to do that.And we were able to speak with Annalena Baerbock, the German. Foreign Minister and she said that one of the main things that the German feel is that there needs to be progress made on richer nations, helping poorer nations to be able to deal with the fallout from climate change. That's not even trying to keep the temperatures down or trying to cut carbon emissions. That's helping to deal with the climate change and the impact of climate change that is already going on. Now, one of the things that the German Foreign Minister acknowledged before she started off this major conference is she said, she believes that there has been a lot of talk. There's, obviously, been a lot of papers, memorandums that have been signed, but so far too little progress is being made on trying to cut carbon emissions and on trying to get temperatures to not rise as fast. Here's what she had to say. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ANNALENA BAERBOCK, GERMAN FOREIGN MINISTER (through translator): We all know it's not enough to describe that we're not meeting our targets. We have to say how we want to change course to finally get back on the 1.5 degrees path. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

They don't want the climate to get warmer by more than 1.5 degrees, Max.Now, of course, at this point in time, the German Foreign Minister acknowledged and basically everybody else who was there acknowledged as well the nations of this world are failing to do that. And it was quite interesting because the German Foreign Minister also said that she believes that there needs to be a commitment at the upcoming COP 28 at the end of this year for targets on renewable energy. To make sure that renewable energy happened in more places around the world, that more countries are outfitted to be able to take advantage of renewable energy, for instance, sun, for instance, wind, but others as well. And she believes that concrete targets need to be set out and there need to be benchmarks as well. So that's one of the reasons why this meeting today was so very important. And as you said, in effect, what they're doing is they're laying the agenda, laying the groundwork for COP 28, where certainly the UAE has said they want to see real progress being made, Max.",
