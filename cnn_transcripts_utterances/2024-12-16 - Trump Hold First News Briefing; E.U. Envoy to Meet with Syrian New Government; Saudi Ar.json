The suspect is believed, as we understand at this hour, to be a student, and it happened at the Abundant Life Christian School. The White House says U.S. President Joe Biden has been briefed.

It seems as if this is an ongoing problem in Americanculture, and we've yet to effectively neutralize the aspect of gun violence in our schools. One of the things that we look to in a situation like this, is what are the teachable moments for law enforcement to assist in interdicting instances of this magnitude? We go back to the '90s. We had the Columbine shooting, whereas responding officers were not responsible for going in and interdicting the shooter. There was a reliance upon special operations officers such as SWAT officers to come in and engage the shooter. We've since moved away from that. However, when we look to the Uvalde, Texas, shooting that happened last year, we clearly saw a manifestation of problems as it related to the officers not going in and interceding and interdicting the shooter. So, we look at this particular instance, I believe we have five dead and five wounded. The five dead consist of one of those people as the shooter. So, it appears as if this was a self-inflicted wound, and therefore we're going to have to start a backwards investigation. And that backwards investigation is going to start from the moment of the shooting, and we're going to take it back as far as possible, whereas we're going to look to the actual social media. We're even going to use one of our greatest resources, which is unfortunately, the children that attend that school. Because bear in mind, here in the United States, kids often times go through these lockdown drills, but the shooter as well goes through the same lockdown drills as well as the other students. So, the shooter would have a fundamental understanding in how these lockdown drills are conducted. And so, we're going to look to what could have possibly done to interdict this at an earlier stage?",

So, you're talking about, you know, four and five-year-olds and 18-year- olds. So, that needs to happen first, and then the harder part of family unification is of course, family notification. If any of the other deceased are children, the parents will need to be notified, and of course, the teacher and his or her family. So, that's just primary right now, and that's probably why they're going to push the press conference until all of that can be done. Because this is likely a confined incident in terms of the crime -- we believe the shooter went to the school, clearly, targeted the school, the rest of the community is going to feel safer, not safe certainly. This is jarring, but there is going to be, you know, ripple effects throughout the community. This is a -- this is also a Christian school. So, the impact, you know, the week of Christmas or the week before Christmas, the religious impact, all have to be accounted for as well in this community. And then, finally, then you get to motive. And all of these cases, I can't think of one where we never had a -- had a warning before. Whether it's other students growing concerned with the killer, other teachers or the family. We'll learn a narrative in the next 24 to 48 hours. In the United States, there is a growing cause of action against parents who might have known or even worse, facilitated it by giving them access to guns or not securing guns that will be part of this investigation. Should the parents had a reasonable belief that the child was a danger to others? And that will all come out in the -- in the days ahead.",

We just through a quick check of their website, it's a very small Christian school. A few hundred students, about 55 staff members. This is a massive campus, about a 28-acre campus. But when police arrived, they said they did not fire their weapons. No guns were shot because the shooter they discovered, had already died from a self-inflicted gunshot injury, and then police were able to go immediately to those victims who were suffering from injuries, give them life-saving help and then get them into ambulances and to local hospitals.

So, those people who were training rushed over to help, and they were doing what they just learned in real time, which is just a sad tragedy and kind of the state of the United States. This is the second school shooting at a small Christian school in just weeks. There was one in northern California a few weeks ago where a five and a six-year-old student were shot.

Do you think that triggering this early election can enable Scholz to revive his political fortunes? JAN PHILIPP BURGARD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, WELT TV:  No, I don't think so. If you look at the polls -- and he's one of the most unpopular chancellors in the history of Germany. I would say today marks the beginning of the end of one of the worst chancellors in the history of the federal Republic of Germany. During Olaf Scholz's chancellorship, the German economy has slipped into recession. German industry is moving abroad, and the migration crisis had not been resolved. So, Scholz has not succeeded in creating political stability. He was neither a leader nor a mediator, and the traffic light coalition was characterized by never-ending disputes.

The high winds, even damaged, you can see there, cemeteries, toppling gravestones, and people are saying their island looks like it was hit by an atomic bomb. France's help is underway. Our Larry Madowo has the very latest for you. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) LARRY MADOWO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Catastrophic. That's how residents of Mayotte are describing the damage from Cyclone Chido, the worst to hit the French archipelago in nearly a century. The Category 4 storm killed at least 14 people as it tore through the Indian Ocean over the weekend. But government officials fear hundreds or even thousands could be dead according to the \"Associated Press\". Torrential rain and winds of more than 220 kilometers per hour wiped out entire neighborhoods, knocked out electrical grids and the water supply, leaving Mayotte almost entirely offline for over 36 hours, according to the website NetBlocks.

And he called the media corrupt, and said, quote, \"we have to straighten out the press\". Trump also said he's a big believer -- also, his words, as you can imagine in the polio vaccine, when he was asked about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., his pick for Health Secretary and a fervent vaccine critic.

And he wasn't a big fan of that. But then he did talk about the polio vaccines. That wasn't the specific question that was brought to him, but he said that he knew people in the past who particularly had polio and that once they had those vaccines that they -- you know, the problem was not -- no longer that widespread in this country. But I think the reason that the vaccine answer is so critical is because it comes really as RFK Jr. is kicking off meetings starting today with key senators on Capitol Hill. And one of the big questions and a lot of the skepticism I know around RFK Jr. and his nomination is around his views on vaccines and whether or not he believes that, you know, vaccines are as effective as past medical experts and others have said that they were. So, that was a key thing. I think one also very interesting moment that Donald Trump brought up is that he said, and he reiterated this earlier -- or actually last month in an interview with Time Magazine, that he believes that RFK Jr. should be able to look into and study whether there is a correlation between rising cases of autism in the United States and vaccines. And I do want to be clear. Every study that has been done has been debunked repeatedly on the idea that vaccines are leading to a spike in autism. However, Donald Trump said that he believes that that needs to be studied. I think overall, though, just to take a step back, you know, what Donald Trump will allow RFK Jr. to do in the role as HHS secretary, the leader of the Health and Human Services Department, and what he will do with vaccines is a big question for many people, and again, one -- going to be one of the biggest questions that senators face as they weigh whether to confirm him. Donald Trump has said that he has an openness to allow RFK Jr, again, to look into these things. But he also argued today during that press conference, that he believes RFK Jr. is going to be far less radical in those beliefs than he has been before. So, that's definitely something to keep an eye on. And I do want to address as well, Isa, what you touched on, which is as, you know, Donald Trump's comments as it relates to the war between Russia and Ukraine. A big moment when he said -- was when he said that he actually thinks that war, not the war in the Middle East, is going to be the one that is more difficult to end. We know that Donald Trump in the past has vowed to end the war between Russia and Ukraine on his first day in office. He has yet to offer any sort of specifics or details for how he would do that. But his stance, particularly the one, you know, his anger toward allowing U.S.-made missiles to be launched deeper into Russia is something to be keeping an eye on. He's has said repeatedly that he wants to meet directly with Putin, whether that's via in a phone call or in person is very much unclear, but he believes that he will be able to usher in a quicker end to that war than the Biden administration has been so far.

And it was his conclusion that, at this point, there's still those lingering questions that remain. Is it that the government does not know where these are coming from, or they do and they just simply do not want to share? And so, that's certainly concerning here.
