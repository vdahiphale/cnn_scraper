      "sentences": "Welcome to \"The Lead.\" I'm Jake Tapper. This hour we're going to start with major breaking news when it comes to Donald Trump's legal challenges. Mr. Trump has just asked the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue of presidential immunity, whether he is immune from facing charges for any alleged crimes he committed while he was president.Mr. Trump wants the justices to temporarily block a scathing decision handed down by the D.C. Circuit Court last week. One that flatly rejected his claims of immunity in the federal election subversion case. One that differentiated between President Trump and citizen Trump. Let's get straight to CNN Chief Legal Affairs correspondent Paula Reid. Paula, tell us what's going on.",

      "sentences": "Well, as you just laid it out, Jake, he is asking the Supreme Court to pause that appeals court ruling that found that he did not have immunity that would block him from being prosecuted at the federal level by Special Counsel Jack Smith on charges related to election subversion.Now, if you talk to sources in and around the Trump legal team or legal experts, they all agree this is not one of his stronger arguments. They don't expect that ultimately, he will prevail, be granted immunity and be shielded from this prosecution. So, the Trump strategy, as much as it is about defending their clients' rights, they're also just trying to delay this trial, the federal election subversion trial until after the November 2024 election. And they're using every possible option available to them and trying to exercise each one mostly to just delay push this back as long as they can. So today they're asking the Supreme Court to pause that lower court ruling. They also intend to file a full appeal to the Supreme Court. Now, they also might also go back down to the appeals court and ask the full court to hear this decision. Last week, that scathing unanimous opinion you referenced, that was by three judges. But he technically has the option to ask a full panel of the D.C. Circuit Court to hear this as well. Again, there isn't an expectation that he would prevail, but it could be an option to delay this a little bit longer. So now all eyes are on the Supreme Court, not even so much for what they're going to do, but how long it takes them to do it, because every day, every week that passes, that gets closer and closer to the election and makes it harder for the Special Counsel Jack Smith to bring this case. Now the Supreme Court also in a unique position right now, they are having to contemplate two big cases related to former President Trump, either one of which could have an enormous impact on the election. Of course, last week they heard oral arguments from Trump's lawyers and a lawyer for voters in Colorado about whether Trump should appear on the ballot. And now they're also looking at this question of presidential immunity. And it's not so much about immunity as it is about timing, how long it takes them to give them a final answer and exactly what they're gonna do here, because that would then give Jack Smith and former president Trump clarity on whether or not this case can even go before November.",

      "sentences": "So, Jake, there's a lot of procedure happening here, but the real-world impact is this is almost certainly going to dictate whether Donald Trump faces trial on Jack Smith's election case before or after the 2024 election. Now, what Donald Trump's team has just asked the Supreme Court to do is issue a stay, which is essentially a pause, saying everything should be put on pause so we can pursue our full appellate rights in the Court of Appeals and then the Supreme Court.That would ordinarily take many, many months. And so, the question is really, first of all, will the Supreme Court issue that stay, that pause? I think they will, at least for a limited time, so they can decide this question. But the bigger question is will the Supreme Court ultimately take this case? If they do not take the case, it's going to go back down to the district court and I think we're very likely looking at a trial this summer. But if they do take this case and they set it on something close to a normal schedule, I think in all likelihood that would push the timeline here out until after the 2024 election. So that's how big the stakes are with this motion.",

They are currently considering this question of ballot eligibility. Oral arguments went very well for Trump's lawyers last week. It is widely expected that he will win on that case, but again like I said even sources close to the former president acknowledged that the immunity case is not as strong.Many of them don't expect the Supreme Court to take it up and even if they did, they don't expect him to win. So, watching closely to see if especially mindful of the optics, the Supreme Court under a lot of scrutiny for questions about partisanship, if they try to release these decisions close to one another, maybe a win and a loss for Trump.",

So, in an ordinary criminal prosecution, prosecutors have an obligation to turn over their evidence, their documents, their witness statements as early as possible. Certainly, they would be doing that by now in the Mar-a-Lago case. But the complication is that case involves all sorts of classified documents. And there's a special set of laws that apply in a scenario like this because typically the government, the prosecutors here, want to limit the types of classified information that they're turning over to the defendant, in this case Donald Trump.And so that's what today's sort of all-day long negotiating session was about. How exactly are prosecutors going to turn this information over to Trump? How much of the classified information does he get to receive in the course of what we call discovery? And that inherently slows things down. So, this case is currently set for trial in late May, but I think it's very likely that this complication will push that date out quite a bit.",

One of the things that you saw in the court documents when the former president was charged, Jake, you saw documents being held in a bathroom, in ballrooms, places where the public could go. So that's one of the issues that certainly led to the charges that you saw, the mishandling charges that the former president faces.And of course, you have to remember that this case goes beyond the documents, it goes into the obstruction. The former president is accused of not only refusing to turn over documents after receiving a subpoena, but also basically telling people some of his co-defendants to lie to the FBI. So that's what the charge of the former president faces.

And now Sandberg is bringing more attention to the issue in a new documentary film she's been filming in Israel. She's sharing a clip from her interview with one of the freed hostages, 18-year-old Agam Goldstein-Almog, exclusively with \"The Lead\" right now.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) AGAM GOLDSTEIN-ALMOG, FREED HOSTAGE (voice-over): Every time we talked about it, at least one of the people said that they had suffered sexual and physical abuse, about half of them. And I haven't talked to all of the girls who are there. They all talked about their kidnapping. Where she was kidnapped from, what they did to her, what she saw. Each was kidnapped from a different place. That's when we learned that some of them were held alone. They said that no one was being held alone, only in pairs. Girls are not alone.

And so, this documentary is giving people a chance to bear witness to hear directly from people who were there, saw things, heard things, first responders who saw the bodies.

I mean, a Hamas spokesperson has come out and said, rape is against our religion, it didn't happen. But not only did it happen, it happened to systematically. The definition of a war crime, crimes against humanity are things that are premeditated that happened at multiple locations. Almost every location where the terrorists were, the bodies that were discovered, and we have all of this from first responders, people who saw it in this documentary, I've walked through the fields where these bodies were found, they're naked and they're bloody. And there's no other explanation for that bet that, you know, this is a lot of people. This is women and men. And this was systematic. It was not just in one place. And if you're trying to terrorize people, if you're trying to inflict trauma on individuals, but also on a country, sexual violence, unfortunately is a tactic that is very effective. It has been used throughout the generations and it cannot be used in any situation.

Nepalis, like Ramchandra, who escaped the Russian army with his life, and praying for his comrades still fighting on the frontlines. He took a bullet and shrapnel in Ukraine, he told me. And so many Nepalis killed. Some complained they were sent forward, while Russian troops held back he tells me, but the main problem was the language barrier. Sometimes you couldn't even understand where you're supposed to be going, he says, which way to point your gun. But that chaos hasn't stopped Nepalis signing up. Many posting upbeat videos on social media of their military training in Russia, where they're meant to be prepared for the hardships of the Ukraine war is in use. In reality, several former Nepali recruits tell CNN, they were sent into battle, after barely two weeks to fight for the Kremlin armed with a rifle and a contract for a few $1,000, a month of fortune in Nepal, where unemployment is high.",

We've actually come to one of them now on the outskirts of Kathmandu to meet a woman who in the past few days has learned that her husband has been killed fighting in that distant war.Hello. Hi. Namaste, namaste. CHANCE (voice-over): He was with a unit of Nepalis battling Ukrainians, she tells me, when he was gunned down. It was my husband's friend, his Nepali commander in Ukraine, who called me in the middle of the night and told me he'd been killed, she tells me, still shocked at the news. There's been no notification from the Russians, she adds, nothing. It's a growing frustration with Russia's treatment of Nepalis as cannon fodder in the Ukraine war, shared with these protesters near the Russian Embassy in Kathmandu.",
