The U.S. president wraps up a rough week after working hard to convince Democrats he's fit to run for the presidency again. Voters are heading to the polls in France for the first round of parliamentary elections. We are looking at live pictures. And the first named hurricane of the Atlantic season roars towards the Caribbean. Why Beryl is expected to keep getting stronger? U.S. President Joe Biden is spending the rest of his weekend at Camp David with his family. The gathering comes after his terrible debate performance this week. And a number of Democrats saying he should drop out of the presidential race. The White House insists that this was a long planned family event, but those family members, more so than his closest political advisers hold significant influence over decisions regarding the president's political future. And the topic of the debate is expected to come up. Well, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris spent part of Saturday trying to reassure the donors and voters that he is still the best presidential candidate for the Democratic Party. At a fundraiser Saturday, Mr. Biden said he will fight harder despite new calls for him to exit the presidential race. CNN senior political analyst, Ron Brownstein, says whether Biden stays in the race or quits, the Democrats have a problem. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RON BROWNSTEIN, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: I think Democrats are in a conundrum. I mean, no one can deny what they saw which is that Joe Biden did not look capable of being president for four more years. And it was probably the weakest debate performance of any major party nominee in the history of the modern debates dating back to 1960. And so there is, I think, enormous anxiety in the Democratic Party about simply sailing forward as if nothing had happened. Biden went into this election -- into this debate with two-thirds, the three quarters of Americans pulsing. And I think he's too old for the job now much less for four more years. And, you know, it is very hard -- you know, you never get a second chance to make a first impression as your mother told you. And I think it is going to be difficult to erase the image of him struggling to complete a sentence, the kind of vacant look, the disoriented look, you know, the inability to really make a sustained argument in any way against Donald Trump.

At each of those events, he acknowledged his poor debate performance but try to assure donors that his candidacy remains on track. It comes as Biden's advisors have fielded phone calls from anxious Democrats and donors concerned about the state of the race and what it could mean to keep Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket after that debate performance. Sources tell CNN that Democrats are conducting polling and research over the weekend and early into next week to try to gauge the exact impact that debate will have on this reelection bid. They said they're not just looking at Biden's reelection bid but also how House and Senate Democrats, who are in competitive races, could be affected as well. Now, the Biden campaign, so far, has doubled down on the fact that President Biden is remaining in the 2024 race. They say that he intends to debate Donald Trump in September. And a memo from the Biden campaign's chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, said that they believe that this will be a very close race, but do believe that their team will put in the work to help Joe Biden beat Donald Trump in November. Now, President Biden is going to spend Saturday at Camp David with the First Lady and other members of their family, all at a time when many questions are swirling about what could come next for Biden in this campaign.

And I should say that even on Saturday alone, when we got these reports about the U.S. trying to change the wording to bridge the gaps between Israel and Hamas, we heard from a Hamas spokesman in Beirut saying that the proposal that was outlined by the Biden administration, by the president himself, still falls short of its main demands, which are for a complete cessation of hostilities and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces at the outset of any ceasefire. Israel, for its part, although it says, and even Prime Minister Netanyahu, has said that it agrees and that it's in accordance with the wording of the U.S. proposal, its perspective is that any ceasefire deal doesn't prevent it from continuing to fight Hamas after the initial six-week ceasefire in order to complete two of its main war objectives, namely to destroy Hamas' military and governance capabilities. And so when you have Israel effectively saying that it must be able to finish a job with Hamas to destroy it militarily and politically, and Hamas effectively saying that it doesn't want to do any deal that results in that situation where it is no longer in control, then you do have these gaps which would seem to be unbridgeable and have thus far been unbridgeable. But certainly, the United States is still trying. It is also putting pressure on the mediators, the Egyptians and the countries to put pressure on Hamas to come to the table and to do a deal. But thus far, the two sides still seem poles apart. And we've still seen those protests taking place in Tel Aviv and across cities in Israel putting pressure on their own government to do a deal with Hamas. But, of course, it takes two to do a deal, and that deal a month after President Biden's announcement still seems some way off, Anna.",

And the average date of the first hurricane isn't usually until August 11th. So Beryl is really kind of in very rare territory here. And one of the main reasons for that is how warm these sea surface temperatures are. On average, the location of Beryl is running about three to five degrees above average.

This far east of the Winward Islands, early into the season, say, for example, June, is not very common. So it's not just that it's strengthened very quickly, but also the location in which it formed make this a very uncommon storm.

With his centrist coalition lacking a majority and already struggling to get laws from Parliament, observers say a no-confidence vote moved.Voting happens over two rounds, with the French electorate heading to the ballot boxes to send 577 MPs to the National Assembly. (CHANTING) Macron's announcement sent parties and politicians scrambling to form coalitions. His biggest threat, France's far-right national rally. Seen as Russia- friendly and skeptical of the E.U., the party is led by Marine Le Pen's acolyte, 28-year-old Jordin Bardella. (CHANTING) He's a strong contender for France's next prime minister, a role that the president appoints from the party that wins the majority. Other challenges include the new popular front, a new coalition of socialist, communist, greens and the far left who want to officially recognize the state of Palestine. And this man, current Prime Minister, Gabriel Attal, who's only been in the job five months, now back on the campaign trail for some peddling a message of economic stability. Whoever France's new prime minister is, they will stand shoulder to shoulder with Macron on the world stage in less than a month's time as Paris hosts the Olympic Games. This political uncertainty has spilled onto the streets, a quarter of a million people marched throughout France in recent weeks to oppose the national rally. Emmanuel Macron's political gamble in dissolving the Parliament puts his legacy in serious jeopardy. His last years in office could be plagued by political uncertainty or worse. He could be remembered as the French president who paved the way to the far-right. Saskya Vandoorne, CNN, Paris. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
