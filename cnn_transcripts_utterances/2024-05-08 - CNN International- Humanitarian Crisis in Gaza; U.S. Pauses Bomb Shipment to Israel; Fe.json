It's Wednesday, May the 8th, 9 a.m. here in London, 11 a.m. in Gaza, where Israeli authorities say a key border crossing is now open for humanitarian aid.The Kerem Shalom crossing was closed on Sunday after a rocket attack killed four Israeli soldiers. A government statement says trucks are already arriving at the crossing and will be allowed into Gaza after inspection. Meanwhile, Israel's military offensive on Rafah in southern Gaza is now into its second day, despite weeks of very public opposition from Washington. And one U.S. official tells CNN the White House paused a shipment of 2,000-pound and 500-pound bombs to Israel last week over concerns about civilian casualties in Rafah. The Rafah incursion has killed at least 27 people since it started late on Monday, including six women and nine children. An IDF spokesperson says approximately 20 terrorists have been killed so far. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Galant visited an artillery battery at the Israel-Gaza border near Rafah on Tuesday, where he outlined the IDF's mission. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YOAV GALLANT, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): This operation will continue until we eliminate Hamas in the Rafah area and the entire Gaza Strip, or until the first hostage returns. We are willing to make compromises in order to bring back the hostages, but if that option is removed, we will go on and deepen the operation. This will happen all over the Strip, in the south, in the center, and in the north. We know that Hamas only responds to force. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But what is clear is the United States has warned Israel time and again. Not only the United States, but the Europeans and others have told them that this operation, if it goes ahead in the Rafah area where more than 1.4 million people have taken refuge, could result in massive civilian casualties. So the United States, as a result of Israel actually starting this operation -- although I stress we still don't know to the extent this is a limited or major operation -- the United States has paused the delivery of 1,800 2,000-pound bombs and 1,700 500-pound bombs. Now, CNN has done an analysis of satellite imagery, which has shown that 500 craters would indicate that those 2,000 bombs have been used that many times, at least in Gaza. And one analyst told CNN that the intensity of Israel's use of this weaponry in the first month of the Gaza war has not been seen since the Vietnam War -- Max.",

The classified documents trial, originally scheduled to begin this month, was indefinitely postponed by a federal judge appointed by Trump. He's charged with mishandling national defense information after the FBI seized boxes from his Mar-a-Lago estate nearly two years ago. Judge Aileen Cannon cited issues around classified evidence, saying they need to be worked out before a jury is chosen. She said the process will take until at least late July. Adding in a statement that finalizing a trial date at this point would be, quote, imprudent and inconsistent. The judge's decision is considered a major victory for Trump, who's eager to delay all of his trials as long as possible. If he's elected president in November, he could theoretically have the Justice Department make all these charges against him disappear. One of Trump's lawyers from his time at the White House blasted the order to postpone the classified documents case and suggested Judge Cannon is both biased and incompetent. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

The largest private energy company in Ukraine, saying that this was an extremely difficult night. It says three of its thermal power plants were hit. And this was the fifth time its facilities have been damaged in these massive missile and drone attacks in the last one and a half months. So you can see that this is stepping up. President Putin has previously claimed that this is in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian energy facilities, which we have seen using Ukrainian drones deep into Russian territory. But obviously, this has been going on long before that. And, of course, today is also when Ukraine marks Victory Day, victory in Europe. It has distanced itself from Russia's celebrations, which are happening tomorrow on May 9th.

There are two colonels, which is a very high rank, who have now been charged with treason. One of them, which also charged, was preparing a terror attack. So that is one thing. I think on the one hand, Ukraine says it's foiled it. That shows the weakness of the enemy. But on the other hand, it is concerning that they were able to infiltrate so close to the president.

In the south, storms are expected to ramp up in the afternoon and produce strong tornadoes, giant hail and damaging winds. Now, parts of Missouri, Tennessee and Oklahoma are grappling with the aftermath of tornadoes. At least one person was killed and several injured when a powerful storm tore through Oklahoma on Monday. Officials say dozens of homes were badly damaged in two cities, and rescuers are searching for one or two people still unaccounted for. The state was under a rare level five tornado risk watch on Monday for the first time in nearly five years. Several tornadoes hit Michigan late on Tuesday, injuring at least a dozen people. Rescuers are still looking for more possible victims. A mobile home park and a FedEx facility both sustained major damage.

They're specifically asking about Pentagon reports into the ISIS suicide blast outside the Kabul airport in 2021, the Abbey Gate attack that killed 13 U.S. service members and 170 Afghans. They're asking why the Pentagon's reports contradict CNN video that reveals there was much more gunfire than the Pentagon ever admitted.The parents of seven U.S. Marines who died in the incident have accused the Pentagon of misleading them. CNN's Nick Paton Walsh has been covering this closely, and here's some of his earlier reporting. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK PATON WALSH, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Two Pentagon investigations have insisted everyone was killed by the bomb and dismissed dozens of Afghans' accounts to CNN two years ago that Afghan civilians were shot in the chaotic aftermath. GEN. KENNETH F. MCKENZIE, THEN-COMMANDER, U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND: No definitive proof that anyone was ever hit or killed by gunfire. WALSH (voice-over): But this new video, which begins outside the airport's Abbey Gate entrance, reveals much more shooting after the blast than the Pentagon said. Combined with new accounts to CNN of Marines opening fire and gunshot injuries in Afghan civilians, it challenges the rigor and reliability of the two Pentagon investigations that declared no Afghan civilians were shot dead in the chaotic aftermath.

The Pentagon have said to me that they will respond directly to the congressmen.But there's a lot of questions that still have to be answered here, because ultimately the version of events the Pentagon have put out suggest that nobody was hit by gunfire at all, that it was limited and controlled and only three bursts. And there've been Marines who've said to them during their inquiries that they opened fire or were targeted by gunfire or they heard gunfire. As I said earlier, two years ago we spoke to 19 Afghans who were either shot or saw people get shot. And again, the theory that the Pentagon have always pushed is there were no other gunmen in the area firing apart from American or British troops. So who did the shooting here? No one we've spoken to in the Afghan side saw Taliban or ISIS gunmen as part of what people thought might be a complex attack. There's been limited and I think not entirely solid reporting from some Marines. There may have been an ISIS gunman who fired once there. The Pentagon have discounted that. And so we're left with this strange moment where the Pentagon are just so insistent that gunfire killed nobody at all and don't want to address a lot of the evidence that points to a different direction about that, leading I think many people to question why. Why are they so insistent that couldn't possibly have happened when the congressmen in this letter point out quite clearly that it's not really clear whether the Pentagon even managed to assess quite what the gunfire after that aftermath was, particularly how that is such discrepancy to our video.",
