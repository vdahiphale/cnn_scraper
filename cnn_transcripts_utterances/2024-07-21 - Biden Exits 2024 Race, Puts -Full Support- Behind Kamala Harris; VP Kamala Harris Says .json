I mean, period, full stop. When we talk about the possibility of it happening, people were tripping over themselves to tell you the world about what was going on behind closed doors, weren't they?And it wasn't clear whether Democrats wouldn't take yes or no for an answer from Biden. But tonight, it's official. President Joe Biden bowing out of the 2024 race, but he didn't stop there with that announcement or leave any room to wonder whether he truly believed in his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris. He immediately gave a ringing endorsement of her to replace him, saying, quote, \"Democrats, it's time to come together and beat Trump. Let's do this.\" And do this, the donors did. The floodgates opening tonight with all the fundraisers. Democrats raising, get this, more than $46 million and counting in small dollar donations in just the hours since the announcement. I'm going to get right to CNN Correspondent Priscilla Alvarez. She's been in Rehoboth with the President of the United States. Priscilla, what more are you learning about the President's decision and how all of this unfolded today?",

      "sentences": "Laura, it has been a remarkable day that has now shaken the 2024 presidential election. The President, up until this weekend, was defiant that he was staying in the presidential race, including his top brass taking to the airwaves today to say he wasn't going anywhere.But as the President was self-isolating in his Delaware residence after his positive COVID diagnosis, he was also reflecting. We're now learning that on Saturday evening, he summoned his top advisers to his Rehoboth Beach home where they huddled and they assessed the polling and what Democratic lawmakers had been saying over the last several weeks as they were calling for him to step aside. And it was during those moments that the President began to come to the decision that he was going to drop out of the presidential race, then came today. And the President deciding to tell a wider team, the senior White House and campaign team that he had indeed come to that decision that he was going to drop out of the race. He told them a minute before posting that letter publicly that he was no longer going to seek re-election. So this really was a remarkable moment and one that came together quite quickly after what has been weeks of the campaign trying to face these headwinds from Democratic lawmakers, allies, donors, who said the President just wasn't up to the task to go up against former President Donald Trump. Now, of course, after the President released that letter, he also said that he was going to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris and urge the Democratic Party to come together and support her. Now, sources also tell me that the Vice President did not learn about the President's decision until today. And over the course of the day, they spoke multiple times. The Vice President then having to work the phones herself. She has been calling members of Congress, civil rights leaders, as well as governors to try to get their endorsements. One of those endorsements being from Congressional Hispanic Caucus. I'm told she called the chair saying that she wanted to earn the nomination and have their support. And that is indeed what she got today. Now, the first time we're going to see the Vice President since this announcement will be tomorrow when she celebrates the NCAA Championships at the White House. The President is still self-isolating. The White House doctor says he's doing better but he is still behind closed doors here in Delaware.",

A full panel because a really, really big moment. Evan, let me go to you first because, you know, we've heard a lot about what may have gone into this decision. Certainly, President Biden is not immune to the conversations. He knows what's been going on. We're told he'd been huddling with his two closest advisers early as yesterday, and they showed him that there was no path to victory.

But the reality was when he was faced with the cold, hard facts of his political path from the two people who he truly does trust with his political life, Mike Donilon and Steve Ricchetti. It was inescapable. And -- but I can tell you that really, even today when he was breaking the news on a Zoom call with members of the White House staff, it was stunning for some people. For some, it was felt like a bitter defeat for others. It felt like a relief. And I think for everybody, it felt like the next phase has already begun.",

As somebody said to me who was on the call, you could see that he has been wrestling with this. After all, he's been down with COVID. It's the comedy. It is really a rare moment, Laura. It's one of those rare moments in American politics that comes around only occasionally when you see somebody do the big hard thing, which is putting themselves ultimately behind the country and the party. And I think at a time when it's pretty dispiriting in American politics, that's something to take note of, even as we begin to think about the political calculations.",

And so now, for example, you're going to have Kamala Harris who believes that women should have the right to do with their bodies as they please between a decision of their doctor, whoever they pray to in their family, whereas Donald Trump is somebody who put three justices on the Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade.You're going to be able to talk about Project 2025 in the fact that Kamala Harris is running against now, who is the oldest person to ever seek the office of president of the United States. And so, you know, Donald Trump is a vessel for white grievance. And he looks in the past often. Joe Biden actually had a nostalgia for the past. And so he oftentimes looked in the past too. Now you have a campaign and you have Kamala Harris who I'm echoing to anyone who will listen, you don't really have to mention Donald Trump's name that often because we can see the contrast. But you have to be able to articulate a vision for the future. And I think she'll be able to do that clearly. And their first ad, Trump's first ad tonight was about what did she know? When did she know? What about yesterday and Joe Biden? It wasn't even about a future under Donald Trump. We have to focus and tell people what America will look like under Kamala Harris. And then she has to get outside of D.C., something she's been doing, and she has to go to these suburbs, these excerpts and someplace that Democrats don't like to go, which bothers me.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [23:28:11] COATES: Well, you know, since Biden's decision not to seek re- election, we're talking hours ago at this point, there has been a significant push for Democrats to rally around Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's nominee. But the big question everyone's asking in the days to come is, will the Democrats fall in line behind her? Well Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California joins us now. Congresswoman, thank you so much for joining us this evening. I am dying to know what you make of President Joe Biden's decision not to seek re-election any longer. REP. BARBARA LEE (D), CALIFORNIA: Well, thanks so much for having me this evening. First of all, I think, you know, President Biden put country over self. And I think it's -- we need to take a moment today, especially to thank him, owe him a debt of gratitude for what he has done in throughout his life as the 30, 40, 50-year public servant in the elected office, but also as president and vice president. I mean, he is a transformational president. Not everyone agreed with everything he did, but I could tell you one thing, life is much better for so many people. I mean, just think $35 capping insulin, 15 million jobs, the largest and boldest climate policy ever. And he focused on racial equity and economic equity and justice, reproductive freedom. I mean, there was so many initiatives and the policies that he championed that may or may not have been popular. But I can tell you one thing, he worked for the people. And we really need to take this moment and say, thank you, Mr. President, we owe you a debt of gratitude.",
