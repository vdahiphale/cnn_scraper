The New York Times is reporting that the District Attorney's office here in Manhattan is signaling Trump will likely face criminal charges over hush money payments to the adult film actress Stormy Daniels. But this is not a slam dunk. The case could pose a big challenge for prosecutors. The Times reports the former President was told that he could appear before a Manhattan grand jury next week if he wishes to testify, a strong indication that an indictment could soon follow. Trump has repeatedly denied having an affair with Stormy Daniels, and he denies telling his longtime fixer, Michael Cohen, to buy her silence for $130,000 right before the presidential election. But Cohen insists that he has the receipts, personal checks signed by the former president to reimburse him. Our Senior Legal Affairs Correspondent is Paula Reid. He's following the story for us this morning in Washington. Good morning to you. The DA is giving Trump the chance to testify. Do you think he'll take it?",

That is something that's not expected to happen until at least the end of the legislature session in Florida. But Ron DeSantis is already polling in the top tier, second so far, only in several of them, to former President Trump. CNN's Jeff Zeleny is live in Des Moines, Iowa this morning. Jeff, I know you've been speaking with a bunch of voters on the ground and this has kind of been the question right now. Is these former Trump voters, do they still want to stay with Trump? Do they like DeSantis? What are you hearing from them? JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Well, good morning, Kaitlan. That is exactly the sort of the issue, the dilemma that many Republicans here in Iowa have. We've been talking to them all week long. And there is high anticipation for the Florida governor to make his first trip here to Iowa. He is going to be speaking in Davenport, Iowa, in the eastern edge of the state and coming here to Des Moines. Only two public appearances. But behind the scenes I am told he's going to be having several meetings with Republicans, lawmakers, some top influential Republicans here. So we're heading from a soft launch, a book tour to an actual exploration for president. It's not official, of course. He'll be doing that in May or June, we are told. But talking to those critical voters here, the ones who have the earliest voice in the Republican nominating contest, they are deciding to choose a Republican alternative Or stick with Donald Trump.

And right there, the voter said, if he's not on the ballot, I will write him in. Of course, that is a dilemma facing Republicans. What if Donald Trump does not win? What does he do? Of course, that is a central question playing out. Will Republicans support the ultimate nominee? But that is getting ahead of ourselves. Right now, we're at the beginning of the phase of the presidential campaign. And one other thing I picked up certainly, this is not a two-man race. We should point out the fact that former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley campaigning here more than other candidates. And Republicans, the bottom line is they're in a couple of camps. You're either with Donald Trump and believe that he is the one who can restore the party, win back the White House, or you were looking for an alternative. And yes, the Florida Governor is at the top of the list for many people now. They want to see him, but there are also many other choices. The Iowa caucuses have a long-storied history of humbling frontrunners and sort of rising or elevating other candidates. So that is really the issue here when the Florida governor comes, he has meetings at the Iowa Capitol here behind me later today. This is his first sort of soft appearance, but has many more stops to do it and voters want to hear from him and to see if he can live up to all the hype. Kaitlan?",

Luckily, this was in an area that's pretty remote, and there's almost a one lane road that leads to this location.You can see that train right now. That rail workers will be working to write up just a little later on. And at some point they'll be able to move in and move some of this heavy machinery in to move some of these trains back. Let's take a look from above. Even though it's raining here right now, we do have our eye in the sky and that gives us a chance to look at this derailment. You can see from above just the destruction that was created here, like you said before, luckily, the residents that are near here are not affected by this. But look at that destruction and look at the machinery that they have to bring in to move these trains back onto the track at some point. Now, they brought new tracks in so they can kind of fix this. And you can see the wood line right there. We are about a mile away from any heavy residential area. But at the same time, you understand why America is focused on this right now, because when you see a derailment like this, you're concerned about the folks who live nearby, especially after what happened in Ohio. But look at that destruction. And of course, we need to figure out from the NTSB exactly what caused this. So the question here now is what led up to this crash? Right before that CEO was talking, you have Norfolk Southern and their operations here now trying to put this together. All the hotels in this area are actually full with workers who we back out here obviously at first light, like we are right now, to start putting this back together. But it's something to see, especially from the sky when you see those trains derailed and those containers there. So we've been able to make it to this location. Hopefully we'll be able to talk to investigators a little later this afternoon to figure out exactly what happened here.",

And so the Kremlin's response was to hit them hard with 95 plus missiles, to use a range of ballistic missiles, hypersonics, crews, drones.And what you find out when you dig a little bit deeper is that they're actually using air defense missiles and anti-ship missiles to attack Ukraine's infrastructure. And it tells you that their stocks seem to be fairly depleted. Now, kudos to the Ukrainians. It looks like their energy infrastructure is back online today.

It's a challenge that we in the United States military were looking at as well, because we know that it's also developing hypersonic weapons. So it's going to remain a challenge. The fact that they haven't used more of them is surprising.But this, again, calls for the need to Ukraine to get the air to offenses it needs. I don't think they still have Patriot air defense systems. Not that Patriot could defeat hypersonics, but still there's much more we need to give and provide the Ukrainians in order to beat back the Russian assaults.",
