Ahead, we're going to mark four years after such a dark day in American history as a new era attempts to take over American politics. Plus, Trump's new right-hand man Elon Musk on the attack, now going after top European leaders, including UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer. The child sex abuse scandal that Musk says deserves to be called out. Also, the notorious bigot who Musk is standing by and the strong rebuke Musk's accusations are getting today.

During this time, some individuals entered the Capitol, took photos and explored the building before leaving, unquote.

But just a short time ago, he did note the certification in all capital letters as saying this: Congress certifies our great election victory today. A big moment in history. MAGA! But the reality is this is a moment, I'm told, the president-elect was watching from here in Mar-a-Lago as he continues to establish his government. He's been moving very quickly to set up the appointees to the cabinet. They'll be facing confirmation hearings. He's been working on his agenda for the first 100 days. But I'm told by one adviser that the president-elect viewed this as a peer of vindication. Of course, that is the really remarkable -- four years ago, this was a major political liability. No one could imagine, including him and people around him, that he would come back. So this, of course, through the whitewashing of history, as you said, is exactly what has happened. He has emerged stronger in this four- year remarkable term. But now, of course, the burden will be on him and his fellow Republicans to actually try and govern, Jake. TAPPER: Yeah, it's a fascinating point. I mean, Donald Trump has run for president three times. It wasn't until after January 6th that he actually won the popular vote and had a clear and decisive win.

That includes this president and the current vice president as well. It's really clear talking to their advisers and various aides that it was very important for both of them, goes without saying that they not see a repeat of any aspect of what happened on January 6th of 2021. Today, the president, of course, has expressed concern about whitewashing of January 6th and what happened that day. He doesn't want history in that sense to be rewritten or actually forgotten about. The vice president, I was told by one senior adviser was actually a bit aghast that questions were even being asked about whether she would go through with today overseeing Congress certifying election results. It was so clear to her that this was obviously her duty and obligation as vice president. Everything today obviously went really smoothly but multiple people who have spoken with the vice president recently told me she does seem pretty focused on finishing out her obligations as the vice president, wants to make sure that she's even showing some calm to friends and aides that she's interacting with. But, yeah, the reality is there is nothing really pleasant about what she had to do today accepting her loss in that way. Also in two weeks from now, having to sit through inauguration day as Donald Trump will be sworn in for the second time. As for the vice president's future, we are told, of course those conversations have begun. Of course, she is thinking about it, but those deliberations are not going to begin in earnest until January 20th when she has actually vacated the naval observatory for J.D. Vance to take up residence there.

CNN's Paula Newton joins us now from Ottawa. Paula, explain to American viewers, and apologies for a second to our Canadian viewers, explain to our American viewers, why is he so deeply unpopular?",

Inflation, affordability, housing crisis, immigration that was legal, albeit, but really sent the population to record levels that was putting stress and strain on public services.I mean, look, at the end of the day, Jake, most people thought, look, you're just not listening to us and our needs anymore. Your government is getting stale. What was the real tipping point, though, was the fact that his own party decided he was not fit to fight the next election, which has to come before the end of the year. Listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But more to the point, she really felt that Canada needed to be in a stronger fiscal position in order to fight what's coming from Donald J. Trump as he comes into his second term.I mean, look, Jake, the president-elect did not let up, was not gracious saying good- bye to President Justin Trudeau -- to Prime Minister Trudeau. He's been calling him the governor of the 51st state and today, posted on Truth Social, many people in Canada love being the 51st state. The United States can no longer suffer the massive trade deficits and subsidies that Canada needs to stay afloat. Justin Trudeau knew this and resigned. I mean, look, saying 51st state Governor Trudeau, that actually stiffens the spines of so many Canadians. I've said it many times. It could actually backfire. But more to the point, you saw a diminished leader today in Justin Trudeau. That is more somber than I have ever seen him. He says that he's a fighter but knew he could not get in the ring for this one. The point is what comes next, Pierre Poilievre, the conservative leader, has found some currency with MAGA's base. He's popular with them, but, you know, dealing with President-elect Donald Trump maybe something else entirely.",

The plaintiffs in this class- action lawsuit filed in California say it will affect and help as many as 18,000 of those discharged under \"don't ask, don't tell\". And in short, it corrects their records.If they were discharged as other than honorable or uncharacterized discharge, that will be upgraded to honorable. If there is a discriminatory sexual orientation indicator in their record, that, too, can be removed. Instead of doing this on take case-by-case basis or individually, the whole goal here is to make this as simple, quick and efficient as possible for thousands of service members. And it's not just about a name or reputation. This has real world impacts because the record can affect job hunting and crucially affect benefits for veterans. So, this is an incredibly important step and very much lines up with what the Biden administration and what Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have tried to do over the course of the past few years, doing right by those service members who were discharged under \"don't ask, don't tell\". The crucial difference here, this is a much broader effort that aims to make the pathway as simple as possible for as many service members as possible -- Jake.",

All of this is about a condo that he says he's living in now primarily as his residence in Florida, Palm Beach. It's worth about $3.5 million. Ruby and Shaye Moss want access to that condo. They want to take it from him and sell it. He's trying to convince the judge, he should be able to keep it. So, he's getting dinged on that. But there's other things. He was on the stand, a person in Manhattan before this judge on Friday, and then again over video conference today, and he was telling the judge, you know, there were things he hasn't handed over to these women still that he has been told he must under a court order. He's just getting them now, the title to his Mercedes-Benz, a classic car convertible that he was driving around on Election Day. And he's just now finding a watch that his grandfather gave him. He held it up in court on the video conference to show the judge that he finally got it out of the safety deposit box.",

Second of all, he just doesn't have enough assets. And even the assets that we're talking about here, the Manhattan home, the Florida home, if you total those up, it's about $10 million, which is less than 10 percent of the total amount that Ruby lost and Shaye Freeman are owed.

They published these results of this study which was essentially looking at all the available research on the effects of fluoride levels in water and children's IQs.And they really looked at studies done around the world, and most of them were done in China. None of the studies included here were done in the United States, where about 63 percent of the population has fluoridated water. We've been talking about this because RFK Jr., Trump's pick for health secretary, wants to take fluoride out of the water. That's something public health experts disagree with. But this is a really important study, and what it found that at higher levels of water fluoride, you do see a negative impact on children's IQ in these studies. If you want to try to quantify that, they looked at -- for some of these studies, the output of fluoride in urine, essentially. What they found for every one milligram increase they found a 1.6 percent decline in children's IQ. But, Jake, it's really important to note, the recommended level here in the U.S. is 0.7 milligrams per liter of fluoride. These studies looked at levels twice that or even much higher. And so, there were two editorials published alongside this study that had diametrically opposed responses to it, one saying this is enough, we should reassess our public health recommendations. Another one says this says nothing about the recommended levels in the United States. So, that is the current debate.",

They have a lot of really great properties like they make your cookware nonstick, they can be water repellant, all sorts of good things. They've been used in a lot of things. But then we found out they don't really break down and they can accumulate and they can have health issues, including causing or being associated with some cancer, perhaps decreasing our immune response to vaccines, causing problems in pregnancy. And so, people are very concerned about these. And we already know that they can be found in drinking water. The EPA has started to regulate this in higher -- with more scrutiny. But this new study that was just published today looked at PFAS, these forever chemicals in wastewater that they say increasingly is being processed and then depended upon for drinking water, increasingly, as we have droughts and climate change, that's something we need to think about even more. And what they found is that these treatment plants, even with triple filtration sometimes, are not getting the PFAS out of the water and we are seeing these in pretty large concentrations. They say about 23 million Americans could depend on water sources that are contaminated with PFAS at levels higher than the regulators recommend.",
