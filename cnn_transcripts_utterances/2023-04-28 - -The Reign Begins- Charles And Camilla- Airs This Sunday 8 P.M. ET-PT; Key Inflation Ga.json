When you look year over year, it's still too hot up, 4.2 percent. But that's down pretty dramatically. It was 4.6 percent last month. It was 5 percent the month. And so, you know, it's good to see that number coming down here. There's another number that came out. The employment cost index. ECI is a quarterly number. I know you've covered this before too, that shows that wages picked up, though, in the quarter. So here's this split screen. Wages are still rising. That's good. I mean, I -- everybody wants to get a little more money in your paycheck. That's good for people. But the fed has been worried that that is inflationary.
