      "sentences": "All right, tonight on 360In the first big moment of the election subversion case, Judge Tanya Chutkan warns Donald Trump to watch what he says and lets him know, to her, he is just another defendant. Also a special counsel named in the Hunter Biden case with orders to investigate the president's son and others. The question now, who are those others? Plus, we are live in Maui where the death toll just rose sharply. Some especially powerful new video is coming in which we will bring to you along with exclusive reporting on how Hawaiian officials may have underestimated the risk of a tragedy like this, and missed key opportunities to prevent it. Good evening, everyone, John Berman here, in for Anderson. And we begin with what we learned today about how Judge Tanya Chutkan intends to handle what could be the most important trial this country has ever seen, and perhaps the most singular criminal defendant ever. Someone who was held and is right now running to reclaim the highest office in the land. And on top of that, he is Donald Trump. The venue, as you know, was a hearing on how he and his legal team may handle evidence, some of it is sensitive that prosecutors will be turning over to them specifically what they are allowed to make public. And on that, Judge Chutkan granted some though not all of what each side was asking on. The former president himself, though, who has been talking and at times ranting about the case about her, about the special counsel, she was unequivocal. To her, he is not a former president or a presidential candidate. He is first and foremost a defendant, which he also made clear comes with certain restrictions including what he can say and post online. What she did not say was when on this already crowded calendar, the case will be tried. The government wants January, Team Trump wants after the election. Earlier tonight on \"The Situation Room,\" one legal expert told Wolf that given Manhattan DA, Alvin Bragg's reported openness to postponing his March trial, late March looked interesting to him. As for what happened today, CNN's Jessica Schneider joins us now. Jessica, walk us through what the judge laid out today with the protective order.",

You know, this isn't actually as broad of a protective order as the prosecution wanted, but it still does restrict Trump and his team from publicly disclosing the so-called sensitive information that is handed over to them during the discovery process.This is sensitive information that includes grand jury process information, also information about search warrants, and this protective order, it also governs how Trump can get access to this information. So for example, when he is not with his attorneys, he can't have his phone or any recording device when he views this information. And John, there was a lot of it. Prosecutor said today at the hearing, they're prepared to hand over 11.6 million pages of documents, that also includes recordings of witness interviews that Trump also will not be able to share or post on social media and the judge, John, she said she'll be scrutinizing everything that Trump's team does say on social media and on media outlets.",

And what that looks like, it's grand jury materials, it's the key evidence really that they're going to use to prove the case against Donald Trump. They are legally required to provide that to him.And in practice, what that means is, his lawyers will show him the most important information, they will talk to him about it. They are probably not just going to leave him in a room to read, he'll be able to react to them. But here is the danger, the red line, if some of that information is trapped in his brain that isn't otherwise public, and then he lets it out in whole or in part in a social media posting, in a speech at one of his rallies when he is talking to journalists, that is where they're going to go to court and say, hey, Donald Trump has breached this order. And there is depending on how often he does it, there's potentially very serious penalties for that. So with an undisciplined individual like Trump, there is danger that it is breached and danger of those penalties.",

If it happens once, they would try to understand why it happened and what the motivation was, whether it was inadvertent or intentional, or even if it was a violation. If it happens repeatedly, then it becomes more intensive an inquiry. You also have to look at what the nature of the breach is. If it's something that's really critical, like witness intimidation, or revealing information, which is clearly confidential, and defendant knows that it's confidential, that's pretty serious, that affects the integrity of the process. What the judge is trying to do here, I think, is balance. Mr. Trump's rights as a defendant and every defendant has the same rights to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence. She is trying to balance those rights against the need for the integrity of the process to prevent things like confidential information being leaked, jury pools being tainted, witnesses being dissuaded or intimidated. That is the balance she is trying to strike. And so if a defendant does something that is particularly egregious, or if they do things over and over again that are clearly prohibited, the judge has the option of imposing sanctions. Sanctions could be a fine. The most extreme sanction could be revocation of release, the defendant could go to jail. I think the chances of that happening are very remote at this point, but it really depends how things play out.",

And so I think that is something that you could potentially see. And going back to, you know, what information does he learn from these documents? I mean, they could get transcripts and everything. And what does he say publicly? And I think that is where the issue is going to be, because I mean, he could very well be on the debate stage with Mike Pence. I mean, he has been attacking Mike Pence, pushing back on his claims that he asked him to overturn the constitution. And so I think that is where the intersection of this could be.

The reality is, you're going to see him draw a brighter line between making those kinds of sort of personal statements as a father and not wading into the questions of criminal justice in the same way that he hasn't waded into the questions of criminal justice around his opponent, Donald Trump, that's a line that he has to be vigilant about not crossing.",

It's the prosecution that needed to make sure they were very clear about what they were doing and they weren't able to answer the judge's inquiries about that, and that's why it collapsed. Now it places Hunter Biden in difficult position, certainly, because it looks like they're amping up potential other charges to try to force him into pleading. The issue here though is he's begging to plead. His defense team seems to want to take a plea deal, and it's just unclear what is really going to be holding that up.

And we decided, OK, we're going to be ready Tuesday for the grand opening. And Monday night they were in the gallery and people were coming in already and saying, oh, I want to buy this, I want to buy this. And my son said, you know what? My dad's going to be here tomorrow night. You bought from him before. He would love to say hello to you and wish you happiness and whatever. Come back tomorrow for the grand opening. And they said, no, we want to buy it now. And he said, no, no, no tomorrow. So they said, OK. And the next day, I was up in my house and the winds were like 100 miles per hour and I have a 150 pound master who could barely walk. And my sons called and said, dad, it's really getting bad. And I said, well, better come on back here because it's not looking good here either. And they came up. They tried to get out of Lahaina. And they were closing down the road because of the flames. And they got out. Like, it was a miracle they got out. They came up to my house and they saw all the furniture on my deck. Everything was being thrown around like toothpicks. And they go, dad, we got to go now. And I said, you know what? If it's going to be really bad, let's get a hotel room. Not one hotel had a room available, nothing. We were calling 15 hotels, not one room. So my other son said, you know what, let's get a U-Haul. I said, OK. We got two U-Hauls. We went to Walmart, bought blow up beds, and then we had four dogs in the car. We bought two blow up beds, blankets, sheets, pillows, bottles of water, and we took the two U-Hauls to the parking lot of the airport to sleep there. And the next thing we knew, Lahaina was gone. Lahaina was completely gone. My lifelong work of 50 years painting rock stars, gone. And I've been having calls from people, collectors from all over the world.
