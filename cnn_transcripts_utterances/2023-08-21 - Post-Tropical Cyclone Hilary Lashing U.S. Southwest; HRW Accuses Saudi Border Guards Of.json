Millions of people are under flash flood alerts across California and Nevada as Storm Hilary makes landfall. A damning report by Human Rights Watch accuses Saudi Arabia border guards of mass killings of Ethiopians. Ukrainian President Zelensky thanks Denmark for his pledge to send F-16 fighter jets. And Spain wins its first ever women's World Cup. More than 60 million people are right now under a flash flood warning as a major record-breaking storm moves across California, Nevada and up towards Idaho. Hurricane Hilary which has now been downgraded was the first tropical storm to hit the state in more than 25 years. Dropping a year's worth of rain on some parts of Southern California. One area hard here is east of Los Angeles in the Palm Springs region. Take a look at this. The intense rain and flooding turning a major freeway into a raging river. And these images are just as bad in Mexico where at least one person has been killed. Random mudslides first hit the Baja Peninsula there before moving north. Our Derek Van Dam is following all the developments and joins us now from the weather center. Good to see you, Derek. So, this was a record-breaking storm as well as an earthquake hitting the region. It is now a tropical cyclone but still expected to pack a punch as it heads north.",

Talking about the mudslides that have impacted much of southern California and the mountainous terrains, they're so dangerous. They can travel 30, 40 miles an hour, roughly 50 kilometers per hour. And they pick up everything in its path from rocks to boulders, to sometimes houses and even vehicles as well. Just because of the amount of force that is behind that wall of mud. So, this is what we have left a post Tropical Storm Hilary. I mean, this is a conveyor belt of moisture. It is wrapping rainfall from the border of Mexico and U.S. all the way to the Canadian border. So, several thousand miles and it's getting wrapped around to the north side of a very strong high-pressure system. But look at the rainfall totals. Now, note it, these are very high- elevation mountains. But it's impressive that we're reaching nearly 300 millimeters because this area normally dry this time of year can't handle that amount of precipitation. So, what happens, especially over the recent burn scars from previous wildfires, we get the mudslides, the debris flows and the landslides that you're seeing on our T.V. screens pop up this morning. This is the millions of Americans impacted by flood alerts. But there are still several 100,000 people that are under a flash flood warning. And this is because of the ongoing rain in some of the hardest hit areas of southern and eastern California as well as southern Nevada. Now the good thing to note, Los Angeles, the International Airport here is starting to dry out. So, we're seeing the rain bands kind of dissipate as the storm system gets caught up in this area of high pressure and strong winds aloft that'll continue to bring this to the northern parts of the country. But there's the additional rainfall and it just incredible to see what happens in Southern California and so many other locations around the world. The mudslides and debris flow simply just cannot handle the amount of water that falls in such a short period of time, Lynda.",

Well, a damning new report by Human Rights Watch accuses Saudi border guards of mass killings of Ethiopians. The report claims hundreds of migrants seeking asylum, including women and children have been fatally shot at close range while trying to cross the Yemeni-Saudi border. It says the killing started in March of 2022 and appear to have continued and if committed as part of a Saudi government policy will constitute crimes against humanity. Our Salma Abdelaziz is following the developments and joins us now from London. Salma, good to have you on this story.

Ukraine's president is thanking Denmark for its pledge to send his country F-16 fighter jets. Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed his gratitude and an address to the Danish Parliament today in Copenhagen. Denmark's F-16 pledge came after the Biden administration said it would approve the transfer of the jets to Ukraine once pilot training is complete. While on Sunday, President Zelenskyy said the Netherlands will also give Ukraine F-16 jets. Nick Payton Walsh is following the developments from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine and joins us live. Good to have you with us, Nick. So, Ukraine says it's expecting some 42 F-16 jets from Denmark and the Netherlands. Those countries haven't confirmed those exact numbers just yet.

But they aren't going to see that. And so, we now have to ask ourselves quite what the F-16s will do, when they arrive and the deep snows of winter in January. It is highly likely if Ukraine has enough of them, that they could use them to bolster offensive capabilities to hit Russian defensive positions. But the ground will be frozen by then. And we don't know frankly, if the outcome is not a significant change in territory over the next few months. What that will do to Ukrainian morale, Ukrainian armaments, and quite where it will be in the future. So yes, Ukraine says if we had F-16s now, it would be a game changer. And certainly, that is true, but they don't, and they won't.
