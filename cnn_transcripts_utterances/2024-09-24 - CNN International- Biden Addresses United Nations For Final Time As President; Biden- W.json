Let's get straight to our breaking news this hour, a message of hope from President Biden, even as war brings misery and loss to millions of people in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He just told the United Nations that it's not too late to stop a full-blown war erupting across Israel's border with Lebanon. In his last speech to the UN General Assembly as Commander in Chief, Biden says that he has not lost hope of international cooperation leading to peaceful solutions to conflict, even as lives are being lost in Lebanon, Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere.

Any country, any country, would have the right and responsibility to ensure that such an attack could never happen again, thousands bombed. Hamas terrorists invaded a sovereign state, slaughtering and massacring more than 1,200 people, including 46 Americans in their homes and at a music festival, despicable acts of sexual violence.250 innocents taken hostage. I have met with the families of those hostages. I have grieved with them. They are going through hell. Innocent civilians in Gaza are also going through hell, thousands and thousands killed, including aid workers, too many families dislocated, crowding in the tents, facing a dire humanitarian situation. They never asked for this war that Hamas started. I put forward with Qatar and Egypt a ceasefire and hostage deal. It's been endorsed by the UN Security Council. Now is the time for the parties to finalize its terms, bring the hostages home and secure security for Israel and Gaza free of Hamas threat, ease the suffering in Gaza and end this war. October 7th, since October 7th, we've also been determined to prevent a wider war than engulfs the entire region. Hezbollah unprovoked during the October 7 attack, launching rockets in Israel, almost a year later, too many on each side of the Israeli-Lebanon border remain displaced. A full-scale war is not in anyone's interest. Even as the situation has escalated, a diplomatic solution is still possible. In fact, it remains the only path to lasting security to allow the residents from both countries to return to their homes and the border safely, and that's what we're working tirelessly to achieve.

But, for President Biden, the optimistic tone we're used to, I think it was his acknowledgement or statement that when the world acts together, we're stronger, perhaps a hint at another Trump administration or the past Trump administration. He said we should not flinch from what happened on October 7th. So, from Ukraine to Gaza to Sudan, pushing for united action.But, there was a lot of applause when he said the people are the ones really with the power.

      "sentences": "Yeah. And certainly, people in the crowd will have taken that in a certain way, but a televised audience in the United States might have taken it a different way. And it was interesting to hear him describe in fairly candid terms his decision to step aside from the Democratic ticket. We actually haven't heard him talk about that decision at great length for very long, and it was something of an interesting choice to hear him talk about it from the UN, particularly when there are so many global conflicts that he needed to address as well. And you did hear in this speech, the President kind of tick through them one by one and talk about the different ways that the United States is trying to resolve them.But, I think at the end of the day, if you were waiting for President Biden to say something new about Ukraine, about the Middle East, about Sudan, you're probably still left waiting. He didn't offer any new proposals, any new strategies to try and bring, particularly in the Middle East, the parties together to try and come up with a ceasefire agreement. In that clip you played, the lead in was pretty much the extent of what he said about the Middle East. So, that is interesting. And I think he made that forceful call for a ceasefire deal, but he didn't really say how he plans to do that, and it remains the case that American officials still think that the prospects of a deal are somewhat fading. They don't necessarily believe that President Biden will be able to achieve this deal by the time he leaves office. They will still continue pursuing it, and President Biden will talk about it in his engagements in New York this week. But, they don't necessarily think they're any closer to striking that agreement. So, when you listen to the President, certainly he wanted to make this a career capstone speech. He talked about all the way back to the Vietnam War, when he first started as a U.S. Senator, and sort of tick through all of the issues that he has worked on throughout the course of his 50-year-long career. But, at the end of the day, for a final speech, his final capstone speech to the world stage, the world is very much still on fire, and the President didn't necessarily offer a lot of new proposals or new perspectives on how to get everything under control.",

He also mentioned the U.S. campaign for two additional seats to be on the Security Council coming from Africa.

But, I put that against the nearly 2,500 troops lost in 20 years there, and I chose to do it rather than make another President do it, because the campaign just wasn't working.So, sure, explanations of why things went wrong. But, to a lot of those listening, they see Afghanistan and the U.S. pullout as proof that the U.S. is a fickle ally.

You could say on Ukraine, even though Zelenskyy has argued he is not getting enough weaponry, enough permission to use that weaponry fast enough, the coalition has stayed together of some 50 plus countries providing military and other aid to Ukraine, and you have the U.S. lead that declaration against the invasion of 141 UN members when the invasion first happened. So, those are wins.Now on the clucking at Hamas and Israel to come to some sort of solution, that's not going to get either side anywhere. It's never worked before. But, it does make it sound to the Democratic Party and to the left wing of the Democratic Party that Biden is serious about coming to some sort of solution. It also gives the GOP a certain amount of ammunition. I'm sure they will be playing that bite, saying this is what a Kamala Harris administration would also be like, bawling out, chiding Israel when it's the Hamas terrorist group and the Hezbollah terrorist group that are to blame.",

Thank you.The Human Rights Office is urging the General Assembly to prioritize ending the conflict in the Middle East, saying that it is extremely concerned by the spillover of the Gaza war into Lebanon. Israel is vowing to, quote, \"speed up operations against Hezbollah\" after unleashing a new round of airstrikes. This is social media video set to show the aftermath of an attack today in Beirut's southern suburbs. Israel says that it killed a senior commander of a Hezbollah missile unit. Lebanon's Health Ministry says that at least six people were killed. The UN says that tens of thousands of people in Lebanon have fled their homes to escape the fighting. Monday's strikes were the deadliest in Lebanon since 2006, killing at least 558 people, including 50 children. The Lebanese Health Ministry says that the vast majority of those killed were unarmed civilians in their homes. An official says that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the security cabinet that the operation's goal is to separate Hezbollah from Israel's war on Hamas. But, Hezbollah has vowed to continue hostilities with Israel until it ends the war in Gaza. The Israeli military said that Hezbollah launched dozens more rockets toward Israel overnight. Obviously, a lot to get to. So, let's bring in Nic Robertson live in Tel Aviv. Nic, before we get to the strikes, have you heard any reaction to President Biden's speech at the UN locally there?

It did appear today as if some infrastructure had been hit, but not clear what that infrastructure was at all.The thrust of the operation really is continuing, not as heavy as yesterday, with the airstrikes, 2,000 munitions dropped so far on 1,500 targets, according to the IDF. The best insight, I think, of where this is going came from the Army Chief of Staff, General Herzi Halevi, saying that Hezbollah should not be given a reprieve, that the operation should continue at full force. In fact, he said the operations were going to be sped up and that action should be continued and vigorous across all areas.

That's the warning that's being given. Clearly, a high number of casualties in Lebanon, and among them, many civilians.

And her team believes that this is a good opportunity for her to essentially argue that it was the former President that squashed that bipartisan border enforcement deal, and that she ultimately wants to come to solutions on this issue.

In her own memoir, she has two chapters, I say we fight and we are better than this, where she speaks very passionately in defense of immigrants. When she was a Senator, a joint session of Congress, she brought a dreamer as her special guest. She called the border wall under the former President as a symbol and a waste of resources.And so, for -- we know the voters like to see candidates show up as their most authentic self, and I think that's why when she spoke at the Hispanic Caucus about the havoc that mass deportations would wreak, you could tell that she really believed what she was saying.
