We will soon know if the aggressive pushback from President Biden has bought him a reprieve from calls to drop his campaign for re-election.Very shortly, House Democrats hold an all caucus meeting. The handful of members who have publicly called from the dropout will be face to face with those who have voiced their support, including now, overnight, the Congressional Black Caucus and the Hispanic Caucus. Later, Senate Democrats meet. So far, none have directly called for the president to step aside, but several have echoed concerns like these from Patty Murray, who said, quote, we need to see a much more forceful and energetic candidate. Now, the president himself delivers a speech at the NATO summit in Washington. One BBC headline says it could, quote, save or sink Biden's candidacy.

And overnight, the White House is trying to offer some explanation for these reports that a top neurologist, who is a Parkinson's disease specialist, had visited the White House on several occasions.Now, these visits by Dr. Kevin Cannard first came to light through White House visitors logs, which showed that the neurologist had visited with Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor here at the White House in January. These logs also show that the doctor had been here at least seven other times in recent years. Now, overnight, the president's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor, released a very rare letter, explaining Cannard had been to the White House and saying that canard was the doctor who had examined Biden around his physical for that neurology test and that the president has not consulted or visited with other neurologists despite through his annual physicals. Now, the explanation from the White House now is that Dr. Kevin Cannard was here for what neurology clinics for those active duty members of the military who are serving in and around the White House. Dr. Kevin O'Connor writing, many military personnel experience neurological issues related to their service. And Dr. Cannard regularly visits the White House medical unit as part of this general neurology practice. Now, yesterday at the White House press briefing, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre would not confirm these visits by Dr. Cannard. She faced multiple contentious questions about whether President Biden himself had been treated for Parkinson's disease. Take a listen.

Is he taking medication for Parkinson's? No. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

He had had no public events, really trying to keep the spotlight on all of the handwringing happening in the Democratic Party over whether or not they believe that President Joe Biden is fit to serve for another four years.But we are seeing his return today with this rally in Miami, and it's interesting because Miami is where Marco Rubio is from, one of Donald Trump's top advisers. I am told that Rubio is going to be present at that rally later today. However, Donald Trump's advisers say not to read too much into that. I also want to note that later this week, over the weekend, Donald Trump is going to be holding another rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. That's just on the border of Ohio, where we know Senator J.D. Vance, another top contender, is also his -- is his home. And so there's a lot of questions over the location of these rallies and whether or not that means Donald Trump is ultimately going to make his vice presidential announcement. But Donald Trump said just as late as last night that he is still mulling this decision over. Take a listen to what he told Sean Hannity. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I haven't made final decision, but I have some ideas as to where we're going and a little bit, you know, we wanted to see what they're doing, to be honest, because, you know, it might make a difference. I don't know. I'm not sure that it would. But there are those that say Trump's waiting until he finds out what's going to happen with crooked Joe Biden, and we'll see what happens with Biden.

And, you know, we're going to have more conversations today. I respect their views. I mean, everybody's district is different than mine. So, they're smart people, they're talented people. And at the end of the day, we all want the same thing, which is to beat Donald Trump.My view is that the best way to beat Donald Trump is moving forward with the Biden-Harris ticket. Certainly, a big swap out, you know, you bring in new talent, we've got a lot of deep bench there, I think. But the mechanics of it, like the $220 million-plus that's been raised by the Biden-Harris campaign would not really transfer over to a new ticket. The campaign apparatus they have in place, which is like a thousand offices across the country, that doesn't transfer either. A new candidate would have to pay for it at fair market value. The list, the computers, the leases, all of that stuff, and the logistics of trying to put together a winning presidential campaign in three months, especially from someone who might be well known in their particular state, but would be single digit name recognition in other parts of the country, including battleground states. It's hard to see how that comes together. So, I think our best shot is with the people who have a strong record. The Biden-Harris ticket has that. They've got the apparatus in place. They've got great fundraising capabilities. Yes, I think $38 million came in over the two days after the debate. We're in poise to win. Many of the polls are -- you know, we're behind in some of those, but many of them are margin of error. So, I think we need to, you know, relax my view is stay the course. I know we've got colleagues that have different views. But let me say this to, you know, I'm old enough to remember conventions where we've come out where people were salty about their candidate not getting picked or had mixed feelings about the standard bearer. But Barack Obama won, Bill Clinton won, Joe Biden won, and we can do it again.",
