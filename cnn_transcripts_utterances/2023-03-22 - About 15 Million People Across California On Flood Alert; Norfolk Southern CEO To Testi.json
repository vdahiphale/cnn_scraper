Downtown Los Angeles, breaking a 130-year-old record from 1893 raining -- approaching an inch and a half of rain just to show you what is happening here.We're back out in San Bernardino, you can look up here, you can see -- the clouds came in. OK. So, it's not raining, but the clouds have come back in and the fog. But the snow line is probably about three -- 3,500 feet up or so because I'm standing at 2,500 ft. So, still a lot of snow coming up in those higher regions. But throughout the state, we saw people having hail. We saw trees falling. We saw that there was some flooding in some places. All of this along here. Just take a look over here, there's a car coming down. I want you to see this car is coming down and you can see the people coming up from higher up in the mountains, they're coming down with snow on their cars. The difference this time between the last time I talked to you was the fact that they're actually able to make their cars down the road. But just to give you an idea of how much precipitation we have seen over this wet season, the Southern Sierra is at a record all time snowpack right now. The central part of the Sierra, it's not far behind it. And overall, the state right now, it looks like it may be on track for another record here. So, this is just an unfathomable amount of precipitation that we have received in California, especially when you consider last year, we barely had any snow pack. So, things are changing. But, you know, happy spring, guys.",

We also see pet supplies up 11 percent and vet services of 10.5 percent.So, that's forcing some tough decisions for pet owners.

And there's been plenty of times throughout my career, especially over the last three years where I thought, you know, maybe I'm not fully motivated to keep doing this. But I still get back to it because I keep -- like, waking up every morning thinking, I want -- like, if I just do this and tweak that or whatever, maybe I'll ski a little faster. That motivation has not left even on the good days, definitely not. But on the bad days, I still have the motivation to improve again and that has to be there.I mean, you're going to fail in life. You're going to do it either privately or publicly. You're going to have bad days. Probably I think for all of us, most of our time is kind of spent actually, like not achieving our goals. And then you have a couple of moments here and there throughout life where you achieve it, and that makes all the work worth it. But I just -- I don't know about how you guys feel about it. But you don't, like, just go through life being successful every day.",

He skied into me. I was downhill on the mountain. He was above me. They were on beginner's slope. She was skiing with her children, her now husband, Brad Falchuk, they are expected to testify on her behalf.
