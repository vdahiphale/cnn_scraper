I think the questions have been asked, and were straying a little far from what's most important at this point in time, and that is the victims and their families. I have three things to add. First of all, there is a lot that our community can and will do in the coming days to support the victims and their families, and we will have more information at future briefings. If anyone -- and I would urge you all to include this in your stories -- if anyone needs mental health support as a result of this incident and the coverage of it, I encourage them to reach out to 988 by phone or text, and to get the mental health support that they need. It is incredibly important that we take care of our community in this very difficult time. We all have a role in preventing gun violence. Our entire community needs to be part of the solution here. There are many things that we can do and we can have those conversations in coming days. But first and foremost, what needs to be the priority for all of us is supporting our young people. And that is where our community's attention needs to turn. At this point in time, the police department, the fire department, the city, the county will share additional information about the investigation as it becomes available. But I urge you all to help our community find resources to support their mental health and to find resources to support the victims and families at this time. Thank you all. (CROSSTALK)",

New details just coming in about today's deadly shooting at Abundant Life Christian School, a private, parochial Christian school with about 400 students, K through 12. Police just confirmed the two victims killed were a teacher and a teenage student. Six other victims were injured, including two students who currently are believed to have life threatening injuries. Police got the call about the shooting just before 11 a.m. local time in Madison, Wisconsin. We learned moments ago that someone at the school called 911 to report the active shooter. Police say the shooter, who was also dead, was a juvenile, was a student at the school. Madison's police chief, Shon Barnes, noted earlier today this tragic event coming just one week before the holidays. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Let's get right to CNN's Shimon Prokupecz and John Miller and Whitney Wild, who is in Madison. And, Whitney, you're at the press conference. You just asked a question to Chief Shon Barnes on whether the suspect was known to have had any other prior run-ins with the law. What did he say?",

I also asked if the school had had any threats, and he said they were really little surface things, 911 calls, hang ups, things like that. But there wasn't anything that had indicated that violence would happen at that school, especially that violence would happen today.Jake, we did learn a little bit more. What we know is that someone from the school called reporting an active shooter, which the police chief says initiates a very specific protocol. The chief described an immediate response from law enforcement, although they did not say exactly what time they made entry. What we know is that that call came in at 10:57. I and other reporters here asked exactly what time did law enforcement make their way into that school. We are still waiting on that detail. Law enforcement is saying very little about the shooter, other than to say it was a teenager at the school. Jake. They did not say the age of the shooter. They did not say the shooters gender, but they did say that that shooter had a handgun. And we know from CNN's Josh Campbell that that was a nine millimeter pistol, a very common type of handgun, a very common type of handgun for gun violence. Further, Jake, we learned that this area was confined to one space, although the chief did not know if it was if it was confined to a hallway or a classroom. Those are still details that were waiting on. Jake, at this point, the chief does not believe that they had a school resource officer. You know, he that would have come from the city. It would have been one of his officers. He said he is not aware of that. Further, Jake, and this is something that we learned earlier today, but as well, finalizing this, that when law enforcement finally made entry, Jake, what they saw was that the shooter had died of a self- inflicted gunshot wound. There are so many questions. The foremost, of course, Jake, is why? Here's what the chief said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Most nine millimeter pistols can have a magazine that takes up to 14 rounds, which means if you have one in the chamber, that's 15 rounds. So this is a small, compact weapon, relatively easy to conceal, and one that gives you a large capacity of rounds to fire, which in a case like this, of course, just increases the damage, the danger, the impact.One of the things that we have learned throughout the terrible and repetitive history of mass shootings and school shootings, but particularly with school shootings, is that most guns come from the home. You know, when we ask questions like, how did this child in every place from Uvalde to other places, you know, obtain these weapons? It comes from the home in most cases, and with a teenager, this is one of the reasons that we hear the chief saying we're obtaining search warrants. When they go to search that home, they're going to be looking for the phone, the computer, the laptop, the things where they may find the building blocks, the planning, the writings about what led to this shooting to establish motive. Any notes or communiques left behind where maybe the shooter put forth motive. But they're also going to be looking for are there guns in the home? Are the guns accounted for? Is this one of those guns? Is one not accounted for? Are there boxes, ammunition and so on? Because they're going to want to obviously find out where this weapon came from and how it ended up in the hands of a student that young.",

For many, many, many independent and private schools and religious based schools, we don't see them oftentimes because those schools are smaller, but they may have some liaison with local law enforcement. I'll tell you from the effectiveness standpoint, what we know works for prevention is having a process like school threat assessment, where you can look at emerging, troublesome or alarming behaviors or concerns, rather than necessarily hardening the target with metal detectors. And, you know, sort of an additional police presence. School resource officers are an incredible asset to schools, oftentimes because they develop relationships with the students themselves. And maybe some of the students go to when they have a problem, when they're worried about someone in crisis, but simply hardening the target doesn't -- doesn't do what we need for school safety.",

The vast majority are male, but females have still carried out a handful of these shootings over the years. What we see are common, alarming behaviors beforehand.And I'll tell you, kind of the shorthand version of this is that the vast majority of students who carry out school shootings are students who are in crisis. They have problems they feel like they can't solve another way. They look to violence as a solution. Oftentimes, they either plan to kill themselves at the end, or they're hoping for a suicide by cop. They're hoping responding law enforcement will kill them in the process because they don't want to live anymore. We have a lot of tools that can help someone who's at that point of desperation and doesn't know what to do, doesn't feel like they can. They can cope with life any longer. And so what schools like Steve was talking about the students of concern committee, behavioral threat assessment committees. These are eyes and ears within the schools. And often with information that come from the student population, because they are the first ones to likely hear or know if a fellow student is in crisis, they can take a look at what's going on for this student. Talk with the student directly. Are you thinking about engaging in violence? Are you planning to do so? Why? What's what problem are you trying to solve? And then help that student solve the problem through nonviolent means. We see so many of these students engage in what the FBI calls a leakage, telling other people, other peers beforehand, posting on social media what they're thinking about doing from a violence standpoint, feeling desperate, showing pictures of weapons. Those are all behaviors that if they get to adults in school, the adults, especially when they have threat assessment training, can look further and say, what's going on with this student? How can we figure out what are they considering violence? Are they feeling desperate? Are they suicidal? And how can we help stabilize that person and put them on a better path?",

But there are two events that took place that I think are very terrible. One is that if people don't come back to work, come back into the office, they're going to be dismissed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

I mean, you hear him saying, well, he's not going to be as extreme as you know, you might think. I think part of the challenge here is Kennedy has an actual record, by the way, not just a lot of rhetoric, you know, saying he opposes these vaccines.

He writes, quote: Donald Trump will inherit a world far more hostile to U.S. interests than the one he left behind four years ago.

I think there are several parts of the globe, particularly throughout Africa, where China is showcasing some considerable dominance. That really concerns me, where the United States can build partnerships with several countries.There, unilateral partnerships that I think would be interesting in the interest of many countries and also other companies within the U.S. domestically, you think about technology, you think about building more electronic cars. A lot of that stuff in terms of that raw material comes out of Africa. I think the United States should be the dominant partner and leader with many of those countries instead of China. I'm also looking at Russia and Ukraine and their interest in usurping their dominance there. I think the U.S. needs to figure out a way to bring that to a close. And so, I think the president elect is aware of these things, Jake, and will attempt to bring closure as quickly as he possibly can to showcase the U.S. is still the leader of the world.",

He will have been in Washington for four years. He will have been vice president.
