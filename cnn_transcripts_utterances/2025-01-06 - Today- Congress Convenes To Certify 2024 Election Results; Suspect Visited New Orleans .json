In just a matter of hours Congress is going to brave that snowstorm and convene at the Capitol to certify Donald Trump's 2024 election victory. But on January 6, four years ago, a different manmade storm was brewing as Donald Trump summoned thousands of his supporters to the nation's capital. He spoke to them that morning on the Ellipse just outside the White House in what the House January 6 select committee later called an effort to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, (R) PRESIDENT-ELECT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. And we fight -- we fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Rioters clashed with Capitol police officers, they chased members of Congress from their chambers, and the put the certification of Joe Biden's election victory on hold. Eventually though, the joint session of Congress reconvened. Trump's own vice president, Mike Pence, presided over his own electoral defeat.In the four years since the violence of that day the Department of Justice has made more than 1,500 arrests across almost all 50 states. It's been the largest criminal investigation in Justice Department history. Now all those arrests, convictions, and guilty pleas could be swept away as Donald Trump returns to office after downplaying and dismissing the violent events of that day while running for re- election.

Mariana, good morning to you. This event today also going to have the unique visual of Kamala Harris, the sitting vice president, presiding over the proceedings. She, of course, ended up being at the top of the Democratic ticket after President Biden stepped down. This, of course, a remarkable comeback for President-elect Trump really underscored today. MARIANA ALFARO, NATIONAL POLITICS REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST (via Webex by Cisco):  Yes. In fact, it's going to be, as you mentioned, quite a visual especially after what we saw happen on January 6, 2021. Democrats have been very clear they accept the results of this election, and I think it's going to be really finalized when we see Kamala Harris announcing President-elect Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance as the next leaders of the country. And I think we've seen Hakeem Jeffries say in his acceptance speech last week when he became the majority -- the minority leader again say that Democrats do accept the results of the elections and thankfully, that there's no deniers in their -- in their group. So we're going to see a lot of those images today on the Capitol as they gather to finalize this election.",

I wouldn't be surprised if he goes through with it.But the thing Republicans in the Capitol are really refusing to engage with this topic as you saw Thune. And he's just sending it over to President Trump. I think that's part of the strategy to say we're in the future. We are no longer talking about the past. We want to move over. We want to move past this even though the own president-elect is not doing so. So I don't expect to see a lot of Republican pushback against that because they are leaning back on what -- you know, that their excuse or their reasoning being that President Biden went so far as using the pardons himself in the way that he did with his son.",

This week Donald Trump will be sentenced in his New York hush money cover-up case -- and then, in two weeks, he'll take office as the next President of the United States. The judge in the case has already said the president-elect won't face legal penalties for his conviction, but that hasn't stopped Trump from railing against him. Trump, on social media, writing this about the judge overseeing the case. \"Merchan has so little respect for the Constitution that he is keeping in place an illegal gag order on me, your president and president- elect, just so I cannot expose his and his family's disqualifying and illegal conflicts. I am the only political opponent in American history not allowed to defend myself -- a despicable First Amendment violation.\" But CNN political analyst Maggie Haberman points out that Trump is facing a different reality from when he was going through the trial.

Always wonderful to see you. So what do we expect here? I mean, is this definitely going ahead? Are there any other options for Trump to get this delayed? And does he have to show up? JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYST, CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY, FORMER PROSECUTOR (via Webex by Cisco):  Good morning to you, Kasie. So the reality is that he doesn't have to show up because the judge has indicated that it can be virtual. Having said that there's, of course, the possibility he won't even show up for that. In terms of whether or not it moves forward I think his team will continue to press and delay to attempt to get this sentencing postponed, removed, et cetera. Although I think ultimately, Kasie, it's better for him to have the sentence in place. This way he can pursue his appeals while in office and get some measure of finality to this entire process.",

This footage just released by the FBI. They say he also stayed at a rental home in New Orleans for a few days in late October and recorded video as he bicycled through the French Quarter. Authorities are still piecing together details of another visit he made on November 10. We've also learned the New Orleans attacker and the suspect who blew up a Cybertruck in front of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas served at Fort Liberty in North Carolina at the same time for less than a year. They were in different units. And law enforcement officials say there's no connection between them or the two incidents. CNN law enforcement analyst Jonathan Wackrow joins us now. Jonathan, good morning. Wonderful to see you. Thanks for being here. I think that this detail about these Meta smart glasses is really a remarkable one. What technology do those glasses provide that may change the game as officials try to make sure that attacks like this don't happen again? JONATHAN WACKROW, CNN LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST, FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA SECRET SERVICE AGENT (via Webex by Cisco):  Well, good morning, Kasie. You know, utilizing this new technology is actually just a toolset for what we refer to as reconnaissance in pre-attack surveillance. And in this case the utilization of that technology allowed the suspect to basically hide in plain sight and conduct that pre-attack surveillance and reconnaissance. What was he doing though I think is really important. For me this shows a very deliberate effort to gather the visual data that he needs to familiarize himself with this target location and the entire environment. It really signals a very clear intent to optimize his attack plan, really targeting the most densely populated area to really get the largest number of casualties possible. So the use of this new technology though allows him to go ahead and hide in plain sight as he's looking and observing different attack locations, and then retaining that information. And then going back and studying it to figure out where there are points of vulnerability potentially in the physical security plan where barricades may or may not be, and how he would launch this vehicle-ramming attack. And also where he should place those IEDs, right? Those weren't just randomly placed. They were put in very specific locations where mass gatherings would occur.",

He may have seen or observed the fact that those bollards were not presence in -- present and there was just a single police vehicle with gaps on either side where he could easily navigate around -- again, to launch this attack. But all of that comes from this pre-attack surveillance that heconducted. And again, utilizing this new technology is really a little bit of a gamechanger for our adversaries.",

And to me what it actually shows is this convergence of radicalization in the pathway to violence. And what I mean by that is typically when you think about a mass attacker, they follow a very staged progression towards violence starting with grievance. And then they go through planning phases to then eventually lead into an attack. When we -- when you couple that with radicalization what you end up getting is somebody that actually has externalized blame to others from a grievance and then is using that grievance as the justification for action. The radicalization part though comes in because it frames the grievance ideologically. And I think when you combine those two it actually accelerates everything. And that's what really law enforcement is concerned with because this can be -- it's -- the combination of the two really allows for this rapid ascent in justification for these violent acts. And all of that, for the most part, is happening online and that's what worries law enforcement and intelligence services the most right now.",

Good to see you.Two hundred seventy-two games played in the 2024 season, and it took every one of them to decide which team would take that number one seed in the NFC. Headed into the playoffs. That finale between the Lions and Vikings in Detroit started as a defensive slugfest -- 10-9 midway through the third. But then the Lions Jahmyr Gibbs ear up -- scoring three touchdowns in the second half and a franchise record-tying four touchdowns on the night. Aaron Glenn's defense making grandpa smile, keeping Minnesota's top five passing offense out of the endzone. A 31-9 beatdown. Back-to-back NFC North titles, a first round bye in the playoffs, and home field advantage throughout. The Patriots were all set up to land the number one overall pick in the next NFL draft after an abysmal season, but they beat their division rivals Buffalo, who were sitting a lot of their starters, losing the top pick. Afterwards, New England firing head coach Jerod Mayo after just one season. Now the four-win Titans secure the number one overall pick. The only thing the Tampa Bay Bucs needed to do to make the playoffs was win -- facing their rivals, the Saints. Late in the fourth Baker Mayfield flips the ball to Bucky Irving to give the Bucs an 8-point lead. And then they had the game won with just seconds to go. They could have kneeled to end the game, Kasie. Instead, their future Hall of Famer receiver Mike Evans needed just five yards to earn $3 million in a bonus, and he gets it. It also puts Evans over 1,000 yards joining Jerry Rice as the only players in NFL history with 11 or more 1,000-yard seasons. Oh, you have to see this. Chicago fooled the entire state of Wisconsin and all the Green Bay Packers. They made it look as if the guy at the bottom of the screen was going to field the punt, but it's that stealthy Josh Blackwell who actually fielded the ball. The Packers on the punt team -- they can't see where the ball is going. They just look for the returner. It's a 94-yard punt return for a touchdown. And then on the final play of their season the Bears would beat their longtime foes for the first time in six years with that game-winning field goal for a 24-22 win. Here's a look at the playoff matchups. The Chargers and Texans get wildcard weekend started on Saturday, followed by Steelers-Ravens. A tripleheader on Sunday with the Bills hosting the Broncos, the Packers taking on Kasie's Eagles in Philly, and the Commanders going to Tampa to face the Bucs. The action wraps up next Monday night with the Vikings flying west to play the Rams. Your Eagles have a shot, Kasie. They do have Detroit on the other side of the bracket, so you don't have to go against grandpa too early in the playoffs.",
