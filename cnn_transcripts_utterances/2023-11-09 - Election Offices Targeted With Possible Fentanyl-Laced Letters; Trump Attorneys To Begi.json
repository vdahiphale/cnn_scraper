And one of the counties' election offices that was targeted is here, election offices, I should say, it's here in Fulton County. And Fulton County has repeatedly been in the news, drawing the ire of the former president. And it has been so far a punching bag, if you will, for the far-right. Election workers here have been harassed, they've been intimidated. And at a press conference a short time ago, talking about this activity here, the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, called on election officials to denounce this activity, as well as political candidates. And he even went a step further, invoking the death of his late son, who overdosed as a result of Fentanyl. Raffensperger said this is a dangerous substance that could be deadly. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BRAD RAFFENSPERGER, (R), GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE: Some people like to call Fentanyl a drug, but it's actually poison. It'll kill you. It'll kill you very quickly, very easily. It's very dangerous. We lost our son five and a half years due to a Fentanyl overdose. We know how deadly this stuff is. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

But the judge said, I don't want to be reversed in this case, I don't want a retrial, so he said he would allow the experts to testify. But he said he would exclude anything and stop any testimony that was irrelevant. So he is allowing Trump's team to call these four expert witnesses that they want to call as part of their defense. But there was a lot of argument over Trump's team wanting this adverse ruling, making their best pitch as to why the attorney general's office didn't prove their case. And as part of that argument, they were saying that the New York attorney general's team never presented any evidence from any witness saying that they wouldn't have still given out these loans on the same terms had they known that the financial statements were fraudulent, as the judge decided or otherwise. And the judge asked the attorney general's lawyer, did you present any evidence of that? And he acknowledged that they actually hadn't. They hadn't called a witness to testify to that. But they did call one banker who said it in a deposition, but they didn't bring it out at trial. At any rate, the judge has not ruled on that ruling, although he did say, we will proceed as expected on Monday. And Trump's team is going to be called back to the stand, Donald Trump Jr. He is going to be their first witness in their defense.

That's sort of all the defense has. You know, it's in their interest to do that. Also, when you call your own witness, you can control their testimony far more than you can if you leave it to the prosecution. S o if you notice, the prosecution, the attorney general's office called them the first time, and really drove the things that came out of Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr's mouths.

Joe Manchin announcing that he will not run for re-election.Someone who has been so key with some of the major decisions in the Senate over the last several years, someone who has been the center of all of these fights amid this 50/50 Senate in the last Congress, 51/49 Senate in this Congress, announcing he will not run for re-election. Something that will have massive implications also in the battle for control of the chamber. This is a state that is very Republican that Donald Trump dominated in his two attempts at the White House. Joe Manchin is seen as probably the only Democrat with a real shot at hanging onto this seat. But even so, Manchin would have a difficult time running in this very conservative state. He would be up against potentially the former governor -- the current governor, Jim Justice, who is running in a primary there. If Justice emerges as the candidate, polls have shown that Manchin would be running from behind. It would be a difficult path for him to run for re-election. But Manchin has fallen out of step with his party as well, as he has criticized Joe Biden, as he has not gone as far as many members on the left had been pushing for. But Manchin had been thinking about this for some time, debating about exactly what to do, debating about whether to run as an Independent, something that he had considered doing as well. But making clear here that he doesn't plan to run at all. In an announcement video that he just posted on social media, indicating that he would try to travel the country to see if there's a movement about whether or not folks could work together in the middle to figure out there's some sort of common ground between the two parties. What that exactly means is unclear, given the fact that he has toyed with possibly running for president on a third-party ticket as an Independent -- possible, something he has not ruled out -- for months and months and months. Is he suggesting that? He does not address that explicitly. But Manchin is 76 years old. Has made clear that he's not going to run again. Something that a lot of people in the Senate had expected. But still, the fact that he has made this decision at this point will have major ramifications for legislating in the Senate and for also control of the Senate next year, as they battle it out. I asked him about -- there have been rumors about what he will do, just before this announcement video came out. I asked him, when will you make a decision to run for re-election? He said when the time is right, the time is right. And moments later, he posted that video saying, he's stepping down -- guys?",

And you have Jon Tester, who's running for re-election in Montana, who has a difficult road to reelection. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, also with a huge battle on his hand to win re-election. But Republicans plan to contest in states like Pennsylvania, also, key to the Republican majority. That will be a big battle as well. Michigan, we'll see how that plays out. Wisconsin, another state. All Democratic incumbents sitting in those seats. The challenge for Democrats heading into next year and keeping control of the Senate is the fact that there just aren't many Republican targets. The only real ones are Ted Cruz in Texas and Rick Scott in Florida, two states that are Republican states. Texas is more strongly a Republican state than Florida, but Florida is increasingly a GOP state. It will be very difficult for Democrats to pick off either of those two incumbents. So Manchin is gone and let's say all of the incumbents are gone, it's a 50/50 Senate. The White House could determine who goes which way. But if Tester loses or Brown loses, that means Republicans could be back in the majority again.
