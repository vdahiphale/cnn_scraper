      "sentences": "Hello and welcome to CNN \"Newsroom\". I'm Max Foster in London. Just ahead Israel launches a large scale military operation in the West Bank town of Jenin. What are the latest on this developing story? And France assesses the damage of six nights of rioting following the death of teenage boy shot dead by the police.But the calls to end the violence are growing, including from the family of the victim. Then a CNN exclusive Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy sat down with Erin Burnett and talks about Vladimir Putin and the slow push to recapture territories occupied by Russia. Well, Israel calls it focus, counterterrorism and operation. Palestinians call it a new war crime against our defenseless people. Deadly violence is flowing once again in the West Bank as Israeli forces launched a lethal military operation in the Northern City Jenin. The Palestinian Health Ministry says at least eight people have been killed and that number is likely to rise and dozens more are injured. Israel says it was striking terrorist infrastructure in the densely populated Jenin refugee camp. Separately, Israel is bracing for protests today as part of the ongoing campaign against the government's plan to judicial overhaul. Police are warning protesters they won't be allowed to block access to Ben Gurion Airport. CNN's Hadas Gold is in Tel Aviv. First of all, Hadas, just take us through this latest operation the Israelis went in pretty hard.",

Now their goal is to really disrupt operations here shut down the airport. And this is a continuation of the months of protests we've been seeing against the plan judicial reforms. That would really completely change how Israel Supreme Court operates. Now, protesters are still coming out this despite the fact that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, has said that he is walking back from some of the more controversial aspects of this judicial reform, namely the one that would have allowed the Israeli parliament to overturn Supreme Court decisions. He recently said that it's completely off the table. But for these protesters, they say that's not enough, because there are other issues at hand, namely, how judges are selected? There are other issues, legal issues in hand. And also I think this protest movement has also developed into something more also a protest movement against this government. This is the most right wing religious government in Israeli history. The question we're going to see today is how many protesters show up in the Israeli policing they're trying to limit the number of protesters are trying to keep them cordoned in a certain area, or the protests are saying they're going to come and they're going to try and shut down the operations in any way that they can, Max.",

The grandmother of the team who was shot and killed by police last week, called for the violence to stop on Sunday. There are more than 150 people detained overnight and around 300 cars were set on fire.But those figures are a sharp decline from what we've seen over the past several days. The Mayor of one Paris suburb says his family was the target of an assassination attempt. French President Emmanuel Macron plans to meet on Tuesday with 220 Mayors who've been dealing with the violence in their communities. CNN's Nic Robinson joins us live from a Paris suburb. And there is a backlash isn't there to the level of violence and the level of damage done as well, costing millions of euros?",

Of course, the overall damage bill is going to be much, much higher. As you say the violence does seem to be coming down is certainly what we witnessed on the streets last night. Riot police were out but they had less of the sort of cat and mouse chase had had the previous night with protesters.Overall, a metric that I think is useful to look at to get a sense of how the violence is trending 352 fires last night 871, the previous night, about 2500 the night before 38, 3900 almost the night before that. So you can see the level of violence is coming down. But also that's because this is very, very, very high level of police presence and Nahel's grandmother spoke over the weekend and echoed I think what we've been hearing from a lot of people and also from the government, that it is time for the violence to stop.

The average age has been 17.We've heard that some people arrested as young as 13. The message from the President over the weekend, President Macron was, you know, to parents, you know, keep your minors in the house, keep the young children in the house, don't let them go out and protest. So she also said his grandmother also said, you know, don't destroy the town halls, your mother's are using the town halls, speaking to people here and other places where we've been to where there's been violence. That's what people say its yes the government needs to change things. It needs to do things differently. The police need to do things differently. But also it's not right to go out and destroy the property that we all rely on in our daily lives. So I think that message, everything combined the tight security, their desire to get back to normality. This is beginning to take a little hold here, Max.",

According to Grigory Karasin, their children were taken to Russia under a program aimed at protecting orphans and those abandoned during what Moscow calls its special military operation.Ukraine, however, claims that thousands of children have been illegally and forcibly deported since Russia's war began. But the numbers are much smaller President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says around 19,500 children have been brought to Russia and that 371 had been returned to Ukraine. Clare Sebastian joins me now. First of all, why do you think Russia is putting this figure out there? CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this lawmaker Grigory Karasin, veteran lawmaker he is the Head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the upper house of the Russian parliament. He seems to be echoing a number put out there last week by Sergey Lavrov who said that 5 million Ukrainian refugees were now in Russia and of them 700,000 children. We don't know where they're getting this number, the disparity between that and the number of children as you pointed out that Ukraine that President Zelenskyy is accusing Russia of having illegally deported is pretty stark. But I think the point here we'll two things clearly are the point here. One is that there is evidence that Russia despite branding this as an evacuation of taking children out of active war zones, bringing them they say in many cases with their parents and caregivers, there is evidence. CNN is actually spoken to some of these children and their parents that Russia has illegally deported children. In some cases about 371 children, according to Zelenskyy have been brought back but there is thousands of children still illegally on Russian territory. And there is enough evidence -- , Max, for the International Criminal Court to have indicted President Putin and his children's rights commissioner back in March. But Russia, this is the second point is not hiding this. They are making no attempt to hide this despite the fact that the international community views the illegal deportation of children as a war crime not only this lawmaker coming out there and talking about it and using it as a pretext to accuse Ukraine of mistreating children. But Maria Lvova-Belova, the Children's Rights Commission actually sat for an interview several months ago with Vice News allowed herself to be asked outright, are you a war criminal? They are making no effort to hide this whatsoever. Their claim that this is evacuations, though, does not stand up to much scrutiny when you look into these cases.",

But there are instances like, for example, children being sent by their parents to summer camps.For example, in Crimea that was only supposed to last a couple of weeks and then not being able to get them back until many months later. And even then they had to go and collect themselves through active war zones undergoing a lot of danger, and things like that. So this is something that is extremely murky, but we know that this is part of the backdrop to this ongoing war, Max.",
