President Biden apparently telling Netanyahu that an immediate ceasefire in Gaza is essential and now what appears to be an ultimatum is coming into view.The White House says that Biden made it clear that if Israel doesn't do a better job of protecting civilians and aid workers in the coming hours and days, then he will reconsider U.S. policy in Gaza. This comes in the wake of Israel's deadly strike on an aid convoy there that killed seven aid workers with World Central Kitchen. The IDF says that it has completed a preliminary investigation into that tragedy and those findings will be shared imminently. CNN's MJ Lee was at a significant White House briefing focused on all of this. MJ, you asked National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby about how the U.S. is going to assess the decisions that Israel makes to try to protect aid workers and civilians. But the answer was nebulous at best. He wouldn't provide specifics.",

The White House says that it wants to see specific concrete and measurable steps that Israel is going to take to alleviate the civilian suffering, the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, but is not saying exactly how they would measure those steps to be taken. And then in terms of the potential U.S. policy changes, they're not saying anything at all about what those potential policy changes might be. And I've just stepped out of the White House press briefing, and you can imagine that White House spokesman John Kirby got pressed a number of times for more details. And one of the questions I asked him was whether President Biden in his private phone call with the prime minister made clear to him what those potential U.S. policy changes might be. This was his answer. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, you have to remember that this is an Israeli prime minister who's under a great deal of stress politically himself here inside of Israel. Now, we've just been hearing, Boris, that we're going to get tonight from the IDF the results of their preliminary investigation into the strikes that killed the World Central Kitchen workers. That's pretty quick, quicker than we'd anticipated, so in a couple of hours that'll be made public.The results of the initial investigation, the wider probe, of course, will take longer than that. But this is the part of the probe on which they base their conclusions that this has been a misidentification. I think it's interesting that they are bringing a great deal of transparency quite quickly to that investigation. As to the rest of it, remember that this is a country under a great deal of stress. We've seen again on the northern border today, more cross-border fire, Hezbollah firing into Israel, the IDF firing back. And the IDF spokesman today coming out and telling Israelis that they could calm down. There was no reason to panic. And I'm speaking here, of course, of the threats that have been made by Tehran in the wake of the strike that - in Syria that targeted one of their consular - one of the Iranian consular buildings. Israel has not recognized or spoken to it, but it has been blamed by Tehran on Israel with the threats to retaliate from Tehran. We heard Rear Admiral Hagari today speak to the Israeli public saying, look, there's no need to buy generators. There's no need to get money out from ATMs. We will let you know if there's a change in the situation. You've also had today in Israel all kinds of problems with GPS. People in Tel Aviv being told by their phones and their cars they were, in fact, in Beirut and Cairo. And this is something that we've seen repeatedly since October 7th, where GPS signals can be scrambled to prevent the kind of missile attacks that depend on GPS coordination. Now, we've had no confirmation from the Israeli military about that, but certainly it adds to the sense that these are tense, stressful times for ordinary Israelis, keeping an eye as they are on their northern border, watching closely the threats that are coming from Tehran and, of course, watching the fallout of the way this war has been waged in the Gaza Strip, not least from their American ally. And bear in mind as well that there has been a great deal of pressure on Benjamin Netanyahu these last four days here in Jerusalem. We've seen those protests, not least led by families of the hostages still in the hands of Hamas, who are tired of his strategy and believe that more could have been done to get their loved ones out sooner. So I think what we've just heard from Washington is significant in terms of the extra layer of pressure that it piles on the Israeli prime minister.",

For example, get more aid into Gaza, open more border crossings to Gaza than there are now, take steps to protect civilians and aid workers. Those are very tangible things and you need to do it now. And if you don't do it, the U.S. will change its policy.And changing the policy means it we'll not give a blank check to Israel to do whatever it wants and we'll not continue to support the war. And we saw that in what Biden said in the call, that he spoke about a ceasefire, an immediate ceasefire as something which is essential. And he did not tie it or link it directly to a hostage deal. And Biden also told Netanyahu that he needs to empower his negotiators to get a hostage deal. Meaning, that he thinks Netanyahu is not really doing it until now.",

The Israelis told the U.S. just last week that they'll need between three to four weeks just to evacuate civilians from Rafah and the Americans told them that it's an underestimation of how long it will take.So if we're looking at an operation in Rafah, we're looking at something that will happen maybe, maybe sometime in May, okay?

And every small change would need another meeting of the security cabinet and this would give a lot of opportunity for the radical right-wing members of Netanyahu's government to try and stall or try to sabotage it.

But here the judge is rejecting his motion based on the argument that he had the right to take these home under the Presidential Records Act. Now, that is a post-Watergate law. That governs which materials created during an administration belong to a president versus the government itself.Now, Trump has suggested that under that law, he had every right to take these classified documents. Of course, prosecutors have pushed back on that, pointing out that the Presidential Records Act is not charged here. There's not even an enforcement mechanism. And they also point out the fact that these were classified documents that they allege were strewn about his Mar-a-Lago property. But this issue, Boris, it's caused a lot of tension between the special counsel and the judge because the judge had asked both, both defense attorneys and prosecutors, to submit jury instructions related to the Presidential Records Act. And in a filing late Tuesday, the special counsel had issued its strongest rebuke yet of Judge Cannon and her handling of this case, saying that there is no basis in fact or law for her to ask for these kinds of jury instructions. And they urged her to reject Trump's effort to even allow the Presidential Records Act into this case. Now, it's interesting, in her decision today on the motion to dismiss, she did punch back a little bit at the special counsel and she insisted that their request that they get a clarity on this issue of jury instructions before the trial starts because they've said, look, if you're going to put this issue in the trial, if you're going to allow this in, we're probably going to appeal. She said that their demand was \"unprecedented and unjust.\" Look, Boris, this is significant not only because she's rejecting this effort to dismiss the case, but it's notable that she is making a decision because her approach to this case has been unusual, it has come under scrutiny. An analysis done by our colleagues, Tierney Sneed and Hannah Rabinowitz, shows that she has over a dozen matters, decisions to still decide outstanding in this case. And of those, eight of them are other motions to dismiss. And the longer it takes her to decide those, the less likely it is that this case will go before November.",

And she heard arguments from both sides about how far back in the year it could go.Of course, the Trump lawyers don't want it to go before the election, because if Trump is reelected, he would, of course, have his attorney general dismiss Jack Smith and these cases. But the special counsel's office was hoping they could start this, this summer. It's been over a month, though, since that hearing, and we still don't have a trial date. So of the more than a dozen decisions that she has still outstanding, the biggest question we're looking at right now is, when will she place this case on the calendar?

This number down here. I'm going to leave that there for a moment. So if you want to just literally take a photo of the screen and remind yourself, this is the number.Remember this, if it's not doing this, nice posing, if it's not this, you're running a risk. And make sure that what you're covering your eyes with isn't wrinkled, isn't scratched, anything that can go along. And don't think that you can just look through some other device and it'll be fine. These actually concentrate the light. You need a special filter on those. Protect your eyes so you can watch your dog, your kids, the final four, other things that make your day brighter.",

He is a Clinical Psychologist and Associate Professor at the Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine. All right. Talk to us, Doc, why do you think people are so fascinated by solar eclipses?",
