Tennessee's version prohibits doctors from giving hormone therapy and puberty blockers to transgender minors. The Biden administration is arguing against the ban, saying it's unconstitutional. Lawyers for Tennessee argue the ban is constitutional because the law was a reasonable legislative response to contested medical evidence.Let's get over to CNN's Paula Reid, who's kindly been standing by as I give some of the background on this case. Paula, you also spoke with some of the people at the center of this case. Talk to me about what they say and what is at stake here.",

With us now, CNN's Supreme Court analyst Steve Vladeck, and Jeffrey Rosen, president and CEO of the National Constitution Center.Steve, I want to read from the decision in 2020, Bostock versus Clayton County, written by conservative justice Neil Gorsuch, which did find that there were transgender rights, certain, in the workplace here. Gorsuch wrote, quote, \"it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.\" So, why are those words important to this case?

Title Seven of the Civil Rights Act, which Congress enacted in 1964.You know, today what the court is doing is interpreting a less specific provision of the Constitution, part of the 14th Amendment that was adopted way back in 1868. And, John, the question's going to be whether the Supreme Court, and especially someone like a Justice Neil Gorsuch, Chief Justice John Roberts, who is also in the majority in that Bostock case in 2020, are going to see these words and these concepts as meaning the same thing in the statute Congress wrote in 1964, as it means in the Constitution, or whether they're going to draw a distinction and say, Congress is allowed to prohibit more than the Constitution does because the constitution doesn't use quite the same terminology, because it was adopted at a different time, that was different. That, John, I think, is really the heart of the matter and why I think so many folks will be focused on Justice Gorsuch specifically in today's oral argument.",

      "sentences": "The Constitution protects the equal protection of the laws. The Supreme Court has said that certain characteristics, like race, get heightened scrutiny. That means you need a really good reason to discriminate on the basis of race.When it comes to gender, the court has adopted something called intermediate scrutiny. You need a good reason, but slightly less strong than when it comes to race. The central question in this case is, is discrimination against transgender people discrimination on the basis of sex? And the Biden administration says, put simply, an adolescent assigned female at birth can't receive puberty blockers to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can. And the counterargument from the respondent's brief is that there's no gender classification here. There are two groups, minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes. Either of these groups includes members of both sexes. So, that's the central question here. And if the court agrees with the Biden administration, it could find that discrimination against transgender people is entitled to heightened scrutiny. And you need a really good reason for any laws, not just the puberty blockers, but for sports teams and separate restrooms and all discrimination against transgender people. By contrast, if the court rejects heightened scrutiny, it might say, well, just some medical evidence that this could be a good thing to block is OK, and we're going to uphold the law. So, that's the central question in the case.",

His mother was just on television last hour defending her son and saying he is a, quote, \"changed man.\" Hegseth's mom made a direct appeal to Donald Trump in her appearance on Fox News. But we all know, as has been discussed and the reporting suggests, that Hegseth faces trouble right now. A rocky road to confirmation, to say the least. The road so rocky maybe that we learned last hour that the president-elect has actually spoken with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis about potentially replacing Hegseth for the job as being a candidate for - to head up the Pentagon. He is facing several allegations of - Hegseth, of drunken misbehavior, sexual misconduct and financial mismanagement of the veterans non-profit that he once ran. Hegseth's mother speaking out now after making headlines this week when a 2018 email that she wrote to her son was published. The email in part said this, \"on behalf of all of the women, and I know it's many, you have abused in some way, I say get some help and take an honest look at yourself.\" That was then. Here is her message now. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PENELOPE HEGSETH, PETE HEGSETH'S MOTHER: Pete is a new person. He's redeemed, forgiven, changed. I think we all are after seven years. I believe he's the man for the job. I know Pete. And the people who know us know Pete. And Trump knows Pete. And he knows the Pete of today. And he knows the Pete who is a good father, a good husband to Jen. He's got seven kids. He's a wonderful son. Wonderful son. And a wonderful son to his brothers and all his friends. He's a changed man. And I just hope people will - will get to know who Pete is today, especially our dear female senators, that you would listen to him, listen with your heart to the truth of Pete.

That's what we should be talking about. The rest of this, it's hearsay. There are anonymous sources. Every one - every one of his co-hosts, and if you look at everything that's come out and said that this is not true. Talk to the makeup artist who did his makeup every day, who would smell the alcohol on his breath, and they will tell you, this is not true. And so, I think we're talking about the wrong thing. Yes, you have an absolute valid concern about whether or not he is the right person for this job.

And I honestly think that the Democrats are doing more damage by doing this kind of thing than focusing on the real question, which everybody rightfully has, is he the right person for the job?
