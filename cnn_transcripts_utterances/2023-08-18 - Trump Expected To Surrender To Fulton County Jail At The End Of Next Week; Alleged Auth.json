Welcome to CNN PRIMETIME.Donald Trump's terms of surrender, the 45th president of the United States, he'll turn himself into the Fulton County Jail at the end of next week and is a sign of just how close we are to that stunning moment. The Secret Service has been at the jail for weeks working with local officials to plan the former president's appearance, a mug shot, fingerprints, the whole nine yards. And what will this mean for the first Republican debate, which is on Wednesday? Plus, classroom culture wars in a suburban Atlanta district, a school board has voted to fire a teacher who read a book about gender identity to gifted fifth graders. That teacher is here with us tonight to tell us why she did it. And Oscar Nominee Bradley Cooper is in the middle of a controversy about his latest film, Maestro. He plays the composer and conductor, Leonard Bernstein, but some of his critics say that the makeup that he wears reinforces hurtful anti-Semitic stereotypes. And others questioned his casting since he's not known to be of Jewish ancestry. So, who can play whom in movies and in television shows? And what does this all say about diversity in Hollywood? We've got a fascinating conversation just ahead. But, first, let's begin tonight with what we know about Donald Trump's surrender in Georgia on charges that he and 18 other people orchestrated a criminal enterprise to overturn Joe Biden's election victory. A senior law enforcement official tells CNN that the former president is expected to surrender either on Thursday or on Friday of next week. And if that process is anything like what most criminal defendants experienced, he could be waiting for hours to his fingerprints and his mug shot taken. But this is, of course, the former president of the United States and nothing like this has ever happened before, not in the least four times. The Secret Service has been planning for weeks. And the treatment of defendants being booked and processed on criminal charges in Fulton County does vary drastically case by case, but it normally does include a thorough search by a jail deputy, a medical screening, pre-trial consultation, fingerprinting, and, of course, a mug shot.

And anytime a president is in sort of custody of something other than the Secret Service, it's cause their alarm.So, the question is, number one, is he ever put into a jail cell? Number two, is he ever put into a general population? Number three, how is he handled and treated? Setting aside the questions of whether he ought to be held guilty for things that he's accused of and so on, there are serious safety considerations. Now, another question we all have to ask is, is this really just like any other case, or are there going to be accommodations made on account of the fact that it's a former president? And I do think that even despite the bluster that you're hearing from the Fulton County sheriff, I mean, this is going to be different. PHILLIP:  Yes. I mean, the other jurisdictions, they have not needed to take a mug shot. Everybody knows what Donald Trump looks like, so there's that. But Shermichael, this is going to be a moment where, potentially, maybe they might decide to do that, just to make a statement that he's like any other defendant. But it's not just going to be him. It's going to be a lot of other high profile people, the Rudy Giulianis of the world, Mark Meadows, a former White House chief of staff, a very high ranking government official in his former life. You're a Republican. I mean, what kind of moment is this for this country and for the party that we're seeing this parade of people showing up at a county jail?",

There isn't really a great way to go about it, but that's just what defense attorneys have to do.Shermichael, this is going to be like a train wreck kind of situation. You've got a Republican debate on Wednesday, and then a potential surrender on either Thursday or Friday.

It's already locked down.So, usually, when you have a movement, the most vulnerable point is an arrival and a departure. That's really when a protectee like Trump is the most vulnerable. Once he's inside, they're going to secure the facility. You've got all these law enforcement entities helping with the motorcade route, the arrival, the departure, and the surrender itself. Now, the surrender itself is quite common. Many -- you know, I would arrest individuals where I would allow them to surrender when they were nonviolent crimes. So, they will likely, though, expedite the process for him. They probably don't want him to be there very long, so he's going to move to the front of the line, whatever that looks like. They're going to process him. I think it will be a negotiation about what they do or don't do because they really want to process him and then move him out.

In the count one, which covers the RICO conspiracy, she lists all these different actions that also occurred in up to six other states. And she's basically begging. I look at it as basically begging other prosecutors to file charges that are similar. I mean, this is something she did that I think was very -- she did the right thing here with these charges.

And we're starting to get clues, assuming that he was with Alex Jones because he was sympathetic to Alex Jones and his cause, and I don't think that's a bold assumption, it does start to tell us something about his view of all this.And one of the things we documented on the committee and in the final report is that Alex Jones and his Infowars played a very big role in the Stop the Steal movement. And it's important to keep in mind that what Alex Jones is all about is anti-government extremism, right? It's this idea that the U.S. government is illegitimate. And the inherent in that thought is the idea that should be overthrown. So, the idea that Alex Jones would find himself there on January 6th and Cheseborowould be right by his side, I think, does start to speak to something about the mindset of Cheseboro, who is also this political conspiracy -- at the heart of the political conspiracy and the fake elector scheme to overturn the election.",

So, I don't think that there's really a firm line between the political conspiracy and the political violence. I think the political violence came about because of the political conspiracy. That's obvious. And I think that's every man on the street can understand that argument.I mean, Jack Smith's indictment was very narrow to Trump, and he focused on very specific charges. But you can even see in that special counsel indictment, he is saying Trump is responsible for the attack. I mean, he says that throughout the speech at The Ellipse, for example, that Trump gave, which was very incendiary with the exception of one word, was entirely incendiary. He cites that speech all throughout the indictment. So, I think, you know, this is something that just didn't charge him for inciting the attack but he certainly lays blame at Trump's feet for it.",

So, with respect to Kenneth Cheseboro being seen on January 6th, it gets much harder for him or Donald Trump, anybody to claim that what Cheseboro was providing was merely legal advice and bouncing ideas around with the president when he's clearly palling around with Alex Jones on the day of January 6th. So, it muddies his avenues for defense a little bit. Now, to the second question about charging the president with a crime, I've been saying for a while, it would have been very hard to charge the president with a crime for the conduct on January 6th because you would have run into a lot of free speech questions with the words that he said there and linking him to the actual violence.And then for seditious conspiracy, which some people have been charged and convicted of on January 6th, you'd have to prove some agreement or conspiracy that is still thin based on what's in the public record. Now, is it conduct that is shameful, disgraceful, unpresidential, un- American, whatever? Absolutely. But know if you could charge it as a crime.",

People really believe this, Abby.And so if you're a Republican at 6 percent, 2 percent, and you're thinking, I need to somehow pivot and reach into some of those Trump supporters, then you're going to take the stance of defending Trump and defending the individuals who have been now persecuted, according to many Republican voters, because they believe those individuals were wrongly charged.",

Because in the end, it's not the criticism of Donald Trump that matters, it's pulling Trump's voters over to them because his lead is so significant, and we've never seen a primary election with someone with a lead this big who in the end is defeated in the pursuit of the nomination.",
