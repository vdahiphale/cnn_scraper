But these are the stories we are beginning to learn about.There are ten more hostages who will be released tonight, according to Israeli officials. We have learned that as part of the extended truce that's supposed to go today and tomorrow, into the following morning. Crucially, we've learned from the family of the youngest hostage, 10- month-old Kfir Bibas, his names and the names of the family not on that list. A strong lobbying effort. They're trying to push to see what they can do, if they can make sure the family is on the list before the extended truce is over. We, of course, don't have news that will be extended any further, even though that remains at least somewhat of a possibility. Meanwhile, we're still seeing the joyful reunions in Israel for those families that are able to come together. Aton Haloni (ph), 12 years old, let's see that video again. This is him being embraced by his mother, who waited all this time to see him. You can see that hug, not letting go in any way. I suspect that will be a hug that lasts quite a while and is replayed many, many times over the course of the coming days. And then the video of the reunion of the Brodutch family in the hospital here. The three kids and the mother, newly released, all the joy there. You can even see the dog joining in the celebrations in the hospital. We have seen these videos. We have seen these pictures. They are powerful each and every time we watch them. And we look forward to seeing more of these play out tonight, even as we wait for more than 100 more hostages to be released. And we'll see if the truce can hold. Right now, it's scheduled for another 48 hours. That will be ten Israeli hostages released today, ten more released tomorrow in exchange for humanitarian aid going into Gaza, and Palestinian women and children being released from prison. It is still a delicate truce, and we will follow it, Poppy and Phil, every step of the way as it plays out.",

But when that pause ends and when as many hostages as possible are brought out of Gaza, this is still very much a war. Israel has thousands, if not tens of thousands, of troops who remain in Gaza. They're in defensive positions. When this truce expires or runs its course or whatever terminology you want to use there, this is very much still a war, and Israel has said clearly its goal is to destroy Hamas. And you can expect that Hamas will fight back and try to fight back against the Israeli forces that are still there. In terms of the long-term question, what happens when this war is over, Phil, that is very much a serious and open question.",

The interest, of course, for the Biden administration is not just the sort of general release of as many hostages as they can help engineer, but also, I think, in particular, these two American women who were expected to be part of the original tranche of 50 released over the past four days that ultimately were -- that ultimately did not -- did not leave Gaza. These obviously have been incredibly, incredibly sensitive negotiations. Burns has been an integral player, really, from the beginning. He's been in regular contact with Israel's Barnea, who's been kind of Israel's point person on hostage negotiations. He's been in and out of Doha over the past month. And I think interesting really here, Phil and Poppy, to sort of see how Biden has sort of chosen to deploy his CIA director in this context specifically. This is something that presidents will often do when they want the United States to be able to talk to, even indirectly talk to an entity that is not State Department recognized as a nation state and they don't want to send the secretary of state. But Biden, I think, has -- has really leaned very heavily on Burns in his capacity as kind of a shadow diplomat, first in Ukraine and now here in Israel. And this is a space in which Burns has an extended amount of experience. He was, of course, a State Department diplomat in the region. He also was the lead negotiator under Obama for secret talks with Iran that ultimately became the Iran nuclear deal. So this is a space in which the CIA director has a lot of experience, and the president is leaning on him very heavily for a very, very sensitive mission.",

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MATTINGLY (voice-over): It's the chilling testimony shining a light on the conditions in which Israeli hostages were held for seven weeks. Now freed, those hostages say they mostly survived on rice and bread and reportedly slept on chairs pushed together, all as bombs rained down overhead.

She was rushed to an Israeli hospital in critical condition after she was released this weekend.Doctor, thank you for joining us. And can we just begin there on how -- because you had contact with her and been overseeing her care, how is her recovery coming? Is she still critical? DR. HAGAI LEVINE, HEAD OF MEDICAL TEAM FOR HOSTAGES: And hello, Poppy and Phil. Yes. Elma Avraham is still in critical condition, fighting for her life. She's ventilated, and you know, we are just focusing now on saving her life. The medical team and the medical center. But I must testify to the world, her condition not only medically, that she didn't receive the medications she needed and some of them are rather simple medications that could have been given, and obviously, she deteriorated with time. But also, you can see on her body that she was dragged from a place to place and that she was handcuffed. That, you know, like she has chemical wounds from -- from not meeting her basic needs, if you understand what I mean. So you know, that's loss of basic dignities. That's immense suffering. It's not clear why they didn't release her before based on humanitarian. And we are very worried that some of the other hostages, hopefully also released today but some of the other hostages are dying or are in such a condition. And -- and they must be released immediately, for the very least, to allow the Red Cross to -- to visit them. It's really worrisome. As we see the light and we are so glad with the release and the recovery of some of the hostages, I must say that also for those who seems when -- there are shades. We hear from them, some were -- underwent, you know, it's not necessarily intentional torture, which also is possible, but they were cuffed for long periods. They were in dark places. They were in poor ventilation. They got a poor diet, as you just showed. And they have mental consequences.

So they distance themselves away from that, and now seven weeks have passed. And they cannot close it now, because what we do usually when you have a trauma, said OK, the trauma is over. It was how horrible, but now you are in a safe place and that we can start recovery. But, you know, for her, her mother is still there. It's not only against basic agreement, but it's against basic morality. Why would you at least separate kids from their living mothers, and I also must remind you that, for many of the families, the fathers are still there. It's horrible. You know, (UNINTELLIGIBLE). We normalized Hamas way that, yes, we now released children and women. But you know, all of them deserve to be free. All of them deserve to get proper medical and mental care. For Elma Avraham, not only she didn't return home yet -- she's hospitalized -- but also her home was violated. She doesn't have a home to return to when she's hopefully released from the hospital after she rehabilitate, because now she's in life-threatening condition. So, it just shows you how deep is the -- the tragedy and, for many of the families, not only that they care about the hostages that are still there. They just -- their own family is still there. So it's very difficult to recover. I must say a bit of the medicine that the support and solidarity among the hostages, among the families of the hostages, and among all the people around the world that support the families and the hostages, is very stressing the families and hostages.
