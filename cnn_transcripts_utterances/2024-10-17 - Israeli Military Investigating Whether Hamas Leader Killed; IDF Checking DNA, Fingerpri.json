      "sentences": "Good morning. You're alive in the CNN Newsroom. I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We are following breaking news right now. The Israeli military is investigating whether the leader of Hamas, Yahya Sinwar, was killed in a strike in Gaza. Israel considers him the mastermind behind the October 7th terror attacks. Let's get right into this. Let's go straight to CNN's Jeremy Diamond in Tel Aviv. Jeremy, what more are you learning?",

      "sentences": "Well, Jim, this would be an earth- shattering development if indeed it is confirmed. The Israeli military says that they have killed what they describe as three terrorists in the Gaza Strip, one of whom they believe may be Hamas' leader, Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the October 7th attacks that set off this year-long war inside the Gaza Strip.The Israeli military is saying in a statement that, quote, the identity of the terrorist cannot yet be confirmed. They are also saying that this apparently happened in a building above ground in Gaza, which is extremely notable given the fact that the working assumption had been that Sinwar was hiding in tunnels for much of the last year. They also say that there are, quote, no signs of the presence of hostages in the area. Now, Sinwar has been, of course, a central figure in this war over the course of the last year. Not only did he green light the October 7th attack that set off this war that has now seen 1,200 Israeli civilians killed on that day on October 7th, 1,200 Israelis, I should say, sorry, the majority of whom were civilians, but also, of course, more than 41,000 Palestinians have now died in the Gaza Strip, killed for sure by Israeli bombs and bullets. But make no mistake that Sinwar also bears some share of responsibility for launching this war. And certainly we have seen growing expressions of anger, including by Gazan civilians who have increasingly blamed Sinwar in the aftermath of Israeli airstrikes for the continued suffering, as they believe, that he was hiding underground. We will see how this actually impacts the continuation of this war and, of course, beyond that, whether or not this could perhaps make ceasefire and hostage negotiations easier to actually achieve, or whether instead the chaos that is likely to follow within Hamas following his potential death, whether or not that will make the situation worse.

But for Netanyahu, politically, in Israeli politics, inside his coalition, he can now say we won and therefore we're ready to move on another path on a hostage deal on ending the war on trying to find, you know, a political solution to the current situation and not just continue on with this perpetual war.",

I mean, we know the president right now is traveling. He has the secretary of state, Tony Blinken with him. He has the national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. And one of the things that we have heard time and again from Secretary Blinken through all of this is that one of the big impediments to getting some kind of deal that would release the hostages and perhaps start bringing this thing towards a ceasefire and a conclusion is Sinwar. He's been pretty -- I mean, as much as there's criticism for Prime Minister Netanyahu, Blinken has made it very clear Sinwar has been a huge obstacle in all of this.",

      "sentences": "Yes. When you listen to U.S. officials, particularly in the last few weeks, talk about the possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza, they essentially put Netanyahu and Sinwar on equal footing, saying it's not clear whether either of them has the political willingness to strike a deal.Now, you will often hear U.S. officials say that Hamas really is the impediment. Hamas has been changing the terms. We know that Netanyahu has also been changing the terms. Now, if Sinwar is off of the battlefield, a lot of the onus moves to Netanyahu. And he has a moment here, U.S. officials believe, where he can declare victory. He can say, we have decimated Hamas, we've taken 14, 15,000 of their fighters off of the battlefield, we've taken out their highest political and military echelon. It wouldn't just be Sinwar. It would be the head of the military wing, Mohammed Deif, and his deputy, Marwan Issa. So, U.S. officials who I've been speaking with this morning, no doubt, see this as a moment where they could jumpstart the ceasefire negotiations that have been completely stalled in the water for the past few weeks. And more importantly, Jim, for months, the U.S. administration has seen the end of the war in Gaza, a ceasefire in Gaza, as the key to unlocking so much more, not just getting the Israeli hostages home, not just getting that critical aid into the Gaza Strip, for the hundreds of thousands of people who are suffering so much in Gaza, but also ending the confrontations that Israel is facing with Hezbollah to the north and Lebanon, the increasing attacks by the Houthis in Yemen, as well as other proxy groups. So, this really is a -- could be a pivotal moment for not just the war in Gaza but so much of these growing and brewing conflicts.",

And, Arlette, if you can pick up on that point from Alex Marquardt, because it's an important one, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said at the outset of all of this that one of the goals was to crush Hamas. Taking out Sinwar obviously gets him to that goal, by and large. What might be the domestic political implications in all of this?

And we're just getting a word from the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, there were no signs of harm to any hostages in the Israeli operation in Gaza that may have killed Sinwar. A Netanyahu spokesperson said the prime minister had instructed the Israeli military to tell families of hostages there were no signs of harm to the hostages in the encounter in question. So, obviously, we're getting more details as the minutes go by. We're going to take a quick break, more on the other side, be right back.(COMMERCIAL BREAK) [10:15:00] ACOSTA:  All right, welcome back to the Breaking News. The Israeli military investigating whether the Hamas leader, Yahya Sinwar, was killed in an operation in Gaza earlier today. I just want to tell you a little bit of reporting coming in from our Jeremy Diamond. It says, Israeli forces encountered a man believed to be Yahya Sinwar during routine military operations in the Gaza Strip. This is according to two Israeli sources. Infantry troops encountered three militants near a building in Gaza and engaged them, according to the sources. After the battle ended, troops found a body resembling Sinwar's and alerted senior commanders. That is when the process began of trying to identify whether this body is indeed Sinwar's through DNA analysis. I want to go to Colonel Leighton, Colonel Cedric Layton, our military analyst, to ask him about this. And I think this has been said in other programs prior to this program. But let's say it on this program. The Israelis have Sinwar's DNA. So, that's how they were able to do this, if you could touch on that. And then also it almost seems as though -- I don't want to speculate as to how this went down, but that this was sort of a routine military operation and they happened upon Sinwar and these other men who are with him. What's your sense of it in terms of what you're hearing about the TikTok that is starting to emerge in all of this? COL. CEDRIC LEIGHTON (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Yes, Jim, it's going to be a fascinating TikTok too, looking at all the different aspects of this. But, you know, first to the DNA part of it, there's nothing like putting somebody in jail to collect their DNA. And the Israelis, of course, do that for all of the terrorists that they capture, that they imprison in their prison systems. So, they have this vast database of all of these people, and Yahya Sinwar is one of them. And it's, you know, pretty interesting to note how they do this, and so this is basically at the moment of forensic examination. And as soon as it's finished, some say it has already finished, but we're obviously still waiting for the official confirmation that will then tell us whether indeed that body was Yahya Sinwar's. Now, as far as this patrol happening upon Yahya Sinwar, where Sinwar and the three -- the total of three people that he was apparently with, there are a lot of situations in war where the area is shaped in essence by previous operations. So, in this particular case, Jim, what you had was, of course, the bombing campaign of the Israelis, the intelligence efforts, all of those different things coming together in a way that forces Sinwar into the tunnel system or into the housing system. We're not sure exactly where he was spending most of his time, but, you know, our speculation was that he was mostly in tunnels, but he was clearly on the move when the patrol encountered him. That part was the big coincidence, that the patrol happened to be there as he was moving, if it is indeed him. And that kind of coincidence is the kind of coincidence that can change the course of a war, can change the course of combat. And if it bears out, then we, you know, have the fact that the Israeli troops involved were doing their job and this whole battlefield, if you will, was shaped by the previous operations that the Israelis have conducted.",

      "sentences": "Yes. You know, I think for an American audience, it's kind of like looking at the bin Laden situation. You know, as we were hunting bin Laden, it took us years to find bin Laden and Israelis, of course, did it well a little over a year. But, you know, they had a much smaller geographic area to deal with, but it was still difficult. It was still one of the most arduous tasks, both from an intelligence perspective and from a military operational perspective to do this kind of, you know, an operation and to actually get at that strategic as well as tactical goal that that you have here.So, you know, when you look at the bin Laden raid, it took us, what, about 11 years or so to -- well, ten years to get him. And that was one of the things that, you know, I think shaped a lot of the way that the American military does its -- conducts its missions. A lot of it was intelligence-based. That particular mission was definitely intelligence-based. This one, you know, there happened to be that one coincidence that, you know, may have changed the course of this conflict, and it still be, you know. So, a word of caution, Jim, I think it's still be one situation where there is still going to be fighting. There's still going to be -- there are going to be pockets of Hamas fighters that the Israelis will have to deal with, but they lack that major command and control or will be lacking that major command and control if Sinwar is, in fact, dead at this point.",

Mr. Ambassador, are you there? All right, we might be trying to get him back on the line. Alex Marquardt -- yes, it looks like we lost the ambassador there. Alex, your sense of, as I was talking about with Colonel Leighton a few moments ago, this hunt that has been going on for Sinwar for the better part of a year, he has essentially been somebody that they had been searching for high and low for months now. And, I mean, if this were to happen, just sort of by happenstance during routine military operations, , that's just a massive development.",

      "sentences": "The way that this has unfolded is just remarkable. There is no sense that this was a major military operation that was launched in order to get Yahya Sinwar. It is essentially, as you said, that they stumbled across him.The sense from U.S. and Israeli officials for most of the last year was that he was hiding in that vast network of hundreds of miles of tunnels, specifically under the southern city of Khan Younis, which is where he's from. And there was also reporting, again, citing Israeli officials, that he was surrounded by Israeli hostages, and that would make him more difficult to target. And here, if this is indeed confirmed, it sounds like they came across him. He was above ground in a building. They killed him and he was not surrounded by hostages. And you have Netanyahu now reaching out to the families to say that no hostages were harmed. So, this is just remarkable. From the U.S. perspective, they have been helping Israel in this hunt. Sinwar, of course, has been the most wanted man throughout this conflict. We were always asking the question whether Sinwar would, for example, use that tunnel system to go across the border into Egypt and escape. But that was never, in any way, confirmed. In fact, the sense was that he wanted to go down with the ship, that he wanted to die fighting. He wanted to die, you know, as a martyr fighting Israel, and that may have happened. So, this really could be a, a real turning point, but by no means does this suggest that, you know, the hostages are going to immediately be released or that a ceasefire can immediately go into place. It is a step in that direction, but we don't know who would take his place --",
