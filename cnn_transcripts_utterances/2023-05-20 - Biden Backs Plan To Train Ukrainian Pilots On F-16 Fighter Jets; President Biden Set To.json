      "sentences": "All right. Hello again, everyone. Thank you so much for joining me. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right. President Biden will officially be meeting with Ukraine's President Zelenskyy at the G7 summit in Japan. The White House making that announcement just a short time ago. Ukraine already scored a key victory after the U.S. has signaled it will now permit allies to send F-16 fighter jets to the war-torn nation. Other G7 leaders have been meeting with Zelenskyy and issued a statement of support, saying \"we reaffirm our unwavering support for Ukraine for as long as it takes.\" Russia's war on Ukraine isn't the only issue high on the agenda. Western leaders are also weighing in on how to confront China's increasing military power. CNN's Phil Mattingly is in Hiroshima, Japan. So, what can we expect to come from this highly-anticipated meeting between Biden and Zelenskyy?",

      "sentences": "Yes, Fred. You know, the symbolism is obvious. We've seen it not just here in Hiroshima, but also over the course of the last 10 days with President Zelenskyy traveling through European capitals attending the Arab League summit in Saudi Arabia, making the case not just to clear allies, like those leaders in the G7 but also to those who have perhaps been more neutral, even leaning towards Russia throughout the course of this conflict since their invasion 15 months ago.And trying to push those allies and those who may be in the more neutral camp towards supporting Ukraine's positions towards cutting off support for Russia, and perhaps most importantly, trying to unify as much of the world as possible as they push towards a very critical moment in this conflict. U.S. officials acknowledged they expect to counter offensive by Ukrainian forces in the coming weeks, no certainty in terms of that date. But part of what you've seen President Zelenskyy do and this will be something that he'll continue to do throughout the course of the day, including a working group meeting with all seven leaders is to continue to push for more. The unity, the durability, the stability to some degree of the Western alliance that supported Ukraine over the course of the last 15 months, I think would surprise pretty much everybody that's involved, including senior U.S. officials. And yet as they enter into this critical part of a war that has just been grinding on for months, they need more weapon systems, they need more economic aid, they certainly need just as much as they possibly can get. And that has been a big part of what President Zelenskyy has pushed towards. And I think it is part of the reason why the U.S. has signed off on a willingness to allow the transfers of F-16 from allies not from U.S. stocks, but from allies. And also, they -- that they will participate in training programs. As you noted, Fred, that's a dramatic shift from President Biden and his team. Something they hadn't opened the door to four months despite pleas from President Zelenskyy and top Ukrainian officials, as well as some Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. But it underscores the power of the message that Zelenskyy brings in moments like this. And the reality of a conflict that shows no signs of ending anytime soon. I will say while the bilateral meeting with President Biden is an important meeting, U.S. officials are looking forward to that meeting. And it'll be the first time they've met face to face since President Biden's surprise visit to Kyiv. It's the other leaders President Zelenskyy is meeting with while here including countries not in the G7 who were invited to participate in this summit. Many of them kind of in that neutral camp in terms of the conflict giving him an opportunity to make his case and try and rally them to Ukraine side. That is an invaluable opportunity when you talk to U.S. officials, giving him a chance to actually make that case has a lot of importance going into this critical moment in the war.",

And it was lastly the tanks and then it was the fighter aircraft. But what he says is going to be doing now at the G7 as coordinating with partners, and preparing for and planning the next joint steps.And in this, he says that's going to be about Ukraine's defense, it's going to be about weapons, it's going to be about fighter jets, it's going to be about air defense. But we think it's also going to be about the support that he needs to get going forward from NATO. Not just the military support right now. But a specific language when ultimately a peace plan can be on the table that Ukraine has satisfied its needs in territorial retakes from the Russians within its own borders. That Ukraine is going to have the international support and specifically security guarantees from NATO. So, I think that's going to be on his agenda. But Zelenskyy is already always looking ahead. And that -- and that will come for a timeline on the fighter jets when they can precisely have them, what weapon systems they can have, how many they can have, where they'll be repaired, how many pilots they can get trained, how quickly. All of those sorts of details, but we know that he's going to be looking beyond that for sure.",

But what the Russians are doing is trying to mess with their psyche and unsettle the population and essentially, you know, make a -- create a population that doesn't want to have this long war, that wants it all over as soon as possible. But there's another thing the Ukrainian say the Russians are trying to do which is deplete the missile systems that the Ukrainians use to defend the capital. Because missiles that they use to defend the capital are missiles or systems that they can't use to defend their soldiers at the front line. And it's those soldiers that are critically important to continue the fight going forward. So, it's a -- it's a concern of the Ukrainians.

But this bill ultimately passed and we fully expect the governor to sign this into law. So, we're just kind of waiting to see exactly when that will happen. Now, I do want to explain the Let Them Grow Act because it has two parts.And the first is the gender-affirming care part of it. The other part is the abortion and this was a last-minute addition to the bill. It was an amendment that was added on Wednesday. And so, there's a lot to this bill. When it comes to the gender-affirming care part of it, what this bill does is that it essentially bars physicians from performing gender transition surgeries. Now these are rare when it comes to teens and children. But the other part of it is restricting access to puberty, blocking medication and to hormone treatments. Now that is standard care for teens and children who want to transition. Now, the other aspect of this is the abortion part. And what it does here is that it restricts abortions at 12 weeks. There are some exceptions when it comes to sexual assault, when it comes to incest and when it comes to medical emergencies. And Nebraska here is a single-lawmaking chamber. So, what it took was a two-thirds majority. It passed with 33 yeses and 15 nos. Of course, there was plenty of debate here. But I want to show you just some of what was heard on the chamber.
