He's noting Todd Blanche said, that at the time Michael Cohen was also exploring, getting a different job at something called iPayments. In any case, you talked multiple times that day, October 26th, with folks associated with Dr. King's statement, this is about trying to get the an endorsement from the family of Martin Luther King.

He's, in the last two weeks of a presidential election, How can you possibly remember chapter and verse on these conversations?

Now, Blanche is making sort of a hard left turn talking about the retainer agreement, or lack thereof for Michael Cohen's legal services. And, look, Landy Davis, the prosecutors, people in and around the prosecution team, they all insist that this case does not rest on the testimony of Michael Cohen. But the fact is he is the most significant witness for the prosecution. And right now Blanche is walking Cohen through the calculation to reach the $420,000 he was paid in 2017 that Cohen has testified that he worked through with Allen Weisselberg. And, boom, there, that is why Cohen is so important, because the only other person who is party to this alleged conspiracy is Allen Weisselberg. He's not being called to testify. And he's pointing out that you, Michael Cohen, was shorted $100,000 on his bonus that year.

That's part of why he ginned up a lot of this extra money when he was totaling how much he was owed.And he also was very frustrated about his bonus, right? And so there's likely going to be an argument that Trump was trying to keep him happy. He was ticked off he wasn't going to the White House. He was a legal advisor and he didn't want him to be an issue, to be unhappy. That's likely where they're going to go. Because what Todd Blanche needs to do, if he ever gets there, is to just establish that there was not a conspiracy to falsify business records and falsely say that these were payments for legal services wWhen it was just to pay him back to cover up hush money.

Cohen is as close as we get, and that's why Blanche is going to really go at him on what was written down on that piece of paper.It's really one of the most significant pieces of evidence. Again, this is an alleged paperwork crime at the heart of it. Arguably, the most important testimony that we've heard so far has been from the Trump Organization accountants, who are the ones who actually cut the checks. He was asking, did you ever plead guilty to larceny? Blanche asked. No, sir, Cohen said, again, trying to dirty him up. But if you go back to the accountants who actually cut these checks, you know, they received paperwork from Michael Cohen. They cut the checks because he submitted falsified invoices for legal services. So, here, the defense has to establish that there's no direct evidence, that their client directed this.

I mean, we're at a point now where it's like, dog bites man, right? We know that Michael Cohen lies.So, the question for the jury I think is going to be I suspect they'll have a big white board up in the jury room and they will list every time that there is corroboration for one of Michael Cohen's statements and they will either believe that the corroboration takes you to a verdict of guilty or they won't. There's one thing I wanted to talk about. There's been so much talk here about the Michael Cohen prepping with the district attorney. You know, there is a jury charge about that in which the judge will tell the jury, you've heard testimony about Michael Cohen prepping. There's nothing improper about that as long as he was not instructed to lie. So, I think that whole line of questioning doesn't work in terms of impact on a jury.",

We've heard that from other witnesses as well when they've been questioned of how much time they spent with them.And the defense, we should note, also has a right to talk to these jurors -- or to these potential witnesses about what they would likely testify about. In some of these instances, we have been told, they did not reach out to ask what they would testify about. But it is important to note they have that ability. Right now, Michael Cohen is saying yes, talking about a retainer agreement that he had with Allen Weisselberg. And all this goes back to Michael Cohen's credibility with the jury and how they view him, but also what can be backed up by documents and call logs and text messages as well here.",

They know these people have criminal records. You make these deals with the devil when you have to.

We also know that we have information about where the checks were, how it was signed. But remember McConney, that was one of the comptrollers of the Trump Organization, taking notes from Allen Weisselberg about the money payment. So, this is part of what we're talking about. Why this is so important here is because the heart of the matter is that Donald Trump was complicit, caused to have this happen and knew about the money that was going and why. If they can establish Michael Cohen as somebody who is not to be trusted about the amount of money as well, then they might be able to suggest that Donald Trump had no idea what he was truly paying.",
