Earlier today, Israeli airstrikes also hit the city center for the first time since 2006. It is 05:00 p.m. here in Abu Dhabi. I'm Eleni Giokos. This is \"Connect the World\". We go straight to our top story this hour. That loud boom heard by CNN teams in the Lebanese capital, and you can see smoke rising over the city in daylight hours, plumes of smoke coming through as those strikes hit southern parts of Beirut. Lebanese state media reporting the strikes targeting the southern suburbs. This all follows what the UN Special Coordinator for Lebanon calls a sleepless night in the city. An Israeli airstrike targeting the central part of the city for the first time since the 2006 Lebanese war. Lebanese health officials say at least nine people were killed. Jomana Karadsheh is joining us from Beirut. We've got Jim Sciutto in Tel Aviv for us. Jomana, I want to start with you. You're on the ground in Beirut. You heard some of these blasts. Tell us what you're seeing right now.",

Jim, what more are you learning about what we've heard from the IDF on today's strike in the southern suburbs, and importantly, any news about the targets in the city center? JIM SCIUTTO, CNN CHIEF U.S. SECURITY ANALYST: The IDF is not being public about their targets right now. But this is clearly an uptick in the number of strikes, but also the location of those strikes, which further reinforces that this is very much a multi front war right now that the strikes continue in Gaza, Israeli strikes in Gaza quite deadly ones. There is now a ground component to Israeli operations in Lebanon, and with the first deaths reported in the last 24 hours, there for Israeli forces. And of course, an expanding there was already quite an extensive air campaign, but an expanding air campaign by Israel in Lebanon, not just in the south, and not just in southern Beirut, but now increasingly in Central Beirut. And of course, just a reminder, there were Israeli strikes inside Yemen against Houthi targets just in the last several days. And now, of course, consideration about Israeli retaliation against Iran. That is a multi-front war under way, and of course, there's incoming fire here as well. We had that massive Iranian missile barrage a couple of nights ago. And last night, our team here watched Israeli air defenses kick into action to take out what the IDF now says were drones fired towards Central Israel, including here in Tel Aviv. So of course, the fear had been for weeks and months that this war has expand -- expanding and it is expanding. And then if I could add one more front that is Israeli strikes inside Syria against targets there, notably in and around a Russian base in Syria. And that shows you just how quickly this conflict can bring in other players, right, whether or not they want to be involved. But that speaks to a broader expansion that well. It's been the worry of many watching this war closely for nearly a year.",

She's the President and Founder of the International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance, and she's a Former CNN Correspondent. Arwa, great to have you with us. You know, Lebanon has been heavily impacted over the years, not only by conflict, but other just really bad luck with the Beirut blast as well. And you've got an economy that's really under pressure. You've got people that have experienced so much trauma, you're seeing these strikes occurring now in a very big way. What can you tell us about what you're hearing from people on the ground right now, and their reaction to what seems to be a war on Hezbollah, but clearly infiltrating the very essence of people's lives? ARWA DAMON, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, INTERNATIONAL NETWORK FOR AID, RELIEF &amp; ASSISTANCE: Well, the vast majority of people that you talk to here, Eleni very much feel as if this is a war on all of Lebanon and on everybody who happens to be in this country, no matter where they are. Look, I was actually just at the home of one of the children and families that -- has supported previously to all of this. And they were hosting two families from the south, and there was a little girl there who was about six or seven years old, and she just sat, bringing her hands like this the whole time, barely speaking, because she was traumatized by what had happened in the south and the bombardment that forced her to flee. And then, of course, hearing all of the bombardment that was taking place in Beirut. And those last explosions that you all have been talking about were very loud. And it's just a brief, you know, sort of indication of just the level of trauma that everyone here is going through. And you know, you talk to people, and given everything that you mentioned there, everything that the Lebanese have gone through, you really get this sense that -- you know psychologically speaking, they're stuck in the freeze traumatic response, and they're absolutely petrified because they've been watching what has been happening to Gaza. They know that Gazans have been live streaming their own slaughter, and that it hasn't stopped, and they're terrified that that's exactly what's going to be happening to them here.",

Yes, you hear these statements coming from the Israeli side, saying that their operation, this ground incursion, into Southern Lebanon, is only limited and targeted. But when you speak to people here, no one believes this. They say, look back at history. 1982 when you had the Israelis launch what was going -- what they said was going to be a limited incursion, and that turned into a full-scale invasion, and years of military occupation of Southern Lebanon and even more recent history. What is happening in Gaza, as Arwa was saying there, is a lot of people would tell you they heard that same sort of rhetoric, the sort of promises in Gaza, for example, in the south with limited operations. And here we are now. And everyone from officials to the people on the street. When you speak to them, they are really terrified of seeing a repeat of what's happening in Gaza, happening here in Lebanon. What some have described as the Gazification of Lebanon? I mean, you look at what's happening Eleni. Look at the numbers when you talk about more than a million people who have been displaced from their homes within a matter of days. And you're talking about different parts of the country, whether it's Southern Lebanon, whether it's in the East in the Bekaa region, or here from the southern suburbs, where we have seen a mass exodus, where you still have people out on the streets, and people are being displaced again. I mean, even last night, that central Beirut strike, not far from where you have some internally displaced families who were staying close to that area. And we went and we spoke to some of those families today, and they said that a lot of people had to move again, because even the area where they thought they were going to be safe is no longer safe they feel. And then you have these evacuation orders, people seeing these parallels to what's happening in Gaza. Evacuation orders, ongoing bombardment, and you know just this -- and the numbers of the people who have been killed and injured within a couple of weeks, more than 1000 people killed, thousands other injured with a health sector that is struggling to cope with the sheer number of casualties, and many of them are women and children. So, you can understand why people fear that they are seeing a repeat of what is happening in Gaza happen here. And they tell us, the international community did nothing to stop what's happening in Gaza, or is that going to be the case here? And that is a real, real fear Eleni.",

They say they struck targets belonging to Hezbollah's Intelligence Headquarters in Beirut, including operatives for Hezbollah's Intelligence Corps, which the IDF says in this statement, is responsible for intelligence about the IDF and the State of Israel. So that is the IDF's explanation for at least some of those strikes we've been seeing in the southern parts of Beirut. Of course, if we see -- as we seen from those strikes, though they're taking part in quite heavily populated areas, so as we continue to assess the damage, whether they struck those targets also, of course, the question will be whether civilians were caught up in that fire as well.",

We don't know how Israel is going to respond to Iran after the barrage of missiles into Israel earlier this week? We know these strikes are increasing into Lebanon as well.

Well, you can read those cancellations, given the part of the region that they cover, as a reaction to the expectation that Israelwill respond to those Iranian missile strikes by taking action against Iran. So, it looks like Emirates is clearing the airspace, as it were, between Israel and Iran, where those strikes might take place, or where those strikes might fly over on their way there, whether that be aircraft or missiles coming from Israel. Not clear yet how exactly Israel is going to respond and when and to what extent? But we do know that the menu, as it were, the list of options, has some quite extreme ones, including the possibility of striking Iranian nuclear facilities or perhaps oil facilities as well, which would have not just national security impacts and the prospect of widening the war, but also economic impacts. You can imagine a strike on Iranian oil facilities would have impacts on world oil markets as well, and then that has a carry-on effect of a potential impact on the U.S. election landscape. It is -- listen, it's already a wider war, that's fair. Is it an open conflict between the regional powers? No. But Israel is certainly at war on a number of fronts here, and every day there seems to be a new one.",

      "sentences": "You know, the U.S. has been in consultations with the Israelis over the last several daysabout how they should respond and really emphasizing that that should be proportional. But as you say, it's completely unclear at this point if Israel is actually going to heed that advice, because just last week, the U.S. was frankly embarrassed when the U.S. put out this proposal for a 21- day ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. And the Israelis had seemed poised to agree to that, but then, of course, we saw that they went ahead and they struck Beirut and killed Hassan Nasrallah, the Leader of Hezbollah. And so that really upended the U.S.'s plans here. Now, as you said, the Lebanese Foreign Minister did tell Christiane Amanpour yesterday that the that Hezbollah had agreed as well to that 21-day ceasefire before Nasrallah was killed. However, we should note that a senior administration official did tell my colleague, Alex Marquardt, they are not aware of that, and if that was indeed agreed to by Hezbollah, then it was not communicated to the United States. But still, you know, in consultations with the G7, the U.S. is trying to keep this proportional, this response. And it is a marked, you know, shift in tone from last April, when we heard the U.S. say, look, take the win. Don't respond to the Iranian attack on Israel. At the time, Israel, of course, did, in fact, end up responding to that, but it was very limited. And so now the U.S. is saying again, you know, actually now you do have the right to respond. And you should give the fact that this Iranian attack was so much larger than in April, but they're encouraging them not to hit Iranian nuclear facilities, which they believe could present a dramatic escalation of this conflict, and they're encouraging them to keep it small and proportional. Now again, whether Israel listens to that is another question entirely. They have decided really, that how they respond, of course, is going to be massive, according to what Bibi Netanyahu has said, that Iran is going to pay dearly for what the they did earlier this week. So, it remains to be seen how the Biden Administration is going to be threading this needle. Of course, the main source of leverage that they have are those weapons sales, those military equipment supplies that they provide to the Israelis. But it doesn't seem like at this point they're going to be using that leverage, Eleni.",

I thinkBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister and his coalition believe that this is a golden opportunity for Israel to really change the geopolitical landscape. Benjamin Netanyahu, as you said last week, he made it very clear this is a turning historical point. He wants to make the Middle East in his own image. He wants to destroy not only the Axis of Resistance, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis and the Iraqis and the Syrians. He wants to go for the head of the Axis of Resistance, Iran. My fear is that Israel could attack, not only the old facilities. It could really attack the nuclear program. As to the Americans, basically a statement that they would not really support an Israeli attack on nuclear weapon -- on nuclear program of Iran. I don't take it very seriously, because Benjamin Netanyahu knows very well that Joe Biden is a lame duck. That this is really a very transitional period. Benjamin Netanyahu can do anything and get away with it. I mean, look, think of the civilian casualties in Lebanon in the past. I mean, two weeks, have you heard a single word, a single word where I am here in the U.K. or the United States, condemnation of the killing of civilians, children, women and medics. And the reality is, I think what you have is that Benjamin Netanyahu is running the clock on Joe Biden because he wants his best ideological friend, Donald Trump, to recapture the White House, because Donald Trump has promised to give Benjamin Netanyahu what he wants. So, this is why I fear the worst. And regardless, even if he does not attack the Iran's nuclear program. If he attacks the oil fields, the Iran will most likely respond on a much, much bigger scale. So, the reality is either way, the situation really the future. The trend is escalation, more escalation, more escalation. And sadly, and tragically, really, more civilians will be killed and more civilians will be displaced.

But earlier it had begun striking without prior warning. Now, again, this is an area that has a heavy presence of Hezbollah. It is where Hezbollah Leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed. It's also an area where a lot of their top commanders were killed in the past couple of weeks, but this is, as you mentioned, this is still an area where it was one of the most heavily populated parts of the country, we have seen a mass exodus of people since, Eleni, when these air strikes really intensified.

And we need to go in there and try both to dismantle, to destroy the weapons that they had. There's an enormous amount of footage from the last 48 hours of the tunneling, subterranean system that those Hezbollah terror fighters built in those villages and towns right next to the border. So, it's very near the border. This isn't going in to conquer Lebanon. Why do you need in Israel telling people to move away? Because those forces move around on motorcycles and pickup trucks, and they are mobile, and they go from their tunnels onto the motorcycles and pickup trucks.",

As you can see, it's up 2.3 percent at just over $75 a barrel, and we've got WTI crude sitting at just under $72 a barrel. Significant moves in the oil price this week.

Now, as you mentioned, there is an OPEC agreement, now the collective cuts extend through the end of 2025. The real question would be, would Saudi Arabia, which has taken an additional million barrels off the market with a voluntary cut, if you had a supply disruption, would they face those barrels in. I think OPEC will be cautious about doing anything that upends a collective agreement, but there is certainly spare capacity.

But the question is, will that be sustained? Will it go higher? I think that will all depend on what is hit. What is the Iranian response? And again, I would look to what we saw in 2019 where the Iranians did hit tankers off the coast of UAE. They did hit critical pipelines at the East West pipeline, and they did hit Saudi Arabia's advocate facility, causing Saudi Arabia to temporarily shut down half of their production. Now Iran has and Saudi has normalized relations since March of 2023. So perhaps Iran would not want to target Saudi Arabia this time around, but there are also other facilities in the region that could be targeted in the event of a full-scale war scenario. And we couldn't rule out, for example, that Iraq's oil facilities could be potentially targeted. We do have Iranian backed militias in Iraq. So, there's a lot of regional energy infrastructure that will be paying very close attention to.",
