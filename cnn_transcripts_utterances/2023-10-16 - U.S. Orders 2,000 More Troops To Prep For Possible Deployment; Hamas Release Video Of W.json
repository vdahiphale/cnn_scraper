The family of a hostage just sharing new photos with OUTFRONT. And also this hour, inside the massacre. We are going to take you to a community that suffered some of the greatest losses in the Hamas terror attacks, more than 100 people were slaughtered there. Homes torched and the chilling evidence that Hamas was going to take many, many more lives. And we'll check back in with Yoni Asher, whose wife and two young daughters were taken hostage. Yoni opening up about the guilt he feels for not being able to rescue them and why he wanted to show us his little girls' shoes. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. Welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. I'm Erin Burnett, live from Tel Aviv tonight. And we begin this hour with the breaking news. American troops on notice. The Pentagon has told roughly 2,000 U.S. troops to prepare for potential deployment to support Israel, a second carrier strike group has also been deployed to the region. This order coming as President Biden weighs a trip to Israel. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is in the region at this hour. He was here today trying to stop the deadly violence in Israel and Gaza from spreading. While he was here in Tel Aviv, air raid sirens blaring overhead, disrupting a high-stakes meeting with Israel's war cabinet. And those strikes here in Tel Aviv have been constant throughout this day. This is video from earlier this evening of Israel's Iron Dome taking out what appears to be live rockets. Not far from where we are broadcasting this evening. It comes as Hamas releases a video that the group says is of one of the hostages, 21-year-old Mia Shem (ph). Her family just moments ago providing us these pictures of her from before she was captured. This is the first hostage video that Hamas has released of any of the 199 people believed to have been held by Hamas. And CNN has decided not to air it. But in the video she says she suffered an arm injury and was brought to Gaza. In a moment, I'm going to be speaking with her mother. But now, in a moment, we're going to check in again with Yoni Asher. His wife, two young daughters and his mother-in-law were all taken hostage. We have spoken to him several times after he recognized his family in this viral video. His daughter is huddled in the back of the truck. He spoke to me about the incredible amount of guilt that he feels for not being there for his girls. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) YONI ASHER, WIFE, DAUGHTERS, MOTHER-IN-LAW TAKEN HOSTAGE BY HAMAS: You know, the worst thing as a family, I have three girls, a wife and two little babies, is this guilt, this guilt. Why are you not coming to get us? I'm thinking about them sitting there maybe if they're alive and thinking, why daddy's not coming. I can't, I want to. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We reported earlier from an Israeli military base not far from the border. And while we were there today, we, of course, saw the Iron Dome at work. Israel's Iron Dome, this is a base that we saw clearly at war. Mats lined up on the ground for troops to sleep, hundreds of them out in the open air. There is little time, though, are of course, to sleep. These troops are ready to act at a moment's notice. We'll have our team of reporters standing by right now ready to give you the very latest on this story on the Gaza border. We also begin with -- and Oren Liebermann at the Pentagon. I do want to start with you, though, Nic, along the Gaza border. And, Nic, what -- as I mentioned, we have these new photos of Mia shared with us by her family from before she was captured.

      "sentences": "Two different moves here, both of them significant. A marine rapid response force is moving towards the waters off the coast of Israel. The 26th marine expeditionary unit on the Gulf of Oman, on the USS Bataan, which is itself an amphibious assault ship is now making its way towards Israel, according to a defense official familiar with the plans.Keep in mind that the amount of U.S. military assets and capabilities they're already near Israel. The USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group is in the Eastern Mid. The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group is headed towards the Eastern Mid and should arrive in just a couple of weeks. So, there is more military assets as the U.S. tries to do two almost contradictory things it seems. One is a show of support for Israel and a message of deterrence for Iran and Iranian proxies in the region. And the second is to try not to get directly involved militarily in a conflict that right now is between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. So, more assets in the region and more U.S. involvement as it sees this conflict, a very hot conflict between Israel and Gaza. At the same time, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued orders yesterday for 2,000 troops to be ready for possible deployment to Israel. These are not combat troops. They are not intended to get involved in combat according to U.S. -- multiple U.S. officials. But they are support troops for the possibility of planning logistics and medical assistance if that order comes. More options for President Joe Biden as he decides what to do and how to handle this along with his national security leadership, Erin.",

      "sentences": "Oren, thank you very much at the Pentagon.And I want to go now to retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling, the former Army commanding general for the Seventh Army. And also joining me now is Chuck Pfarrer, he's a former SEAL Team 6 squadron leader who has gone all over the world doing hostage rescues. So, much to talk to both of you. General Hertling, U.S. officials have stressed that there are no plans to put American boots on the ground to fight in this war. So then why would the marines go in to strike groups, all of this every day more and more? How big do you think this war may get? LT. GENERAL MARK HERTLING (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Well, Erin, you have to understand that the makeup of a strike group, first of all, a marine rapid response force is about 2,000 soldiers, and that's exactly what is part of the Ford group. They were in Oman conducting theater security cooperation exercises with governments in the area, militaries in the area. So they were pulled off of that exercise, put back on their ship, the Bataan, and sent as part of the strike group into that area. It's a prudent move. It's to get forces in the area to handle any contingency that might arise. And those contingencies fall along an entire spectrum of things. Along with the Ford and the Eisenhower strike group, one has been in the area for about six months, the Ford, they were getting ready to leave the area, be replaced by the Eisenhower. So it was a prudent move to actually ask the Eisenhower group or task them to go forward earlier to have two carrier strike groups in the area. It is a show of force. Make no mistake about that. But it's also to handle any kind of contingencies. And I think the deterrence effort is to prevent this from turning into a wider conflict than it already is.",

There are different outcomes whenever a terrorist group sends a proof of life video. Sometimes the terrorist captors are in the video. It didn't seem like, although there was someone there, you never saw anyone else's face.It appeared that she was talking under duress, which is understandable, and, as Chuck said, her arm was being bandaged as she was talking. And it looked like it was either broken or sprained or something. So, all of those things are factors in this. But it's also showing Hamas, at the same time they released this, they were talking about having more hostages than what Israel had already concluded. Israel saying 199, they said between 250. So that tells me there's more -- it's an opportunity for them to say, hey, Israel, you don't know everything you think you know. So all of those things are factors in intelligence-gathering.",

He is missing his wife and his two young daughters. They were taken while visiting his mother-in-law near Gaza.

You can see a gunman placing a cloth over his wife's head. His mother-in-law and his two daughters are huddled in the back of the truck. After seeing this video, Yoni tried to track his wife's location. It said her phone was in Gaza. Well, we have been checking in with Yoni ever since then. And I was able to meet him in person over the weekend, traveling to his home north of Tel Aviv. Here's our conversation.

He was fighting about six hours outside of the kibbutz, and killing terrorists as much as he could until he got to the clinic in kibbutz Be'eri where there were a few people who got injured. And they -- he and unfortunately a friend of mine also passed. They were securing the injured people. When a lot of terrorists came in and attacked them, they managed to kill 12, I think. More and more came in, and they just could not handle it. And at some point in the time as much as I could understand someone threw a grenade.

She says she was injured in her arm and taken to Gaza. We are not airing the video. But these are photos of Mia that her family shared with OUTFRONT after her video was released. OUTFRONT now, Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Conricus, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson. Colonel, I appreciate your time. I'm glad to speak with you again.
