I'm Kaitlan Collins here in New York. And moments ago, Robert Costello's cross-examination by the prosecution just finished. Now, Trump's attorneys are back up at the stand, and what a morning it has been. Even though he has only briefly been on the witness stand, we saw prosecutors interrogating Robert Costello about emails that he sent to Michael Cohen, very clearly attempting to represent him after the FBI searched his home, his hotel room, and his office in 2018. And Paula Reid and John Berman are back here with me. And, Paula, I mean, there was an amazing moment where Susan Hoffinger, the prosecutor, was just asking Robert Costello about that testimony in front of Congress last week, which was clearly designed to get Donald Trump's attention. And Robert Costello said he wasn't -- he didn't know that his comments he made there about Michael Cohen claiming he was a liar would be reported in the press, which I think is kind of difficult to really take at face value because you're testifying for a committee and the former president's allies.",

And speaking of the Robert Costello Testimony origin story, as we've reported, Bob Costello was never expected to be part of the defense strategy But there are several people in Trump's orbit who wanted him to testify because they believe that he could help undercut Michael Cohen's credibility. He was the only defense witness to testify before the grand jury.Now, he was not able to stave off an indictment, but that's a lower standard So, even though the defense team did not want to call Costello, Trump allies, again, they had Costello testify before Congress, knowing it would likely get Trump's attention, and indeed it did. He was very impressed with how he attacked Michael Cohen, attacked the case, attacked the judge and pushed for Costello to take the stand over objections from some members of the defense team. And now what we're seeing here is this is a bit of a mess. It's not doing what was intended to do. It's not going to make or break the case, but this is a forced error. And it's something that not the lawyers were pushing for, but the client was pushing for, because people in his orbit thought it would be a good idea.",

He's denying that it would be characterized as a backchannel.But then we saw emails where he was complaining about Michael Cohen playing them and slow rolling them, where Michael Cohen was later saying he was not going with them to represent him.",

The defense worked so hard to make people dislike Michael Cohen. But now the prosecution is seizing on this guy that they may be able to dislike even more. This guy who was completely unnecessary, probably, to this case, is now being put on trial. First, you know, look, Michael Cohen's not on trial, but the defense tried to put him on trial.

I mean, you know, if you're not sitting in the courtroom watching the entire trial, there's always a little bit of speculation to it. And, look, the fact that they're apparently scoring some points on cross-examination doesn't mean that it destroys all of the direct.I mean, I understood Costello to be coming in to basically say once again Michael Cohen has lied about a whole bunch of stuff and that's not necessarily a bad idea. You can't really tell from the outside or even as a litigant whether you've gotten to a point where the cross was so devastating of Cohen that you're going to get a 12-juror unanimous acquittal or you're going to get some portion of them to dig in and acquit or dig in and hang the jury because they can't trust Cohen. So, you know, hindsight will be more precise than anything else. But I think Costello had some stuff to offer. I don't think it's great to pick a fight with the judge, which apparently he did. I also think it's kind of amazing how thin skinned New York judges are. You know, it's the most thick skinned part of the country, but they're thin skinned on the bench. And, frankly, it's a mistake, it's a legal error to clear the courtroom. If you want to clear it, get the jury to go out and say, like your last guest just said, take a little break here and then chastise the witness for giving you a side eye, you can do it. But, you know, the public trial right is a serious constitutional right for the public and for the defendant.

And that's a danger and that's the kind of thing you have to talk about in trial prep, which is like, you know, Bob, do me a favor, don't pick a fight for no reason. Let me do the lawyering. You're just a witness. You know, it's true, doctors are their own worst patients. Lawyers can be their own worst witnesses.But I think that all in all, it doesn't, it doesn't mean the jury is disconnected from what he had to offer about Cohen on direct. And so that's, that's the wild card. We're not going to know until we see a verdict or a non-verdict. But you're right, Jake. I mean, I would certainly want to spend a little bit of time with the witness saying, look, I know you're very opinionated, I know you've said some things, I know you've been on the media a lot before you testify, which is never great, but don't come in and pick a fight with the judge.",

And so the allegation at the timing of the Access Hollywood tape in particular would have been the straw that they believe broke the camel's back, not the catch and kill scheme.

Why is all of a sudden now, two weeks before election day, is Donald Trump so worried about this becoming public? That's number one. Number two, I think that there's testimony from Hope Hicks that is very effective about Michael Cohen didn't go rogue. And she's a sympathetic witness, she's not a hostile witness to Donald Trump, same for David Pecker in laying it out. And I would argue, and, Bill, you mentioned this, how is the judge going to give instructions on whether this is about you're worried about your wife, or you're worried about the election? One of the -- Stormy Daniels was able to say on the stand, if the jury believes her, that Trump told her don't worry about Melania, that they sleep in separate beds, and that he didn't use a condom in the alleged incident. If you want to talk about the ultimate thing that says you don't care about your spouse, if the jury believes that, then, to me, that tips it to election interference.
