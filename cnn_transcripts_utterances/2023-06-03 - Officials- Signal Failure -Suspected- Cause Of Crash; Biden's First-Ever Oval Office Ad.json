We have -- Indian Railroad officials have told CNN, as you mentioned, that they believe that it could have been a signaling failure of some sort. And that could have either been human error or some kind of technical breakdown. The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, he was supposed to be launching a brand new high-speed train today. And instead, he rushed to the scene of this disaster to meet with some of the survivors to express his condolences, and also to vow for some kind of justice saying whoever was responsible for this would have to pay for this. Now, Paula, the Indian railroad network is massive. You have more than 13 million people a day who move around on trains in this country. And sadly, there is a track record for deadly accidents and disasters, but perhaps nothing quite on this scale, which has really stunned people. So you had long lines of volunteers who were trying to donate blood to help some of the survivors and coals, of course, for upgrading aging infrastructure and improving the safety records after this terrible accident, which still has people very much reeling, Paula.",

In his first ever Oval Office address last night, President Biden said the consequences of not getting a deal done could have been catastrophic. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: Passing this budget agreement was critical. The stakes could not have been higher. If we had failed to reach an agreement on the budget, there were extreme voices threatening to take America for the first time in our 247-year history into a default on our national debt. Nothing, nothing would have been more irresponsible. Nothing would have been more catastrophic. No one got everything they want, but the American people got what they needed. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The problem is the President's done none of those things. He said he didn't have the documents, they ultimately found the documents. He had them in his possession, he may have even knowingly had them and moved them around. That's all the problems that make it harder now for the President to be exonerated.The other thing, though, Paula, is, you know, we're talking about a former president who's running for reelection against the president whose special prosecutor might be prosecuting him. This is fraught with political challenges for the Justice Department, for the White House, for the special prosecutor, and Pence having now been exonerated makes it even harder to bring charges against President Trump because he says, look, you're already, you know, letting one guy go, why am I being targeted?

RICK HALLERAN, CHIEF, IOWA TASK FORCE 1: And we need to be concerned for those that are in the site working as well as anyone else that could be inside.

YouTube says it has removed tens of thousands of videos under this policy, but it no longer believes removing such content reduces the risk of real-world harm or violence. This comes as many tech platforms are trying to weigh how to protect users' free speech while trying to mitigate some of the risks of misinformation in the leadup to the 2024 presidential election. YouTube says that other elements of its election misinformation policies still remain in place, including prohibitions on content that could mislead users about how and when to vote. The company says it also plans to release additional information about its plans ahead of the 2024 presidential election in the coming months. Clare Duffy, CNN, New York. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Live is a relative term here.These were taken about every 48 or 58 seconds, still photos, then transmitted back and over 187 million miles. That took 16 or 17 minutes per picture. So not live like we would know it. And it was taken from an orbiter going around the planet. It wasn't something on the surface. So in some ways, underwhelming. But in other ways, really interesting because this was to celebrate the 20t h anniversary of the Mars Express orbiter, which has been up there going around the planet. Helping us understand what surface conditions are like, what the geology is like. It's helped to research the ideas of water and ice on Mars and the general geology of Mars. When you put that together with all the other exploration of Mars that has been done by other probes and satellites, some from NASA, things that have landed on the surface and looked around. It's deepening our knowledge of this planet, the next one out from the sun beyond us, beyond that big asteroid belt and beyond Jupiter. So it's deepening our knowledge of this planet and paving a way for what we need to know if we actually want to send people on that roughly nine-month voyage, depending on the position of the planets. And have them walk on this very surface that we've only been able to see in pictures. And now, at least in a way, live pictures. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Sustained winds right now are about 35 miles per hour.To put it in perspective, a tropical storm is 40 miles per hour. We're really not that much in terms of how the storm has weakened over the last few hours. However, because of its proximity to Cuba and the United States, specifically Florida, those outflow winds are still helping to trigger some showers and thunderstorms across the southern portion of the state. You've got a lot of showers, some lightning. Also, if you have any beach plans this weekend, we're also going to see an increase in high surf as well as rip currents in the area. Several things to watch for there. The storm is expected to continue to move south and gradually more eastward over the next 24 to 36 hours. As it does so, it's still going to help produce more rainfall. Most widespread areas likely to pick up one to three inches, but it's not out of the question for some locations in the southern half of the state to pick up four or maybe up to five inches total over that 48- hour time period this weekend. That's why we do have several counties under flood watches, not only for today, some of them even carrying over into tomorrow. But even the areas that aren't under the flood watch, Tampa, Naples, all the way down to Key West, all still have very high rain chances not only today, but also for tomorrow. Elsewhere across the country, we have rain across the high plains and very warm temperatures across the Midwest. One thing to note, though, even though we have the potential for several records, more of that heat finally begins to retreat by next week. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
