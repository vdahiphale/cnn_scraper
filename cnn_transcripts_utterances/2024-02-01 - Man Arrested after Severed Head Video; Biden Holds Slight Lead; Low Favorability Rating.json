We don't know what the results of that wellness check was, whether they were able to talk to him or his family. But commonly in these things, unless you've broken a law and you say, yes, I'm good, there isn't a lot of action that they can take without the help of the family or direct intervention. There was also an investigation by the U.S. Marshals in that he was making what was considered threatening statements against one of the judges who had dismissed multiple of these frivolous lawsuits, including the lawsuit saying, I'm suing the federal government because they gave me the student loan that allowed me to go to college that made me not as successful as I hoped I would be and now they want to pay it back. But what we're seeing here is familiar to us. You know it, too. Think about what we've seen in just recent history. A man in Arlington, Virginia, blows his house to smithereens after filing multiple ridiculous lawsuits and living in a world of paranoia and not getting the kind of intervention that he needed. An individual storms the FBI office in Cincinnati because he's mad that the FBI are arresting January 6th people who stormed the Capitol. Every few weeks we see one of these. What the behavioral science experts call an injustice collector, everything is going wrong in their life, none of it is their fault, it's the deep state, it's the migrants, it's that they're a white male or some - some other thing that in these echo chambers, in these chat rooms on the internet.

He was disrupted a couple times at that event. And I think it links back to 2016. There was a big split between kind of union leadership and kind of where they were and rank and file voters. That's where you have Trump still pitching himself to the Teamsters. He knows he's not going to get probably that top line endorsement, but he's trying to have a kind of brand recognition so that he can pull off enough people there. I think that might be a little tougher because, you know, to Phil's point, Donald Trump has lost some branding with that kind of moderate, working class person from 2016 to now.

I mean, I never seen, you know, a kid that worked as hard as he did, that grinded every day to try to make himself better. Like he says, each and every day. It was just crazy. I -- we would be out, you know, shooting baskets 10:00, 11:00 p.m. at night and I would tell him, I said, ain't nobody out here working but, you know, me, you and Michael Jordan. We're the only three guys that are out here working, trying to get better. And he took it and he ran with it.
