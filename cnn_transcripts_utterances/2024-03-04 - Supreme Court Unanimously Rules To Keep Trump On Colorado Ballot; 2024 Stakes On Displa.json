Secretary of State Jena Griswold is joining us live.Also tonight, the huge stakes of the 2024 election are on vivid display this week as Trump aims to sweep Super Tuesday contests tomorrow and President Biden prepares for his critical State of the Union Address Thursday while also facing dismal new poll numbers. And there's more breaking news. Vice President Kamala Harris just wrapped up talks with a top political rival of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu escalating the Biden administration's push for an immediate six-week ceasefire in Gaza. We're getting a readout of the meeting. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in The Situation Room. The Colorado secretary of state is standing by to discuss the consequences of the U.S. Supreme Court's unanimous rejection of her state's efforts to remove Donald Trump from the presidential ballot. I'll speak with her in just a moment. But, first, let's get a breakdown of the landmark high court decision from CNN Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Paula Reid. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAULA REID, CNN CHIEF LEGAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Former President Trump today claims the Supreme Court has unified the country by securing his place on the 2024 ballot. DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The voters can take the person out of the race very quickly, but a court shouldn't be doing that and the Supreme Court saw that very well, and I really do believe that will be a unifying factor.",

States may disqualify persons holding or attempting to hold state office, but states have no power under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the presidency.The justices warned that allowing states to each make different decisions about ballot eligibility would result in a patchwork creating chaos around elections. The victory for Trump was expected after February oral arguments, where justices from both sides of the aisle appeared skeptical of Colorado's case. JUSTICE ELENA KAGAN, U.S. SUPREME COURT: I think that the question that you have to confront is why a single state should decide who gets to be president of the United States.",

OF STATE JENA GRISWOLD (D-CO): Well, thank you for having me on. First and foremost, I'm glad that they issued a decision. Colorado voters and American voters all across the country deserve to know whether Donald Trump is qualified or not as we go into Super Tuesday. But in terms of the bigger decision, I am disappointed. We believe that it's up to Colorado or any state to determine whether to disqualify oath-breaking insurrectionists from our ballots.

Although Congress could act, it's highly unlikely with such a Congress that we have that just doesn't function very well.

Because they believe that it's inappropriate for one state to decide how the rest of, essentially, the union will be able to operate. But their role is, hold on, if I'm in charge of my own state elections, then why would I not be in that best position here for my own voters?

There were some crazy ones, like saying the president -- Trump argued, the president is not an officer of the United States. That would have been a head scratcher to me if the Supreme Court nine justices agreed on that. This is one where reasonable minds can disagree.

A 9-0 unanimous Supreme Court decision is just something we saw him do it this afternoon. You could just take out and sell on the campaign trail as validation. Now, I know this wasn't the thorniest or trickiest of all the legal issues he faces and that he had a pretty strong case here to take before the Supreme Court, but that is still sort of a feather in his cap now to -- as he's trying to do away with all of these legal challenges, to get a 9-0 Supreme Court decision on one that keeps you on the ballot is no small thing.",

Well, that seems to be a much stronger argument in favor of not allowing a president to be immune, which would be the other side of the coin for the Supreme Court not having a win for Donald Trump. Now, if they are inclined to make us a political calculation, that would be outwardly surprising, but there's a legal argument as to why he would not have immunity as opposed to one strong in the other direction. Either way, if the timing holds, it took about a month to actually have a decision. If you have an oral argument in April, on April 22nd, if it's a month from then you have an actual decision, well, there might, in fact, be some time on the clock before the election to have some meaningful arguments or a trial.",

But, of course, all of this spotlights the possibility, the alternative that Gantz represents not only here in Israel but also in the United States, where U.S. officials have been growing increasingly frustrated with the current Israeli prime minister.

The one thing to keep in mind when we're talking about this ballot case is that Donald Trump and his team believed they were going to win. They watched the oral arguments, they thought their team did really well, and they actually believed that this case was the case they had the most legal evidence to prove. And so after the win, of course, Donald Trump taking a victory lap, as you said, but then moving on to immunity.

Number one, it sends a signal that the United States stands with Israel and that we have not forgotten the horror that was visited on Israel on October 7th, and the necessity, the righteous necessity to make sure that Hamas is not an operative force ever again. It also, and I imagine that behind closed doors this message was delivered, is essential that the conflict in Gaza, the Israeli attacks in Gaza happened in a different way than they have these many months in a way that is much more consistent with the kind of humanitarian improvement we would like to see in Gaza, and in which Hamas is the target and in which there is much less damage done, fatalities, casualties amongst the civilian population.",

Number one, that what happened on October 7th, what was perpetrated by Hamas was inexcusable, was barbaric and was monstrous, and that Hamas must cease to be a player in the region and on the global stage. It is also true that 30,000 dead Gazans is not a tenable situation, that a humanitarian crisis in which Gazans are not getting enough nutrition, not getting the medicine. That is also untenable. So, again, sadly in this conflict, people have a tendency to take sides. We have to remember that the life of an Israeli and the life of a Gazan are morally equivalent and that we shouldn't take sides. And that, yes, we need to prosecute the war were against Hamas, but we need to do it in a way that is different, frankly, from the way we have seen the war undertaken in these last several months.",

More recently, Coy Griffin, a county commissioner in New Mexico, was removed from office in 2022 on 14th Amendment grounds, because he actually was a convicted January 6 rioter.

Our route driving through Port-au-Prince with sometimes change hourly, given gunfire and violence, abrupt -- erupted, unpredictably, honestly. And we notice kidnappings, extortions were rampant.
