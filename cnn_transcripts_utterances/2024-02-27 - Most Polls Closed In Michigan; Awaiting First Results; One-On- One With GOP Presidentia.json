We're going to get our first chance to project winners once the last polling place is closed less than an hour from now.In the Democratic primary, President Biden might be facing his most serious challenge yet this election year. Not from his long shot opponents, Congressman Dean Phillips. No. From progressives who are opposed to the President's response to the Israel-Hamas war. This group of progressives, they are pushing for a permanent ceasefire and they want Biden to cut U.S. military aid to Israel. And they are urging Michigan Democrats to cast a protest vote, to vote for uncommitted in the primary instead of voting for President Biden. The war in Gaza is an issue that hits hard in Michigan, which has one of the largest Arab American populations in the United States. And we're going to be watching to see the size of this uncommitted vote to gauge dissent within the President's party as he heads toward his widely anticipated rematch with Donald Trump. Now, President Biden narrowly beat Trump in Michigan four years ago. The state should prove to be decisive once again in November. In the Republican primary, Trump is aiming for yet another big win over his rival, Nikki Haley, just a few days after trouncing her in her home state of South Carolina, Trump is counting on Michigan and its 55 Republican delegates to propel him even closer to clenching the GOP nomination. As we await the first results tonight, our correspondents are standing by. They're covering the candidates. They're at key polling places throughout Michigan. First to Jeff Zeleny, who's covering the Democrats tonight and he's at an event in Dearborn, Michigan for supporters of that protest vote for uncommitted.",

Going to give us a few key data points about what voters are thinking about his policies, of course, his handling of Israel's war in Gaza. We are here in Dearborn, Michigan, of course. This is a - at the heart of the Arab American and Muslim American community. They have been key supporters of the President. They certainly were in 2020. Not anymore, Jake. We've been here talking to voters. We were a few weeks ago as well when the President was in town. The anger is clear. The disappointment is clear. They want a change. So this is a protest vote, voting uncommitted. But the question is how many people actually turn out to vote uncommitted. Now, that may not be our best guide tonight because this, of course, is a non-competitive election. President Biden is not facing a challenger per se, just his policies are being challenged. But talking with Democratic officials, of course, one of the President's biggest challenges is keeping his coalition together. Of course, that's Arab American, Muslim American voters, but it's also young voters, progressive voters, black voters, Latino voters. Of course, Michigan was ground zero for that. Joe Biden sort of pulled all of those factions of the Democratic Party together four years ago. Now that coalition is fraying. But Jake, I had an instructive conversation with a pastor here in Detroit earlier today. He said the biggest worry for the White House, the biggest worry for the Biden campaign is apathetic voters. He said apathetic voters don't go out and vote uncommitted. They simply stay home, and that, he believes, is the biggest worry for President Biden. Jake?",

As you noted, Jake, Donald Trump won Michigan in 2016 and then lost to Biden in 2020. And in a recent poll in Fox News of Michigan voters, they looked at a hypothetical rematch between the two, and Trump had 47 percent of support over Biden's 45. Now that is well within the margin of error, but gives you an idea of how close this race could potentially be.Now, many of Trump's allies believe that Michigan is the key to the pathway back to the White House. And here's what they're looking for tonight, they are looking at first, moderate Republican voters. So far in this primary season, they have leaned away from the former president. The other thing that they are looking for is an area that Donald Trump has underperformed in, in several of these contests, which is suburban voters. This is going to be critical in Michigan in the fall. Now, one of the hopes of these advisors is that with all of these resounding early wins in Nevada, in Iowa, in New Hampshire, that some of those voters, some of those moderates, some of those suburban voters are going to shift towards Donald Trump.",

On the Republican side, in the Republican primary in Michigan with 1 percent of the vote in, Donald Trump is in the lead with 54.4 percent of the vote. He has 10,950 votes, roughly 3,000 votes ahead of Nikki Haley, who has 39.8 percent of the vote. She has 8,011 votes. Obviously, it is very early. We only have 1 percent of the vote in, but those are actual votes, not polls. And now we have some Democratic numbers to look at. And the Democratic primary in the state of Michigan with 117 delegates at stake, President Joe Biden, the incumbent, with 4 percent of the vote in, has 88.3 percent of the vote. Uncommitted is coming in second. That's at 7.2 percent. And Dean Phillips, the congressman from Minnesota, is at 2.1 percent. President Joe Biden has 31,753 votes, and that is roughly 30,000 votes ahead of uncommitted, which is a number we're going to be watching all night. John King, I see he's starting there with Haley and Trump. But the truth of the matter is, for both Democrats and Republicans, one of the things we're going to be looking at tonight is the size of the number two vote to see how much of a protest that is of the person in the first place.",

And then on the Republican side, 159 for Trump, Nikki Haley, 21, and Ron DeSantis, who of course we know announced the suspension of his campaign, got five votes. We have two districts here. So that is for District 9. On the Precinct 6 side of things, which is the one that was tallying votes over there, you can see them finalizing just a little bit of what they've got, but they too have transmitted their votes to the county. They had a lot more on the Republican side. Trump, 202 votes, Nikki Haley, 28 votes, uncommitted, three, again, preliminary numbers that they've told us here. And then the Democratic side, it was a lot fewer, 13 for Joe Biden, two for Dean Phillips, and five for uncommitted. Again, preliminarily is what they told us here. It kind of falls into - in line with what we heard as far as a wide range of opinions from voters here today. We heard from very strong Biden supporters who felt the most important issues to them were the economy and feeling like they needed to have someone they could trust in the White House, but of course, strong Trump supporters and some who just couldn't vote for Joe Biden this time around.",

      "sentences": "Right. So if you look at roughly 20,000, and I think that's - history says that's a fair number, one of the dynamics sometimes in those uncommitted votes is a certain candidate decides not to contest the state. Back in 2008, the uncommitted vote was way higher, because both Barack Obama and John Edwards didn't play in Michigan, and their voters voted uncommitted to sort of say, I want to go out and vote for my guy, but I can't vote for my guy. So it was much higher then.   So the question this time, though, is there's nobody like that.There's not another Democratic candidate who said, oh, I'm going to skip Michigan, because Biden's strong there. So that, I think, is a true protest vote, as opposed to years past where there were different reasons for it. Or it's - maybe - let's not overstate that it's all about Israel-Gaza. Uncommitted is going to tell us people who had a chance to vote for an incumbent Democratic president or vote for his long-shot challenger, and they chose to vote uncommitted. So it tells you, number one, they're unhappy. They're looking for something else than that. And then the question is, and our reporters on the ground will help us, how much of it is Israel-Gaza, how much of it is repairable and how much of it may be irreparable. There are at the front page of the Arab American News, six, eight weeks back, was abandon Biden. And when you talk to them out there, and you say, but that might help Trump win, some say, I'll think about that closer to November. Others say, I don't care, that this is a matter of principle, that I'm going to vote against Biden on a matter of principle, and if Trump wins, so be it. That's the challenge for the President. That's why his National Security advisor was - his deputy National Security advisor was out there last week. That's why Ro Khanna, the Democratic House member, was out there last week trying to help him. That's why the campaign team was out there. This is a full-court press, and congressman - Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, who you know is from right down here in Detroit area, she has been - they'll call it a five-alarm fire.

Now, on the Republican side, we have six votes for Nikki Haley, 15 for Donald Trump, and three for uncommitted, a total of 112 votes at this precinct.   But look, I did, I spoke with many uncommitted voters here in Ann Arbor, several of them telling me they are not a part of the Arab American community, but that this resonates with them, and this is their opportunity, they said, to have that protest, to let the President, who they did plan to vote for, they said, in November, hear what they have to say about this particular issue.",

It's what does this tell us about November.And looking back in history, just go back to 2016, there was a very, very intense primary in Michigan between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was going to win that primary. Bernie Sanders eked it out. And if you fast forward to the fall of 2016, Hillary Clinton ended up losing Michigan. And so that's one of many examples throughout recent history of places like Michigan. And Michigan itself being a harbinger for problems that a candidate has in a primary that bear out in the general election.

Because we all know politics is a game of addition, right? You need a unified base of support from your own partisans to be in the ballgame for a general election.And so looking for cracks in the Biden coalition in these Democratic vote tallies tonight is what we're looking for. I mean, I'll just note, with 7 percent of the estimated vote in now, the uncommitted vote is already at 11,607 raw votes. So they've already crossed the ridiculously low expectation setting that they had set for 10,000, but we've only got 7 percent of the estimated vote in. So they're at 11,000 now. That raw vote number is going to grow throughout this evening, perhaps substantially. So we'll see how much of a protest statement is made here, but it doesn't mean - and this is important for us to remember all day long - that every single one of those uncommitted votes is a Donald Trump vote in the fall or a stay-at-home no-Joe Biden vote.

Some say abandon Biden, some just say protest Biden, that number is going to tell us a lot. When we see Wayne County, it's also the largest population center in the state of Michigan, so, we're going to get the most votes from here. It's the Democratic base. This is it. So critical for the president. What else are we seeing? So you just pop around a few other places. This is Oakland County. As I mentioned, critical to winning the state of Michigan, win Wayne County. Then you go out into the suburbs. You have Oakland here, Macomb here, 13 percent. You have 13.5 percent, 14 percent if you round that up. Again, you know, let's not -- let's be careful. He's getting 80 percent of the vote. He's the president of the United States, he's getting 80 percent of the vote. So if you're home and you're a Biden fan, you're saying, why aren't you focusing on that? And we should focus on that. That's 80 percent of the vote. But that's nobody. That's an \"I'm mad at you\" vote. And in a state that can be so hotly contested, Hillary Clinton loses it. She's not president. Joe Biden wins it. He is president. In a state that matters so much, the \"I'm mad at you\" vote matters. And so we come back out and look where else are we getting it. Kalamazoo again, the urban areas that are important. This -- you know, Joe Biden won this by 18 points in 2020. So again, in a place you want to run up the numbers come November. This is a place you want to run up the numbers to offset Donald Trump's rural strength. So you have, you know, some people you need to talk to. That's what that tells you. That's a good number, but in a Democratic primary, you know, Dean Phillips is getting nothing here. That's -- so that's not a \"I'm looking for an alternative\". There's an alternative right there. That's an \"I'm mad at you\" vote for the most part, or \"you don't like Phillips.\" And so, one more quick point, we'll switch to the Republicans. Jonah was just talking about this, and I think this is the fascinating debate as we go forward. At the moment, only 7 percent of the vote. Let's be patient with the results. But Nikki Haley is not winning any counties. Donald Trump's getting 64 percent of the vote. So the governor can clearly make the argument about a third of Republicans here. We'll see what that number ends up. But a third here, 40 percent of my home state of South Carolina, 43 percent in New Hampshire don't want Donald Trump. She's right. The math supports that. However, that's winning and that's getting the delegates 55 delegates at stake tonight. 16 of them are supposed to be awarded based on the primary results. But we're going to have two Republican conventions. If you want to go to a place where the Republican Party, the Trump effect, election denial, that has completely destroyed what used to be a strong, functioning Republican party, go to the state of Michigan. They have two Republican parties. They're fighting in court over which one's the real one. They will -- both of them will award delegates. Donald Trump will probably get all of them and then they'll fight it out in court.",

So really, we're focused on what this week looks like for her and what she will be able to do in terms of getting voters on her side in those Super Tuesday states ahead of that critical date for her a week from today. But one interesting thing, Jake, that I've been told by a campaign official, is that the Haley campaign isn't only looking at the results tonight on the Republican side in the Michigan primary. They're also looking at the results on the Democratic side because they believe that if there is a high number of uncommitted voters, that that could demonstrate a potential weakness for Biden with certain voting blocks. Now, I spoke with one campaign official who said, obviously, they don't expect that those voters who are voting uncommitted are fertile ground for Nikki Haley. They oppose Biden because of his position on the Israel-Hamas war. Haley's position on that isn't all that different, so it wouldn't attract those voters. But it's interesting because they're trying to look at Biden's weaknesses right now as they are talking about Haley being a better overall contender in the general election against Biden as she has been trying to go after Trump and his electability, saying that if he were the actual candidate on the Democratic -- on the Republican side, it would be like suicide for the party saying that earlier today.

And, you know, Governor Whitmer was on with Dana on Sunday and she pointed out that Donald Trump's relationship with the Arab American community, with the Muslim community is pretty checkered, and that people are going to have to think about that choice. She said a vote for uncommitted today is a vote for Donald Trump. Obviously, there are a fair number of people who wanted to make that vote. And I would also stress, we saw the Ann Arbor vote. This is an issue not just with the Arab American community, but it's a mission -- it's an issue with younger voters, which is a problem nationally for Biden motivating these younger voters and some African American voters.

You have to give credibility to the passion that many of these voters are coming out with that are voting uncommitted.The fact remains that there are a few things. One, this president has been working diligently towards a ceasefire. He has been working diligently towards humanitarian aid. And those things have to be recognized. And maybe it's a job of messaging from the White House. We know he just came out recently saying that this was something that could happen in the upcoming weeks. But the fact still remains that this is -- if you look at the results from tonight, right, and I think back to 2012 -- David knows this better than I do -- but in 2012, there were about 20,000 people that came out and voted uncommitted for Barack Obama. And he still won over Mitt Romney, who's a native of Michigan by nine points. And so while I do believe that you -- that there are certain changes that have to be made from this White House, this is not anything that you need to put your blinkers on or throw your hands up and say, oh, my God, this is something that is going to change the trajectory of the race. Because at the end of the day, and I think Nina will agree with me on this, voting uncommitted today is an exercise of your little d capabilities and your little d democratic values, but it's totally different than voting for Donald Trump in November. And I think that this -- I do not equate the two to be the same, and I disagree with Governor Whitmer on that, but I will say that this tonight does not give me any heartburn for Joe Biden. The heartburn that people should feel is that for Donald Trump, because there are a third of the people, 40 percent of the people who are outwardly rejecting Donald Trump again.

And an interesting fact point, just as we talk about the issue with Gaza is there are quite a few moderate Republicans who are inclined to vote for someone other than Donald Trump, and who could be won over by Joe Biden.

Donald Trump won this county by 40 points. So this is not something Joe Biden's worried about come November.Donald, you know, the Republican's going to win this. What you're just trying to see is the uncommitted vote is high. In these rural counties where you don't have as many Democrats, you tend to have more conservative Democrats if you do have them there. But, you know, so it's 7.5 percent up in these tiny rural counties, but then you come down. It's still a 16 percent statewide, you know, nearing 17,000 votes. And so we did get since last year visited our first votes from Wayne County. Just want to caution you, it's a tiny. This is one precinct, probably, you know, sample precinct similar, but still, you know, 23 percent right there. That to me is the question of the night. What is that percentage and what is that number in Wayne County? Because this is ground zero, if you will, of the discontent. Dearborn is right over here to the west of Detroit. Inside Detroit, you know, the liberal base is mad about this policy. On the Wayne State campus, they're mad about this policy. So this to me is ground zero. And if you want to run up the numbers statewide, this is where you would do it. So you come out and look, just you start to move around Kalamazoo again. You're moving west. You're getting out. It's almost, you know, it's 19 percent. But again, very early numbers. So let's be careful. So look, you have a very formidable front runner on the democratic side. He's not going to be beat. Joe Biden's going to beat the nominee. The question is, you know, the challenge is always bring the base home or bring the voters who are against you home. Those are voters that are not voting for anybody else, but they're mad at him. And it's the same issue, same issue. They were just talking about this in New York on the other side. If you come over here, Democrats would say, that's a bigger deal, right? 32 percent of your party is voting against, you know, the former president, Donald Trump, in a state that has been absolutely critical to his success and to his failure in 2020. So both frontrunners have a challenge. Both are winning quite comfortably. But both have a problem bleeding in their own party, if you will, a third -- just shy of a third of Republicans. They're saying we don't like Donald Trump. So let's look here where this is coming in. Oakland County, this one here, you know, 32 percent. Again, how do you want to read that, right, in a suburban county that is trended democratic come November? You know, is that a good sign for Donald Trump? Well, those are voters Joe Biden is going to target right there.",
