Zain is off today.It's a busy day in Washington D.C. as well as a continued fallout from President Biden's dramatic exit from the presidential race. Right now on Capitol Hill, the U.S. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle, is testifying for the House Oversight Committee. Her agency is under intense scrutiny after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, nine days ago, at one of his campaign rallies. We are closely monitoring that hearing and we'll bring you live updates throughout the hour. We're now to this and passing the torch and plowing full steam ahead. It is a brand-new U.S. presidential race and Democratic leaders are coalescing around Kamala Harris. They're likely new nominee as she launches into her first full day of campaigning. The vice president just wrapped up her remarks honoring NCAA championship teams at the White House. It's her first public appearance since President Biden announced that he is not seeking reelection. She began by praising President Biden and his service to the nation. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's Eva McKend joins me now live in Washington, D.C. Eva, so a huge night in terms of funding, in terms of support, in terms of re-energizing, really this race from the vice president now not skipping a beat, I would argue the past month since that devastating debate performance from the president. But yesterday, she's getting the endorsement from the president as his pick for the party's nominee, other notable names, including the Clintons and many who would have been viewed as her most serious contenders, governor, senators, also endorsing her the latest Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.

And that is why they were pushing so hard for Harris. But now, the hard work for her begins. We know that she has been working the phones. She spent more than 10 hours on the phones calling governors, members of Congress, leaders of civil rights organizations, labor organizations, praying with her pastor for strength, that she can get through the weeks ahead. And that is all to shore up internal support within the Democratic Party. That is what's going to be needed in the weeks ahead for those delegates that plan to support President Biden at the convention to actually go and switch her -- their support to her. Now, she does have an angle here, or I would say an edge here, and that she enters this stage with the support of key coalitions already. I'm talking about groups like Black Voters Matter, Higher Heights. They do some crucial work in terms of organizing and turning out voters in key battleground states. And they have been with her throughout this entire process, doing that quiet diplomacy as it looked like President Biden would step aside, Bianna.",

Now, even though in the last few days, he's put out statements saying he's looking forward to hitting the campaign trail, ultimately, when he put out the letter, one of the biggest things he said was that, he is trying to look out for the better good of the American people.

And I can tell you now, Bianna, from a lot of the conversations I've spoken to, grassroots organizers, and even activists who are going to now really be in the space of really mobilizing voters, that they say that there's this renewed energy around the Democratic Party and that they're more committed than ever to making sure that Kamala Harris gets on that ballot.

That has now shifted. And Tim Alberta tweeting yesterday upon this news, really cannot overstate how problematic this is for Trump's operation.

So if you're talking about which campaign structurally has to catch up more quickly, it's the new Kamala Harris campaign, which has been around for about less than 24 hours at this point. Look, is the structure and the messaging going to be slightly different than it would have been against Joe Biden? Yes, but not dramatically so. If you go up until before the first debate, Donald Trump was leading Joe Biden still. And it wasn't because of Joe Biden's age. It was because of his policies. It was because voters had soured on the Biden-Harris administration on issues around immigration, which she was the borders czar. And then the point is to handle root causes of migration and then securing the border, which she did not do, and which the American people do not believe that she's done a good job at. And she was there on all the big spending that caused a lot of the inflation. And so they're blaming -- voters are blaming the Biden-Harris administration on inflation. Not to mention the fact that if you look at all the foreign policy challenges that we have right now, whether it's Russia invading Ukraine, the crisis in the Mideast, whether it was the withdrawal from Afghanistan, Kamala Harris was there right with Joe Biden. And so if you take out, yes, the age issue, which certainly has dominated the headlines since the end of July during the CNN debate, before that it was really about the policies. And that is why, as of today in the new poll that just came out, Kamala Harris is losing to Donald Trump at about the same margin that Joe Biden was losing to Donald Trump going into that first debate.

So I think that what we're hearing is a lot of themes coming out of the questioning thus far, but the director, you know, has failed to respond and reassure not only lawmakers, but the American public that this election is safe. And, you know, to the reporting that we just had -- just prior to my joining, what we don't understand is, how did this happen? Right? What we don't need is actually the details because we know that there's a criminal investigation. There's a mission assurance investigations going on. But what we do need is at least directionally a real understanding from the -- from the director that all of these investigative resources will yield some answers. And the answers are going to come really in two parts. One, is this an isolated incident? Was this just a series of failures on that day? And the Secret Service only needs to make, you know, smaller recommendations and smaller adjustments to ensure that this never happens again. Or do we have a systemic problem in the protective model that the Secret Service is applying, not only to the former president, but to all of our protectees? So this is a real seminal moment for the United States Secret Service. There's a spotlight on our mission, on the way that we actually execute our protective mission, you know, across an entire spectrum of protectees. The director is failing to reassure everybody that the Secret Service can move forward. However, I want to say as a former Secret Service agent, I'd like to take this moment to know -- because I know that the women and men of the Secret Service who stand up every day to do this job are doing everything that they can do to protect these governmental leaders.",

Welcome back to ONE WORLD, I'm Bianna Golodryga.While Democrats seem enthusiastic and energized by the prospect of Kamala Harris replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, some Republicans are challenging the move. On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling for Biden to step down from the presidency. He said that if Biden is not fit to run, then he is not fit to serve. Johnson also said he expects lawsuits to be filed in various states challenging any move from Biden to Harris. CNN chief congressional correspondent Manu Raja joins us with more. So we heard from the speaker there and Representative Nancy Mace also, said that she will be pushing for the Cabinet, Biden's Cabinet, to invoke the 25th Amendment.

This decision, while a lot of people were speculating could happen, certainly came as a shock to the political world.

There's a text about her ties to some of the more unpopular aspects of the Biden administration, namely his border policies. Expect a lot of attacks about that. And there's some questions about how they will deal with the fact that she is a historic figure in her own right. She, of course, would be the first woman president, the first black and South Asian American president. And the question is to get Republicans on how they would deal with that. I put that question to some Republicans, including one Congressman, Tim Burchett of Tennessee, about how Republicans would deal with that aspect of the campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. TIM BURCHETT (R-TN): Biden said, first off, he said he's going to hire a black female for vice president. And that not -- he just skipped over. What about -- what about females? What about any other group? Just when you go down that route, you take mediocrity and that's what they have right now as vice president.",

Of course, Democrats would say that she -- her qualifications were the reason, ultimately, for her decision to get that post, even as the then- Vice President Joe Biden had suggested that perhaps that he wanted a black woman as the number two on the ticket in an effort to try to energize that aspect of the democratic base. But it all underscores what the Republicans are still grappling with, that there's a new nominee, that things will change in this election, that Democrats who are really struggling with their enthusiasm with Joe Biden at the top of the ticket now have a new energy, particularly among some of the aspects of the democratic base that simply were not there with Joe Biden as he was struggling to rebuild his coalition for 2020. Now they have to grapple with the likelihood of Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, and what that means for them going forward.

And one of the benefits of her also being the nominee is she gets to tap the staff resources. She also gets to tap the campaign coffers. And like we saw yesterday, there's a lot of excitement about her. We saw $67 million come in via ActBlue, which is a record. So she has a strong case to prosecute against Donald Trump.
