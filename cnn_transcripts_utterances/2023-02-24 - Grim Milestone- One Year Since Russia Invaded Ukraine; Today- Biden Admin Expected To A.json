It's being held at the U.S. Federal Reserve, at the Bank of England, at the European Central Bank, and various other banks among allied countries. That money currently belongs to Russia.But if we look at the whole situation, the amount of damage that's been done by Russia to Ukraine is estimated to be well north of $1 trillion, $1.2 to be exact. And so, before we start digging into our own pockets, it makes total moral, financial, and political sense for that money to be confiscated. And is it legally possible? Yes, it's legally possible if we were to adjust the laws. People -- right now, Putin is hiding behind a law called sovereign immunity, which means that any assets that belong to the state can't be touched. But Putin has redefined international crime by killing Ukrainians, by bombing, by invading their country, we should be adjusting international law. And so it would require some change to law in the United States and other countries, but I can't think of a more important and worthy reason to do it than to rebuild Ukraine after this terrible damage has been done.",

He's the one whose soldiers are raping Ukrainian women.There's no escalation. What we're trying to do is help Ukraine defend themselves, both with military hardware, but also with financial resources so that they can carry on, so they don't just capitulate because they were bankrupted or destroyed.

And so this is a real problem.And as time goes on, it will become even more of a problem. And this is kind of what Putin's banking on. So, in my estimation, neither side has a decisive military advantage to win the war. And so, it's going to drag out. And so Putin's only hope is that somehow America stops funding the war.

You don't let the momentum and that train keep going. You got to slow him down. As for the questions, though, there is an Achilles heel for the prosecution here. While Murdaugh is saying akin to, I shot the sheriff, but I did not shoot the deputy. I'm a liar. I am somebody who was addicted to opioids, but I never committed murder, certainly not my wife and children. The prosecution has to still try to bridge a gap for this jury, which is the why. Now, motive does not have to be proven by prosecutors, Kaitlan, but it's a 10,000-pound gorilla for every jury in the room as to why, especially because the videos beforehand showed some sort of obviously a close relationship. There was some laughter about a bird in the dog's mouth and beyond, a tree that was arcing, if you remember that video with the son, Pawpaw (ph), and his father. So why did it happen at that time, is really what the prosecution has got to bridge. And they have said it's because he was trying to distract from financial crimes. But finally, Kaitlan, if that's the case, I wonder if jurors are asking themselves, hold on, he needed to distract from financial crimes that he openly has now admitted under oath in court with a trial ahead.
