      "sentences": "Good evening, breaking news to bring you. The US Supreme Court has rejected the special counsel's request tofast-track a ruling on presidential immunity. Special Counsel Jack Smith had asked the nation's highest court to speed things up in deciding whether Donald Trump can be prosecuted for alleged election interference. Smith wanted to avoid going to the appeal court first and going, if you will, straight to the top. Mr. Trump's attorney says he was acting in his official capacity as president and is, therefore, immune to federal charges. So the current question plays out through the Washington DC Circuit Court of Appeals. Katelyn Polantz is in Washington and with me. Now, look, the -- this is both procedural/legalistic at one level and, at the same time, incredibly important because it's sort of going to mean a trial -- a further appeal trial has to take place, which pushes all things forward. We don't know why the Supreme Court refused to put this on turbocharge, do we?",

And, Richard, the Supreme Court says this is not their moment just yet. So what is happening here is there is a question of this community around the presidency. And does Donald Trump get that protection as a criminal defendant? That question is going to go to an intermediary court first, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, the court in the middle of the trial court and the Supreme Court in the US. And so that DC Circuit, they're going to be looking at this question. They're going to hear arguments on it on January 9th. They are taking it very fast as far as their schedules .",

As to the actual court case, Mr. Trump's attorney says he was acting in his official capacity as president when he challenged the 2020 results. The question is now playing out in the District D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Joan Biskupic is in Washington, CNN legal analyst, Norm Eisen is with me. Joan, why couldn't the Supreme Court have just done the easy thing, since we know, this is going to end up there one way or the other after the appeal courts heard it?",

And before you go to the Supreme Court, and what Special Counsel Jack Smith was saying is exactly what you're saying, look, you're going to have to decide this anyway, you're going to have to decide whether former President Donald Trump is immune from this from criminal prosecution for what went on in the wake of the 2020 election. And, you know, the Supreme Court, for whatever reasons behind the scenes, they didn't explain, just didn't want a part of it now. You know, on one hand, they might have thought, look, let's get an orderly, good decision from a lower appellate court, we can start with that when we take up our consideration. Maybe there is no reason for urgency here. But everything involving Donald Trump is fraught for the U.S. Supreme Court. And let me just tell you that his lawyers had argued to the justices, if you intervene now, you will look like you are sending a signal that you are against Donald Trump.
