He had served in Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa.And his military experience could help him as he navigates some of the wars abroad, including in the Middle East and in Ukraine. Now, Waltz's pick really is keeping in what Donald Trump is valuing most for some of these top positions. And that is loyalty. We saw him name Susie Wiles as his chief of staff. CNN reported that Stephen Miller is going to be named deputy chief of staff for policy. There's been a number of other people, Tom Homan, to serve as his borders czar. Elise Stefanik as his U.N. ambassador. All of these people have one thing in common, and that is that they are loyal to him. And particularly so they are loyalty stretching back to the time that he had departed the White House in 2021, when many people had tried to distance themselves from Donald Trump following the January 6th attack. All of these people stood by him. And I'm told that is his version of rewarding them. Now, I also want to note that Waltz, like some of these other picks, has been seen at Mar-a-Lago in recent days. He's also been a strong defender of the former president on television, particularly when it relates to some of these military matters. Now, another influential voice that we are continuing to see him move sway with is Elon Musk. He has been at Mar-a-Lago virtually every single day since Donald Trump won the election. And I'm also told that he's been not only calling up Trump allies and lawmakers, but they are calling him as they seek to exert as much influence as they can in this process, really hoping that Musk will help them paint a bigger -- a better picture of them to the president-elect.

And, you know, I think one thing that Musk is going for him is he's enormously wealthy. And Trump loves an enormously wealthy person and looks up to them. And so maybe he feels acceptance with the richest man in the world. Being a sort of a super fan. Right. There's nothing more complimentary to someone who desperately craves affirmation. You have to cozy up to the Trump administration because this is an administration that operates in a very transactional way. And so Elon understands that. He also wants some influence for his various ideas about reforming the government, which I think he'll run into a buzzsaw of more difficulty than in just bossing people around, wandering. He has a tendency to wander into a company and then kick all the trash cans and scare people. Right. That's his thing.

He had a big role in the TikTok hearings grilling the FBI chief about the influence of Beijing. The issues in this part of the world, it's a very long list. Of course, he's familiar with trade and tariffs. But he may also have to deal with the security issues surrounding the South China Sea and the presence of Taiwan. He has been very bold about his concerns about not only China itself, but also its bigger role on the world stage. Let's listen to some remarks he made back in 2023. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL): China today is the single most formidable adversary the United States has ever faced. The Soviet Union was not an industrial power, a technological power, a commercial power.
