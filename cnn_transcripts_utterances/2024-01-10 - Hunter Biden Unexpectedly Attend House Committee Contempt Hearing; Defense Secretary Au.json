The president's son, Hunter Biden, shocking the House Oversight Committee by showing up at his own contempt hearing just briefly. They were just starting debating if they should hold the president's son in contempt of Congress for failing to comply with a subpoena last month. He sat in the front row for a few minutes before leaving just as abruptly as he arrived.I want to bring in defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Shan Wu. We are looking at the video of Hunter Biden walking into that committee meeting. Shan, was this a good idea for Hunter Biden to show up even though he didn't testify or say anything but he was there?",

But he's showing up really muddies the legal waters some because he is there versus completely blown off a subpoena and just not showing up pulling like a Steve Bannon-type of maneuver.And so, it makes it harder ultimately, for someone making a decision whether to prosecute him for contempt as to whether there's solid legal grounds for that. And that could either be DOJ or maybe, you know, Attorney General Garland will farm it out to the special prosecutor Weiss in that case. But definitely muddies the waters some because they have to take into consideration if he's tried to comply, if there's been these efforts at accommodation that usually happen, and there's a long history of his team being in touch with them.

And they don't want to do that.On the prosecutorial end, I think if we look at the examples of Meadows and Scavino, I think it was -- those are instances where contempt was referred to DOJ. They didn't do it. And probably the off- ramp DOJ used is the fact that there had been negotiations. There had been an effort and accommodations. Meadows, I think had turned over documents. So, it didn't look like a very cut-and-dried case. I think, unfortunately for Hunter Biden, Attorney General Garland has shown himself so worried I think about being criticized for favoring the president's son, that he might kind of lean in the other direction and lean towards adding contempt onto the basket of charges they've already put on Hunter Biden.",

So, my colleagues, quite frankly, across the aisle should have expected something based on -- based on that previous move by Hunter. That being said, I think it was pretty smart for him to come and show the American people that there -- that my colleagues across the aisle actually don't want the truth to get out.

There's good practical reason -- not open court. Open hearing.There's good practical reasons not to just want to put him out there fresh with no private preparation because your time is limited. You don't know what he's going to say. It's hard to have good questions. But from an optics standpoint, you know, they look bad that way. And legally, I still think it really muddies the water legally for DOJ because here's someone who's been in negotiations saying they're willing to be here. And it's more of the kind of time place and manner is not to Congress's suiting. So, normally, I think that would be a no-brainer, DOJ would not prosecute such a contempt.

Routine screening in early December showed that he had evidence of prostate cancer. And the decision was made to have surgery.And they decided to do that operation over the holidays, John, which a lot of people do so they can recover over the holiday. So, a few weeks later, he has surgery, on December 22. Sounds like that goes fine. He was under general anesthesia. And as expected, he went home the next day, which is typical. What happened next though, is where the story takes a bit of a turn. He started to have significant problems at home. Abdominal pain, hip pain, leg pain, and going back into the hospital on January 1. At first, they diagnose this urinary tract infection but then realize there's something more serious. He goes to the intensive care unit. And they find that he has some fluid collections as well in his abdomen. One thing about fluid in the abdomen, John, it's not supposed to be there. When it's there, it can cause your intestines to become paralyzed, which is what happened to him. And that warranted all this other treatment that he needed over the next several days. Probably, a very uncomfortable few days for him. But it sounds like by January 5, he was sort of, you know, back to normal -- resuming normal duties they say.",

Because if it -- if it starts to spread outside, the prostate surgery is not usually the answer. So, the fact that they did an operation suggests that it was localized to the prostate. It's now gone. So, the prognosis overall is excellent. But, John, one thing you know, we've talked about before. Prostate cancer, pretty common, you know, among men. One in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. One in 41 men will die of prostate cancer. And it's much higher among black men for all sorts of different reasons from genetics to less screenings, but two times almost more likely to be diagnosed and more than two times more likely to die.

And now, Secretary of State Tony Blinken has a new warning today.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ANTONY BLINKEN, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We've made clear -- we've been clear with more than 20 other countries that if this continues, as it did yesterday, there will be consequences. We've also repeatedly tried to make clear to Iran as other countries have as well, that the support that they're providing the Houthis including for these actions needs to stop. It's not in their interest to see the conflict escalated. And we're not the only ones who sent that message to Iran.

Blinken remains focused on keeping that war from expanding to become a bigger regional conflict. Alexey Navalny, in court for the first time since being transferred to a Siberian penal colony. You see a picture of it here. Navalny is the chief critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Of course, he went missing for two weeks last month, reappearing thousands of miles from the jail he had long been held in. And during this court appearance, he spoke via video. The hearing comes after Navalny gave insight yesterday also on social media into life at the remote penal colony. Dripping with sarcasm, he posted about his \"educational\" work there and joked about the morning walks that he gets to enjoy for -- he's forced to take when it's negative 13 degrees outside. A man who was rescued after being trapped for six days in his wrecked truck has just been reunited with the people who saved his life. These are new photos that have been released of Matt Reum from Indiana meeting with the first responders and two fishermen who found him. Reum almost died in that truck, surviving on only rainwater until the fishermen came upon him. He did have to have one leg amputated due to the injuries he suffered. But still, he says he is beyond happy, Sara. (END VIDEOTAPE) SIDNER: Survival is everything.
