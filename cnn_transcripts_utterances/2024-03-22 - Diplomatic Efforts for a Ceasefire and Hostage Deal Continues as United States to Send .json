As CNN's Jeremy Diamond reports, thousands of civilians are trapped on the premises. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A crowded stairwell at Al-Shifa Hospital. Dozens of women and children await Israeli military instructions. For four days, thousands of civilians have been trapped here as the Israeli military raids the hospital, targeting Palestinian militants allegedly operating inside the medical complex. Soldiers are everywhere. The voice on the loudspeaker warns, if you leave the premises, the soldiers will shoot you. We have warned you. We have come here in order to get the Israeli hostages. Then we will let you go. Soon, word of evacuations begins to spread. Now they are forcing out the women, the voice behind the camera says. We don't know where they're going to take us. The Israeli military says they have killed more than 140 militants in and around the hospital, and detained these five men described as senior terror operatives. Among more than 600 suspects, the Israeli military says they've detained. Eyewitnesses say medical personnel and other civilians have also been rounded up. Outside the hospital, the fighting continues, as seen through the lens of Hamas militants, who have been targeting Israeli tanks and troops around the hospital complex. Israeli airstrikes reducing parts of the surrounding al-Ramal neighborhood to rubble, sending thousands fleeing south. It's a journey marked by the sights and smells of death. We walked over the martyrs who are dead in the street. People are reduced to body parts, this woman cries. Where is the humanity? The newly displaced arrive on foot in central Gaza, carrying only backpacks and plastic bags, children clutching dolls and stuffed animals. Others, like this mother and her triplets, arrive with nothing at all. Tanks and artillery were firing at the buildings around al-Shifa, and forcing people to leave the buildings, she says. They make them leave with nothing on them, nothing, no pillow, no blanket, not even water. Nuzha isn't just fleeing the fighting, but the starvation that has left her eight-month-old babies thin and frail. You can see them, she says, each of them is not even two kilos, eight months old and not even two kilos. Anyone who sees them would think they are only two months old, and they are eight months. It's a catastrophe, no water, no food, and siege and gunfire. But her journey is not over yet. She is heading further south in search of food and shelter, no longer taken for granted in Gaza.

So I think we see a growing impatience of the United States with the continuation of the war and the threat of an Israeli invasion on the last 20 percent of Gaza into Rafah.

That would put a swift end to this war. But I don't think the Americans want to use the doomsday weapon to do that.

There needs to be an acceptable Palestinian leadership that comes out of the Palestinian authority that will be handed the keys by Hamas to Gaza. This is the end game that we need to see happen.

They'll be the head of the Egyptian intelligence and the Qatari prime minister. There's a Hamas delegation there already. So I think this is quite significant. I think that there's reason for optimism on these talks. I see the Israeli tactic as raising the importance of the movement of Palestinians from the south of Gaza to the north of Gaza as an issue, which is not that important to them in order to get concessions from Hamas on the issue of the release of prisoners.

I think that we're very unlikely to get a resolution on that today, just given the legal complexities, the tax complexities and the political decision and will that there needs to be there, because some countries in the E.U. have a neutrality status like Ireland and Malta. So they cannot just suddenly decide that they're going to use these profits without having the political capital behind them. But the message coming from E.U. leaders and indeed E.U. diplomats who we have spoken to is that if the resolution and the suggestion isn't kyboshed completely at the end of the council today, that is by and large a sign that things are trending in the direction that those profits may become useful.

CORRESPONDENT: Here in Port-au-Prince, there are no front lines, the boundaries, they are blurred and they are constantly shifting. And when you're with Haiti's national police force, one that is facing struggle and setback and diminishing resources, you realize just what they're up against. And that is constant gang activity. We're driving through areas that are highly contested between different gangs and the police, and they're trying to hold them back time after time. And yet these attacks are constant and they come at all hours. The police often, especially with armored vehicles like this, are able to push them back. The issue comes in holding that space and keeping it secure. They don't have enough resources to do that. Many of them have told us that's where an international mission would help. As of now, though, they have to go in, push back and then move on to other areas where gang activity has broken out. It's incredible to be inside this tank of sorts and to realize just how much it has seen.

This is \"CNN Newsroom\".The New York attorney general has taken the first step towards possibly seizing the assets of Donald Trump, unless an appeals court intervenes or unless he comes up with nearly half a billion dollars bond by Monday, an amount Trump said he can't pay. Now, the attorney general's office has made suggestions about how Trump can pay the bond, but his legal team doesn't seem to like any of them, calling a proposal that he offer real estate impractical and unjust, and saying that selling properties at a fire sale would cause irreparable damage if he were to later win an appeal. CNN's Kristen Holmes has the story.

Posting to Truth Social that the amount ordered by the judge was too high for bonding companies, adding that, quote, \"putting up money before an appeal is very expensive\". With New York Attorney General Letitia James already taking the first steps to seize Trump's assets if he's unable to post bond, Trump has been publicly defiant. DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: We're fighting it out with them. We have a lot of cash and we have a great company, but they want to take it away or at least take the cash element away. Billions of dollars in value, billions of dollars in properties, but they'd like to take the cash away so I can't use it on the campaign. HOLMES (voice-over): As Trump seeks solutions, his campaign also facing a cash crunch. Struggling to chip away at President Joe Biden's significant financial edge, Trump's campaign and joint fundraising committee raised a combined $20.3 million in February, ending the month with $41.9 million in the bank. While an increase from January, the numbers lag behind Biden's, whose political operation raised $53 million last month and ended February with $155 million cash on hand. Meanwhile, with Trump's legal fees still looming over him, his leadership pack spending more on legal expenses than it took in last month. Biden not only outpacing Trump at the bank, but also on the campaign trail, making an appeal to key voting blocs. JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I need you. I need you badly. I need the help.

Now, this comes at a time when the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government have been facing flak for the alleged clampdown and crackdown on political opponents and critics who have been taking on the government, especially ahead of the elections, the national elections, which is about three weeks out. Now, what we're seeing are very serious charges being leveled by the enforcement directorate, which is the Federal Financial Crimes Agency, an investigating agency that also comes under the Modi government. What the enforcement directorate is saying is that there are charges that they will be leveling against Arvind Kejriwal, along with others. These are corruption charges, serious charges, and they've also alleged that Kejriwal, along with others, have taken kickbacks from an alcohol licensing policy. All these charges have been denied by Kejriwal and his party. Now, coming to the larger picture here, why Kejriwal, why the arrest, and why is the opposition claiming or crying foul over it right now? It's simply because, like I said, the elections is about three weeks out. He was about to start his campaigning, and he's going to go on his campaign trail. Kejriwal is one of the few politicians and political outfits that is still politically relevant here in India, and he does have the might in many ways to take on the Modi government, if not nationally, at least regionally. His party is small. It's also relatively new. But he has been the chief minister of Delhi for two consecutive terms. The power center of Delhi is what I'm, of the country is what I'm talking about, which is New Delhi. And he's also had his party win the elections in the state of Punjab. Like you said, he has been a vocal critic of Modi. So observers and analysts claim that this is political vendetta. This is an opportunity that the BJP, which is Modi's political party, has seen at the moment and is seizing the moment by trying to put him in jail. Now, there are a lot of political opposition parties and leaders who have come out in support of Arvind Kejriwal. One of them is a very prominent opposition leader. His name is Rahul Gandhi. And he has come out and said, and I quote him here, \"a scared dictator wants to create a dead democracy\". He's, of course, referring to the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi here. Meanwhile, Modi's political party has come out after the arrest and stated that law is taking its own course and corruption charges should be probed. In a few hours from now, if not in moments, we will be hearing from the court. We are expecting to hear more on the custody of Arvind Kejriwal. And this could be challenged in the Delhi High Court later today by Arvind Kejriwal's party. But for now, we're seeing protests that could continue through the day. And Arvind Kejriwal, according to his party leaders, will continue to be the chief minister of Delhi. And this party will govern Delhi even if he's behind bars. His lieutenants say they will be out on the streets demanding that he is released and will be demanding justice for Arvind Kejriwal at the moment. But serious charges being leveled against him.

The launch of the Soyuz rocket from a cosmodrome in Kazakhstan was aborted just 20 seconds before liftoff.NASA says one of the service towers next to the rocket failed to initiate an engine sequence start, triggering an automatic abort. A NASA astronaut and two other crew members are safe and engineers are trying to figure out what went wrong. The voyage from Earth to the space station takes about three hours. The next opportunity to launch is on Saturday. Demand for A.I. powered technology is booming and one of the tech's biggest players is riding the wave. TSMC, the world's largest chipmaker, is expanding its global operations while managing competitive technological and geopolitical risks along the way. Will Ripley was granted rare access to the company's headquarters in Taipei. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) WILL RIPLEY, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): This is Taiwan's epicenter of technological revolution, where precision meets innovation and tiny chips power big dreams. This is TSMC, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, commanding more than 50 percent of the global market, producing more than 90 percent of the world's most advanced chips.",

It's so secret you have to check your phone, your laptop, anything that emits a signal just to walk through the door. RIPLEY (voice-over): As demand for A.I. driven technologies soars, TSMC is the go to global manufacturer, sending stocks skyrocketing. The company's workforce, 77,000 strong and growing, a far cry from its humble beginnings in 1987, says the senior vice president of human resources, Laura Ho. What is it like to run H.R. for what is arguably the most important company in the world right now? LAURA HO, SR. VICE PRESIDENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES, TSMC: I think now H.R. is very different than the H.R. then, because we are fast expanding our global footprint. RIPLEY (voice-over): TSMC says it needs to hire thousands of new employees over the next few years to fill chip factories or fabs under construction right now across Taiwan and around the world. Last month, TSMC opened its first fab in Kumamoto, Japan, with the help of billions of dollars in government subsidies. They're also building new fabs in Dresden, Germany and Phoenix, Arizona.",
