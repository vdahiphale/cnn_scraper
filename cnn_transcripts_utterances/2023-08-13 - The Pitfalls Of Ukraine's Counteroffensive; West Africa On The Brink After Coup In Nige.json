First Ukraine where President Zelenskyy admitted this week that the counteroffensive is difficult as Western officials told CNN that further decisive progress by Kyiv is highly unlikely. So where does the war go from here?And then to Niger, where a military junta launched a coup 18 days ago. That makes for a six-county belt of coups spanning 3,500 miles right across the African continent. We'll tell you what you need to know about this startling trend. Also, are you amazed by the power of artificial intelligence? Well, wait until you hear about quantum computing. It will make today's AI look like child's play.

      "sentences": "You know, the expectations on the counteroffensive were from the start I think unreasonably high and there is really two main reasons for that. One, Ukraine has never had complete control over its air space. And if you think about carrying out a land counteroffensive, which is of course what the Ukrainians are doing, while being bombarded from the air constantly encountering mines, no U.S. military operation would be carried out in the same way without complete air superiority. So that's one significant challenge that is really slowing down theUkrainians. And the second reason I think that's equally as important is that after many colossal blunders in term of its tactics and operations, the Russians have now also adapted to a long, drawn-out conflict and they are now in the position of defending territory which in some ways is easier than taking back territory. And those are I think the two main reasons for why we are seeing the kind of on-the- ground dynamics that have disappointed some Western officials.",

They're also taking high casualties over the last year and half or so. The Russian side has dug in. They have mined the areas between themselves and the Ukrainian advance very, very heavily. That is hurting the Ukrainians in huge ways. A lot of the weapons that the West provided earlier on in the war, tanks for example, are being taken out by these mines at a higher number than I think many anticipated.And I think now is the moment to rethink our Western policy as well because we weren't prepared for this kind of war. We were supplying Ukraine with weapons to at least be able to defend themselves. But we weren't supplying them with the kind of weapons they need to be able to launch a proper counteroffensive which first and foremost means high, long-range missile capabilities so they can disrupt Russia's supply lines behind the front lines. They are very limited in their ability to do that. So never say never, but I do think the outlook does not look positive for Ukraine over the next three or four months.",

One is that the Ukrainians need to be trained on this equipment. The second is that with longer range missiles, you are -- there is a balance. You don't want to use missiles that attack deep into the heart of Russian territory which could give the Russians the provocation to feel that they were at war with NATO, to use tactical nuclear weapons, to get much more aggressive in terms of their aerial bombardment of Ukrainian cities.What do you think of those arguments? POLYAKOVA: The argument that we're going to somehow provoke Russia beyond what is currently already done, I think this is a red herring, frankly. Mainly because I don't think there is a high chance that the Russians will go towards the nuclear decision. We have managed that nuclear escalatory risk very, very effectively and the Biden administration deserves a huge amount of credit for that certainly. And it's not the Russian interest because they would lose whatever alliances or partnerships they still have with countries like China, with India who do not approve of nuclear use and have made that very clear even publicly as well as privately to the Russians. And my second point would be in terms of reaching further into Russian territory by the Ukrainians. Well, look, this is war. If you're not able to disrupt your enemy's supply lines, if you're not able to hit their centers of operations, even on Ukrainian territory, the Ukrainians cannot fully reach Russia's logistics and supply lines in their own country. And I think this is where the real problem is. Ukraine has no interest in attacking Russia. They don't want to escalate this war. As President Zelenskyy said on your program, they want to take back their own territory and currently they don't have the reach to be able to truly, truly fight this war in the way that any Western military would have in a similar environment.",

And President Bazoum from Niger was doing his best. Many experts noticed that the number of attacks, of terrorist attacks against the civilians have decreased this past month, this past year. But it was not enough. And the ECOWAS, the regional West African organization, decided toactivate its standby force, a military force, and to be ready to restore the democratically elected President Bazoum who is detained right now in a house in Yami by the coup leaders. So it's a lot that is going on right now. A lot is on the line. Will they do cross that line and send the soldiers from ECOWAS to restore the classic power in Niger or not? And in the meantime the coup leaders are doing their thing. You know, they have appointed a new government, a new prime minister, they have closed the border, they faced the sanctions.

They didn't go out and spend all of that money right away. In fact, it was hard to spend a lot of that money in those years. And so, some of that money got spent in 2022, some of it is still being spent now. And you see that in the very strong consumer spending numbers.The second thing is that Russian invasion of Ukraine is still just absolutely horrific. But in terms of the economic data, the price of oil is back to where it was before there was any concern about the invasion. It is basically that particular issue has gone away. And then the third thing is the fed has raised rates a lot. It raised them by more than five percentage points but rates still aren't that high in the grand scheme of history. So, maybe monetary policy wasn't as contractionary and negative a force as people thought it was.",

So, you talk about consumer spending, but isn't it also true that maybe we didn't keep in mind that the Biden administration was also spending.I mean, there is a massive infrastructure bill. There is a -- Inflation Reduction Act which has a fair amount of spending in it. There is the CHIPS Act, which has a fair amount of spending. And it also did the price cap on oil which forced Russia to discount its price, further reducing energy prices. So, could that all -- you know, I mean, think of your three buckets.

And part of that is all of these new programs that you just mentioned, infrastructure, CHIPS, climate change, and the like. And they are really sort of stimulating the economy.And the other thing is, yes, the reason oil prices fell isn't just pure luck. It is in part the administration, I think, has done pretty deft handling of denying Russia some of the money, maybe not all of the money they could otherwise have gotten from oil and while making sure that it didn't cause a global recession by spiking.",

And that's fine if you're doing that.And right now, we're breaking that rule. We're seeing good times with a pretty large deficit. So, I'm not panicked. I don't think the sky is falling.
