They are confident that they will get bipartisan support. But without a speaker in the House of Representatives, the future is sort of uncertain timing-wise. HUNT:  Entirely uncertain, Betsy. That's a very fair characterization. You know, I think it's worth underscoring that this is really personal for the president -- this idea of defending democracy. It's the reason he argued he got into the 2020 campaign in the beginning of it all and it's really motivated him fundamentally.

We've seen protests across the Middle East from the outset of this war on an almost daily basis, but these demonstrations are getting bigger and bigger and they are spreading across the region as they are across the globe. And, in fact, here in Jordan, this is an issue which is deeply personal for many. More than 50 percent of the population are either Palestinian or of Palestinian descent. When you walk around the city, that feeling -- that sentiment is clear. Many are hanging Palestinian flags out of their windows, out of their cars. Many chanting pro-Palestinian chants. This is a moment that is deeply important, deeply significant, deeply personal to many here. But it's not just in Jordan. We have seen protests in Lebanon, in Egypt, in Libya, Tunisia, Iraq, and the occupied West Bank, and they are spreading. They are getting bigger. In Cairo, we know that protests will be taking place today with permission of the state. That is a significant move by the Egyptian government. We've heard that vocal condemnation from Arab leaders as well. In fact, we've heard vocal condemnation from international rights groups. Independent U.N. experts have accused Israel of carrying out -- accused them of carrying out a siege that could amount to crimes against humanity.

Let's bring in Tia Mitchell, the Washington correspondent at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Tia, good morning. It's lovely to see you. Jordan has scheduled this 8:00 a.m. press conference after what was clearly a very contentious night of trying to convince people to get on board with him. We expect he's going forward to a third vote but I think we're all going to be listening very keenly because at this point, we're not 100 percent sure yet what he's going to say. TIA MITCHELL, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, THE ATLANTA JOURNAL- CONSTITUTION (via Webex by Cisco):  Right, and good morning to you as well. It is -- it's very interesting that he's decided to go to the public first before the House convenes at 10:00 a.m. As you said, we don't know if he's going to forge forward. That's what we think he's going to do. That's where all signs are pointing that he is going to try a third time to be elected House Speaker. But one of the reasons why it's unclear what Jim Jordan is doing is because as you've noted, the Republicans who oppose him were pretty resolute as things broke up last night that they're not changing their minds, and there are a lot of them. Kevin McCarthy was removed from the speakership with eight opponents. Jim Jordan had about 20 last time there was a public count. Twenty-two to be exact. And so, he would need to flip all but four. He can only lose four votes. And so, it just doesn't look like he has the math but the signals are showing us that he might be wanting to move ahead with a third round of voting anyway.",

They are saying they're receiving death threats. We have Georgia Rep. Drew Ferguson is one of those Republicans who currently doesn't support Jim Jordan and he said he and his family had faced death threats. However, generally speaking, Republicans have been supportive of Donald Trump and supportive of trying to appease the conservative base as much as they can, but now they've reached their limit when it comes to Jim Jordan.
