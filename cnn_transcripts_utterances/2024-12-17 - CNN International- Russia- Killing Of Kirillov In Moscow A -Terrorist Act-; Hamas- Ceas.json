I'm going to get out of your way and you can see the actual scene of where all of this took place. And you already mentioned that the entrance to that building where all this happened, the second entrance down from here, was badly damaged in that explosion.The Russians are indeed saying that they believe that the explosive device was hidden in an electric scooter parked right outside that building, and that there were about 300 grams of TNT inside that explosive device. They have already said that they found remnants of that explosive device, and one of the other things that they said as well is that they believe that it was detonated remotely. Now, we do know at this point in time that the Ukrainian security services have claimed responsibility for this. A source saying that to CNN that Ukrainian security services were behind this. The explosion, despite the fact that 300 grams of TNT might not sound like very much, seems to have been substantial. We can see that there is a lot of workers here on the ground, Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation on the ground. Some others have cordoned off the area. But, one of the other things that we're seeing as well, if we pan over to the other side, is that the explosion was so strong that it damaged the building on the other side of the road. You can see there that windows have been smashed by this explosion that took place. There was an eyewitness report that we have seen, some of them on Russian media, saying that they thought that maybe some sort of cement truck had unloaded a lot of cement, or something very heavy had fallen down on the ground. So, clearly, the people who live in this area very much heard this explosion as it took place, of course, at the beginning, not exactly clear of what it might have been. The Russians have launched a criminal investigation into all this. You can see the investigators, and we've seen the investigators on the ground here, not just civilian investigators or from the police authorities, but also military investigators as well. Of course, Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov, very important for the Russian military, very high up in the Russian military. He was the head of Russia's nuclear, biological and chemical defense forces, and the Ukrainians had actually indicted him in absentia. Just yesterday, the Ukrainian security services accusing the Russians of using weaponized chemicals in the war in Ukraine. Igor Kirillov, for his part in the past, had accused the Ukrainians of doing the exact same thing. So, certainly, someone who was on the forefront as far as that conflict between Ukraine and Russia is concerned, and someone who the Russians, of course, for their military, was extremely important.

      "sentences": "Well, what's interesting is that the contours of the negotiations are still relatively the same. Some of the details may be different. We've gotten some indication that Hamas is perhaps more willing to allow an Israeli troop presence along the Philadelphi Corridor, for example, which was one of the major sticking points that led to the collapse of talks back in August.But, really what has changed is this kind of bigger geopolitical picture that I'm talking about here, which is that U.S. and Israeli officials believe Hamas is increasingly isolated in the wake of Hezbollah agreeing to a ceasefire, despite previously saying they would only agree to a ceasefire if Israel ended its war in Gaza, the fact that Iran has been significantly weakened through the weakening of its proxy, Hezbollah, but also throughout the region, in the wake of the collapse of the Assad regime, which was a close ally of Iran, and the fact that Hamas' dreams, Yahya Sinwar's dreams, perhaps, as Israeli officials have said he had, of a kind of broader regional war erupting and Israel being defeated as a result of that, clearly has not happened. Instead, we have seen the reshaping of the Middle East in a way that Iran has been significantly weakened. So, all of that, officials say, contributes to this picture of an environment where a deal can perhaps be reached, in addition to, again, the political conditions in Israel perhaps being riper, as the Israeli Prime Minister can tout the killing of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' leader, he can tout a series of military victories in Gaza in order to get to a deal. But, he has still cautioned that he will not agree to an end of the war. And so, there is the possibility here of a first phase of a ceasefire that could ultimately collapse and lead to the return of war in Gaza.",

Now, these mass graves that we'd had hints about way before Bashar al-Assad fell, of course. The International Commission on Missing Persons speaks of a man known as the \"Grave Digger\" who appeared before a German court back in 2020 who described his role in taking truckloads of dead bodies to some of these sites.And that site you showed a moment ago fire to the outskirts of Damascus. What we were hearing was happening there, from some of the truck drivers involved, is that it was each week that four tractor trailer loads of bodies, containing 150 bodies, each report twice a week, between 2012 and 2018, and that, of course, alone would mean many, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of bodies possibly. So, this grim task now of trying to extract the bodies and identifying them begins, although what we understand also from some of these advocacy groups that are involved in trying to get cameras to these sites and to help them be cleared and opened up that the bodies can be retrieved, is that what we understand happened is that once the bodies were brought, they were then bulldozed in order to make them sufficiently small that they could be put into these very large graves. So, the process of identification is also likely to prove very difficult. But, this the sad next step in this unfolding tragedy where so many of these estimated 150,000 people who are still believed to be missing by the International Commission on Missing Persons in Syria may now be lying.

Juliette, I hate that we always talk under these circumstances, but certainly good to have you. As Natasha pointed out, school shootings, sadly, are not rare here in the U.S., but what does seem more rare is the fact that police say the person responsible was a 15-year-old girl, a student. What do you make of that? JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, &amp; FORMER ASST. SECRETARY, DEPT. OF HOMELAND SECURITY: Absolutely rare, somewhat unprecedented. Looking back at my data, I can't find a single instance where there was a female sort of mass shooting at a school. There has been altercations between females where gun was used. So, the reason why this is such an outlier case is that the data in public safety is it's gendered, and I'm willing to admit that. So, it's gender stereotypes, but men generally kill based on what we would call socially aggressive behavior, or aggressively anti-social behavior. So, they'll go to a school without a target. They'll go to a shopping mall without a specific target. When female killings tend to be what might be called more intimate, in other words, it's an individual, someone that they feel harmed them, someone who may have isolated them, a family member, a husband or a lover. And so, this is just very different, and that is why there is this focus on the friend and the note, because we need to figure out what was animating her, because she does fall outside of, I hate to say there is a norm to school shooters, but there is.

Kennedy has insisted, on Inauguration Day, the Trump White House will advise all U.S. water systems to remove fluoride from public water, which Trump said sounds OK, despite decades of evidence showing fluoride radically lowers tooth decay. Kennedy has made false claims about the ingredients in Fruit Loops and calls a lot of American foods poisonous, and many abortion rights opponents simply don't trust him, including former Vice President Mike Pence, who says Kennedy's nomination is an abrupt departure from the pro-life record of our administration, and should be deeply concerning.

Now, Jay-Z has already fiercely denied these accusations, and his legal team has already asked the court to dismiss this case entirely. But now, for the first time speaking to reporters since these accusations came out, Jay-Z's attorney, Alex Spiro, held a press conference of sorts. There was a private meeting at Jay-Z's Roc Nation offices in New York City, where CNN was invited to watch a presentation put on by Jay-Z's attorney, where he had a PowerPoint where he showed different details that he says disprove Jane Doe's case. Let's take a look at some of what he said.ALEX SPIRO, JAY-Z'S LAWYER: This is not an account of inconsistencies. I wanted everybody to understand that this never happened. This is completely false. You have to look at the timeline. You have to look at the timeline. So, there is an old expression that time doesn't lie. Everything else that I'm talking about, these glaring inconsistencies, these are not minor inconsistencies. These are not minor problems with these stories -- this story. This is utter falsehoods. Time never lies. And so, if you look at the time, no matter what, this couldn't have happened. It's not even possible that this happened.",

In fact, he says it's not even possible that Jay-Z was there.Now, if we go back to Jane Doe's initial complaint, she alleges that she was raped by both Jay-Z and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs at an after-party for the MTV Video Music Awards in the year 2000. Now, this after- party, she said, was held at a white house that was outside of the city. Well, Jay-Z's attorney actually showed photos of Jay-Z that night at an after-party, but it was in New York City. So, he says, if you look at the timeline, it's not possible that Jay-Z was in the suburbs at this alleged after-party because he was photographed being somewhere else. Now, in her initial complaint, Jane Doe also said that she got to this alleged after-party by getting into a limo from a driver outside of the MTV VMAs, who said that they worked for Sean Combs. Well, today, Jay-Z's attorney is saying that's not possible because the limousine line was barricaded by the police and fans were not able to access it. Now, I reached out to Jane Doe's attorney. His name is Tony Buzbee. He says that he is representing over 120 accusers of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. This is the first accuser to come forward and name Jay-Z. But, he tells me that he stands by his client. He says that they are still vetting her. But, when I asked about the vetting process, here is what he told me. He said that four individuals at his firm interviewed the client and checked details. He says that a background check was run on Jane Doe and that his firm actually engaged a seasoned investigator to vet some details she disclosed to us, and he said, quote, \"Those results were consistent with what the client had told us.\" He also says that she assigned two separate affidavits, and he tells me, quote, \"Courts exist to resolve factual disputes. Our client remains adamant about her claim.\" Back to you. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

Since then, its financial performance has been poor, to say the least. Now, Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky is buying it for the princely sum of $4.5 billion. Now, he made his money in energy, but he has a few UK interests already.

This takeover comes with strings attached. Royal Mail will still have to deliver letters six days a week, Monday through Saturday, and parcels Monday through Friday, and the UK government will hold a so-called golden share in the company, because this is vital British infrastructure. So, they'll get a final approval on things like a change in ownership of the company, a change in headquarter location or tax residency. This takeover is expected to complete next year.
