The NYPD saying a woman sleeping on the train this morning was deliberately set on fire. The woman, who has yet to be identified, has since died. We've learned New York police are set to hold a news conference on this investigation very soon. We're keeping our eye on that.Meantime, CNN's Gloria Pazmino is tracking the story from New York and Gloria we understand police are searching for the people -- person who did this and there are photos.

We're watching as police officials there get ready to have this briefing in the next few minutes, but this is just a horrific and senseless attack from the details that we have learned in the last few hours. Police tell us that there was a woman who was asleep inside of an F train in Brooklyn at the Stillwell Avenue train station in Coney Island. That is the end of the line there.And the train was not moving. She was asleep inside of the subway car. And early this morning, police tell us that a man approached her and set her on fire. As she burned, the man walked away and left the station. Police who were who were patrolling the platform at the time saw the scene, tried to put out the flames and called EMS who responded. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Now you're looking at images that the police have released. This is the person they are looking for. They say that he is about five feet, six inches tall. He's 150 pounds, approximately 25 to 30 years old. And he was last seen, as you see it there, wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt. Now this is happening as there's been a lot of concern and a lot of focus, Jessica, on the safety of the city's subways. In fact, the governor, Governor Kathy Hochul here in New York, announced last week that she was deploying an additional 250 members of the National Guard -- DEAN: Gloria, sorry, I'm going to interrupt you. We've got Jessica Tisch, the police commissioner. We're going to listen in. Thank you so much, Gloria. (LIVE VIDEO)",

A 911 call was received that this individual is recognized at the J and York Street station on the F line. Our transit sergeant responded to that location, met with these young high school students, looked inside the train and saw an individual that he recognized from wanted flyers that we got out earlier. He confirmed that it was our individual wearing the same clothes and hat and radioed ahead.Our officers in District 2 stopped that train at Herald Square and was able to keep the doors closed, walk the train, and place this very dangerous individual in custody. This is amazing work done by the public and the police working together. Once again, someone saw something, we got it out through technology in numerous ways, and we were able to make a quick arrest on this nothing less than heinous crime that occurred in our subway system.

Before that, you saw people and still selling St. Luigi t-shirts and other garments and items. You have posters. You have the social media reaction, which is unbelievably favorable to him.And I think these were authorities saying, not withstanding, that public messaging of people who were tempted, apparently, Jessica, liked what he did, that this is unacceptable, this is a crime, we're going to come get you, we'll find you, and here he is.

I think it speaks to a larger issue about feelings really of not only corporate America but of the healthcare industry where people really have significant claims and valid claims that are being disrespected and denied and people are dying as a result of there being an emphasis on profits over health. And so, I think that's a reaction to that.The real concern legally, Jessica, is how that plays out in a courtroom. There's something called jury nullification, and that is where a jury knows you did it, but they give you a pass for a variety of reasons, much of which they can sympathize and empathize with what you do. Now, many people may say, you're kidding, you're crazy. They'll never do it in this instance. I'm not so sure. I mean, the social media reaction is unbelievable. We saw it there in that clip. People are cheering for him. So, if you get jurors like that on the jury pool, what will their reactions be? Last point to that, Jessica, and yes, I get that you can dismiss jurors for cause. What that means in English is that if a juror says, I hate the healthcare system, I hate the system in general, I like Luigi, I like what he did, you can excuse them, but you can't excuse everybody who doesn't show a bias but conceals it and gets on the jury and has it. [17:40:00] So, I'm interested to see how the public perception plays out in a court of law when he's sitting before 12 jurors of his peers who have to decide guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

So, we should expect to know more about what those people told committee investigators about Matt Gaetz and his behavior as well as who else the committee talked to and the committee's conclusions. It was earlier this week when we did learn that the House Ethics Committee had a secret vote to release its report into the conduct of former Rep. Matt Gates, and now we know when.Multiple sources telling CNN the report will be released tomorrow. The release is a stark reversal by the committee, which just last month voted to shelve the report after Gaetz resigned from Congress once he became President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general. Now, Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration of that role after Trump called him to say that Gaetz didn't have the votes in the Senate to get confirmed. This report concludes a years-long probe by the Ethics Committee into numerous allegations against Gaetz. Those allegations include whether he engaged in sexual misconduct with a minor, whether he paid for sex, used illicit drugs, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, and more. Gaetz has strongly denied all of the allegations and has said the committee's investigation is a witch hunt, saying this on X after reports of the committee's decision to release the report. He says the Biden-Garland DOJ spent years reviewing allegations that I committed various crimes. I was charged with nothing, fully exonerated. The Post went on to say, it's embarrassing, though, not criminally, that I probably partied, womanized, drank, and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now. We should note that it is rare for an ethics report to be released after a member has left Congress, Jessica, though it has happened on a couple of occasions in the past.",
