We're learning this morning that Donald Trump plans to use the historic decision to attack the evidence against him in all four of his criminal cases. One source says Trump's lawyers believe the ruling could have the biggest impact on his Mar-a- Lago classified documents case.CNN's Katelyn Polantz has more from Washington right now.

But what they will also be able to do and what is now expected from what we're hearing from sources is that they're going to try and cut out the details that these cases have if they were to go to trial.This is a focus around the evidence in the cases. Because there are things, like in the Mar-a-Lago case in Florida. That is so largely about things that took place after the presidency alleged obstruction and having documents in Mar-a-Lago in unsecured locations that were national security and should have been protected. And yet, his attorneys are going to be arguing to the judge and already have told the judge that they want to cut out things like when Trump had the documents taken out of the White House at the very last hours of his presidency. So looking at the evidence is going to be something is going to continue on in these cases as they move forward now that the Supreme Court has decided, and it's going to ricochet in all four of those cases. Also, Alisyn, everybody is looking at this opinion. It's not just Donald Trump's team. People like Mark Meadows and Jeffrey Clark, who are co-defendants of his down in Georgia -- they, too, see possible help potentially for them. They're fighting their charges there in other ways -- other types of immunity for federal employees. They've been losing that battle in the courts. Mark Meadows, though, is expected to go to the Supreme Court just later this month when he has a deadline upcoming for another appeal. And the general idea from the sources I have heard from is that it might not explicitly help them now that the Supreme Court has defined presidential immunity -- but hey, it couldn't hurt -- Alisyn.",

That's when you will be able to gauge what the American people want because thus far, we've heard from a lot of Democratic elected officials.So, Joseph, to you. You know, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton saying this. \"I have grave concerns about his ability to defeat Donald Trump. When your current strategy isn't working, it's rarely the right decision to double down. President Biden is not going to get younger\" -- quoting him. Also, reportedly, a draft letter now is floating on Capitol Hill that lawmakers may sign, pressing Biden to step down. So, Joseph, even if Biden is defiant -- digging in, you know, his heels -- how does he endure or survive this kind of tidal wave? JOSEPH PINION, REPUBLICAN STRAGEGIST (via Webex by Cisco):  Well look, there are a few factors here. Number one, I believe the Congressman's own words belie the truth. This is not about doing what is right for the American people. This is about a Democratic Party that has dug themselves a grave and now are looking for an escape hatch. And so, yes, it was quite clear to everyone that Joe Biden had not only lost a step but lost his footing on the global stage. It was quite clear when we had Robert Hur with a big billboard telling the American people that it was his opinion -- the Department of Justice's opinion that he was not fit to stand trial. He was mocked. Every single person who has spent the last three years with grave concerns about the empty stares, the falling up the stairs, the tumbling down the stairs -- we take no pleasure in saying these things. It is just a reality for a man that is our commander in chief. And so, I think Republicans are going to do everything humanly possible to keep Joe Biden on the ballot. To tell the American people that Democrats have effectively perpetuated an Aaron Sorkin fever dream on the republic -- a fraud on this republic by trying to tell you that this man was fitter than he was. You look in places like Wisconsin where he has to possibly either not be alive to be off the ballot. Place like Georgia where he has to demonstrate that he is unfit mentally to be off the ballot. So these are all going to be very intricate steps that Democrats are going to have to go through, and Republicans are going to push back firmly on all of those.",

I don't think you can trust things that Donald Trump has said. I don't think you can trust that he is going to advocate for the interests of the American people. I think he's advocating for himself by putting himself in a position to keep himself out of jail.On the flip side, I don't think you can trust that Joe Biden is equipped to handle this job. He's already been failing to do so. And we saw on the debate stage he really wasn't all there. And so, trust now is completely eroded for the American people because this was blatant, as to Joe's point. This was obvious. This was coming -- a long time coming. He went into office at an older age. They're both going to be octogenarians. Should they be in the White House for the next four years -- either -- whoever it is? And so, the -- this is where yes, the Democratic Party can hit Trump for a lot of things, but the Republican Party has just as much to go after on the flip side. So again, I have long said I don't see either of these choices being good for the American people moving forward. But for the Democratic Party, if they really believe and the polls are showing that they are so far behind, there's opportunity here. They should be capitalizing on it by moving past Joe Biden.",

Opinion polls suggest that the Conservative Party could suffer major losses with the Labor Party -- the current opposition party -- sweeping into power after more than a decade.Now, of course, there are many key issues at the forefront of voters' minds. This is the first time that voters have gone to the polls since 2019 when Boris Johnson was elected prime minister -- the leader of the Conservative Party. Since then, we've seen many leadership changes -- many new prime ministers -- and a sense of instability within the government -- within Parliament. Many, of course, concerned with the chaos that we've seen on the police force (PH), but also concerned with the state of the economy, the cost of living -- prices here in the United Kingdom. And, of course, there's also foreign policy concerns at stake. This is an election taking place at a time where the U.K. has diplomatically been very much involved in the war in Ukraine as well as, of course, the ongoing war in Gaza. So there are a number of key issues, of course, for voters heading to the polls today. Polls opened at around 7:00 a.m. local time. They will stay open until 10:00 p.m., or 5:00 p.m. Eastern time. It is at that point that the counting begins. Now voters, of course, are voting for their member of Parliament. There are 650 constituencies. They are voting for their local representative for each of these parties; not voting directly for the prime minister. And what these parties are looking for -- what these party leaders are looking for is for their parties to secure a majority -- that crucial 326 figure and above. And we'll be seeing those counts coming in constituency by constituency overnight into the early hours of Friday morning. We, of course, expect to see exit polls throughout the night coming in, giving us a steer of where this year's election is heading. Those official results set to be announced on Friday. And, of course, it is crucial for that party that does win to secure a majority to be able to form a government for the prime minister to take office. So this is and could potentially be a big gamechanger for the country. Many will be staying up overnight to watch those vote counts come in to see who the next prime minister will be.",

As plastic enters the marine environment it breaks down over the course of time. And so, when small organisms eat that it starts with the next level of fish all the way up to the top of the food chain with sharks. The most commonly found item across the world by scuba divers is plastic fishing line, and that can create a tearing effect. It can create abrasions where it moves and starts to hurt sensitive marine organisms, such as corals. And animals can find themselves entangled. Once the debris has been safely removed underwater, we sort it, we record it, and then we report it to our database. Over the past 10 years of recording data, we've actually moved more than 2.3 million pieces of marine debris around the world. When divers remove this they're not only making the marine life underwater safer, governments can use that information to create new policies that might prevent the spread of marine debris, especially plastics, in their local community. As scuba divers, we are ocean optimists. We should not feel discouraged by the immensity of everything that's going on. But rather, we can take one small action at a time and we can make a big difference. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

In the general population, only about up to 10 out of every 100,000 people have been diagnosed with this condition. The reason why researchers are turning attention to this though is because in their study they did find that patients with diabetes who have been prescribed semaglutides appear to be about four times more likely to be diagnosed with this condition compared with people who had diabetes and were not prescribed these drugs. And people who are overweight or who had obesity and used these drugs appear to be about seven times more likely. But again, Alisyn, it's an association.
