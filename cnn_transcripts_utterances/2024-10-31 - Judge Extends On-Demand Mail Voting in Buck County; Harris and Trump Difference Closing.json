GOV. AUSTIN DAVIS (D-PA):  Well, Jim, thank you so much for having me. It's great to be with you. This morning.

And the reality is there are dedicated professionals here in Pennsylvania who are working hard to administer our elections. I am confident that we are going to have a free and fair election here in Pennsylvania as we did in 2020.

The reality is Donald Trump has a long history of doing the opposite of protecting women. He has had a number of allegations and a long history of, quite frankly, demonizing women. And it is just his ploy to try to win more votes. He recognizes that women are going to be a deciding factor in this election.And I believe the contrast between him and Kamala Harris could not be clearer. Kamala Harris has a career of standing up for freedom, for reproductive rights, for maternal health. And she will make history as our president, but women can count on her to continue to defend their basic fundamental rights and freedoms. Donald Trump can't do that and hasn't done that.",

He's also saying he will protect whether women, whether they like it or not. Harris is trying to convince America and she can unite the country, but saying Trump is unstable and obsessed with revenge.And presidential historian, Tim Naftali joins us now.

Historically, when presidents in their first term have less than a 40 percent approval rating, they lose and anybody from the same party is apt to do poorly in the next election.And so, from the start, she has faced the challenge of creating a movement for herself while she's linked to an unpopular presidency. We can have a debate later as to why the Biden presidency is unpopular, but the reality is it is. And so, her campaign has made a -- has taken a risk that focusing on her and focusing on Trump and the dangers he -- a second term of Trump would represent is a better bet than trying to take more time to distinguish herself from Biden, to create some space between her and Biden. And her final statement at the Ellipse did include promises about the future, but was mainly a promise for stability and for normalcy, if I can use that term, and contrasting that to Donald Trump, and trying to remind people of the chaos associated with Donald Trump, which is why she was standing at the Ellipse. She was trying to remind people, Donald Trump equals January 6th. On Donald Trump's side, Trump -- any other Republican candidate, I think, would have a much easier time in this election than Trump. Trump is very high unfavourability ratings for someone who's doing as well as he is currently in the polls.",

And you know -- but you know, last night it looked like this series was going to keep going, right? The Yankees were rolling. It looked like we were going back to L.A. for a Game 6. But then, the Yankees, they just had an epic meltdown in the 5th inning. But things started off great in New York. Aaron Judge hitting his first ever World Series home run in the 1st inning. Then Jazz Chisholm came to the plate. He connected for back-to-back home runs. Yankee Stadium was just rocking. They were up 3-0 right away. Then they were up five-nothing in the fifth. That's when things fell apart.Judge dropping this fly ball in center field. Then Anthony Volpe makes a throwing error on this ground here. Then Garritt Cole didn't cover first on this ground or the Dodgers ended up getting five unearned runs in that inning to tie the game up. Then in the eighth, it would be tied at six. Mookie Bets comes into play, it's a sacrifice fly. Tommy Edman scored to give L.A. the lead. Then starter Walker Buehler came out of the bullpen in the ninth. He closed it out. Dodgers win 7-6 to take the World Series in five games. Freddie Freeman, who hit four home runs tied a World Series record with 12 RBIs. He was your MVP. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) FREDDIE FREEMAN, 2024 WORLD SERIES MVP:  This is everything. I'm telling you, I wouldn't be here without the support of everybody in these shirts tonight. It's been a grind these last three months, but this organization, Stan, Andrew, Brandon, Doc, my teammates, my family. It's been a lot and this is it right here. Not this. That one, that one.

Party on in the clubhouse. It was also on in L.A. Fans taken to the streets of downtown to celebrate. Some fans though, Jim, we're up to no good. A city bus was lit on fire. There were also reports of looting. LAPD tweeted for fans not to go to downtown and to celebrate responsibly. They will have a parade Friday morning in downtown L.A. to celebrate and a ticketed celebration at Dodger Stadium.And you know, Jim, L.A. fans have been pretty salty over the past few years because, you know, they won the NBA title with the Lakers in 2020. They won the World Series of the Dodgers in 2020. Got no parades because of COVID. So, I expect massive crowds in L.A. on Friday for this one.",
