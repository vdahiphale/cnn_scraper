But now we are just hours into this cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, which is intended to bring calm and peace to this region. But the residents here in northern Israel, in this town of Chula (ph), are extremely distrustful of this cease-fire. They don't believe that it is actually, truly making them safer. That's because they fear that this threat of anti-tank missiles, which wrought the destruction on this house right here just several months ago, they fear that that threat still very much exists, that Hezbollah will be able to come back, reinfiltrate southern Lebanon and ultimately pose a threat to these communities once again. The Israeli government insists that it will act unilaterally against Hezbollah, should Hezbollah violate that cease-fire. But we are just hours into it. And, for now, this fragile peace has a lot of tests to endure. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

One, focus on the Iranian threat, he said. Two, give his forces a breather and to replenish stock supplies of military hardware. And three, separate the fronts and isolate Hamas.

And I think I just want to reference what Jen was reporting there.It's very interesting, the dynamic there in the buildup, because, of course, France had really fallen out with Israel over the weekend because the French had indicated they would arrest the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, if he landed in France. And they would send him to the ICC, very swift response from the foreign minister here, saying that the French involvement in the cease-fire in Lebanon was therefore in jeopardy. In fact, Israel didn't want it because of the position the French were taking. And just hearing what Jen's hearing from the U.S. side. And what we're hearing now reported in Israel and from Paris, is that the French, subsequent to now being involved in the deal again and being a part of the process of making sure that this ceasefire holds and works and is supported inside Lebanon. We've now learned that the French have taken a new position on whether or not they would arrest prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on those ICC warrants. They've said that because he is the head of a state that isn't a signatory to the Rome statutes, to the ICC, in effect, therefore, he -- therefore, that's a reason why he wouldn't be arrested. And that's the way they interpret international laws, which is an interesting come-around for the French and I think shows you just how complex, tight and nuanced the diplomacy to get here has been. I want to get to your question but I don't want -- I don't want to take up too much time. But I think, you know, what we're seeing here is a pivot away, which does give an opportunity, perhaps, to focus on Gaza. And I think there is clearly some hope. And the-- you know the -- Hamas has said very clearly that they see what has happened with Lebanon. They see the position that Hezbollah has taken. And they are ready to get into ceasefire negotiations. But we're not seeing any statement from them, which indicates they're changing their position. And we haven't heard anything from the Israeli government, indicating it's changing its position about the possibility of those talks and the possibility of a hostage release.",

They have taken out the leader of Hezbollah, Nasrallah, many other top deputies. They have taken out rocket and missile emplacements and therefore Hezbollah is badly weakened. It's a shadow of its former self. And, by the way, they were able to do all of that because of the skill and effectiveness of their soldiers but also because of the backing of the United States. At critical moments in this conflict, President Biden dispatched military assets and capabilities to the region. An aircraft carrier, another aircraft carrier, fighter squadrons and even an advanced, sophisticated air defense battery, to ensure that Israel had what it needed to be able to carry out effectively this campaign against the terrorist group Hezbollah. And the September ceasefire call that you're referring to was actually something coordinated between the U.S. and Israel. Israel decided ultimately it didn't want to do, that it wanted to go forward with a ground campaign to take out emplacements on the other side of the border. The U.S.-backed that and we've arrived today where we are because of the steps Israel has taken but critically because of the steps the United States has taken.

And all eyes, not just from the U.S. and Israel but the rest of the world, are going to turn to Hamas. And so there is now newfound opportunity and possibility to drive forward a ceasefire and hostage deal in Gaza. But I'm not going to stand here and make any predictions that when or how that will come into effect.

What he has not really mentioned is that the overarching goal of Benjamin Netanyahu to return the 60,000 or so displaced Israelis to their homes on the Lebanese-Israeli front could not be done as long as the war continued. Hezbollah is down but is not out. Hezbollah is not defeated. It has been weakened tremendously but Hezbollah has shown that it has been able to reconstitute itself under fire in the past few weeks. Hezbollah has been able, even though it has suffered major blows, the killing of its top leaders, the destruction of its social base of support, its missiles and infrastructure. But it has been able to target the heart of Israel for the past two months, including Haifa and Tel Aviv. And secondly, what we need to understand is that Iran wants an end to this particular war because Iran is very much concerned about the coming administration. It does not really want to fall into the trap of Netanyahu, who keeps saying that Iran, Iran and Iran, because Iranian leaders are anxious about the hardliners within the Trump administration who are viscerally anti- Iran. But for Hezbollah, it has two major objectives:  basically, Lebanese sovereignty and the pulling out of Israeli troops from Lebanon. These are the two option -- scenarios, interests that its new leader, Naim Qassem, has made very clear. But at the end of the day, what we need to understand -- and a minute ago, Becky, you listened to Jake Sullivan celebrating the ceasefire and taking credit for that. He did not really mention that America's support for Israel has led to the death of 3,800 Lebanese in the past few months, 15,000 Lebanese have been injured; 200 children have been killed. And what's happening in Gaza, the colossal failure of the Biden administration to convince and use leverage with Netanyahu to end the war in Gaza, that is a, I mean, humanitarian catastrophe, as you know.",

A reduction by some further 6 percent of GDP as a result of the conflict, which has already had a significant hit over the years of a really wrecked economy. What does -- what do you believe Hezbollah's -- I'm not going to call it retreat. But what does this ceasefire mean for Hezbollah's position in Lebanese society? There will be those who say they don't want to see Hezbollah taking Lebanese society  and politics hostage again. They will say these are not supporters of Hezbollah.

As you said, he was chief of staff to the previous U.S. trade rep under Donald Trump. And remember that was a period where Donald Trump negotiated new deals, trade deals with Mexico and with Canada, as well as the reinstituted instituted NAFTA deal with our other North American trade partners and across the Atlantic as well. And so we've already seen the signs of how Donald Trump intends to engage with trade. Already he is promising across the board tariffs. We saw in just the past 48 hours him threaten China -- or excuse me -- yes, China and Canada and Mexico with 25 percent tariffs, all related to immigration. And then as far as Kevin Hassett, you know, he is someone who is actually a calming voice for a lot of people in the financial sector. He is a well respected right of center economist. And it will be his job to oversee the National Economic Council as a director. And so that that is another pick that he, along with Scott Bessent, that has done a lot to sort of quell the fears of Wall Street, that Donald Trump is going to somehow come in here and shake up the corporate world. And then as far as that new transition agreement, look, this is something that normally is already in place by now, in past transfers of power. It is an agreement that both sides reach before the campaign is even over. In fact, the Harris campaign had signed an agreement with the Biden administration going back to October. The Trump administration blew past that deadline. But now, with this new agreement, his new cabinet picks and the people he is putting in place will have access to all of the information and the briefings that the income -- or the current secretaries have. They will be able to work with these outgoing staff to try to form a transition plan from one administration to the other. It's just sort of the formal bookkeeping and just sort of transfer of power that is relatively normal.

And the U.S. imports a lot of electronics from China. In addition to sneakers, toys, sports equipment and furniture. For example, China makes a sneaker. A U.S. company buys it, pays the import tariff and then makes a choice -- eat the cost or pass it to you. Before the higher tariffs announced Monday night Americans could expect to spend $2,600 more each year under Trump's original tariff proposal. Inflation is expected to rise by 1 percent. U.S. retailers like Steve Madden are already moving production out of China to beat the tariffs and keep prices low for U.S. consumers. Small businesses don't have that same option.",

Deepening your empathy for people who come from different perspectives. Oh, yes, that's what -- conservatives will say that, so will progressives. So there's actually a common ground around inclusion if we frame it as all of us needing to grow to understand each other better.
