I'm Erica Hill in New York, and we do begin this hour with breaking news.\"The New York Times\" reporting President Biden has told an ally, a close ally, he is considering whether to stay in the presidential race. This is the first indication Mr. Biden could end his reelection bid as the fallout from his disastrous debate performance continues to be felt. Joining me now, principal -- principal deputy Biden campaign manager Quentin Fulks. Quentin, it's good to have you with us. I do want to get your take, first of all, on this new reporting from Katie Rogers that the president has told a key ally he knows he may not be able to salvage his candidacy if he can't convince the public in the coming days he is up for the job. What is being discussed in the campaign right now about this?",

The president is in this race to win it. He is the Democratic nominee. And, from our perspective, we're going to continue to do everything we can to make sure that we're building a campaign apparatus to reach voters.",

I think, obviously, the president, in his own words, acknowledged a poor debate performance. But, at the same time, I think what we're sensing from people is asense of urgency and fear from Donald Trump. And I think that the conversations that the president has been having with Democrats across the country is one to reassure them that he is in this race, that he knows that he needs to reassure the American people and that our campaign is going to continue to build in scale to win in November.",

I know that is also the point of the campaign. There's a lot riding on those moments. Will these next few events -- these campaign events in the next couple of days and this interview on Friday, how much will those come into play, in addition to polling, which the campaign has said it is waiting on, when it comes to making a potential decision?",

But that does not define the record of accomplishments. It does not define the vision that President Biden has. And these interviews and these things that the president is doing, our campaign stop in Madison, Wisconsin, on Friday, we want everything to go well, from the campaign's perspective, all the time. But if they don't, I do not think that has a bearing on if whether somebody is going to continue running for president of the United States. But, obviously, we prepare to make sure that everything goes off as smoothly as possible all the time. But I don't think we should put so much stock into, if a slip of the tongue happens or if something happens, then that's the end. This is a choice. And it has been from the beginning of this election. And we're going to continue to make this a choice between Joe Biden, who wakes up every day thinking about the American people, and Donald Trump, who only cares for himself and is in it to destroy our democracy, quite literally.",

There is now going to be a meeting at the White House with those governors and the president. But there has been frustration about the lack of communication. That's coming from elected officials. That's coming from donors. The lack of communication from both the president and the campaign. I know that the president did speak with Leader Jeffries and has also spoken, as I understand it, with Leader Schumer just in the last couple of days.

Moderate Congressman Jared Golden writing in an op-ed that he thinks Donald Trump is going to win in November. He is not the only one who has said that. How does the president plan to message? How does he plan to contain what feels like a bit of a revolt starting, right, that seems to be building in Congress against him?",

And the vision for this country for the next four years is also Joe Biden's vision. But we -- I really do want to -- Erin, if you will allow me to -- Erica, if you will allow me to take a step back, and really just put this in for perspective. People continue to count Joe Biden out. And we continue to see the president perform. Most people would walk away. Joe Biden, when he was 29 that was just elected senator, lost his wife and his daughter. Most people would have walked away. Joe Biden lost his son. Most people would have walked away. Joe Biden came from retirement because he saw what Donald Trump was doing to this country in Charlottesville because he knew he had to turn it around, and he got to work. He led us through a pandemic. He has done a massive amount of work to put America back on track. People, if I -- I take us back to 2020. Look at Iowa. Look at New Hampshire, a fourth- and a fifth-place finish. And then, three weeks later, Joe Biden had almost -- almost successfully combined the Democratic Party and wrapped up the nomination. That is who Joe Biden is. He is a fighter. He is going to keep fighting. He is going to keep talking about the vision that he has. And, meanwhile, on the other side, Donald Trump is doing none of that. We see him continuing to double down. We see Donald Trump not being out on the trail, not talking about anything. And so, yes, Donald -- or Joe Biden is 81, but Joe Biden is 81, and he's going to stop a national abortion ban. Joe Biden is 81, and he's going to continue to defect -- to protect climate and the environment. It does not change anything. We are not being Pollyannish about this at all.",

It's the message we heard from the first lady, of course, from the president in the wake of that debate, that, when Joe Biden gets knocked down, he gets back up. That has worked for him for decades in politics.But I will point out, what we are seeing and hearing from the American people in the wake of that debate is not favorable for your candidate. The most recent polling from CNN, three-quarters of voters believe the Democratic Party has a better shot at holding the White House with someone other than Joe Biden. That same poll does show the vice president doing better in a head-to- head match up with Donald Trump than Joe Biden. You also have a new CBS News poll out that finds seven in 10 think someone besides the president would be a better fit. How much is the campaign taking into account these reservations from the American people?",

And our campaign has a very clear understanding about what needs to be done in order to make sure that we are going to be in a position to win this.

We saw the president at a debate, and, again, acknowledging, the president acknowledging in his own words that it wasn't the best performance. But, after that, we saw the president get out. The president went to a rally. The president went to North Carolina, greeted supporters at 2:00 a.m. on a tarmac, delivered a speech. We saw the president give a speech about immunity. We have seen the president give a speech and talk about extreme heat and climate, which he's done way more on than Donald Trump. We have seen the president continue to go out. We have announced that the president is going to do a sit-down interview. We have announced that we have an event in a battleground state of Wisconsin, in Madison, to continue to communicate with voters. And, meanwhile, I will again point out to you, during that time, where has Donald Trump been? Where is Donald Trump? We are in the middle of a campaign, and the choice is between Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and our campaign continues, and the president continues to show and demonstrate that he's doing it. He was in New York doing a fund-raiser. The work is being done, and we have to continue to communicate about the stakes of this election. And, yesterday, after a Supreme Court ruling that basically handed Donald Trump the keys to a dictatorship, we have not seen that. We have not seen Donald Trump. We see him sitting in Mar-a-Lago tweeting about being happy that they have told him that he can continue to rip away freedoms and basically do whatever he wants if he regains the keys to the White House. And that is the fundamental stakes of this election between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. And we are going to continue to stay on a path to draw that contrast every single day.",

Thank you.I do want to discuss further now with CNN political commentator former Biden White House communications director Kate Bedingfield and Republican strategist Doug Heye. Good to see you both. Kate, I know you just heard the reporting from M.J., as she pointed out, the White House denying \"The New York Times\"' reporting, the campaign also denying to me just a couple of moments ago that \"New York Times\" reporting. But I think it's important, as we hear what M.J. is saying here, right., the fact that there is this meeting, there is clearly a discussion going on, despite the fact that the campaign just told me there was no discussion whatsoever. Kate, how do you read this? What does this tell you about the mind-set of the man who you worked for and the mind-set inside that White House right now?",

I think they know that the task ahead of them is to put President Biden out there, for him to demonstrate that he is energetic, that he is capable, that he's vigorous, that this campaign over the next four months is going to be about taking it back to Donald Trump. I mean, that's -- in addition to assuaging some of the concerns about age and energy, which is an immediate task ahead of him, the other big task for him here is to drive the message of the race back to Trump and back to what is actually at stake here and back to the fact that his opponent is somebody who has said he's going to use the White House as a tool of personal retribution, and that he might not accept the results of the election. And so there is a real threat here. There's a threat to women's reproductive health. There's a threat to essentially your freedoms. So the task that Biden has now is to drive the race back to that ground. I think he can do that. But I also think that that is going to be contingent on these next few days and kind of how this all goes for him.",

I mean, she's not -- I feel like there's this caricature of her out there right now as some sort of conniving political spouse.I can tell you, as somebody who worked for Joe Biden for a long time, they have an incredibly close, loving relationship. They lean on each other. And I expect that that is what's happening right now. I mean, ultimately, this is a decision that President Biden and his family and the team around him will make. But I think what is the immediate task in front of them is for him to get out there, show some energy, show that he has the vigor to take on the rest of this campaign. I think he's certainly capable of doing that. But I think people rightly want to see it. And I think you have got things on his schedule over the next few days that are going to allow him to showcase that. He's going to be campaigning. He's going to be out in the country. He's obviously going to do this interview on Friday. So we will have opportunities to see him. But I think, if you look at where the polling stands right now, it has not -- the bottom hasn't fallen out from under him. It hasn't cratered. And so I think a few more days to let this play out, let Joe Biden make his case, I think is the responsible thing to do, because the truth is, there's no magic wand that you can wave to sub Joe Biden out as the nominee that will be seamless and simple. So I think a few days to let him go out, show what he can do is prudent. And I think that he will live up to it.",
