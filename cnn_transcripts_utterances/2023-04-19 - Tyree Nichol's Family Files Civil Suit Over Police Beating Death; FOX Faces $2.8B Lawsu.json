The attorneys for Air National Guardsman Jack Teixeira said they need more time to prepare. And the Air Force unit where the 21-year-old was assigned has now been stripped of its intelligence duties while the Pentagon conducts an internal probe. Teixeira is accused of posting classified documents in an online chat room popular among video gamers. He's facing charges under the Espionage Act. Meantime, sometime between now and midnight, the Supreme Court is going to decide whether women can have access to the nation's most commonly used abortion pill. Mifepristone has been approved by the FDA for the past 23 years. But a federal judge in Texas ruled the agency violated the law in the approval process. Appeals were filed by multiple parties, including the drug's manufacturer. Last week, Justice Samuel Alito put a temporary hold on that Texas decision to give the court more time to review the case. But it does expire at 11:59 P.M tonight. Access to the medication would be immediately restricted. Brianna?",

This is a combination of a total and annular solar eclipse. And it occurs when the moon passes in front of the sun.

The former chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, Alan Weisselberg, has just been released from Rikers Island after serving time for his role in a decades-long tax fraud scheme. He was sentenced back in January to five months as part of a plea deal. Weisselberg pleaded guilty to 15 felonies and testified against his former employer. And the Supreme Court has cleared the way for a Texas death row inmate to try using DNA to prove his innocence. Rodney Reid claims an all- white jury wrongly convicted him of killing a 19-year-old white woman in Texas back in 1998.
