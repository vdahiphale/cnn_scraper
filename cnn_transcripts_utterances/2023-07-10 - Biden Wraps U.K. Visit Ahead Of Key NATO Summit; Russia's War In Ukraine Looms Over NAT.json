      "sentences": "Well, we begin in the U.K., a trip draped in pageantry and ceremony under the shadow of war and the specter ofclimate change. Right now, U.S. President Joe Biden is wrapping up his trip there. He spent the last few hours with King Charles. With both men, they were expected to discuss climate change earlier. The president also met with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to discuss Ukraine. That's ahead of tomorrow's key NATO summit in Lithuania. Mr. Biden expects to be back on Air Force One in just a few minutes, heading to the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. The big news ahead of Tuesday's high-stakes NATO summit is coming from Turkey's President. Recep Tayyip Erdogan is asking to clear Ankara's path to E.U. membership before paving the way for Sweden to join NATO. We are on the ground following this all for you. We got CNN's Max Foster at Windsor Castle, and our Nic Robertson is outside Downing Street. Max, I want to start with you. We've just seen Biden wrapping up that meeting with British PM Rishi Sunak, as well as King Charles. I want you to take me through the main messaging here before he heads to the NATO summit.",

      "sentences": "I think these moments between the heads of state is really important because the U.S. is, by far, Britain'smost important ally in the world. So, they roll out the red carpet and President Biden came. He was given the honor of inspecting the honor guard and then he went for tea with the king. This is something we've seen in the past with Queen Elizabeth, of course, but then something slightly different this time. They went on to get a briefing on a meeting about climate change. So, you had the heads of U.S. and British banks discussing ways to try to alleviate the effects of climate change. And this was a big important meeting and this is something that The King can do. He can -- he uses his convening power to bring important people together to discuss big issues. I just had a chance to speak to the U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry. He was in that meeting and he told me it was agreed that we need to accelerate the deployment of capital investments in the new energy economy. So getting big bank leaders to really try to use some of the capital, as John Kerry says, is sitting on the sidelines and trying to put it into clean energy. So, some progress on that meeting as well. And this is interesting to see how King Charles is choosing to use these moments for his new type of monarchy, which is distinct from the Queen, Queen Elizabeth, the late Queen, because we never really heard about any of the details about her meetings. But there are two different ways of effectively trying to achieve the same thing, which is solidify relations between nations.",

      "sentences": "He is, and he has been. He has said that Ukraine is not going to get immediate membership of NATO,and I think that was a given the concern that President Zelenskyy has expressed -- is very much in keeping with the way that he has tried to get allies to go the maximum, do the maximum on providing military support, you know, pushing for planes, pushing for air defenses, pushing for tanks way before anyone was willing to do it. So I think this is very much in keeping with what President Zelenskyy does, which is keep up a strong narrative of what he feels Ukraine needs and indeed on the battlefield. It's sort of been assessed to be right so far that he needed the military support ahead of when it actually came. On this specific issue of NATO membership, interesting that we heard from the Foreign Minister in Ukraine today saying that the original NATO roadmap, if you will, for Ukraine to join came about April 2008, the Bucharest NATO summit there. It was going to follow a system called MAPS, which is, you know, a process of integration. That is now going to be bypassed. There will be another process, a process that perhaps we'll hear more about coming out of the summit. And I think some of the detail in that is going to address the obvious elephant in the room that Ukraine is at war, if Ukraine was to become an immediate member of NATO then the article five would be triggered and the rest of the NATO Allies would be at war with Russia. That's obviously one of the principal reasons why it can't happen. The democratization, the democracy, that needs to be installed or instilled in Ukraine is the other issue here, to have a Democratic civilian leadership or control of the military, again, a prerequisite for NATO not just the integration of weapons systems. So, I think for these reasons, Ukraine can expect to look -- to get some language that will benefit it and some of the discussion here will have been about the modalities of that. Its security guarantees through continued military support, continued economic support. President Biden, over the weekend in his interview with CNN, likened it to perhaps what Israel has at the moment with the United States, which is, you know, first world high tech weapon systems training on those weapon systems and the knowledge that its ally has its back. And so that's -- I guess that's the realm that run at the moment, not the full membership room.",

This is going to be a vital moment. This is going to be an important NATO Summit. He's just wrapped up his visit in the U.K. visiting Rishi Sunak, the British Prime Minister, as well as King Charles, solidifying the relationship there. A really important trip for him and, of course, now heading to the NATO summit. All right. Before leaving for Europe, CNN's Fareed Zakaria sat down exclusively with president Biden. The U.S. leader spoke candidly on why he believes Ukraine still isn't ready to join NATO. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT: I don't think there is unanimity in NATO about whether or not to bring Ukraine into the NATO family now at this moment in the middle of a war. For example, if you did that then, you know, we -- I - - and I mean what I say we're determined to commit every inch of territory that is NATO territory, it's a commitment that we've all made no matter. If the war is going on, then we're all in war, you know. We're in war with Russia, if that were the case. So I think we have to lay out a path for a rational path for Russia, for -- excuse me, for Ukraine to be able to qualify to get into NATO. But I think it's premature to say to call for vote, you know, in now because there's other qualifications that need to be met, including democratization and some of those issues. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Now, the supposed attack and targets of the attack, the paramilitary group Rapid Support Forces released this video showing the aftermath of the strike. The group says more than 31 people were killed and dozens of civilians injured. CNN's Senior Editor for Africa, Stephanie Busari joins us in our live with more on the airstrike and its aftermath. Stephanie, great to have you on. Look, the latest strike killing 22 people at least, you know, we know that numbers is being questioned, just shows how this could descend into a bigger cycle of violence. Diplomatic efforts we know have been proven to be ineffective. And now the U.N. is warning of a full-scale civil war. I mean, what kind of interventions are the U.N. talking about at this stage?",

This is the latest incident toprovoke outrage, to provoke condemnation in this seemingly never-ending war that has claimed so far nearly 3,000 lives and more than 6,000 people injured. And what is really shocking for observers, and including the U.N., is that it seems to be happening with no attention being paid to the civilian casualties. These attacks are happening in residential areas and we're hearing of people being forced out of their homes by paramilitaries to carry out full- scale attacks and really just launch attacks, you know, on civilians without paying any attention to the rising numbers of casualties. This diplomatic efforts have been tried. Numerous ceasefires have been instituted, but they've never worked. And it's just continuing. And the U.N. has said that it's really concerned that the humanitarian efforts and international law has been ignored very largely in this war between two rival generals, Eleni.",

The heavy rains spurred landslides and flashfloods, killing at least 22 people. Rescue efforts continue for those stuck in flashfloods. Forecasters say heavy rainfall is expected for the next five days. Meanwhile, 10 million people in the northeastern U.S. are under flashflood alerts. New York's governor declared a state of emergency in Orange County where one woman has died. Forecasters are calling Sunday's delusion in West Point, a once-in-a-millennium rainfall event. Major flooding is also heading parts of New England, including Killington, Vermont, where a highway has been washed out and the state's governor has declared a state of emergency. As forecasters expect, more severe weather will impact the area on Monday. You can see those images. There we've got meteorologists. Jennifer Gray joining us now.

You know, we still have all day today to go tonight and then possibly into tomorrow morning.This is a very slow moving cold front, pretty much stalled out over the area. And it's just bringing torrential rain rolling over the same areas for hours and hours. And so here's a picture from Ontario County. You can see the roads are closed. There's even a kayaker in the middle of the road. We have seen flash flooding all across portions of New England. And that's going to continue as we go throughout the day today. I'm going to need my producer to advance a graphic for me. There we go. We have the flash flood threat across portions of Vermont in eastern sections of New York. This is a level four out of four high risk of flash flooding. This is very rare to be issued by the Weather Prediction Center. But this area is going to be really susceptible for flash flooding throughout the day today as well as tonight. Flashflood warnings are in effect for a large chunk of Vermont. And you can see we also have flood watches in effect as well. This is a very saturated area. Over the last, two weeks, we have gotten a lot of rainfall across this region. And so any additional rainfall is really just making the flash flooding worse. Rivers are rising -- rivers are running very, very high. They're going to rise even higher with this additional rainfall. This is the current radar. And you can see just rain pouring all across New England. The radar estimated rainfall in the last 24 hours or running more than 200 millimeters in some locations. And some areas received all of that rainfall in just about a six hour timeframe. West Point, New York, for example, nearly a one in one thousand year event with 200 millimeters of rain. That's a preliminary storm total. And they received that within about six hours. So, just incredible numbers coming out of the Northeast and New England. So, here are the probabilities of occurrence with that one in one thousand year event is a 0.1 percent chance in any given year of this happening. And we know, due to climate change, we're seeing these excessive rainfall events happening more frequently than we used to. And so this is something we're dealing with more and more across the northeastern U.S., New England. We are going to expect many flight delays as this rain continues to fall. You can see another photo right here. We're going to see more roads washed out. We're going to see major flooding across this region today.

Number three, we found ourselves in a circumstance where the war in Yemen is essentially for a year now, been -- it's ended -- now peace is being kept. So, we're making progress in the region.
