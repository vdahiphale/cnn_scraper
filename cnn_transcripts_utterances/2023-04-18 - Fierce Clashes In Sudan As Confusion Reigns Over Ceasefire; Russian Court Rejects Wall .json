Then Moscow rejects the appeal of U.S. journalist Evan Gershkovich against the terms of his pretrial detention. We'll have more on his court appearance. Plus, the hotly anticipated defamation trial between \"Fox News\" and U.S. voting technology firm gets underway. Those details coming up later this hour. But first, tonight, rival commanders in Sudan had agreed to a ceasefire that was supposed to take effect. In fact, two hours ago after facing pressure from Washington. But it appears the fighting hasn't stopped. The conflict broke out between the country's army and the Rapid Support Forces, a powerful militia group that happened on Saturday if you remember. Now, the risk of a humanitarian crisis couldn't be higher. Civilians in Khartoum are caught in the crossfire, and they have been facing power as well as water cuts, and we brought you that in the show yesterday, and are struggling to get food. The World Health Organization warning that medical supplies there are running low, and quote, \"Sudanese officials say nearly 300 people have been killed so far\". The RSF and the army had worked together in the past to overthrow Sudan's former President, autocrat, Omar al-Bashir, four years ago, if you remember, and again in 2021 to push out, the civilian government. Well, our chief international investigative correspondent Nima Elbagir joins me now and Sir William Patey; a former British ambassador to Sudan are with me now. Thank you, Sir William for   joining us, Nima, great to have you back on the show. And it's so important that you are back because in many ways, you are our eyes and our ears on the ground.

That's more than normal in this particular court, but the judge wanted more jurors -- or rather more alternate jurors specifically because it's going to be such a potentially long trial that anything could happen. People get sick, they wanted alternates at the ready. There are six men and six women in this original pool of jurors, and then of that original 12, according to our court reporter who's been sitting inside this whole time, about nine of them appear to be people of color. So that's the make-up right now. And I should also mention that, the jury is made up of folks from here in New Castle County to the larger county surrounding Wilmington, a more Democratic-leaning county, so the challenge will be to see if there are more or less \"Fox\" viewers, potentially in that jury pool.",

Even anecdotally, we're seeing hotels,flights, resorts being filled again after being empty for years now. Even prices, fares and the prices shooting through the roof in many cases. But the same thing cannot be said about big ticket item purchases. People are not buying new cars. There are certainly not buying new homes. And the housing sector was the driver of economic growth for decades in this country. But now this sector is in a slow motion crash and with developers running out of cash to not only unable to start new projects but even having difficulties finishing construction of already presold apartments. And also perhaps the most sensitive economic data point, youth unemployment. That is the rate for people between the age of 16 and 24. That number increased to 19.6 percent in March 2023. That's the second highest figure in -- on record. And that's very worrisome because this is closely related to the issue of social stability, especially at a time when we are going to see hundreds of thousands more new college graduates flooding the job market in the coming months. So a lot of underlying challenges, a lot of undercurrents despite these robust figures released by the government on Tuesday -- Steven Jiang, CNN, Beijing. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The movie is going to be now filmed in Montana at Yellowstone Ranch, so a beautiful location. Alec Baldwin is expected to be back to film; same with the director, Joel Souza. Now Joel Souza was also injured when that live round of ammunition came out of the bullet and went through Halyna Hutchins and actually into the shoulder of Joel Souza. But he's going to be back. So how did this all come about? You might be wondering, why would they want to go back to film something where such a sad and awful tragedy took place. This is all part of a settlement that was reached between Alec Baldwin in a wrongful death suit filed by Halyna Hutchins' widower, Matthew Hutchins. And they filed this against Alec Baldwin and members of production. And they decided all right, we're going to dismiss this wrongful death lawsuit and as part of that we are going to go back, film the movie, give the profits to  Halyna Hutchins' widower. And he actually serves as an executive producer on the film, so it's all a lot of things coming together. And I don't know when the movie is going to come out.
