Yes, what we're experiencing right now is moments of torrential rain, rain coming at you sideways, just slapping you in the face, and then this heavy wind-gusts -- now, I'm just a couple of blocks away from the Swannanoa River here in Asheville, and here in the past hour, the county has just issued a mandatory evacuation order for people living around the river.And in fact, if we push in our camera right down that way, you can see even despite the fact that we're a couple of blocks away from the river. Already, all of this flooding is coming up, we can see police officers shutting down several roads especially around Biltmore Village, an area that, you know, so many tourists know and love, that is known to be a flood zone area. Now, the National Weather Service has been warning people  for at least a day or two. Now, to expect one of the most significant weather events in modern times for this region. This is a very serious situation -- well, and there's a major wind-gusts right there, for folks living here in Asheville, the flooding from two major rivers reaching 10 feet already, they're expecting  another 10 feet since Wednesday. They've had rainfall not from Helene, from a different weather system reaching 8 inches. They're expecting by the end of Helene not to go to over 20 inches. So, the worst is yet to come really for residents here in Buncombe County and Asheville.   I spoke with the fire chief yesterday about what's really keeping him up at night. Listen.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was going to address United Nations General Assembly as fears of a regional war grow, Israel says it intercepted -- there they are, about ten projectiles that Hezbollah had fired towards the city of Haifa earlier today.You could hear those deafening sounds. It says it later destroyed the long short that had been used to do that. This follows what the U.S. and other allies thought was a major breakthrough and a possible ceasefire plan.

      "sentences": "Well, Sara, it certainly doesn't appear imminent, and there is some disappointment and frustration among U.S. officials about what we've been hearing from Netanyahu since this war announced. But frankly, they shouldn't be very much surprised.We have seen time and time again over the past 11 months that Netanyahu has been willing to publicly and repeatedly defy the Biden administration. But it was just about 36 hours ago when White House officials almost triumphantly announced this 21-day plan for a ceasefire, a truce to get to a peace, a temporary peace so that a more permanent ceasefire could be negotiated. And this was put out by the U.S. and ten other allies, and it appeared that Israel, Hezbollah and the Lebanese, were all on board. And then Netanyahu very quickly dashed those hopes, saying that they would continue to hit Hezbollah with all of their might. So, how to reconcile this, it's particularly confusing because Israeli officials were very much involved in those discussions, not just any Israeli officials, but Netanyahu's closest aide, Ron Dermer, he was speaking with the National Security adviser, Jake Sullivan and others. And the White House actually conceded yesterday that they would not have put this plan out so publicly if they did not believe that the Israelis were not on board, but they do not appear to yet be on board. We have heard from the Prime Minister's office just last night, trying to smooth the waters, essentially saying that they do share the aims of this U.S.-led initiative, and that discussions do continue. So, that's where we are, Sara, these diplomatic discussions are continuing. It's obviously a big day here at the United Nations, we are waiting to hear from Netanyahu not too long from now. It is possible, Sara, that, you know, the Israelis could continue to hit Hezbollah for a few more days. They may feel like they've got more to do militarily and then agree to this truce. But at the same time, we've seen a real willingness they say to go in on the ground, they are preparing for a ground incursion into Lebanon, which would significantly escalate the situation and raise the possibility of a much broader conflict.

Now, Adams and his lawyers have said that he's done nothing wrong, some of the gifts he received, they said were just that, they were just gifts. Some of the airline and free trips that he received were just free airline upgrades. He says that he wants New Yorkers to hear his defense. Take a listen to the U.S. Attorney.
