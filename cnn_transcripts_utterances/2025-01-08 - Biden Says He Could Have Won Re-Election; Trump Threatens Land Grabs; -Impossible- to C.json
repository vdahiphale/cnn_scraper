      "sentences": "-- more on that in just a moment. But in the meantime, with just days left in his term, President Biden is clearing the air. He sat down for a rare exit interview with USA Today's Susan Page and was asked if he could have won in November. Biden responding, quote, saying this, \"It's presumptuous to say that, but I think yes, based on the polling.\" At which point, Page asked him if he'd have the vigor to serve another four years, Biden's response was, quote, \"I don't know. Who the hell knows. So, far, so good. But who knows what I'm going to be when I'm 86 years old.\"The president also says he has not decided yet whether to issue preemptive pardons before leaving office, but added that during their meeting in November, he urged Donald Trump not to focus on revenge, saying this, quote, \"I tried to make it clear that there was no need and it was counterintuitive for his interest to go back and try to settle scores.\" Joining me now to discuss Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal of Washington State. Congresswoman, thank you so much for being here. I guess, first of all, what are your thoughts on whether President Biden should have remained the nominee? Do you think he would have beaten Donald Trump? I mean, I spoke to some Biden folks back in those days when this was all being batted around, they were worried privately that he was going to lose re-election. What do you think about that? REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA):  Well, Jim, I just focused on what is in front of us now. The election has already happened and I think we can go back and think about it. But the reality is, we've got things we're doing right now in Congress and have to be focused on how we win back the House, the Senate, and the White House. But I think that, you know, the reality of what Republicans are going to do this Republican trifecta in trying to pass a Trump tax scam 2.0. that benefits the wealthiest corporations and individuals and takes things away from working class Americans who are just struggling to make it every day, that's the focus that I'm working on right now.",

And I think that we have to be very focused on what he's going to do to lower prices for Americans.I think that tariffs, of course, are can -- the threat of tariffs sometimes can bring about some longer-term change, but you will see prices going up for Americans. And he admitted that, you know, Jim, after the election -- during the campaign, he was saying, oh, I'm going to bring prices down. Immediately after the election was done Donald Trump was saying, well, actually, my tariff plans are going to raise prices for Americans. And we've got lots of economists saying that. And so, I think it depends on what the goal is of the tariffs. If the long-term goal is to preserve manufacturing in the United States and there's an investment by the U.S. government the way that Joe Biden and Democrats did with the Inflation Reduction Act and with many of these other bills, the CHIPS and Science Act, that's one thing. But simply, you know, using the threat of tariffs to try to cow other nations is, you have to recognize that that is going to raise prices and we're going to enter into tariff wars that, as you know, are very difficult to end. Once you implement a tariff, it is very difficult to end that because it starts a whole chain of reaction.",

And I think it is a sad day in this country that I still serve, Jim, with 137 Republicans who are election deniers. They don't believe that Biden won the election legitimately in 2020. They're still spreading misinformation about the 2020 election. The ones that were here were part and parcel of trying to contest that election on the House floor on January 6 and denying the violence that happened. I was trapped in the gallery that day. I will not forget how close we came to losing our democracy that day, and I don't think any American should allow that memory to fade because it is absolutely essential for the future that we do not -- that Donald Trump does not pardon these insurrectionists who were convicted and that we discourage this kind of violence. It's stunning to me that we even have to, you know, continue to have the conversation, but it's so important that we do.",
