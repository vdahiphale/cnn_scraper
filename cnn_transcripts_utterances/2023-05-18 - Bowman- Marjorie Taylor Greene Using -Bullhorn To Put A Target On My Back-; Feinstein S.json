      "sentences": "Thank you, Anderson.Good evening. And thank you, for joining me. Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, dismissing Donald Trump's presidential candidacy, days before he's set to make his own candidacy, official. According to \"The New York Times,\" DeSantis is pitching donors, by saying there are only three real contenders, in the presidential race, himself, Joe Biden, and Trump. But he says only two candidates have a chance, at winning the Presidency, and Donald Trump is not one of them. Trump is, of course, the front-runner, so far, despite his election lies, and mountain of legal troubles, one of which ended, with a jury, finding him liable, for sexual abuse. DeSantis is driving home, his record, of turning culture war issues, into laws. Then, there's Nikki Haley, and Senator Tim Scott, who are calling for a return, to what they call true conservatism, without directly attacking Donald Trump. Former Vice President Mike Pence, who worked in the Trump presidency, but also became a target of it, says he too, wants to return, back to the party's original roots. And there are those presidential hopefuls, and potential candidates, who say Trump should never step foot in the Oval Office again. That is where former Arkansas governor, Asa Hutchinson, former New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, and New Hampshire governor, Chris Sununu land. More candidates with less name recognition are also jumping in with various platforms. For his part, DeSantis travels to another early nominating state, tomorrow, when he visits New Hampshire. Here now, with his take, on the road to 2024, Michael Smerconish, host of \"SMERCONISH,\" here on CNN, and of \"The Michael Smerconish Program\" on SiriusXM. Michael, Governor DeSantis has said all of these things, saying Donald Trump can't win, but he and Joe Biden might. Do you buy it? MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN ANCHOR, \"SMERCONISH\": Ron DeSantis -- hi, Sara, first of all, thanks for having me. Ron DeSantis would seemingly have a very strong hand, right? Florida governor, he's going to be very well-funded. He's got organizational support, and a lot of endorsements. Oh, wait a minute. Maybe we've seen this movie before. Because all of those things were said about Jeb Bush, which I think just underscores, how hard it is, to handicap what's about to unfold. The pitch seems to be you get Donald Trump's policies, without Donald Trump's values. But what I keep thinking is that those so-called values, of Donald Trump, the rough edges, the offensive statements that alienates so many are also what pack 5,000, 10,000 people, into an arena, for one of his rallies. So, even though a number of Republicans, they say, \"I'd love to have Trump's policies. I just didn't -- just don't wish I had the other aspects of Donald Trump,\" I don't know that that drives out a vote. And you got to drive out a vote to win.",

And it's like Donald Trump has all the lanes, and then there's an HOV lane. And maybe Ron DeSantis is in the HOV lane. And you know that if you've got an additional passenger, you get to go faster than everybody else, in those other lanes. But it's hard for me to see any room at the end, for anyone other than Trump or DeSantis. And according to all the polls, it's not just a one-off. Donald Trump has like a 30-point lead, over Ron DeSantis, right now. Is that because DeSantis has not formally come out, because he hasn't responded to that which Trump has said about him? Or has Trump already defined him in a way that's going to limit the appeal that DeSantis can ever have? I would love to sit here, and make a bold prediction, about what's about to unfold. But I really don't know. There are so many intangibles that none of us have a crystal ball.",

But when she thinks somebody else is doing? The tactic she employs, are not just nonsensical, they're dangerous, because it's whataboutism, and then it's wrapped up in racism. It's plain and simple. She doesn't reflect the vast majority of White conservative women, in this country. She doesn't reflect their views. She doesn't even reflect the views of the vast majority of conservative women. And I submit to you that the more she continues this, we'll be able to see her real ambition. And I think we already see some of it. She does these incidents. She goes at them alone, because she fundraises off of them. You don't see any of her colleagues, the ones, who look like her, women in the GOP, in the House chamber, rushing to her defense, because what I saw in that incident was a heated discussion, between two colleagues. Was it civil? I think it was. But what it indicated is that she, and many others, also on the other side of the aisle? I'm not going to say it's equal amounts, or in the same way.

So, why isn't it being enforced?Hospitals are supposed to inform their patients, what procedures cost, before their treatment. The problem? Hospitals aren't being held accountable. The government agency, responsible, lists only four hospitals being fined, in 2022 and 2023, combined. Patients also don't know to ask for the information. One study found only 9 percent of adults were aware that hospitals must disclose this information. There's also a big disconnect, between government data, and private reviews. The official figures show 70 percent compliance. But a survey, by a patient rights group, found only about a quarter of hospitals are actually following the law. One of the highest-profile people, demanding change, an unlikely advocate, he is known worldwide, for his dope rhymes, and memorable hooks, not patient advocacy. I'm talking about this guy.
