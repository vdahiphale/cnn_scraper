They say one of the fortunate things that happened is there was a missile alert and the staff and the children that were being treated here actually got evacuated to a bomb shelter. The staff then immediately came out and started sifting through the rubble. Now, all of this is currently a clean-up operation, but you can see just how powerful that blast must have been. This is one of the floors of that building. And here it's evident that it just flat pack down. Those are some of the supporting beams. And the Ukrainians say that there will be a response to this. The Russians claim this might have been a stray Ukrainian interceptor that hit the building.

A charge the Kremlin denies. It's a huge disappointment and a devastating blow, Ukraine's president announces, to see the leader of the world's largest democracy hug the world's most bloody criminal in Moscow. Moscow has been a close partner with India for generations, supplying the Indian military with weapons since the days of the Soviet Union. More recently, Russia has become an Indian gas station of sorts. India has been scooping up billions of dollars in Russian crude oil, which most Western countries stopped buying after Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Booming bilateral trade, it's, helping fund Russia's war machine. In Moscow the two leaders announced plans to expand Russian energy deliveries. But on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made his most critical public statements to date about the war in Ukraine, appearing to lecture Putin on the heartbreak of seeing innocent children killed.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT, 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The biggest problem for the radical left Democrats is that their candidates are very much, if you take a look, mentally deficient. Is that a nice statement? They are mentally deficient. I'm saying that because the other term is too tough. The biggest problem is that their policies are no good. Their policies are horrible. Americans want strong borders, not open borders. We want low taxes, not high taxes. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And while it does not define porn, it says even librarians caught with it should be registered as sex offenders. PAUL DANS, DIRECTOR, PROJECT 2025: We are an historic movement of the conservative coalition, coming together to make sure that the next conservative president is ready to hit the ground running day one. FOREMAN (voice-over): For now, Donald Trump is keeping Project 2025 at arm's length, calling parts \"ridiculous and abysmal.\" But he hasn't said which parts. FOREMAN: Part of Trump's political problem here is that several of the authors of this plan are part of his inside team, making it considerably harder for him to say he didn't know much about it.
