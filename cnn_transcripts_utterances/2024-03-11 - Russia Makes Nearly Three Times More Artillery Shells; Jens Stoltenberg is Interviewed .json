Political support for NATO in the U.S. Congress. I visited the - the Washington - Washington just a couple of weeks ago, and that was the message from both the Republican and the Democrat -- Democratic side. And thirdly, the criticism has not mainly been against NATO, but the criticism coming from former President Trump has been against NATO allies not spending enough on NATO. An there things have really changed. Now, more and more NATO allies are spending at least 2 percent, the NATO guideline, of GDP on defense. And now Sweden joined today. They are spending more than 2 percent. So - so - so European allies and Canada are really making difference now by significant increasing what they spend on defense.",

It was the first picture manipulated or otherwise we have seen of the princess since her surgery.With us now is \"Vanity Fair\" staff writer and co-host of \"Dynasty\" podcast, Erin Vanderhoof. Erin, thanks so much for being with us. What's this about? Is this controversy about health or is it about transparency? ERIN VANDERHOOF, STAFF WRITER, \"VANITY FAIR\": I think it's some combination of the two. You know, ever since January, Kensington Palace has been really balancing their, you know, desire to give Kate some deserve time off, you know, after a long hospitalization -- she was in hospital for about 12 days -- with the fact that, you know, the public has an interest and, in the case of the British taxpayer, they have a right to know. And I think that right now we're just kind of seeing them deal with an unprecedented situation. There's never been a time when so many royals have been facing so many health issues. On one hand, they were really transparent in the beginning, but I think that on the other hand there's still a lot -- a lack of trust, I think, between the palace and the public just based on, you know, being -- everything that happened in the wake of Prince Harry and Meghan, the duchess of Sussex, leaving. Like, there's still a rift there and they haven't quite figured out how to peel it.",

It hasn't been released yet.Now, if that were the United States, if that were in the United States, and the head of state was not leveling with the American people about the condition of his or her health, that would be a huge scandal.

But I'll note that he's been, you know, kind of joking that he's become like the first monarch who's also a content creator because he has been, you know, filming videos at -- in the palace. He's been showing pictures from his meetings. And I think that that -- what we've seen from Charles is actually a little bit different than what we are seeing from Kate, who has been totally out of the public eye other than one paparazzi shot. They arranged so that she could leave without any cameras, you know, watching when she left the hospital. And I think that that -- the difference between the way that Charles - I mean that the king and that Kate's illnesses have been handled is one thing that's causing the speculation.The other thing that's causing speculation is that there just are still - you know, that we're used to seeing pictures of Kate all of the time.",

So, it's a transitional moment that has just gotten out of hand partially because, you know, in a meaningful way we don't actually really know what is going through Kate's mind right now.
