Wiles is a familiar face in Florida political circles. That clip there was pretty interesting. You kind of get a sense that she didn't really want to be in the spotlight.

      "sentences": "Well, you're absolutely right there. It's very well known that Susie does not like, Susie Wiles, I should say, does not like to draw attention to herself. She likes to kind of stay away from the story. She doesn't want it to be about her, obviously, I think, a quality that Donald Trump very much appreciates and likes about her. We know that other times when people are really jockeying for the attention alongside him, it doesn't always go over so well.But, one key thing about Susie Wiles that I think is important to keep in mind is how loyal she has been to Donald Trump. There is no secret that Donald Trump values loyalty really above all else, and she has been there from really -- the past several years now, she has held a very high position of power. After Donald Trump had left the White House, in many ways in disgrace after particularly the January 6th attack on the Capitol, Susie Wiles, unlike other people who try to distance themselves from him, she stuck by him and really rose to a very high position, and really the highest position beneath Donald Trump over the last several years, as his campaign manager. Now, you brought this up, but I think it's so important to know, and it was such a great line from Steve Contorno's story, which is that she doesn't want the clown car coming to the White House. And that's really, I think, sums up how Susie Wiles has operated in the past. She knows Donald Trump very well. She understands how he operates. She knows that many people try to get to him with sometimes planting crazy ideas in his head. And what she has always done is what she calls controlled chaos. She wants to control the chaos, and she understands that really one of the best ways to keep discipline around Donald Trump is to try and cut off access to some very controversial figures. She recognizes that she can't always do that. Donald Trump will always take calls, will always be meeting with people. They're going to be trying to get in front of him, as we've seen over the last 48 hours or so, with people jockeying behind the scenes for top roles in his second administration. But, what she is going to try to do is cut off the access that she can. And I'd remind you as well that over the past four years now, she controlled the flight manifest for his private plane, which I know that's a little bit in the weeds, but that is a very crucial job. She really controlled who had access to flying with him, who would get to be with him on a day in and day out basis. I'm told, as are our colleagues, that she very much wants to keep that control when she takes the role as Chief of Staff come January.",

Now, the big question is going to be, can she achieve that? My former boss, John Kelly, wanted to do the same thing. He was a Four Star Marine General who knows how to enforce order, and even he wasn't able to do that with Donald Trump. But, look, it depends on the relationship with the person, and she might have a different relationship now with Trump than John Kelly did, and I hope that she is successful at bringing more order to the chaos, because that was one of the most difficult things in the first term, was discipline.Donald Trump knows he is not disciplined. His staff knows he is not disciplined. But, if there is someone around him who can bring a little bit more order and stability to the White House, that will bode well for policy-making and predictability, and that's the type of thing that the business community and foreign allies really want to see.",

Have there been names that have been floated that have the opposite reaction, that make you concerned? TAYLORThere is actually a whole new cohort of people that are considering joining this administration, especially from the tech sector, and especially from the business community. With the involvement of people like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, there is a whole new crop of characters that are interested in coming into government. Why does that matter? Because Trump really cares about people with household names coming to work for him. So, some of these lesser known, more partisan political operatives that were emerging at the end of the Trump administration, they might not be so lucky in getting those top posts, because Trump now feels like he has got a lot deeper bench to choose from. And again, that, to me, is a silver lining, and shows there might yet be some very interesting and again, seasoned leaders coming into the Trump administration that you would not expect.",

Do you wonder if, sort of, as you outline in your piece really starkly, I think, sort of what working for Trump in the first administration was like, you talk about canceling international summits to run back to Washington to try to talk him out of making potentially unlawful decisions. You talk about perhaps being ostracized by the public, by your family, by friends, and even having a hard time finding work after you've worked in that administration. Do you worry that things like that might scare off otherwise people who could be a good fit or who could be good for the country?",

It means people should go into an administration, and not just a second Trump administration, any administration with their resignation letters ready, because you never know what you are going to encounter. Now, of course, that first go around was very unstable. Policies were constantly changing at the speed of the President's tweets. And I think with any hope we might see a new leadership team in the White House that brings a little bit more of stability there.But, if that doesn't work, if Susie Wiles isn't able to run a tighter ship, then those appointees need to be ready for the cascade effect of the chaos and be ready to say no to things that are unlawful, or be ready to resign if it doesn't align with their principles. But, I think the point here is that if he can get good people, good conservatives that want to advance the conservative agenda into government, that aren't partisan types, we may not see as tumultuous of an administration as the first go around, but that remains to be seen.",

This is a continent, Rahel, with very large Muslim communities, very large Jewish populations, and more broadly, even beyond those communities, very strong feelings about what's been happening in the Middle East. And we heard that today when we heard from the mayor of Amsterdam speaking to it, saying, look, there can be protests about what's happening in Gaza and the broader region. There can be expressions of solidarity for the Palestinian people. What happened here in Amsterdam was criminal.

Look, I think the big difference this time around, we know the President-elect likes to see rates lower rather than higher. The Federal Reserve is trying to lower interest rates this time around, and one of the only things really that could derail that, short of a big surprise, is perhaps the President-elect's policies of mass immigration limits, seeing blanket tariffs being applied around the world, that could then force prices up and perhaps force the Federal Reserve to slow down.So, at least for now, we know he is going to stay in the chair. He is firmly wedged to it as far as he was saying there.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PAU MOSQUERA, CNN SPAIN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): As has been done over the last days, Lt. Colonel Juan Jose Gonzalez and Lt. Ruben Bavketh (ph) are getting ready at Valencia's airport for another flight over the areas most affected by recent rainstorms and flooding. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): We have six helicopters deployed in the area affected by the floods. Most of them are dedicated to locating the missing, while another one is dedicated to carrying out daily flights to the Civil Guard laboratories in Madrid to deliver biological samples. That DNA is analyzed and compared with the relatives of those who are missing. MOSQUERA (voice-over): The main goal today is to assist the search and rescue teams deployed on the ground, and we are joining them. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): We are now heading to the west, to the area of Chiva and Cheste. There we will find the Barranco del Poyo, and then we will continue east, following the natural course of the water.",

Even though it has been more than a week since all this area got flooded, we can still see piles of cars, debris all around, and collapsed bridges. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): Approximately 20 people were rescued with this helicopter, a number that gets bigger if we keep in mind the work done by other five helicopters that have participated in search and rescue operations. So, the volume of people rescued is significant. MOSQUERA (voice-over): Nevertheless, it's been days since the last person they rescued alive. Nowadays, they are focusing on the mouth of the Turia River and Valencia's lagoon to check if any of those missing were swept out to sea. UNIDENTIFIED MALE (Interpreted): If the mud has buried them, we cannot see them anymore. So, what we do is wait for ground teams to notify us any finding, then we take them out with the crane. MOSQUERA (voice-over): The search is intense, but there is nothing new in the area. So, after an hour hovering around, we get back to the airport base. This will be it for now.

Trump's decisive victory includes winning the popular vote over Kamala Harris by a margin of more than four million. He currently has 301 electoral votes, sweeping the swing states, with just Arizona yet to be called. Beginning January 20th, Trump will be able to count on a mostly friendly Congress, thanks to the red wave. Republicans recaptured the Senate. Now, control of the House is still up for grabs, but Republicans at the moment do have a clear edge. So, how did Donald Trump pull off an incredible political comeback?To help answer that, we are joined by Michael Smerconish, the host of CNN's Smerconish on Saturday mornings. Michael, great to have you. I always enjoy your perspective. It's been a few days now. What are your thoughts about the results, including the possibility of a full red sweep? MICHAEL SMERCONISH, CNN HOST, \"SMERCONISH\", &amp; CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Rahel, it's always great to be with you. I really appreciate the invitation. The biggest surprise to me, among many surprises on Tuesday, is that he broke 50 percent, because Donald Trump has never broken 50 percent in a prior national election, meaning he won in 2016 but he was in the 46.1 range. Then against Joe Biden, still in the 46 point range. And many of us were fond of saying that he was a guy with a high floor but a low ceiling, meaning that he had a very hardened level of support, but that they were finite, they were limited, and that he is not going to ever exceed the numbers that he generated previously. And he did exceed them. So, that assessment was wrong, and he did it without a robust third- party effort, pulling votes away from his opponent, which makes it all the more impressive and unexpected. And to your point, now, if he enters with control of the Senate, which he is assured of, and potentially the House of Representatives, it sounds like a mandate for Donald Trump, which is just not something you would have believed a year ago, twice impeached, four times indicted, somebody who was convicted, owes a lot of money in civil judgments, and yet he confounded all the experts.",

And it's as if he -- and I heard this from radio callers in the last couple of days that he engendered some support who don't -- from people who don't necessarily like him, but that they thought that he -- they were being brow beaten, and that they resented it. And a great example of this is that the Madison Square Garden election -- pre- election rally that took place the Sunday before the last full week of the campaign, where an appalling joke was told by a comedian. It was appalling, but it was a joke. And for three days, it dominated the news cycle.And I could give you four or five other instances like hat, where people have said to me, like, yeah, we got the message.

One thing that I just thought was really fascinating was the sort of differing media strategies, right? You saw Trump. He didn't do the 60 Minutes interview, which is a tradition for presidential candidates. He didn't do that, but he did do Joe Rogan. He said that his young son, Barron, his 18-year-old son Barron, was part of the reason why he decided to do that.

That's sort of legacy media. How do you pass that? Meanwhile, he is spending three hours with Joe Rogan and the Vice President turned down that opportunity because apparently he was insistent you have to come to his studio, his studios in Austin, and he wants that interview to be three hours in duration. But, in retrospect, that would have been a better place for her to appear than sitting down with 60 Minutes.And Trump did a lot of that narrow casting, and I'm so glad that you brought up the Barron Trump reference, because I read that as well that he was relying on his son to find out who is hip and cool and where should I spend my time to reach an audience of voters who otherwise might not be coming out to vote. Remember, Rahel, 80 million people who were eligible did not vote in the 2020 cycle. And so, Trump's effort was to try and reach people who were not high frequency voters, and to come back to where I began, which is to say that the biggest surprise to me is he broke 50 percent. Perhaps he broke 50 percent by reaching individuals who don't typically vote and added them to the ranks, and that's why he wasn't capped where he normally had been, somewhere between 46 percent and 48 percent.",
