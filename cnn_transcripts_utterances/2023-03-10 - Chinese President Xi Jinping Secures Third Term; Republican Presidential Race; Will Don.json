CNN has learned that Manhattan prosecutors have invited Trump to testify next week before a grand jury. It's a move that typically indicates an investigation is nearing its end and that an indictment could be imminent. The former president is currently at the center of multiple criminal investigations. But this grand jury is looking into the hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. Remember, while president, Mr. Trump was asked about the payment, and he denied making it, and directed questions to his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Less than a year later, Cohen testified to Congress. Watch. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

It has been going on for approximately five years.And the fact that they have extended this invitation to the former president does suggest that in indictment is possible, if not likely. And it's been interesting. Over the past few weeks, Kristin, we have seen this sudden uptick in activity in this investigation. We have seen a series of high-profile witnesses, close allies of the former president, like Kellyanne Conway, who picks going in to testify. Now, if there is an indictment here, prosecutors could face some challenges. You have the fact that this is conduct that is approximately seven years old. This is a pretty novel legal theory that they would be pursuing as well. And at the heart of this, there is a potential crime, but it is ultimately a paperwork crime. And Michael Cohen, who you just heard there, he would be a key witness. And some defense attorneys may seize on the fact that he is a convicted liar, and he has made many repeated public comments about his ill feelings towards his former boss. So, prosecutors, if they choose to bring this, it would be an unprecedented indictment of a former president.

And the only mention of the former president, as he spoke this morning, he said his administration has had no drama. He describes himself as a doer, not a talker, but does not mention, of course, Donald Trump by name. But he does promote what he's done in Florida, his proposals, and also what he calls fighting against the woke crowd. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) GOV.

So that will be one of the differences that they hash out once this campaign is fully joined. But, Kristin, I can tell you, talking to Republican voters here, you're in a couple different camps. You're either fully supportive of Donald Trump and want him to win back the White House, or you're looking for an alternative. And the Florida governor is high on the top of the list of many Republicans, but they also want to see how he actually does on the ground actually campaigning. And there are other candidates, as you said, the former South Carolina governor, Nikki Haley, she's been here for several days. Other candidates also expected to get in. So this is the very beginning of the process here, but certainly a significant development that the Florida governor is finally -- he says he's selling a book.

I mean, right now, we know that those who are still in line with Trump, Trump's aides, are trying to twist arms and make sure that they're going to be getting the same endorsements that they got last time around, that people are sticking with him. We have already seen a number of House Republicans take sides, whether it's saying that they would endorse a potential DeSantis run or saying that they're still standing behind Donald Trump.

What do you think about that, him using it for his advantage? BARRON-LOPEZ:  I think he certainly would use it to his advantage. Trump has already said that, if he were indicted, he would continue to run, that he would not pull out of the race. And when I was talking to a lot of his base at CPAC, they said over and over again, even when presented with the facts about the FOX that -- about -- with the facts about FOX News and how FOX hosts admitted that they did not believe the 2020 election was stolen, that base for Trump did not believe FOX, even when they admitted privately and all this evidence was out there that they were not telling the truth about the 2020 election.

And I have got to say, the rain at that time, felt like you needed three or four faster speeds on your windchill wipers just to keep up. And we have just heard in the last hour or so the road that we took in from the main highway to the coast, that's now closed because of slides. Now, Felton has been hit before recently, in January, left behind a lot of this. As you mentioned, California cannot catch a break, this the 10th atmospheric river to hit the state this winter. They call it the Pineapple Express. Sounds fun. It is not. It's when low pressure from the north meet some moisture- laden air by Hawaii, and basically aims a fire hose at this state. Throw in a couple of other winter storms, you have got two years worth of snow some places. And the fear right now is the weather that we're getting at the moment is a little bit warmer. So, along with all the rain, we could see a lot of that snow melting. We are keeping an eye on a lot of places. There's a little town just further downriver near Santa Cruz Circle, where the main street has been washed out. We're going to go and check that out in a little bit. The entire city of Fresno is under a flash flood watch. Right now, the river is lowering, but, but California is going to get hit again by another atmospheric river early in the week. We were just talking to a fire department guy here. They are waiting to see, trying to forecast where might get hit next. The only silver lining to this cloud is all of these storms are putting a dent in the years-long drought that we have been suffering out in California, but for the people of Felton and elsewhere who have been getting hit time and time and time again this winter, this is just a another, another storm to face. And they are wondering, when will it stop?

So I think, in terms of the people of China, Xi will be judged based on his ability to restore economic growth. But the danger always with a with a dictator in power is that he will try to distract people's attentions from problems at home by focusing on enemies abroad. And, in his case, that could mean lashing out more at the United States, as he did last week, or actually mounting a military campaign against Taiwan. So, it's a dangerous, volatile situation.
