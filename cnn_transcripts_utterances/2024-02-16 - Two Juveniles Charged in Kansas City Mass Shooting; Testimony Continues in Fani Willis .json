Sources tell CNN that Willis' team thinks she did enough to quash that disqualification bid during this combative testimony we witnessed live yesterday. CNN anchor and chief legal analyst Laura Coates is live for us outside the courthouse in Atlanta. Laura, we were watching those fireworks alongside you. Clearly, the prosecution felt that Fani Willis did enough in that testimony to not ask her back on the stand today for cross-examination.",

      "sentences": "I mean, fireworks indeed, Boris, if you think about what happened yesterday, explosive testimony by someone we did not expect to hear from.That's the DA, Fani Willis, who, as you know, is being asked to be disqualified. And if she's disqualified, it's not just her. It's her entire team. It would have to be a new prosecutorial team that would be appointed or assigned, which would kick this can way down the road, if it ever even reaches there. And, remember, it's so important to them to actually prove -- she has a burden of proof in the criminal trial, but she's not a criminal defendant here. She does not have the burden of proof of showing that she had a conflict of interest that rose to such a level as to undermine the chances of every defendant having a fair trial. The burden is on those who brought the motion to disqualify. And they have to show some sort of financial benefit was gained by her relationship with Nathan Wade. And what they have been trying to do is show a through line, that somehow the money that was received by Fulton County or state of Georgia is a through line all the way to the vacations they took, the nature of their dating and romantic relationship. If they fail to prove that connection, it's a problem. But lingering here in the ether is whether they have lied about the start date of their romantic affair. Did they say at a date that was before or after the hiring and which is to be believed? So far, only one witness has ever testified, and that witness has some credibility issues. It's potentially a disgruntled employee. There was no follow-up to figure out what she was saying. It was a little bit vague. So what would happen there, they have got to prove those two things, and she's not on the stand to talk about it.",

It's important to get out of the drama and the nonsense about did she like wine or Grey Goose or anything else and focus on the central legal question, which is, number one, did somebody make a false statement in an affidavit to the court, and, number two, was there a manner in which the prosecutor was enriched off of state funds? And when you strip it all away, there actually isn't a ton of evidence that they provided that actually directly links the two. Now, was it improper or icky or yucky or just something that reflects poorly on either Ms. Willis, Mr. Wade or the office? Well, certainly. And that's for people and voters and the public to decide. But in terms of a disqualifiable conduct that the defense has established, I don't think it's totally clear yet.",

And many of them potentially that are going to be involved, could have witnessed what we saw yesterday as well. TIA MITCHELL, \"THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION\":  Yes, so I think the court of public opinion is very mixed, depending on, again, perhaps where you already were leading on the case. So people who were inclined to support Fani Willis, to support this investigation and the charges that resulted against former President Trump, there were a lot of people saying her testimony was yes, blunt, straightforward, maybe a little combative, but they felt that she did well yesterday defending herself, defending her actions and redirecting focus back on the people who are actually, as you point out, Boris, going to face trial potentially. But then you did see some reaction that was more mixed, people who felt that she didn't do herself favors by coming in so hot, coming in so adversarial. You saw some posts, perhaps, like on social media saying she seemed combative and unprofessional. So, again, I think it was mixed. But I think one of the big takeaways from a lot of people was that Willis was right. She is not the one on trial.",

There is at least the appearance of impropriety. And that alone -- you're going to have to put this in front of a jury. And the jury in Fulton County, Georgia, has been watching this play out every day. Even accepting that people have different views about extramarital relationships or paying in cash, it simply doesn't matter. We are in the real world, not fantasy lawyer land. And at a certain point, you have got to be willing to put this in front of the public.",

There's a legal path and, as you were talking about, there's public opinion.She had opened herself up to criticism, she and Nathan Wade had, with their relationship here.

      "sentences": "So, I don't know -- again, I think that depends on where you already were approaching the case.Of course, there were people already who felt that the case was partisan, it was politically motivated. For example, when Fani Willis wanted to charge one of an elected official as an elected co- conspirator, he got his charges kind of put on hold because Fani Willis had raised funds for his political opponent ahead of the 2022 election. So, there are people who already had felt that there were missteps from the district attorney. And they said that's indication that perhaps she didn't have the purest motivations. This feeds into that. This has been very high-profile. It has been damaging not only to public perception of the case, but to public perception of the district attorney as an elected official, who I should note is up for reelection. That being said, I don't think it's disqualifying. I don't think, in and of itself, without more evidence, to Elliot's point, that it would doom her politically or doom the case. But again, it hasn't been helpful. I think even people who want to support her and who think the case is solid, they want the case to move forward, even they are saying the revelation of this relationship was not great. It was not a good thing. It was not a good decision.",

We don't know their names. We don't know their ages. Law enforcement is saying, though, that the expectation here is that more charges are eventually going to be filed. Right now, those two juveniles are in a juvenile detention center. The question which would elicit much more information is whether or not these juveniles will eventually be charged as adults. If that were the case, this would work its way through the court system in a completely different way where we would have much more access to the details of this investigation. We'd have much more access to information about these two juveniles who've been detained. But, right now, again, as I said, we don't know their names. We don't know their ages. The Jackson County prosecutor has released a statement saying that his office works very closely with juvenile officers, but doesn't technically oversee them. But, again, they do expect to be in these hearings with the juvenile officers. They work with them very closely. So there are many more questions to answer here, Brianna. But, again, what we know now is that they are apparently getting closer to justice, these two juveniles charged with gun-related and resisting arrest charges, Brianna.",
