That's where investigators failed to serve an arrest warrant on him yesterday, after they were blocked by a security detail. The warrant is valid until Monday and it can be extended. Yoon faces charges of abuse of power and orchestrating a rebellion following the martial law he briefly imposed last month. But his supporters say it's Yoon who is playing by the rules.

How comes things haven't changed? DELL'ARCIPRETE:  Well, we know that most of the people who are trying to make it to Europe are fleeing conflict, violence, extreme poverty -- and those factors that push people out of their countries have not changed over the last few years. They've probably even worsened in some parts of the world. So I think this is the main reason why we are still seeing many people arriving. And we are -- this is also the reason why the Mediterranean, as you pointed out earlier, remains such a dangerous route for migrants with children among the most vulnerable.",

The organization posted on socials.So many people have needlessly died and disappeared and what a horrible way to start the year. What are the Italian authorities actually doing to help these people and their families? DELL'ARCIPRETE:  So it's very important to, first of all, start from the fact that what we see is a very high number of children or young people or women but also of families that have witnessed things that nobody should ever witness. There is a lot of trauma. There is a lot of issues that can also have an impact on mental health. It's very important to support those who arrive with adequate reception conditions and also improving the access to services like psychosocial support. What Italy is doing is that we, Italy, in fact, has one of the most advanced system for the reception of unaccompanied and separated children by the law. But those provisions are not always implemented fully. And what we know is that, in many cases, children remain in reception centers that are not up to standards. They remain there for too long. They don't have enough access to education, particularly to learn Italian or to enter on or get back to school. And that can create additional problems as you can imagine.",

And this is at a time when so many nations seem to be turning to the Right.I just wonder what sort of impact is that actually having on people trying to seek asylum, especially in Europe? Just this week, we saw president-elect Donald Trump double down on an incorrect claim that an attacker in the U.S. was a non-American migrant. But the man was firmly American and the president-elect doubled down. Are these scary times? What's going on? DELL'ARCIPRETE:  Well, I think we know what is to be done for children and those who are vulnerable. We know there is a need. We know there is an urgency. We also have opportunities to improve how we treat those people, how we make sure they have access to the services they require. And the main opportunities in the European side is the implementation of the new European pact on migration and asylum. This year, in 2025, all member states will have to come up with plans on how to implement this new E.U. migration pact. I think that is a great opportunity to review what is going on and to advance in a way that makes the rights of children better protected.",

In a statement he put out following the decision, he said it's his responsibility to defend U.S. national security, including by ensuring that American companies continue to play a central role in sectors that are critical for our national security. Nippon Steel, the company that planned to buy U.S. Steel, as well as the company itself, have both said that they would fight this decision in court. The Pennsylvania governor, the state where U.S. Steel is headquartered, said in a statement that this situation is far from over. But it comes as this deal has been marred by political headwinds. Both Biden and president-elect Trump vowed that they would not allow this deal to go forward in a bid to protect American manufacturing jobs. Several senior administration officials familiar with the review tell CNN that the merits of the deal did not necessarily point in the direction of it posing a national security risk and that the majority of members of the committee on foreign investment in the United States that had been reviewing the deal actually believed that it should go through. It is one of Biden's final acts in office, certainly a shot across the bow to other companies considering receiving a foreign investment. And it all comes before he hands over the keys to his successor -- Kayla Tausche, CNN, the White House. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
