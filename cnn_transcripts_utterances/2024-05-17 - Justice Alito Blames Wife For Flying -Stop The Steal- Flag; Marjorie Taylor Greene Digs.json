      "sentences": "OUTFRONT nextJustice Samuel Alito throwing his wife under the bus as calls grow for him to recuse himself from any cases related to Trump. Those crucial opinions are expected any day. And the nation's top constitutional expert, Laurence Tribe, is OUTFRONT. Plus, MTG versus AOC. Marjorie Taylor Greene now doubling down after a late night House brawl that played out on camera. A top Democrat in that hearing room is my guest. And CNN's exclusive video of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs physically assaulting his former girlfriend. A reporter who has long covered the mogul is OUTFRONT. Is this just the tip of the iceberg? Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, my wife did it that is the excused from Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito, as voices are growing louder for him to recuse himself from two crucial cases tied to Trump, cases that the nine justices are deciding right now, we could find out and some of these any day. They're related to Trump's efforts to overturn the election. And that is why this image is at issue. The image obtained by the New York Times was taken just days after the January 6 insurrection. And as you see, that's the American flag intentionally flown up upside down. It is flying outside the home of Justice Samuel Alito. Now that, choosing to do that is a known symbol of solidarity among Trump's supporters who believed that the election was stolen. Now, tonight, Alito is insisting that he had nothing to do with it, telling \"The New York Times\", quote, it was briefly placed by Mrs. Alito in response to a neighbor's use of objectionable and personally insulting language on yard signs. Mrs. Alito -- blaming his wife. While the blame Mrs. Alito excuse is not flying with the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dick Durbin, saying in a statement, he says a leadership recuse himself from any cases related to the 2020 election. Obviously, that means the immunity case and the Jack Smith case. Durbin writes in a statement, flying an upside-down American flag, a symbol of the so-called Stop the Steal movement, clearly creates the appearance of bias. Now, just to state the very obvious here for me, for everybody watching, the Supreme Court justice should know better than to have such a blatant political display in his front yard. It's common sense. But if there were any question about it, the court does have an internal rule book that he could have consulted. It reads: Employees may not engage in partisan political activity, for example, publicly support or oppose a partisan political organization or candidate. This includes displaying signs or bumper stickers, or stating positions on social media. Pretty obvious stuff, but important to note in the context of the fact that public trust and the Supreme Court is near record low according to a Gallup poll. And the Supreme Court, as I speak, as I said, they are as we speak making crucial decisions. They are considering outcomes that could determine the next election. Remember, one of the two cases they are deciding is the immunity case. That's Trump's defense that he has absolute immunity from criminal charges in relation to anything he did while in office. So, if the Supreme Court grants Trump that immunity, Jack Smiths case is done and over, it is gone. They've never seen the light of day. And the other issue before the Supreme Court involves the Justice Department's ability to charge participants in the January 6 riot. It could affect hundreds of convictions. Now, of course, it's not just Alito on the court who is letting his wife take the heat. Justice Clarence Thomas has been silent about his wife's attendance at Trump's January 6 rally, and her efforts to try to overturn the election, including text messages that she sent to Mark Meadows, Trump's chief of staff. One said: Help this great president stand firm, Mark, you are the leader, with him who is standing for Americas constitutional governments at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the left is attempting the greatest heist of our history. Again, that's Clarence Thomas's wife, Ginni. The bottom line is two of the nine justices on the American Supreme Court have spouses who have made very clear unambiguous political statements and actions and words. And those justices are sitting on the bench, and as we speak weighing in on cases that will determine the presidential election and Trump's fate. Jessica Schneider is OUTFRONT live outside the Supreme Court. And, Jessica, this is really an incredible moment, and this is a court that finds itself embroiled deeper and deeper in controversy.",

But that's a different from what's going on with Justice Alito.He's not saying my wife has her own separate career, and he's throwing her under the bus and blaming her for what is on his house, his flagpole, it's his flag malfunction. It's his upside flag, and everyone knows that the upside-down flag, which the United States code says should be flown that way only in cases of absolute emergency as a kind of SOS, was in this case a symbol of the claim that the election was stolen from Donald Trump. It was the banner of the insurrectionists. And I'm reminded of something that the late Justice Scalia said in a opinion he wrote in 1987. He said, you cannot expect to ride with the cops if you cheer for the robbers. [19:10:05] In this case, Justice Alito expects to preside over a decision about whether there wasn't as direction and who was responsible for it? And whether Donald Trump, who has been charged with involvement in trying to obstruct the operations of government and the transfer of power is immune, number of cases before the court.

If justice is dissenting, you wait until the dissent is done before announcing the case. So, by delaying this immunity decision, so long that a trial can't occur before the election, the effect may be to give de facto immunity to the former president, who if he wins the election, will pick an attorney general who will dismiss the case.

The loss of those five members meant that the Democrats would have been in a majority in -- on our committee, and in the markup session, and therefore, they couldn't abide that, so they moved it to 8:00 p.m. When they got back from New York working in a number of them, a number of Republican members missed votes in order to go to Donald Trump's trial. When they got back, they tried to truncate the proceeding to cut off debate about whether or not the attorney general should be held in contempt. They tried to reduce the amount of amendments we could have in the amount of time we could have to introduce amendments when we successfully thwarted that.

It's shocking footage and it comes after federal authorities searched two of Combs' homes as part of an ongoing sex trafficking investigation. An investigation stemming from allegations and five different lawsuits, allegations, that he has vehemently denied.Elizabeth Wagmeister is OUTFRONT with the story, and I do warn you, you're going to see this video here and it is difficult to watch. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) ELIZABETH WAGMEISTER, CNN ENTERTAINMENT CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): New surveillance footage obtained exclusively by CNN appears to corroborate some of the allegations of abuse against music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs. The video captured on multiple cameras shows Combs wearing only a towel assaulting his then-girlfriend, Cassie Ventura, in a hallway at a Los Angeles hotel in March 2016. A lawsuit filed by Ventura in November last year and settled the next day referenced actions that seem to match those seen in this video. There is no audio. According to the complaint, Combs became extremely intoxicated and punched Ms. Ventura in the face, giving her a black eye, which according to the lawsuit prompted Ventura to try and leave the hotel room. The surveillance video obtained by CNN begins as she enters the hallway. The complaint says, as she exited Mr. Combs awoke in, began screaming at Ms. Ventura. He followed her into the hallway of the hotel while yelling at her. The complaint goes on to say he grabbed her and then took glass vases in the hallway and threw them at her. In the surveillance video, Combs can be seen grabbing Ventura and throwing her to the ground. As Ventura lies on the ground, Combs then kicks her twice and attempts to drag her on the floor back to the hotel room. Ventura is seen picking up a hotel phone. Comb seems to walk back to the hotel room, then returns and appears to shove her in a corner. Moments later, he can be seen throwing an object in her direction. According to Ventura's now settled lawsuit, the pair began dating several years after they met in 2005. They parted ways in 2019. Comb's attorney said the decision to settle was in no way an admission of wrongdoing. Ventura declined to comment on the video, but her attorney told CNN the gut-wrenching video has only further confirmed the disturbing and predatory behavior of Mr. Combs. Words cannot express the courage and fortitude that Ms. Ventura has shown in coming forward to bring this to light. The video hasn't been seen publicly before and comes on the heels of a series of civil lawsuits alleging Combs involvement in sex trafficking and sexual abuse, allegations Combs has repeatedly denied. Authorities searched Combs' homes in Los Angeles and Miami in April, as part of an ongoing federal investigation carried out by a team that specializes in human trafficking crimes. In a December 2023 statement, Combs responded to the claims and some of the lawsuit saying: Sickening allegations have been made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday. Let me be absolutely clear, I did not do any of the awful things being alleged. (END VIDEOTAPE) WAGMEISTER (on camera): Now, we have not heard back from Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' attorneys other than that statement that we saw from him on his Instagram, which wasn't even specifically about Cassie, that was about all the lawsuits, but who we are hearing from tonight, Erin, is a Cassie's husband. She is married and shares two young daughters and he posted what he said was a letter to women and children. This is part of it. He says, quote: Men who hit women aren't men. Men who hurt women hate women. To all the survivors, your stories are real and people believe you. I want to raise my daughters in a world where they are safe and loved.

And there was a sense that the Rafah attack was some weeks or even months off.What's happened over the last few weeks is that the humanitarian situation has got much, much worse, 600,000 people on the move. And your description of the situation as apocalyptic is I'm afraid appropriate because these are people with nothing, fleeing with nothing, reaching places where there is nothing. And it's an appalling set of choices that are faced by them all at the moment. BURNETT: Secretary Miliband, we've got some new video that we just got here at CNN of Rafah. This is just lines of people -- theoretically, these people are waiting for food. You see the rags are just waiting to try to fill up those containers with any kind of food that they. And the World Food Program has said just today that anymore escalation in Rafah could, quote, bring humanitarian operations to a standstill, to a standstill. And then we heard, oh, that that floating dock that the U.S. had built did actually get some aid coming in today. What is the situation right now? Is -- is any coming in?

We have a few aid workers on the ground.We can't get our doctors and our surgeons into the hospitals that wed been working out. We can't get aid workers, then we can't get the food aid or the medical aid in.
