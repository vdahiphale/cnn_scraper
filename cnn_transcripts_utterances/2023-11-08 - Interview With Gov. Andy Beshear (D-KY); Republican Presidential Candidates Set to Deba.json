      "sentences": "Well, John, so far, this appearance has been quite a contrast to her father's appearance on the witness stand earlier this week, which was quite combative and chaotic.Now, the questions have focused on her time at the Trump Organization. She left the family business in 2017, when she went to the White House, but the government has been asking her questions about specific projects that she worked on while she was there. They have been focused, for example, on the old post office building here in Washington, D.C., which was converted into a hotel. That was a project that she worked on. And she said that, yes, she did profit from its eventual sale in 2022. She did not disclose how much she made. We have previously reported it was around $4 million. But they have also been asking her about other projects, like the Doral resort and spa down in Florida. And they are especially interested in how financing was secured for these properties, her role in that, because it really gets to the heart of the case, specifically, loans that were received from Deutsche Bank. And these loans had quite favorable terms. They were granted, those kinds of loans, based on Trump's purported net worth. And that gets to the heart of this case, the allegation that he did not accurately represent the value of his assets to get more favorable terms on loans and from insurance companies. So, so far, the questioning, it has been very civilized. It has been very technical. That's pretty much what we expected from this witness. As you said, Ivanka is no longer a co-defendant in this case, but the attorney general's office has been seeking to secure her testimony, even though she's tried several different times to get out of making this appearance. Before today's proceedings gone under way, the attorney general addressed cameras to talk about why they wanted to hear from Ivanka. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But what she really did was, in negotiating with Deutsche Bank for the loan, $170 million loan, it was very clear that Deutsche Bank wanted personal financial statements from Donald Trump, not only to make the $170 million loan, but to keep it going all of those years. And the reason is obvious. Donald Trump filed for bankruptcy six different times. And what it does is, it undercuts his testimony last week that the banks really didn't care. They clearly cared. And if the A.G. is careful, they will delineate all of those conversations about how important those financial statements were to getting that $170 million loan.",

What people haven't focused on is not just his testimony last week, but it's also the testimony he gave in his deposition, where he took the Fifth Amendment over 400 times. Now, what does it mean to take the Fifth Amendment? It means that you are refusing to answer a question because a truthful answer would tend to be incriminating. Then, what did Donald Trump do last week? He went into court and said, oh, I didn't do anything fraudulent. I wasn't involved in a fraud, which is just the opposite of what, in effect, he was saying when he took the Fifth Amendment in his deposition. So, you have got contradictory testimony. You can use his assertion of the Fifth Amendment against him to basically find that he's lying, that he's manipulating the system when he goes in, refuses to answer questions, answers the questions in a half-baked manner. I just don't see how this judge at the end of the day is not going to find that, with respect to Donald Trump, liar, liar, pants on fire.",

We know that Arkansas Governor Sara Huckabee Sanders is going to be on the stage endorsing him, as well as several other endorsements, some of which previously supported Ron DeSantis. And a lot of this is just a series of trolling by Donald Trump and his team. They are angry with the RNC. They have called for the RNC to stop hosting these debates because Donald Trump has such a commanding lead. But one thing I do want to point out here is that Donald Trump does have a commanding lead in these primary polls. And if he is to become the nominee, he would have to work with the RNC, as any nominee would, to get real help during a general election because of that infrastructure, so interesting way that they're dealing with this now, when, down the road, they do believe they're going to be the nominee, and they do believe they will have to work with the RNC.",

We are now 68 days, I think, away from the Iowa caucuses.

She seems to sort of relish the fight when it's there for her to take. But I think that you will see her do both, John.
