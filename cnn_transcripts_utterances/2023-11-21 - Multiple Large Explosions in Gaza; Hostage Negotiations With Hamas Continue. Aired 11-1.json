The announcement of that deal could happen today, even in the coming hours. Earlier this morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he said publicly that progress is being made on an agreement, and a senior U.S. official has said that a deal is -- quote -- \"very close,\" but, of course, stressing that it is not done yet.",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, they are quite confident.This is the most optimistic we have heard U.S. officials. They are telling us that they believe they are closer to a deal than ever before, with all of the caveats, recognizing that the situation is extremely fluid and that the fighting does continue. Now, that fighting may end soon, at least temporarily, if this agreement does go into effect. The broad strokes of what we understand this agreement to be that was mediated by Qatar and the U.S., agreed to by Israel and Hamas, is that, over a four-or-five-day pause in the fighting, that some 50 civilian hostages, women and children, would be released by Hamas. In exchange, Israel would release three times that in terms of Palestinian prisoners, so 150 Palestinian women and children who are in Israeli prisons. Now, the number of hostages released by Hamas could grow beyond that 50 if all goes according to plan. We expect that this initial 50 would be released on a rolling basis, over the course of those four or five days. If that goes well, there could be more hostages who would then get released beyond that. Remember, we understand these hostages to be spread out all over the Gaza Strip and among different factions of Hamas and other groups. And then, Kate, there's also the question of aid. This is something that Hamas has been insisting on, that more aid be allowed to get into Gaza. Hundreds of trucks of aid per day is something that they are asking for. We understand that this is something that has been agreed to, but the implementation mechanism, how those trucks go in, is still something that is rather complicated, how they get inspected. One very important point, Omar and Kate, is that we understand that the list of 50 hostages that Hamas has agreed to release are all hostages who are alive. And, of course, that is very important, because, of the 240 hostages being held by Hamas and Gaza, we are not clear on how many are dead and how many are alive. So the gaps have narrowed. There is optimism there. But keep in mind, even if some 50 hostages are released, the vast majority, 80 percent, would still remain hostage, held hostage by Hamas -- guys.",

I mean, it seems -- cautious optimism seems to be kind of the word of the day, the mood of the day surrounding all of this. What do you see in this deal and the talk around it? What -- do you think -- what could, I don't know, still get in the way of this deal happening? JOSH ROGIN, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\":  Right. No, I mean, if it comes off, it will be the biggest diplomatic achievement since the war began after the Hamas terrorist attacks of October 7. But it's not a done deal yet. There's still an opportunity for spoilers. As Jeremy pointed out earlier, Israel is likely to escalate prior to any cease-fire, as is often the case in these types of things. And then once it starts, because the deal is staggered over four or five days just for the first phase, all of that time, there's a lot of things that can go wrong, especially the fact that Hamas, we know, doesn't control all the hostages. They don't control all the forces. They don't speak for all of the militant groups. Any one of those could throw a wrench into the works. And on the Israeli side, as Oren just pointed out, there are a lot of things that can get in the way of what they need to do. And so I think we just have to hold our breath and hope that, over the next few hours, nothing gets in the way, because, if this does succeed, a lot of innocent people could be saved.",

And so I think there's a lot of sympathy for these families, as they press all of these governments to do more, to acknowledge that there's a tension at some point between military operations and doing what's necessary to get their people out, and that getting the people out should take priority. And I think that pressure and that movement is a big part of why you see a lot of these high-level interactions. President Biden, the Qatari emir, lots and lots of very high-level government officials have spent a lot of time, are spending a lot of time on this, in part because these families and their supporters have been so passionate. And I think this will, in one sense, give them a moment of relief and hope, but also gird them for what will surely be a long, continuing struggle ahead.",

We could be talking about a significant number of innocent hostages released. At the very same time, this morning, take a look at this. There's multiple large explosions we're seeing in Northern Gaza. This was the scene of one of them just a few hours ago. Look at that plume.

So, I want to start with, let's look at just some of the details on this deal. There would be a four-to-five-day pause. And in that pause, it's not like everyone lays down their weapons and goes on a lunch break. What does a pause like this typically mean militarily? What can and can't they do? BRIG. GEN. JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Well, what it means for the IDF is, they're at exposed, increased risk. They're in the middle of Gaza. They're beginning operations that are heading down toward the southern portion of Gaza. They're inside the Gaza Strip, which means they are targets. And if there's a cease-fire, they will be very, very deliberate and very, very cautious in terms of their force protection measures, et cetera. They're going to take care of themselves. That is priority number one. The challenge that you have is this four-day pause means that Hamas will, in fact, reposition, reinforce their positions, do everything in their power to move hostages, make it that much more difficult for the Israelis to really take advantage of the intelligence that they have built up over the course of the time that they have been in Gaza conducting military operations.

They're at the edge. They're at the sharp edge. They're leaning forward, and now they're not supposed to engage. So something can happen. It would probably cause one of those elements to engage, return fire, and all of a sudden you have a violation, which could escalate. That's an accident.

And if this goes through, it would be the longest pause we have seen since October 7. At this point, it's only been in spurts of hours.

They gain as a result of that. This is a home fight. This is a home game for them. And as a result of what the IDF has been able to achieve, Hamas, with some type of a pause and then a series of pauses potentially, gives them a great advantage to take advantage of that time, resupply, reengage.
