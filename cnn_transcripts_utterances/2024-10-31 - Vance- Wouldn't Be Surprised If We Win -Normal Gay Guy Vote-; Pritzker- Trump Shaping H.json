Harris alongside JLo in Las Vegas, as Donald Trump is saying the quiet part out loud, in New Mexico. Also, J.D. Vance is making a closing argument of his own tonight, saying that there are some women who, in his words, \"Celebrate\" abortions, and why he thinks they'll win the, quote, \"Normal gay guy vote.\" And about last night, Donald Trump's Transition Co-chair was here, embracing COVID conspiracies that are spread by RFK Jr., and also on vaccines. My source tonight is one of the world's foremost experts on vaccines, and I have a feeling he doesn't agree. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. With just days left, in this race. Tonight, both campaigns are descending on the same state at about the same time, battleground Nevada, which has a large Latino population, and could play a role in deciding what happens next Tuesday night. Harris just wrapped her rally in Reno. She's now heading over to Vegas, where she's going to be rallying with JLo on stage. And Donald Trump just finished his event in Henderson, Nevada a few moments ago as well. Every stop matters right now, at this close to the end of the race. And that's what raised questions about why Donald Trump was spending a few hours, in New Mexico, earlier today. It's a state he's lost twice before, and right now is seen as safe Democratic terrain. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT AND 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I'm only here for one reason. They all said, Don't come. I said, Why? You can't win New Mexico.

At one point, as you heard there, he was building up to poll the crowd, on whether or not they preferred being called Latino or Hispanic. All of that that you saw happening in New Mexico is what led Vice President Harris to offer this response.

But on top of that, he has gone out of his way to insult the Latino population. He has gone out of his way to push policies that not only hurt the progress of the community, but also are designed to create further frictions between White Americans and Latino Americans. And we've seen that time and time again. He utilizes rhetoric on the campaign trail that is designed to create a race war. And I think that for Latinos, who are living in New Mexico, for Latinos who are living in Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans who are living on the mainland, at the end of the day, they're seeing this, and they're questioning not only who Donald Trump is, but also who the Republican Party is.",

That's going to have real ramification in places like Pennsylvania. This is a very proud community that's been through hell, in their home island, with Hurricane Maria, and so many other challenges. And for him to allow one of the people, on his stage, to insult Puerto Rico and then just let it slide? That hits home. So, I think when you look at the Latino community, writ large, Democrats do need to come to grips with the fact that we've got to improve our outreach, our message. There's things we got to do better.

These ads are running across multiple states. It has absolutely nothing to do with the policies that matter to the American people.

Even though I should note, it's not hidden. You can see it for yourself. Someone who knows that well is my source. The Director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Dr. Paul Offit. Also, a member of the FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee, and a founding advisory board member of the Autism Science Foundation. So Doctor, I am very grateful that a doctor is joining us on this. I just -- just tell me your reaction to listening to that. I'm sure you heard that a lot before. What did you make of it? DR. PAUL OFFIT, DIRECTOR, VACCINE EDUCATION CENTER, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF PHILADELPHIA, MEMBER, FDA VACCINE ADVISORY COMMITTEE: Well, there were seven misstatements of fact in three and a half minutes. I'm not sure what the record is. But that had to be close. I mean, when they start things like there's 76 vaccines, there's -- vaccines prevent 17 different diseases. When he actually, when he said that when RFK Jr. was born, which was 1954, there were only three vaccines. Technically, there were actually four. And it's just the notion that we are still talking about whether or not the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine causes autism, which was something that was raised in the late 1990s? There have been 18 studies done, in seven countries, on three continents, involving thousands of children, costing tens of millions of dollars, and they all found the same thing. You're at no greater risk of autism if you got the vaccine that or if you didn't. It's amazing that we still talk about this.",
