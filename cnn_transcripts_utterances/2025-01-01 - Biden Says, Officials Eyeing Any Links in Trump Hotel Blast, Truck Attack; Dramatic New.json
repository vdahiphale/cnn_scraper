President Biden saying that officials are now investigating whether there is a link between the deadly terror attack in New Orleans and the Tesla Cybertruck explosion that happened outside of Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas.This is some new video of that explosion, you see it there outside the Trump Hotel, the driver of that vehicle was killed, seven others were injured, and we now know that Cybertruck was rented in Colorado, the blast in Vegas happening just hours after a man plowed a truck into a crowd of people on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing at least 15 people injuring 35. What you were looking at is new video here now from that from just moments before the deadly attack. And I want to warn you that this is graphic because you can see the white pickup truck driving northwest on Canal Street at 3:16 A.M., and there you see it there veer it drives around a law enforcement vehicle before turning there onto Bourbon Street. It rapidly accelerated into that crowd of people who are celebrating you the New Year. And people say after plowing through that crowd, he crashed the vehicle, then got into a shootout with police. In this new video, you can see chaos. You can actually hear gunfire in a video that we have now. Officials saying that they found some writing from the suspect that supports the FBI's view that the massacre was inspired by ISIS. Omar Jimenez is live for us tonight in New Orleans. Kyung Lah is going to be joining us eventually. We also have Veronica Miracle covering the Las Vegas explosion. First to you, Omar. What is the latest from officials at this hour?",

But there is a lot that we know from the FBI so far at this point. For starters, they found an ISIS flag in this vehicle along with weapons and a potential IED, along with a number of potential IEDs in and around that vehicle in the French Quarter, which is just behind me here in New Orleans. So, we know that on that front.We also heard from President Biden who said that this suspect, Samshuddin Jabbar, was a former member of the military, but also that he posted videos on social media indicating he was inspired. This is a U.S. citizen from Texas, and it's why authorities in the Houston area right now are making preparations to search a home they believe is connected to the suspect. But there are a lot of steps are going through trying to even clear the neighborhood likely for safety reasons. But while that investigative process goes on, there were also a lot of questions here on the ground about why barriers that were installed years ago to try and prevent this type of attack from happening were not used the early morning of this attack. And you showed some of that surveillance video a little bit earlier of a white truck coming up and sort of veering around law enforcement while police gave us insight into why that dynamic was even happening in the first place. For starters, those barriers were under repair ahead of the Super Bowl. It's expected to be here next month. So, as a result, as a replacement, they put law enforcement vehicles in some of those entryways, along with barriers and some other aspects that But of course, as we see on that video, and as we learned from law enforcement, that driver went around those law enforcement vehicles and then eventually plowed into those people, which, as we know, has killed at least 15 in just the early hours of 2025 just past 3:00 A.M. And I was talking to a shop owner who is right on Bourbon Street, and he told me that it was just as busy at 3:00 A.M., as it was at midnight in his turns, but, of course, we know people have died in this case, many others injured again, and just the opening moments of 2025.",

We know they both went to the same rental car agency, essentially this online service that facilitates private citizens leasing their own or renting their own cars to people. They both use that same service. And we know that they are both -- they both have military backgrounds. But, again, these are things that could easily have been coincidence.That's not to say that these two events are not related. They wouldn't be investigating that very question if they thought it was something that wasn't possible. And if it turns out, and, again, this is a big if, because we don't know that at this point, but if it turns out that these two individuals knew each other, then we have a very significant issue on our hands here. That points to a conspiracy, coordinated effort that spans a large area, right, two very different states. We know the Las Vegas attacker started in Colorado, drove to Las Vegas, and detonated that truck there, whereas the other, the New Orleans attacker started in Houston and ended up, of course, in New Orleans to commit his attack. So, connecting these two would be highly significant, but we are not quite on the verge of doing that at this point. We need a lot more detail to figure out if there are actually any interactions between these two people. Law enforcement has many resources, intelligence resources, law enforcement resources at their disposal that they can push against to see if there are any indicators, that I'm sure they're doing exactly that tonight.",

The investigators work around the clock to make sure they're getting everything that they can and I was often awoken at 3So, all of that is in process right now, and my colleagues have said exactly the right thing. It is critically important that the investigators run down this potential link, and also look at social media, look at any writings that they're going to find. And importantly, look at who his circle of friends are and acquaintances, people that he's been in contact with. And that information will come from the house. And then you can just very slowly and methodically go through each one of these individuals and question them. The other thing that's important in this case is it is such a high- profile case that anybody who had contact with this man will be reporting things to the authorities.

Was this a failure on the part of police? MCCABESo, you know, a trained operative is going to find a weakness in any security plan. That's what they do. This is what they live for. This is what they spend their time planning about thinking about conducting surveillance. We don't know if this guy did any of those things, but I suspect we'll find more out about that as the days go on. The point is, if the security demand is to keep vehicles out of that area, to do that, you have to physically blockade the entire entrance.

And then in 2022, he submitted an email talking about how essentially he was broke.

But I will say this does not really have the hallmark of an ISIS-directed attack. The ones that we've seen that have been directed, there's been significant planning for the attack. They've usually involved multiple individuals. Think, for example, of the January attack against the Qassem Soleimani ceremony in Iran, which does appear to have been an ISIS-directed attack, multiple individuals involved in a coordinated active shooter-like attack.This is a much more rudimentary one, so probably has more of the hallmarks of an inspired attack. And that would also be pretty consistent with most of the ISIS attacks or plots in the United States. They've -- generally, it's hard to get someone like that into the U.S. So, the vast majority of the ones we've seen in the Hudson River, for example, or in San Bernardino, or the Pulse nightclub in Florida, have generally been ISIS-inspired attacks.",

Do you believe this attack was preventable? GEN. RUSSEL HONORE (RET.), LED HURRICANE KATRINA TASK FORCE: Brianna, I believe this determined terrorist, like this -- who is willing to die, would find a target. He came with a purpose to kill people. He is of an ideology, not from a nation state, but ideology of ISIS, Islamic State of Syria and Iran. He was determined to, in the name of ISIS, to have retribution. Almost on a daily basis we are attacking ISIS targets in Syria and anywhere else we can find them, because they are on a mission, a jihadist mission, to call it death and destruction to the United States and our allies. So, he may not have taken orders from anybody in the Middle East, but he was a determined terrorist to cause death and destruction, and while they will find better ways and more redundant blocking of those streets, he could have gone a block away from all that blocking on the Bourbon Street and find hundreds of people on any street in New Orleans, on Canal or Poydras or Tchoupitoulas, and run in and kill a bunch of people. This was a symbolic attack on New Year's with a lot of people in town, very symbolic a bold game. And this is -- fits the ISIS playbook. They don't have jets and TAMA (ph) missiles.

The police are well trained in trying to deal with street crime and gang type activity that may come to the French Quarter with an automatic weapon. We've had several of those incidents, and they're well trained to respond to it. I don't think they were as focused as we should until today on the potential of terrorist attack using vehicles. And what could be worse, Brianna, is a terrorist attack with body bombs. They would have to have a lot of technical assistance to do that.

      "sentences": "Well, this is talking to multiple people on all different ends of this case, but the headline is he pledges allegiance to ISIS, not in the formal way that we've seen in prior messages, where they almost read by a script saying, I pledge allegiance to, and then they say the name of the leader of ISIS and the Islamic State.In this case, it's a bit of a rambling conversation over four or five different recordings. They appear to be made kind of in the dark as he's driving. You can't really see him. You can tell that you're in a car moving. It's probably made as he's on his way from Texas to Louisiana, but the substance of it really tells you where he's coming from and how he got to this place. He talks about the falling apart of his family, the bitter divorce, his feeling of being isolated and ostracized. He said, one of my plans originally was to get the family together at a holiday event and then use that as a ruse to get them in one place and kill them. Then he talks about kind of shifting to but I had some dreams, dreams about ISIS, about joining ISIS about what to do, and that's why I'm going down this path to this attack that I'm on the way to? He tackles back and says, I don't want you to think, referring to his family, that I'm doing these killings because of you. This is for ISIS in some and substance, and I'm paraphrasing. But it gives us a window when you start to ask that question, how does someone who you know served in the U.S. military, served in Afghanistan, came back, tried to go into business, went through some personal issues, end up on this end of kind of ISIS recruiting and goes to kill people, literally following the ISIS playbook of how to get a large vehicle? How to find a crowded place? Pick a narrow street with a big crowd, go for maximum lethality. Have secondary weapons. Confront police -- you know attempt martyrdom and leave that message behind about why you're doing it. He followed it to a T.",

He rented this Tesla cyber vehicle. So, the person he rented it from has the identifiers for who he rented it to. The background of that person is also a military background.He is reportedly a Special Forces Sergeant, expert in communications, but authorities haven't identified the body that's in the car. They're operating on the theory that he's the person who rented the vehicle, because that's a logical theory, but they still don't know it's him. But when you get down to it, then, using an Elon Musk Tesla targeting a Trump property in a high-profile way on a holiday in Las Vegas, another military person within four hours of the first attack, you have to really kind of go through the -- go through the questions of, is there a connection, or is this a coincidence? And if it is a coincidence, who was the second attack on behalf of in Las Vegas? Lot of questions.",

Now, as far as what he shared about the investigation, he said much of what we had learned, for example, that the suspect had served in the U.S. military, that hours before the attack, had posted on social media that he had been inspired by ISIS. And then ISIS flag was found on his vehicle. But the president also recognizing that there are still questions that need to be answered. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
