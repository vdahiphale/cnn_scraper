But the deal that he is asking Congress to codify is running into some resistance from both the right and the left. On the right you have some Republicans who are just wary of getting involved in a dispute involving private companies, and then on the left, you have some progressives who don't like that this deal does not include 15 days of paid sick leave. So that is why in the House they have decided on this two vote system today in order to appease progressives without jeopardizing the deal's chances of passage in the Senate.First, they're going to vote on the deal, which, as a reminder, includes a 24 percent increase in pay and it also includes a cap on health care premiums. And then they're going to have a second separate vote on just adding paid sick leave. Then all of that will head to the Senate. It's unclear if the Senate is going to take up the paid sick league portion, but you do have Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer vowing to get this deal done. Of course, it's a matter of timing.

Rhodes was also one of the five Oath Keeper defendants to be convicted of disrupting an official proceeding, which on its own could carry a 20-year prison sentence.

But one of them predictably because it's the internet, was that a trolling campaign emerged. And a number of trolls you could sort of watch the organization happen on 4chan. So, this is all happening in public. They were like, let's go to Twitter and test the new limits of Elon Musk. Twitter's challenge going forward is not, you know, can the platform build machine learning? Sure, they can.
