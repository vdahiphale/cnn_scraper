A member of the committee and constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe are both OUTFRONT.Plus, breaking news, the Supreme Court putting a temporary freeze on plans to end title 42, the Trump-era border policy, as thousands and thousands of migrants have been lining up to enter the United States. We are live on both sides of the southern border tonight. And Putin making a rare visit to Belarus where Russia is now training Belarusian pilots to fly jets capable of carrying, quote, special warheads. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. Welcome to a special edition of OUTFRONT. We are live from Washington tonight. And it is countdown for the Justice Department this evening. As the January 6th Select Committee makes history, referring Donald Trump to the DOJ for the criminal prosecution. Now, this has never happened before in American history. And the committee is recommending not one but four criminal charges against Trump. The first, obstruction of an official proceeding. That charge alone could carry a 25-year sentence if convicted. That is life for Donald Trump. Number two, conspiracy to defraud the United States. Three, conspiracy to make false statements to the federal government regarding the slates of electors. And, four, the charge of insurrection. And the consequences for insurrection would end Trump's current White House bid. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JAMIE RASKIN (D-MD):  It is a grave federal offense anchored in the constitution itself, which repeatedly opposes insurrections and domestic violence, and indeed uses participation in insurrection by office holders as automatic grounds for disqualification from ever holding public office again at the federal or state level.

And, in fact, today is two years to the day from when Trump sent the tweetAnd that is just the start of a very consequential week for Trump. Multiple investigations into the former president are coming to a head as this year ends. Tomorrow, the House Ways and Means Committee is expected to discuss how to move forward with the six years of Trump's tax returns that it finally obtained. On Wednesday, the January 6 committee will release its full report, and that is going to be crucial because it includes full transcripts of what they were told by witnesses behind closed doors. That is going to be a lot of information. And then the Justice Department is conducting that simultaneous investigation on January 6th as well as Trump's mishandling of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. CNN is also learning tonight that the Georgia special grand jury investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election is now writing their final report. All of that happening as we speak. And in New York Trump is still facing a civil suit filed by the attorney general over allegations of widespread fraud. There's a lot to get to tonight, so I want to begin with Evan Perez, because Evan as I said, it is countdown for the Justice Department. They've got these referrals now from the committee. And now they've got to decide if they're going to indict and for what, how are they handling this news tonight?",

That refers to Mike Pence, and section 2384, which is seditious conspiracy.Accordingly, we believe sufficient evidence exists for a criminal referral of President Trump under these two statutes. It's interesting, because on the first four referrals that they make, they're clear they've got the evidence and they make the referral.

The case that reached the Supreme Court tonight, though, was not coming from the Democratic side. It was filed by GOP-led states including Texas, and the Republican governor in Texas where you are, Greg Abbott, tweeting, Texas continues to secure the border in the federal government's absence. The Lone Star wait won't wait for President Biden to do his job -- obviously making this a very political. What else are you hearing from officials where you are?",

And at this point, they say they are focused on really trying to ramp up and opening more, larger warehouses, perhaps even unused school buildings. Shelter is the number one top priority that officials here have and are the most concerned about. That and transportation.So they say they will continue working on the logistics of making that all come online in anticipation that large numbers of migrants will be crossing the border in the days to come. But we should also point out there is an incredible amount of frustration when this news broke, we happened to be speaking with a man by the name of Ruben Garcia who runs one of the most prominent shelters here in El Paso. He expressed frustration that we knew that this date was coming a month ago, and that just now that there are still issues with it. And so, the frustration about how everything is left to the last minute really complicates matters for the people on the front lines of all of this, which here in El Paso are churches and shelters and volunteers.",

But when they saw the confusion set in with now it being frozen and it still remaining in place, some of them went over here and started lining up.And, so, they figured, look, if it's not going to happen in the next few days, we might as well take our chances now to try and get it. Many of the folks who are waiting to be processed -- and it's, as you can tell, getting to be a very long line at this hour.

George Santos helped the GOP gained control on the House by flipping a Democratic seat on Long Island. His campaign website right now says George graduated from Baruch College with a bachelor's degree in economics and finance. But a spokesperson of Baruch told CNN they couldn't find a record with anyone of his name or birthday ever attending the school.His bio right now on the NRCC's website says he's worked for companies such as Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Both companies told CNN they have no record of his employment. And an archive version of his campaign website's bio from April says George founded he run a nonprofit called Friends of Pets United from 2013 to 2018 which was able to effectively rescue 2,400 dogs and 280 cats. Despite such specificity, no such organization was found in the database nor in the registered charities in New York state or Florida. Jessica Dean is OUTFRONT from Capitol Hill.

Quote; Santos represents the kind of progress the left is so threatened by. A gay Latino immigrant and Republican who want a Biden district in overwhelming fashion by showing voters there's a better option than the broken promises and failed policies of the Democratic Party. But, again, we are hearing just from his attorney, not from George Santos himself. Worth noting, this was his second run at this. And the Democratic Party of New York and his opponents' campaign pushing back on the idea that they dropped the ball saying \"The New York Times\" obviously has more resources.

In that case, every win matters. Of course, Kevin McCarthy running for speaker, having trouble getting support there. So, it remains to be seen how that will play out.If the House Ethics Committee gets involved, it could be anything from a reprimand to a removal. It is a question now of how Republicans want to proceed, how they want to deal with this. Will they seat him, will they not? These are the questions to keep an eye on as this unfolds. But it is worth noting that the House Ethics Committee is the only committee that has the equal number of members from Democrats and Republicans on that committee.
