New York City Mayor Eric Adams is OUTFRONT. Plus, Marjorie Taylor Greene saying she doesn't give a rat's you-know- what about what her party thinks, as she plows ahead with her plan to oust Speaker Johnson. Let's go OUTFRONT. Good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, from the trial to the trail. Former President Trump, in a rare break for the courtroom today, hitting the campaign trail and he gotten a plane and flew out to Michigan. This is Freeland, Michigan, where you're looking right now, live pictures of Trump, right now on the podium. And he is maybe coming out swinging today using the stage to tear into the judge overseeing his hush money trial. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP, FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: There's no crime. I have a crooked judge. He's a totally conflicted judge. And then I get indicted again, and then I got indicted again. And then I get indicted by Fani with her boyfriend. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

As you mentioned, this hearing is about four additional alleged violations of the gag order, but these violations allegedly occurred before the judge issue that $9,000 fine and threatened Trump with jail.So at this point, it's really unclear if that threat is going to have a deterrent effect on Trump but, Erin, speaking with sources and observing Trump. It's clear that he's not being quite as prolific and his violations of the gag order as he was instead relying on allies to attack prosecutors and other individuals who are protected by this gag order and making these political attacks that he was making. Now we heard a short time ago you play that clip of him attacking the judge. That's completely fine. That is completely valid under the gag order, he can attack the judge. You can attack the District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Now, tomorrows hearing will give prosecutors and defense attorneys a chance to argue about this, but this will all happen outside the presence of the jury. And, Erin, the big thing I'm looking for is whether Trumps attorneys are going to switch up their tactics because remember that last gag order hearing, it was a disaster for the defense. They wanted to focus on their big picture constitutional arguments about political speech. The judge wasn't having it. Instead, he wanted to go post by post, comment by comment. At one point, he even threatened to have a Trump testify under oath during the gag order hearing. So I'm watching to see if defendant its attorneys change up the approach to tomorrows hearing, then after that concludes, the jury will come back in and hear more critical testimony from Keith Davidson.",

This is the lawyer who gave the indication that he negotiated the Stormy Daniels deal and the Karen McDougal deal with Michael Cohen.And so, I think the issue will be on the cross-examination. You spoke with Michael Cohen. Is that correct? You exchanged emails with Michael Cohen. You had several discussions with him. You were not privy to what, if anything, was said between him and Mr. Trump, are you? In fact, you have no idea who directed this, if it was Trump or anyone else, or if he acted on his own. You can't give us any indication as to that, can you? And so, why do I say that? The cross has to suggest that this was something that Cohen was doing, right? And it was -- he's the fixer. He was doing it. Not necessarily that he included his boss, told his boss whether he was looking for brownie points or whatever, perhaps that's a defense, but you move Trump away from that, and that's what Cohen's job was. Why would Trump have any knowledge of this? That's what -- that's going to be their play.",

So has he done what the prosecution needs him to do? TERRI AUSTIN, HOST AND LEGAL ANALYST, LAW &amp; CRIME NETWORK: Well, he took one step forward and two steps back I think because one of the things that the prosecution must do is, as Joey says, establish the fact that there is a separation. Cohen is out here doing what he needs to do on his own. And we heard Davidson say, look, he's irascible, he's always leaning into his relationship on Trump. And you can't predict what he's going to do. So I think that separation has been made, but Davidson also said, I don't know if Cohen actually has the authority to make these payments. I think that hurt the prosecution a little bit and it established that maybe there was that separation. (CROSSTALK)",

He's allowed to do that.But what I played are the things he said today, he did speak for an hour-and-a-half and those are the only things he said.

I know there is a theory that he wants a martyr himself by going to jail. I don't really believe that. You know, everything that I've read, heard about him suggests to me that that's the last thing that he wants. So I do think its having some disciplining effect. The question really, Erin, is what effect is this whole thing having on the campaign? And I think there's very little evidence right now that is having much of an effect on the campaign at all. In fact, Trumps numbers are sort of marginally better than when the trial started, half -- more than half of people say they're not paying close attention to it. You know, we'll see what happens when there's a verdict one way or the other and how that affects the campaign. But right now, this is in many peoples estimation a non-event.",
