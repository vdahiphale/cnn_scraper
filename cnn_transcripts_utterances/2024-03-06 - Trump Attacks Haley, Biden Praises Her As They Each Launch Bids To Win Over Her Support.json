We're tracking the fight for her supporters and the strategies on both sides on this, the eve of the President's critical State of the Union address.Also tonight a big Super Tuesday winner joins us live. Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff of California will weigh in on the next phase of his costly Barkley (ph) campaign for the U.S. Senate and the broader stakes of the 2024 election. And will also get a first-hand account of the deadly Russian attack near the convoy of Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A key Zelenskyy national security adviser who was there joins us live this hour. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in the Situation Room. Tonight, the 2024 floor race for the White House is at a high stakes pivot point after months of anticipation that President Biden and Donald Trump would face off again, Nikki Haley's exit and Super Tuesday have effectively sealed the deal. Our correspondents are covering every angle of this unprecedented moment in American politics. First, let's get to CNN's Kristen Holmes. She's in Florida covering former President Trump. Kristen, what is Trump now saying after Haley's announcement?",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, even wait until after Haley's announcement for firing off on social media. He posted while she was speaking while she was calling on Donald Trump to bring Republicans into the fold to earn the voters that had supported her over him. He lashed out at Haley saying this, \"Nikki Haley got trounced last night in record setting fashion despite the fact that Democrats for reasons unknown are allowed to vote in Vermont and various other Republican primaries. Much of her money came from radical left Democrats as did many of her votes and was 50 percent according to the polls. At this point, I hope she stays in the race and fights it out until the end.\"That he went on to say that Nikki Haley's supporters should join Donald Trump and that movement again, after saying that they were radical left Democrats. Now, of course, it's also comes after Donald Trump months ago tweeted that anyone who gave information or gave money to Nikki Haley, any donors, would not be welcome into Trump's orbit, which is hard to believe, given that they are very welcoming right now to donors and to people writing checks. But all of this said, there are specific people within Trump's campaign advisors that I'm talking to who say that they know they need some of these Nikki Haley supporters. Now some of them were Democrats, some of them were never Trumpers, people who were never going to vote for Donald Trump. But there is a faction of these Nikki Haley supporters who are Republicans who are just looking for an alternative but will ultimately back the Republican nominee or likely back the Republican nominee. That is who they are focused on the campaign, reaching out trying to come up with solutions to that. Well, Donald Trump himself is taking his message in another direction. But it is clearly a pivot to the general election, we saw numerous Republicans coming out to back Donald Trump and Donald Trump saying that he needed to debate President Joe Biden as well. Now, keep in mind, Donald Trump did not participate in one single primary debate essentially saying that he didn't have to because he was leading by such a wide margin, now we have heard from Biden's camp essentially saying this wasn't the time to talk about it. But Donald Trump's team, as we have reported before, they are itching for those general election debates, they want to put him on the stage. They believe this is a big part of their tactic to win in November.",

That means that everything that the campaign does going forward increasingly so is going to be with an eye towards November and really broadening out Joe Biden's base and coalition going forward. Now, even before Nikki Haley officially dropped out of the presidential race this morning, we know that the Biden campaign officials and that team have been watching those supporters. These are the folks that they see as sort of the gettable voters, the folks who they say are turned off sort of permanently by Donald Trump.And the statement that we saw from President Biden earlier today, after Nikki Haley dropped out, we saw him explicitly making that outreach to precisely those voters. He said in that statement, \"Donald Trump made it clear that he doesn't want Nikki Haley supporters. I want to be clear that there is a place for them in my campaign.\" So, Wolf, I think just looking ahead to the rest of the week for the Biden campaign and the Biden White House. There really is no separating out Super Tuesday last night and the State of the Union remarks that are coming up on Thursday. I think the very themes that are animating the general election argument for President Biden, those are the themes that we very much expect to see woven throughout his speech coming up on Thursday, and obviously incredibly important, because this is the last time that he'll have that setting to address folks before he faces voters again in November, Wolf.",

I mean, she had a lot of things to say about him during the campaign, largely on foreign policy.And, you know, so these folks are not necessarily going to go to Donald Trump.

He's going to lay out his accomplishments, but he's going to be very personal about it in terms of everything that he has done to boost the economy on a macro level, but also on a very micro level, which is what people haven't really felt yet, right? He is going to really lay that out. And then he's also going to talk about remind people, you know, the body and the mind have a way of forgetting trauma, we suffered trauma under four years of Donald Trump. And so it doesn't surprise me that a lot of people maybe have fuzzy memory about that. The Biden campaign, and I think starting tomorrow night without necessarily mentioning Donald Trump, Joe Biden, the President is going to remind people exactly what is at stake that this is a more dangerous, a more feral, a more retribution obsessed Donald Trump this time around than what we have ever seen.

I mean, the fact is, a lot of people after January 6 thought Donald Trump was going to be left for dead politically by both parties and most Americans and that just hasn't turned out to be the case. As we saw last night, the Republican Party has coalesced around him.He's got the Republican institutional leadership now with McConnell and others. I mean, he's got a pretty unified party. These polls are talking about with Republicans who supported Nikki Haley, I don't actually think these people are Republicans in the traditional sense anymore, I don't think a lot of them voted for Trump before, I don't think they intend to vote for him now. And I think, frankly, when you look at going from McConnell's endorsement today to all the votes that he's gotten in these primaries, you could make a strong argument that his party is far more unified behind him than Biden is behind him.",

And I mean, boarding the cars in the motorcade when we saw the strike actually. And then that's what was happening. It's really was less than 500 meters from us. What was that, you cannot exclude anything with these insane people who are striking every day, every night, every corner of my country. So you cannot exclude it was directed at the delegation of my President or at the delegation of the foreign guests. What we exactly know that Russia is doing this day by day, night by night, the previous night in Odesa, 20 drones were hit in Odesa. And almost all of them were intersected. What we also know that several days ago, the drone was hitting the residential area, the outskirts of Odesa, killing 12 people. And part of the building was completely demolished, ground zero, and 12 people were killed, including five children. The smallest was just four months old and the eldest was nine years old. So that is what is going on in my country. They really -- they don't care where to hit. They hit against peaceful citizens. They hit across the fire of high level guests. They hit across civilian infrastructure. That's what they do.",

The United Nations says some 40 percent of admissions under their coordination were either denied or obstructed by Israel last month. We are still seeing the prolonged closure of border crossings from Israel into Gaza.And we are also still seeing Israeli protesters physically blocking aid trucks from accessing Gaza with little to no intervention from security forces on the ground. Now, we are beginning to hear from international allies of Israel, including the United States taking a firmer stance when it comes to pressuring Israel to allow for more aid to get into Gaza. The Biden administration has been clear, they've said that there is simply no excuse for more aid not to be allowed in. We know according to the Pentagon, as well, that the U.S. is considering a maritime corridor it is reviewing its options there. And of course, we have seen humanitarian aid now being air dropped into Gaza by the U.S. and other international allies, that that has drawn some criticism from aid agencies have described this as a temporary measure carried out with little to no consideration for how this aid can be safely and fairly distributed on the ground. Now, of course, the amount of aid actually getting in at this stage is simply not enough. It is a drop in the ocean in comparison to what is actually needed in Gaza. And as you saw in our report there, Gaza is teetering on the brink of an outright famine. Wolf?",

That attack did serious damage to the ship itself. It killed at least three crew members and wounded four more according to Central Command. Three of those are in critical condition. They have been evacuated from the True Confidence. Again that is a Liberia flag, I'm sorry, Barbados flag Liberia own vessel that came under attack.
