The Biden administration very recently authorizing more than 1,500 pound bombs and more be sent over to Israel. This as lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who we just spoke to, are calling on President Biden to use weapons transfers like this as leverage to get Benjamin Netanyahu to change course. And Biden and Netanyahu are set to speak in a phone call today.Let's get more on this new reporting. CNN's Natasha Bertrand has this for us. Tell us more, Natasha.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Kate, so we're told that the U.S., in recent days, did authorize a new transfer of two - of over 2,000 munitions to the Israelis, including over 1,500 pound bombs and another 1,000 plus small diameter bombs. And these are notably munitions sales that had been notified to Congress and approved many years ago. And so they did not require new congressional notification. Instead, once these orders essentially became fulfilled, then the State Department was able to authorize that transfer to the Israelis.But we are told that this transfer authorization came before this latest strike on an aid convoy by these Israelis on World Central Kitchen. But still, it is likely to generate further questions over the administration's policy of continuing to provide these weapons and this kind of equipment to the Israelis amid public condemnations by President Biden, by senior administration officials of how they are carrying out this war in Gaza. We are told by a former senior State Department official that if they wanted to, the U.S. could, in fact, choose to suspend these kinds of approvals. However, the administration, so far, showing no signs that they are willing to do that, saying that they're investing essentially in Israel's long-term security here, and reiterating that Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas and other threats. But, obviously, this latest transfer authority is going to raise more questions about whether they should be using their authority and their leverage in a different way. BOLDUAN: Yes.

There's thousands of deaths. And aid workers need to be able to move safely to deliver aid to those in need. We are focused on health, so we're looking at delivering medicines and medical supplies.
