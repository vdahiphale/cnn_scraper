The fact that we have 31,000 casualties, deaths in Gaza so far has really changed that equation. So a large portion of the Democratic Party is now quite willing to get tough with the current policy in Israel. The Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, a stalwart defender of Israel for his whole career, just came out with a big speech on this.

Instead, there was nothing, radio silence, which was a complete contrast to what we saw with the king. There was messages from the king, even though he's undergoing cancer treatment. And into that radio silence, into that vacuum rushed all these conspiracy theories. I mean, some of them, I've never seen anything so extreme in terms of what these conspiracy theories were. And it became an international story. And then the photo, well, royals always Photoshop their pictures. Henry VIII, he Photoshopped all his pictures. One of my favorite Henry VIII pictures, portraits, has Henry the VIII aged 40 next to his daughter, who -- he died -- he died when she was 12 but she's in the pictures. He's 55.
