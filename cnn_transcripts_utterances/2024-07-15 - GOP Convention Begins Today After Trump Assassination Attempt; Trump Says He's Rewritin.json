He has -- you know, we think of January 6th, we think of the Pelosi incident and so on. He has not been an apostle of peace and love and politics throughout. So this is a new message for him. Scott Walker dominated the politics of this state for a decade and he did it because he understood how to win those suburban areas around Milwaukee. And those are the voters who have in some measure drifted away from Donald Trump and drifted away from the Republican Party. If this convention wants to win those votes and this state, then he will echo that message and the other speakers will echo that message.

There was no question that there was going to be more Democratic dissent coming his way.There were some advisers we're told that were worried that there might be some prominent members of the Democratic Party coming out on the Sunday shows yesterday to publicly call on him to drop out of the race. Today, he was going to have this TV interview with NBC's Lester Holt, where the focus was surely going to be about questions of his age, his fitness to serve, and again, the moment of political peril that he is in. And the moment that those gunshots rang out in Butler, Pennsylvania, so much, of course, was upended for the Biden campaign's part. You know, they appropriately put a pause on their political work, including pausing, as you mentioned, TV ads outgoing political communications. And we also know that the White House had to postpone the President's trip to Texas. One of the stops was going to be a fundraiser. But notably what we have also seen is a pause on the Democratic dissent coming the President's way, which until Saturday had really been growing by the day. I mean, keep in mind that even in the hours leading up to that Donald Trump rally, the President was working the phones and having some really tense and tough conversations with Democratic lawmakers that were really questioning the viability of his candidacy. And we have spoken with some Biden allies that are quietly feeling hopeful that perhaps this could be sort of a turning of the page moment for President Biden and the Democratic Party. And the idea is basically that Democrats will see this moment as being so urgently, you know, a moment for the party to really come together that they see this as being even more urgent now, as they are seeing Republicans really rallying around former President Donald Trump. But of course, it's really not even been 48 hours yet, Dana, so we'll have to see what kind of tone comes out of the RNC. But, again, this is sort of the private and quiet hopes coming out of Democrats that they're hoping that the dissent that we have been seeing come out in such full force that perhaps that could be quieted because of what happened over the weekend, Dana.",
