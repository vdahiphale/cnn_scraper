Debris from the drone allegedly fell near the Moscow Expo Center. Now this marks the third time in the past month that this district of the capital has been struck by drone debris. State media says authorities closed the airspace over one of Moscow's major airports, delaying arrivals and departures.It's one of two incidents officials reported in recent hours. The Russian defense ministry says two of its patrols, ships in the Black Sea repelled an attack from an unmanned Ukrainian gunboat late Thursday. One of the vessels that thwarted the attack is the Vasily Bikov. That ship also participated in Russia's attack on Ukraine's Snake Island at the start of the full-scale invasion. Meanwhile, we're learning more about American-made F-16 fighter jets possibly being sent to Ukraine. CNN's Nada Bashir is following those developments from London.

The hope for Ukraine is that these F-16s will mark a significant shift in their counteroffensive or mark a huge boost to their air defense efforts and operations. But of course, this is moving slower than they had hoped. Of course, there has been some delay since Biden announced that turnaround back in May.We heard earlier this month from the State Department saying that they do intend to push forward with plans to ensure that Ukrainian pilots are trained. on these U.S.-made fighter jets, but of course, as we learned yesterday from the Ukrainian Air Force, that training is not set to be complete until the beginning of next year. That is a blow to Ukraine's air defense ambitions. However, we have heard that recommitment from the Biden administration committing the U.S. government to approving the transfer of these U.S.-made fighter jets to Ukraine on the provision that Ukrainian pilots are fully trained. And that is expected to take place as soon as that training is complete. And of course, training was anticipated to begin this month although it's not clear exactly how long that training would take. But we have seen that delay over the last few weeks but of course we heard from the Ukrainian Air Force spokesperson speaking yesterday saying that there are some positive indications they do hope that training will commence in the near future. So, of course, that will mark a significant boost to the counter-offensive which is inching on although slower than had been previously anticipated. We have seen Ukraine gaining territory twice now in the last two weeks making gains towards the southeast and port city of Mariupol but they are of course sustaining blows as a result of the continued bombardment of the Russian Armed Forces not least the continued drone attacks that have been targeting Ukraine's southern Black Sea ports.",

If the U.S. State Department does end up sort of legally categorizing this as a coup, which ECOWAS, France, the E.U. have all done, that would mean the U.S. would have to pull back certain military activities and funding that is helping Nigerian forces in this fight against extremists.

There could be.And interestingly, we've not seen a lot of anti-U.S. sentiments. Most of the sentiments and the hardline positions, previously they've been against France, because the argument on grounds that despite having strong military relationship with France, it's not resulted in any form of economic gain. And so, we've not seen a lot of anti-U.S. sentiment. So, I think, which is good for the U.S., I think they can use that as a leverage to try and find a way to work with the junta if everything fails, which I think it's going to be the only way.

Meanwhile, Russia's space agency says all systems are functioning normally after its Luna-25 spacecraft entered the moon's orbit on wednesday. It's Russia's first lunar lander in 47 years and they are aiming to touch down on the moon's South Pole as early as Monday. Saudi Arabia is saying hi Barbie. Locals packing theaters now that the global blockbuster has arrived. But there isn't Barbie mania everywhere in the Middle East, as Becky Anderson reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BECKY ANDERSON, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Scenes like these were unthinkable just a few years back. Saudi women packing cinemas to watch Barbie. An empowering movie with feminist themes. But Barbie mania is alive in the kingdom, which only ended its decades long ban on cinemas in 2017, as part of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's plans to transform the country. JAMAL MOUSSA, EGYPTIAN LIVING IN SAUDI ARABIA (through translator): I asked people coming out of the screening, they told me that it is an excellent film, a romantic film, the Barbie movie. It has a compelling story. So I thought to book for me and the children to watch it, and they were happy about it. An advancement we are witnessing every day, we can now see movies and a lot of things that we did not see here before.",
