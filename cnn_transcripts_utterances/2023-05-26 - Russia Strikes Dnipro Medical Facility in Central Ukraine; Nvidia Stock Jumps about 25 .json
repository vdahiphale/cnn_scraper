Making investors happy more evidence that AI is the new tech growth engine chip maker Nvidia stock soaring 24 percent on buoyant demand its market cap now surpassing that of both Facebook chief Meta and Tesla and creating discomfort. Meanwhile, traders increasingly pricing in additional Fed rate hikes with a more than 50 percent chance now of a rate hike next month. And then causing serious pain, you've probably guessed the still unresolved U.S. debt ceiling crisis. Less than a week to go before the U.S. apparently runs out of cash and still no deal to raise the borrowing limit reports though, do say progress is being made on a two year deal. Both sides are set to work through the long weekend. But at least as of yesterday, that's Thursday, the U.S. had less than $50 billion of cash left on hand. That was down more than 20 billion from the day before. So clearly time is running out. And as we await new developments, I'll give you a look at this Wall Street futures and Europe higher amid reports of deal making progress. After today's close U.S. markets won't open again until Tuesday. There's a long weekend here in the U.S. That's just two days before the June 1 Treasury set deadline. A busy Friday indeed and let's begin with those debt ceiling talks. Christine Romans joins us now. Christine, you can -- now rather than me, but we do seem to be closer on reaching some kind of deal, a two year extension, which would push them beyond the 2024 election, I believe, but some concerns debate over work requirements to get federal support.",

And then there's also this movement from the White House. You know, it looks like maybe offering up $10 billion in IRS funding that has been the bane of Republicans, right? They hated that the IRS got so much new funding to modernize and to be able to enforce rich tax cheats. And so maybe some of that money could be take 10 billion. I think is the number they're talking about move from that pile from the IRS enforcement pile, the IRS operations pile moved over to cover some other spending cut areas, the Democrats are find important. So maybe there that shows there's some compromises and movement, something that Kevin McCarthy can take back to Republicans. But you're right, still a lot of concern, from the left about any work requirements for food stamps and for Medicare. Look, they say that's not solving America's debt and deficits problems. That's just, you know, hurting the poor. So that's a philosophical debate that is still happening there overall, but we are seeing some movement. And I think that is what is so important. And when you look at markets, Julia, I'm worried about the calendar I'm worried about the whip whether they can whip these votes. But markets are saying failure is not an option.

So I think that there needs to be bigger -- two big discussions, one about debt and deficits and the drivers as we know our health care, retirement, interest on the debt and tax revenues that are too low. OK, so that's take those four things, you got to figure it out, right? Maybe you need a bipartisan Blue Ribbon Commission to do that. You know, and the second thing is the debt ceiling is not as helpful as it was in terms of fiscal restraint 100 years ago, when it was put in, maybe we need to have bigger discussions about making sure the debt ceiling is not a political football.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SALMA ABDELAZIZ, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): These calm waters are home to a secret Russia doesn't want you to know. Experts say Iran is quietly sending weapons on ships like this one across the Caspian Sea to replenish arms for Moscow's war on Ukraine. Concealing movement at sea is considered nefarious and potentially a violation of international law. But in the Caspian Sea, there are a growing number of gaps in vessels tracking data known as AIS, with a more than 50 percent increase in ships hiding their movement between August and September of 2022. According to maritime trafficking data, most of the vessels going dark are Iranian or Russian flag tankers. The timing is suspicious too, this practice picking up the last summer, just as White House officials revealed that Russia had purchased hundreds of drones from Iran.

You want to nail those bacteria, you want to just kill it, and you're trying out one after another. It is going to take you weeks and months, maybe years to do say 100 million of those. AI in a much shorter time, and maybe days or weeks contest out way more than that, maybe even billions of chemicals. So to the point that you were making with your guests earlier, AI just makes everything go much faster. And we really need an approach for these bacteria. So these bacteria are so dangerous. Let's talk a bit about it. So it's called the Acinetobacter Baumannii sorry about that, and it develops antibiotic resistance. In other words, it becomes resistant to antibiotics. And it can cause infections in the blood urinary tract, it can cause pneumonia. It's found mostly in hospital so people with catheters, people in the ICU, people who are the most vulnerable. And here's probably the worst of it, or part of the worst of it, Julia, it clings to surfaces. So you can wash, wash, wash and scrub, scrub. But you know, if someone in a hospital misses a spot, these bacteria can just grow and grow and grow. So what these researchers did is they got a mouse, they gave it a wound infection, a skin infection with this bacteria. And they found that a particular chemical worked against it. So Julia, I want to be clear, this is a great day, if you're a mouse, it's a great day, if you're a wounded mouse. This is not going to be on the market anytime soon.

Secondly, and you know more about this, Julia, than I do, because you're the business expert and I'm not. You have to convince a pharmaceutical company that it is worth spending money on this.

This would be used for, you know, in big picture a relatively small number of people because not tons and tons of people get this infection compared to some other bacterial infections.

Taking high end dining now to new extremes a French startup is offering flights to the edge of space in apressurized capsule attached to a helium balloon. Stick with me and of course being French food is also playing a crucial part. In this experience the company called Zephalto promises the finest meals for Michelin Chefs as the capsule rises around 25 kilometers above the earth now that's far higher than passenger jets, which cruise at an altitude of between 8 and 11 kilometers. The firm says the craft will take off from a French spaceport ascend for around an hour and a half at speeds of four meters a second, before reaching an altitude of 25 kilometers where you'll spend the next three hours. You can see on the diagram plenty of time to eat and admire the view, followed by slow descent back to Earth. You can see we're very excited about this on the show. Vincent Farret D'Asties is the CEO and he joins us now. Sir welcome to the show. Very excited to talk to you just explain what inspired this firm? VINCENT FARRET D'ASTIES, CEO ZEPHALTO: Yes, thank you very much. I'm very happy to continue. What inspired was a dream? I used to say it a lot and made with moves to sail to the stars because yes to provide a little cabin space -- I wanted to fly to the southern being harmony without adding fuel to get there. So but this dream is coming true is when was the beginning of Jupiter was 2016. And now we are about to fly at 25 kilometers altitude this year for test flights.",

And a shark took off one of the limbs of the woman who is in very serious condition right now there was also a young woman who was bit down on the New Jersey coast she was surfing. And then down in Florida there was a young woman who was just sitting in the water near Fort Pierce and she was bit. Both of those individuals were not bit as bad as the woman in Turks and Caicos but here in New York, the Governor has ordered more drones in the air more boats in the water as the summer season gets going to make sure that people are safe from sharks and a few words of advice as well.
