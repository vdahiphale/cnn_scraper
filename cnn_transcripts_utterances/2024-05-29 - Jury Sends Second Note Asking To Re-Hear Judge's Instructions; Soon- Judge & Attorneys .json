I'm Jake Tapper.We do have some breaking news for you, and just over four hours to deliberation, the jury has now requested to hear read back of four parts of testimony, and just now, they send a second note, another note, a second one. These 12 people will decide the fate of former President Trump and his criminal hush money cover-up trial. We're going to bring you all the updates in a moment. The verdict comes down, which could be in seconds or days. If you ask Donald Trump's allies, they believed that every minute the jury continues to deliberate as a good sign for Trump. The truth is, we have no idea. This morning, Judge Merchan instructed the jury on how they should reach their verdict. This included a directive to check any personal Trump views at the door saying, quote, you must set aside any personal opinions or bias you might have in favor or against the defendant. And you must not allow any such opinions to influence your verdict. But I guess those instructions weren't as clear as Judge Merchan thought they were because this second note from the jury, they rang the buzzer again and they're saying we'd like to hear those instructions again. CNN's Paula Reid is outside the courthouse. Paula, what exactly is the confusion? And honestly, why didn't he just give them the paper document with the instructions? Like -- I mean, I know Karen here says that that's just not what's done in New York. Well, it's stupid. Give them the instructions and paper. Why not?",

It's also stupid not to have cameras inside the courtroom, but I'm going to hop off my soapbox for a second and note that the judge isn't even in clear on whether they want the entirety of the jury instructions re-read or just portions. It appears in the judge is not keen to repeat those over 50 pages of instructions that he already gave adjust this morning.Now we're learning that the first request that they made for portions of four different pieces of testimony, that read back we're learning from her colleagues inside, that's going to take about 30 minutes, according to the court reporter. So they're going to hear back these portions of testimony that they asked for, three different pieces of testimony from David Pecker and then a piece of testimony from David -- from Michael Cohen. Now, what's interesting is they want to hear from both David Pecker, and Michael Cohen again out the Trump Tower meeting, and that's notable because you have two people in this critical meeting, the prosecutors argued in their closings yesterday, set off this alleged conspiracy to help Trump in the 2016 campaign by using the \"National Enquirer\" to suppress negative stories about Trump and amplify positive ones. Now, we don't want to read too much into this request. What it suggests, Jake, that the jury may be moving through this case chronologically. Now, the judge has just read both notes from the jury and he's asked the foreperson to confirm that he'd he read them right. The foreperson has confirmed and obviously the judge wants to get a little clarity on that second note just how much of his instructions does he need to go through again, because it's clear Jake getting through these two requests is likely going to take us to the end of the day. So, highly unlikely that we would get a verdict today. This expected to go into tomorrow.",

So one of the instructions was you can't rely on his testimony only look at what evidence is out there to corroborate it. And there's -- there's quite a bit of overlap between what he was talking about and David Pecker's testimony. So they might be looking for ways to corroborate it which could also be partly why they want to hear the instructions, but it doesn't surprise me in the least that they do want to hear all of the instructions because it was a lot and there's no way anybody could process all of that in one shot.",

If that were the case, they would just have a knee-jerk reaction and potentially just convict him. And this really shows they're listening, they're thinking they're looking at the evidence they want to read back. They want the law read back to them. They want certain parts of the testimony so they can analyze it. And whatever the verdict is, we have to respect it and I think the legitimacy of the jury system out of the criminal ill justice system is important, whatever the verdict is, but I think this is a very positive sign because it shows they're taking their job very seriously and they're being thoughtful.",

They want a certain specific part of David Pecker's testimony.And that could be in multiple places, right? There could be a question on direct, are a series of questions on the direct. There could be more questions later on in the direct and then parts of cross. And what's going to happen is the court reporter is going to have to identify each and every place that is responsive to that note in both direct and cross, then the parties are going to have to agree that that's the only place in the transcripts that it exists, and then it'll be read back to them. The court reporters, the one who does the read back, both of the judge's instruction and of the testimony in New York. So you'll have the court reporter who will be speaking for a long time tomorrow, but I bet even at 9:30, we might not get started because the jury will come in, the judge will send them back to continue to deliberate. They can continue to deliberate, even while the parties are answering the notes and looking for things, it's not like things stop at that time.

In other words, they didn't spend hours and hours kind of venting or unburdening himself of their feelings.

In California, it's discretionary. A judge can give copies of the instructions to the jurors. I always did that every jury trial, and I presided over a lot of them in the nearly 20 years I was on the bench. Give them the jury instruction. So I read through -- actually skim through the jury instructions that Judge Merchan read to the jurors. The reasonable doubt instruction alone is one-and-a-half pages. It's just absurd to me. So that's one. And then the transcript, why are not transcripts digitized? So when they're gone through, you digitize them and then they can provide copies of the particular excerpts that the jurors want to hear. Instead, they have to go through and that's tedious, I get it, both sides. The judge, they do -- they go through to find out exactly what the jurors want to hear from the transcripts and then they should provide it to them instead, they're going to sit there and it will be read. Now, it is read back transcripts are read back in courts in California and there's also move toward digitizing things. So the jurors can not just hear it because the person who read's it can't use any affect at all, give it to them in writing, printing, so they can read it. I just don't get it.

Kara Scannell, thanks so much.Weeks of testimony, scores of documents weighing 34 criminal counts and appears to critical witnesses as the jury as to revisit what David Pecker and Michael Cohen had to say. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [16:40:14] TAPPER: And we're back with continuing coverage of jury deliberations and Donald Trump's hush money cover-up trial. The jury says wrapped for the day after getting the case this morning, the jury did request of rehear for parts of testimony and to rehear the jury instructions the Judge Juan Merchan read this morning. They will likely hear those read to them again tomorrow morning at 9:30 a.m. when the court is back in session. Our panel is here to discuss. And there's something interesting that Andy McCarthy wrote. He's actually a very interesting writer. He's frequently cited by Donald Trump and he tends to take Trump's side of this case and has issued some very blistering condemnations of the case as brought by D.A. Alvin Bragg, and also how Judge Merchan is running his courtroom. So that said, he's also been quite critical in this new column, one that I think Donald Trump will probably not read aloud, in which he says that the strategy for his defense was not the wisest one. And let me just read a lengthy excerpt to do it justice. Against the weight of evidence and common sense, Trump insists on telling voters that Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal are lying. But no one with even passing familiarity with Trump's combative and parsimonious nature would believe for a second that, A, he would agree to pay $130,000 to Stormy and $150,000 to McDougal if they were falsely claiming to have had affairs with him, or B, that Cohen would have paid Stormy and Trump's pal, David Pecker, would have paid McDougal unless Trump had green-lighted the payments and assured them of repayments. Since Trump knows that if he acknowledged as being complicit in the payment arrangements, voters will conclude his denials of the affairs are lies, Trump has decided he must distance himself from the nondisclosure agreement, NDA payments. Politically speaking, this is dumb because voters long ago made up their minds about Trump's extramarital affairs. And if he admitted them at this point, he'd merely be admitting what is notorious and not credibly deniable. Then that's the politics of it, McCarthy writes. Legally speaking, he says, Trump's gambit is disastrous. It makes no sense in a criminal courtroom for a defendant to deny his complicity in legal conduct when there is daunting evidence that he was complicit up to his neck. The prosecutors framed the case to the jury as a criminal conspiracy to bury damaging information. That's not a crime and NDAs are legal, but rather than go with that, his best defense, Trump has acted guilty. As if a candidate suppression of negative information rather than routine is criminally able and if the NDAs are radioactive. For the District Attorney Alvin Bragg, this is a gift from prosecutorial heaven. Which I thought was very interesting. What do you think? DUPREE: I think there is a lot of truth in that, Jake. Look, I mean, its been an open secret that for a long time, Donald Trump does not make distinctions between kind of political arguments and legal arguments. The two basically merge. And he goes into court and he makes what I agree with Andy is a political argument and you can point throughout this trial, so many moments that the fighting this Stormy Daniels affair, the fighting, his involvement of the payoffs even tactical decisions like the decision to call Costello, those all appear to have been decisions that were driven by Donald Trump's determination of how we want it to litigate this rather than what I suspect his defense lawyers were telling him and what I think most defense lawyers probably would tell him. So I think there's a huge amount of truth get to that. But again, I think for Donald Trump, the main battlefield here is the court of public opinion, and that's what he's been playing to.",

This was a day after an Israeli strike and fire killed 45 people at a camp for displaced Palestinians in Rafah, according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry. Haley's trip comes a week after she said she would vote for Donald Trump in November. Even so, Governor Haley still has considerable support across the country, including, and perhaps especially in battleground states. Case in point, she got 17 percent of the vote in the Pennsylvania Republican primary, more than month after quitting the race.
