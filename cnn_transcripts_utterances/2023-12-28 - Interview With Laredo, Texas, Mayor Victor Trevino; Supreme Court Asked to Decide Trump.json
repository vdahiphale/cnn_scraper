I mean, I think it always comes down to the role of government and what the rights of the people are. And we -- I will always stand by the fact that I think government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people. Government doesn't need to tell you how to live your life. They don't need to tell you what you can and can't do. They don't need to be a part of your life. They need to make sure that you have freedom. We need to have capitalism. We need to have economic freedom.

There is a significant constituency within the Republican coalition, particularly in the South, that is -- expresses sympathy in various ways, sympathetic views toward the Confederacy and don't want to be reminded that the reason the Confederacy existed was to preserve slavery, and, by the way, also to defeat majority rule in the country, since the secession was a direct result of Abraham Lincoln's election and the awareness in the South that the free states were now going to move in ways to impinge the future of slavery. Look, to her credit, as governor, she did remove the Confederate battle flag from the state capitol, but she did that, of course, only after defending its presence for years and after a massacre at an historically black church in Charleston made that previous support untenable. The problem she has here is not so much about the voters are going to be flipping one way or the other based on your view about what caused the Civil War, but this definitely plays into the argument that her critics make, that she is someone who kind of tries too much, too hard to be all thanks to all people and is unwilling to really take a stand in the party. I mean, Chris Christie is out there saying, I'm not getting out of the race because you can't trust her to make a strong case against Donald Trump.

Haley is positioned to do competitively well in New Hampshire. She is doing better in New Hampshire than DeSantis is in Iowa. I think that, after New Hampshire, she will be clearly seen as the principal alternative to Trump. But the main reason she's doing so well in New Hampshire is her strength among independent voters, who can vote in New Hampshire, but not in South Carolina. And, ultimately, she needs to show more appeal to core Republicans, particularly those who are open to Trump, but not wed to Trump. And this is the kind of dance she has done before in South Carolina for many years, I mean, kind of speaking in this very opaque language that minimizes the role of slavery, until called out on it. I don't know if this -- again, this is really the problem for her in South Carolina. The problem is, she has to make a stronger case against Trump if she is really running to beat him, right?

The Colorado Republican Party is a party of this lawsuit as well, and they were first out the gate last night with their appeal, making some pretty serious arguments, in their view, that this Colorado decision was completely wrong and sets a terrible precedent. Let me read for you a little bit of what they are telling the justices in their request for the Supreme Court to take this up and overturn the decision. They said: \"By excluding President Trump from the ballot, the Colorado Supreme Court engaged in an unprecedented disregard for the First Amendment right of political parties to select the candidates of their choice.\" They went on to say that: \"With the number of challenges to President Trump's candidacy now pending in other states, there's a real risk that the Colorado Supreme Court's majority's flawed and unprecedented analysis will be borrowed and the resulting grave error repeated.\" In other words, they're afraid that some of these other cases that are still lingering out there are now going to go against Trump because of the decision in Colorado, and they want the Supreme Court to step in and fix that. And they might be worried for good reason. There's a case pending in Maine right now. There's also a lawsuit that was filed in Oregon a few weeks ago trying to overturn -- trying to keep Trump off the ballot. But, look, mostly Trump has succeeded. You can see here in other states he has mostly been able to preserve his spot. But now it's all up to the Supreme Court. See what they're going to do.",

But that's my sense. My sense is that they know what happens when they put their thumb on the scale of presidential elections. They still remember what happened after Bush v. Gore, when it looked like they were the ones to decide a presidential election.

Maybe he wanted to see what their specific arguments were going to be and to argue something that's complementary. Let's remember, of course, that delay is the name of the game for the former president and that there's no need for him to appeal before January 4, for instance.

And so what the court doesn't want is this patchwork of different decisions, where Trump is eligible in one jurisdiction, but he's not, for instance, in another state.

What we're seeing is that, for instance, Michigan dismissed one of these challenges because they said the secretary of state doesn't have discretion when it comes to eligibility. In Maine, it's kind of the flip side of that, where it's only the secretary of state who, in the first instance, does have that discretion to determine eligibility. And that's why she heard kind of a mini-evidentiary trial as to whether or not she was going to say the former president is ineligible under Section 3, again, of the 14th Amendment. I think what we're looking at here is a bunch of different cases. Again, sometimes, it's a court. Sometimes, it's a secretary of state who makes that first decision. Those cases are then appealed up the state court system. And that -- but that's why we're really in this waiting pattern for the U.S. Supreme Court to give more guidance.",
