What we know about that second train and what it was carrying.An active GOP, likely presidential candidate, speaking from Maryland to California, nailing the talking points, but refusing to target Trump. But is that a winning strategy? We'll ask our senior political analyst. Plus, the battle for Bakhmut and what it could mean for the war in Ukraine if the city falls to the Russians. Good to have you with us. With the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board is sending investigators to Ohio a little more than 24 hours after another Norfolk Southern freight train derailed. It was the second derailment by that company in that state in a little over a month after the toxic crash in East Palestine. CNN's Polo Sandoval has the latest.",

Authorities really shift a lot of their focus on four tanker train cars, two of them were hauling what's being described as diesel exhaust fluid while the other two were hauling water soluble solutions that's often used to treat wastewater. Common industrial solutions as they described them. However, authorities saying that those train cars did not experience any sort of spillage. So, the head of the EPA in the state of Ohio said that there was no chemical release into the air, into the water, into the soil. So now, a lot of the focus will certainly be on a massive cleanup process that is underway there in Springfield, Ohio. And also, on the investigation as they try to find out exactly what led to this derailment, just a little over a month after the toxic tragedy that took place in East Palestine, Ohio with the same rail company, in the same state. However, at this point of the investigation, certainly nothing to lead investigators to believe that they could potentially be linked, but certainly a reminder that these kinds of derailments are happening according to the Federal Railroad Administration, roughly 1,000 derailments happening in the U.S. per year.

The bigger deal is that they -- no one yet in the Republican field is willing to make a direct case against Donald Trump. And I think if anything of the last few weeks have showed us is that despite everything that has happened, January 6th, the threat of indictment, the losses in 2022 of so many candidates that he handpicked for the GOP, he still has the biggest piece of the party. He is still the biggest figure in the party. And what that means is if you're going to beat him, you're going to have to give voters a very clear and persuasive reason why they should pick you and not him. Whether it's Mike Pompeo or Nikki Haley at CPAC or the others, no one really has been willing to do that. They've only -- they've only gone as far as pretty veiled euphemisms.
