That's the most the country has ever fired in a single day.And now, first on CNN, U.S. officials accuse North Korea of secretly sending ammunition to Russia to use in Ukraine.

But thanks to a new piece of intelligence that's recently been declassified, the Biden administration does believe that this deal is moving forward. And broadly, U.S. officials say the very fact that Russia has been forced to turn to North Korea for ammunition suggests that eight months of war have depleted not just their stocks of more sophisticated precision-guided munitions but also their arsenal of just plain old artillery. Russia has been conducting this punishing artillery war on the front lines that one military analyst said to me this morning has likely burned through millions of shells at this point. So it's possible that North Korea is filling a pretty important hole for Russia right now depending on how many shells they've sent.",

LILLISintelligence, North Korea is trying to make it look like these shipments are actually going to North Africa or the Middle East, anywhere but Russia. And generally speaking, North Korea is a really hard intelligence target for the United States. This has been so tricky, in fact, that as recently as a couple of weeks ago, U.S. officials were telling us that they still had seen no signs that these shipments had actually been sent. That, of course, has obviously changed. But it gives you a sense, Ana, of how new this information is and how murky the space is.",

U.S. intel officials say Russian military leaders have talked about how and when they would use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine. Now, on its face, that's alarming. But some U.S. officials are divided on just how serious the threat really is. Keep in mind, the Pentagon estimates that Russia has an active stockpile of up to 2,000 nonstrategic nuclear weapons. CNN White House reporter, Natasha Bertrand, joins us. Why the differing opinions on how big the threat is?",

There are some people in the administration who believe it is thinly sourced, that it is mostly analysis, whereas others are viewing it with more concern.Broadly, the administration does believe that there's this intelligence that suggests that the Russian generals have been speaking about how and when they might use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, basically the circumstances under which they would actually deploy that nuclear weapon. But the difference in opinion here comes into play when you consider how the people, the administration officials are actually interpreting this intelligence. Obviously, you know, this is not a monolith. Not something that is a perfect science. Intelligence requires a lot of interpretation. And some officials that we spoke to said they believe that some of this conversation reflected in this new intelligence analysis could be taken out of context, that it has been misinterpreted. But, look, others say this should be taken seriously because of all of the rhetoric that we have heard coming from the Russians over the last several weeks, and, of course, the battlefield losses that they are sustaining in Ukraine. Now, of course, we heard that Russian President Vladimir Putin has said in speeches that the Russians would be willing to use such a weapon if necessary. And so they're watching this, the U.S. is watching this with a lot of concern as to how this plays out. But so far, no real consensus on how real this is, and imminent -- Ana?",

Khloie along with her classmates and teachers, some dead or dying, were alone, trapped with an active shooter. It's the phone call that should have made the difference.
