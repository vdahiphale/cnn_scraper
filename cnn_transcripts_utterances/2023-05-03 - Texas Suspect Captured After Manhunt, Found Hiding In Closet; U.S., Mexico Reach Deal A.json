The Palestinian Islamic Jihad saying a round of confrontations has ended.The Israeli military telling me that there is no actual ceasefire with militants in Gaza but they said that messages had been exchanged. I think that's more reference to that there is no official sort of long- term ceasefire with Hamas. But the message is being exchanged essentially saying things are over for now. The Israeli military saying that over the last 24 hours or so more than 100 rockets were fired from Gaza into Israel. The Israeli military responding with airstrikes. They say that they attacked everything that they wanted to. They said they attacked 16 targets, which include Hamas reinforcement targets, outposts and underground tunnels. We have not heard of any injuries in Gaza as a result of these airstrikes. There were some injuries in Israel as a result of rocket shrapnel. Three people were injured. One of them, a 25-year-old man was it was injured with serious injuries. According to emergency workers, this happened yesterday in the southern city of Sderot. And of course, this is all sparked yesterday morning by the death of Khader Adnan who you mentioned was once a spokesperson for the Islamic Jihad. He became really a symbol, a face of Palestinian prisoners. He was in prison for his -- I believe his 11th time since 2004. And this was actually his sixth hunger strike. But this one he was found dead in his cell yesterday morning. The Israeli prison authorities saying that he had consistently refused medical attention as a result of his hunger strike. And then of course his death sparking not only these rocket fires but also a general strike in both the West Bank and Gaza. Meaning everything from shops to schools were completely closed off. What's interesting though, is actually Khader Adnan's wife yesterday before the biggest barrage of rockets made a statement to the media saying she didn't want more blood to be spilled. She actually requested that rockets not be fired from Gaza because she didn't want the Israeli military to then be striking Gaza in response. Obviously, of course, that did not happen.

A Russian-installed official in the city of Melitopol has been wounded by an apparent explosive device in his front yard. A police chief was killed last week in a similar incident, which Russia called sabotage by a reconnaissance group. And a second Russian freight train has derailed this week in Russia's Bryansk region. The governor blames an explosive device. No one was killed in either derailment.Meanwhile, the latest UK intelligence shows Russian forces have built an extensive system of trenches in both southern Russia and occupied Ukraine. The defense ministry says the defense highlights Moscow's deep concern that Ukraine could achieve a major breakthrough with its planned counteroffensive. Volodymyr Zelenskyy tells the Washington Post neither the White House nor the Pentagon informed him about leaked documents containing sensitive details about the war in Ukraine.

There's no -- there's no guarantee. So, that's one of the things that they want to get -- they want the studios to guarantee is that to have at least six writers in this many rooms. And four of whom are also producers so that they get paid more. That's been one of the sticking issues that the studios have said that they -- you know, that has kind of stalled the contract negotiations.
