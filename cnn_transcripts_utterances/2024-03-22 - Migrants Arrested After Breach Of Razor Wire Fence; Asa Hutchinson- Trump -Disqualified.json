Hundreds of migrants were arrested by Border Patrol after a group rushed past razor wire and the National Guard. Now it is unclear what led to this incident.

And this happened just before noon yesterday in El Paso when what is described to us by Customs and Border Protection officials as a large group of my migrants.We've also been told it was several hundred people essentially pushed through this area where the Texas National Guard has set up razor wire and chain link fences along the northern edge of the Rio Grande there. Of course, this is, you know, one of these areas that has been the hotspot of the tension between Texas authorities and the Biden administration over how to enforce immigration enforcement along the border here. So that area where you're seeing those migrants bust through the razor wire there and overwhelm the National Guard soldiers, that is just on the northern edge of the river. So those migrants were already in U.S. territory. Then they ran toward the massive border wall that has been in place there for years. And that is where they were taken into custody. They turn themselves in to Border Patrol officials there. [08:35:17] So Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection officials say all of those migrants were taken into custody. They've been in the process of being processed through the immigration and documentation that they go through when they're taken into Border Patrol custody. That usually takes several days before many of these people are either allowed to request asylum and given papers to continue on into the U.S. Some of them we're told will be deported, hard to say with a group this large exactly what the overwhelming sense of the outcome will be in this particular situation, John?",

And here's how it breaks down. His campaign gets paid first, then the PAC that's funding his legal fees gets paid next. And then after that, the RNC then gets their share, third billing.Joining us right now to talk about this and much more as a former Republican governor and former Republican presidential candidate, Asa Hutchinson. Governor, thank you for coming in. The RNC being the third priority behind Donald Trump and his legal fees when it comes to donor dollars. Are you OK with that? ASA HUTCHINSON (R), FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: No, I'm not OK with it. The RNC represents all of the candidates that are running on the Republican ticket. They're raising money for all of the party operations. And now we see it funneled into entity that will help pay Donald Trump's legal fees. This is something I warned against some time ago. I think I'm glad it's being disclosed so people will know this. But this is why the RNC is short on cash is because people see it siphoned off to help Donald Trump in his legal fees.",

Regretfully, Donald Trump has redefined the GOP in his image and has put personal ego above the common good. He has made the GOP the party that likes Russian President Vladimir Putin over the freedom fighters in Ukraine. He's transfigured conservatism into isolationism, by abandoning NATO and U.S. leadership among the nations of the world. And you go on to say, these and more are not Republican principles.

But it's important battle this year, that we continue to fight for what we believe is important for our country and for our party. We're doomed to lose if we just simply become the Trump entity that's going to be following whatever latest craziness that he advocates. And that's a concern to me. That's why I'm raising my voice.

To this day, he continues to undermine our democracy by defending the actions of that dark day.We've talked a lot just in public about how some Republican leaders said very publicly, Mitch McConnell being one after January 6th, speaking out in breaking from Trump and then have since now said that they will endorse and support him.

Where do we go when we don't identify with the Democrat expanding and, you know, their big government philosophy? They want to be a Republican, but the leadership is saying, a redefining who the Republican Party is.That's troublesome to me.
