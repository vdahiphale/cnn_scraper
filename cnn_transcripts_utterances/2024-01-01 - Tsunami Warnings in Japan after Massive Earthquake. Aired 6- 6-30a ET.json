And this is significant, because with shallow earthquakes, they could potentially be more destructive and more powerful. And they could trigger massive tsunamis, essentially. We already know that a major tsunami warning has been issued in the city of Noto in Ishikawa prefecture, very close to the epicenter. This is the first major tsunami warning that's been issued since 2011, when 22,000 people were killed in an earthquake and subsequent tsunami, Max.",

We know that we're hearing some reports of people being injured in Ishikawa prefecture. We also know that 32,500 homes have lost power. We also know that bullet train lines have been suspended.

I mean, Japan of course, when it experienced the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, it was a devastating moment for the country.And really, there were a lot of lessons to be learned there. Of course, there were the issues with the Diichi nuclear power plants on the Eastern coast of Japan, but also just in terms of how buildings, how architecture could be more prepared for large earthquakes, large tsunamis, Max. And for this Western part of Japan, of course, the city of Noto, this is a seaport town. There are lot of fishermen. There are lots of people who enjoy the sea, who are close to the sea. So of course, there are lots of concerns about how to evacuate people to higher ground, what potential devastation could be caused in these regions, Max.",

Because of course, as you mentioned, lines have been down.But the Japanese government is trying to get information out to people. It's trying to confirm facts and details about who needs rescuing, about what potential damage is caused. Because as you mentioned, there are parts of Japan that are well- equipped to handle these earthquakes and tsunamis. But for smaller regional places like Ishikawa prefecture, specifically the area of Noto, we might be seeing potential damage to homes. You know, not all of these homes are built with concrete or with earthquake-prone material. Some of them are built with wood. And those materials can be more flexible and potentially fall more easily in the middle of an earthquake, Max.",

      "sentences": "Yes, Max that was the initial projections. And that's -- what they do is they base that off of available information from previous similar magnitude earthquakes at that depth. They calculate it all together and come out with an initial projection of a tsunami wave.So far we have only seen up to 1.2 meters or roughly 5 feet. Right? So that's important. And what else is important for people and viewers tuning in around the world as they wake up this morning on this first day of 2024 is that the tsunami threats and the threat of after-shocks has not yet waned. Remember, that tsunamis is -- they're not just one initial wave. They are a series of waves. And sometimes, the timing between the crest of the waves, that is from wave height to wave height, that can happen between 5 minutes to upwards of an hour or even longer. So the threat continues for the West Coast of Japan. The threat continues for portions of Russia and into the Korean Peninsula, as well. This is the latest warning now from the Japan meteorological agency. And we're focusing in on the Ishikawa prefecture, because it's that shading of purple. That is a major tsunami warning. They haven't issued one since the devastating tsunami that occurred in 2011. But nonetheless, there are warnings and advisories that span the entire Western coastline of Japan, as far North as Hokkaido. Remember, shaking was felt as far East as Tokyo. So the observed tsunami wave heights that we've seen so far, 1.2 meters, that is in the Ishikawa prefecture. And remember, these projections of how high these waves could become is all based on local topography. Because a tsunami wave is not equal in height. It's all dependent on the seabed, the plate symmetry (ph) across that shoreline, how the wave plays out. But bottom line is that the tectonic plates have shifted near the West Coast of Japan. And that caused a displacement in the ocean's water. And that has allowed for the tsunami wave to occur. And of course, the ongoing threat being that this is a series of waves that could impact the region and in fact, we could see some tsunami waves still into portions of the Korean Peninsula and Russia, as well -- Max.",

At least three strong aftershocks have been reported, as well.Let's get some insight on all of this from Dr. Mohammad Hazad -- Heidarzadeh, senior lecturer, the University of Bath, the secretary- general of the Joint Tsunami Commission of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, as well. Thank you so much for joining us. Because we are very concerned, obviously, about the tsunamis. They are -- there are warnings. We're actually seeing them hit the coast today in Japan of more than a meter. How do you read all of this? DR. MOHAMMAD HEIDARZADEH, SENIOR LECTURER, UNIVERSITY OF BATH: This is a very serious -- very serious incident. We have -- we are dealing with the 7.5 earthquake at the shallow death of only 10 kilometers. And this is a type of earthquake that is making a sizable tsunami, as you see the waves are coming to the coast. And so this is -- just reminds of the 1993 earthquake and tsunami -- basically tsunami in the same area. Because we have two, actually, areas in Japan, terrors (ph) of tsunami. We had the Pacific (ph) side, which was -- you know, we had  the one in 2011. And we also have the East side. We have the Sea of Japan. And this is happening in the Sea of Japan, a very close basin. And any tsunami in this basin can create long oscillations, long waves, big waves. And just reminds of the 1993 event, that the magnitude of the earthquake was 7.7, and that earthquake and tsunami killed more than 200 people.",

We are now in the East [SIC] side -- West side of Japan, in the Sea of Japan. And that's a very different setting and different situation. And sometimes any tsunami on this side of Japan can be more dangerous, because it's a very closed basin. And any tsunami can lead to long oscillations, like two days of oscillations and floodings. And as I said, we had a similar size incident around the same area in 1993. They refer to the Okushiri tsunami. And that even actually was one of the drivers of the Japan goal of working tsunami warning system for Japan.",

He said he's quite confident that they've got the wave walls, and they've got the underpinning to handle the earthquake. Are you concerned that they're not really considering the nature of the sea there and the size of the waves coming in and you are a bit more concerned about the energy infrastructure there that they aren't?",

And I was back many times.And the thing we learned from that incident is that the seawalls are not going to be making the coast very safe. The seawalls are maybe useful for storms. Sometimes, you know, they are not very useful. And they can be easily overtopped and overturned by tsunamis. Because tsunami waves are more energetic storms than high waves. So I would say I'm sure the Japanese government, they know that, that they have to have other plans, for example, especially for the nuclear program. They have to have plans for turning off the plant and other measures to ensure that the nuclear plants are exactly in the same place that we see on the screen there. The center, we have one nuclear plant there. And the news I have from Japan, is that nuclear plant was off this morning. And fortunately, it was off.",

Let's go to Hanako Montgomery in Tokyo. We were speaking to that expert a bit earlier on and saying that, you know, there's been a lot of experience with these earthquakes on the East coast. This is different because it's on the West Coast. And it's an enclosed sea. So we could see a much more unpredictable effect of these tsunamis.",

But for this earthquake that happened on the West Coast of Japan, as you mentioned, Max, you know, there are lots of concerns about incoming tsunami waves. Already, we have seen the Japanese government issue a major tsunami warning for the city of Noto in Ishikawa prefecture, very close to the epicenter. And this is the first time that the -- that Japan has issued this major tsunami warning since that 2011 earthquake and tsunami. So again, just lots of concerns about what could happen with the tsunami. CNN has confirmed that we're already seeing 1.2 meters of waves. During the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, we saw waves of up to 30 feet.

And on the West Coast of Japan, that quake was felt very, very powerfully. So immediately, people were told to evacuate their homes, leave their belongings in their homes, evacuate to higher ground. That is the first step often when trying to evacuate when there is a potential tsunami, Max. And again, this is a developing story. We're still waiting to hear just the extent of damage. But NHK, the Japanese public broadcaster, is reporting that six people are reported injured in Suzu City in Ishikawa prefecture. We also know that about 33,000 homes in Ishikawa prefecture, which is again close to the epicenter, have lost power. We're also hearing reports of damaged houses from fallen power lines. And also, we know that bullet train lines have been suspended. Reportedly, there have no -- there have been no damages to the nuclear power stations that are nearby the epicenter.
