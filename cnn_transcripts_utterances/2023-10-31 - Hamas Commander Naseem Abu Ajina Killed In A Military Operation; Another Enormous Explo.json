Calls for action as a rise in anti-Semitic attacks in the United States and around the world have many people in fear. Hello everyone, live from New York, I'm Bianna Golodryga. Zain is on assignment today. Welcome to \"One World\". A time for war, Israeli forces turning Benjamin Netanyahu's words into action, pushing deeper into Gaza on their fifth day of their ground operation and seemingly closing in on Gaza City. One day after the Israeli Prime Minister rejected calls for a ceasefire, the IDF says it struck more than 300 Hamas targets in Gaza overnight, including military compounds in underground tunnels. It comes as the head of the main U.N. agency operating in Gaza told the Security Council on Monday that the enclave's entire population is being dehumanized. And he warned that an intermediate humanitarian ceasefire has become a matter of life and death for millions. The Palestinian Authority's foreign minister, meanwhile, pleaded with the Council to intervene on behalf of the innocent civilians who are still trapped inside of Gaza. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RIYAD AL-MALIKI, PALESTINIAN FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER: Two point three million Palestinians in Gaza face death every day and every night. Save them. Save them.

Only hours after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel is going to resign Hamas to thedustpan of history, Israel defense forces launched a new offensive against the Islamist group striking approximately 300 targets. And those targets, Bianna, in Gaza, included military compounds inside underground tunnels, belonging to Hamas. And it's not only airstrikes were talking about. The Israeli military says that in the most recent ground operation, soldiers had what they called, several engagements with terrorist cells that fired both anti-tank missiles, and machine gun fire toward them. And according to the IDF, soldiers on the ground are also pinpointing Hamas positions to aircrafts, so that those warplanes strike their enemies' infrastructure. And Bianna, as part of the Israel's offensive over the past 24 hours, both the Israeli military and the country security agency now say that a Hamas commander, who directed the October 7th terrorist attacks has been killed. He was identified as Naseem Abu Ajina, a commander of Hamas brigade in northern Gaza who was also in charge of Hamas aerial array and helped develop UAVs and paragliders. And according to a joint statement, his elimination significantly harms the efforts of Hamas to disrupt the Israeli military's ground assault. Hamas has not confirmed the commander's death, but, Bianna, as you can imagine, this is very, very significant. Back to you.",

The residents say the situation elsewhere isn't much better. We've been following our CNN colleague, Ibrahim Dahman who is in southern Gaza with his family. He says they see airstrikes every night, and he says he is now teaching his children how to survive in case something happens to him. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) IBRAHIM DAHMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT, CNN JOURNALIST (voice-over with English translation): My family fled Northern Gaza but we still don't feel safe. What's wrong? Don't be afraid. Every night, airstrikes hit Khan Younis. With no sense of time, the days roll into one. We pass the time by watching airstrikes. There are too many to count. This used to be someone's home. Now, they have likely become one of the dead. Strangers volunteer to search for their remains. Food is scarce where we are staying. We cook and share whatever we can. We teach the children, too, so that if we are killed, they can feed themselves. The tanks are filled with impure water. We try to keep our spirits up. There is camaraderie in the chaos. The explosions became louder this weekend as Israel expanded its ground operation, leaving us in a blackout. Only Israeli phones worked so some tried to keep a sense of normalcy. All I could think of was my parents' safety and pray my family made it through the night. But even in a war zone, there is light in the darkness. My wife is three months pregnant.

      "sentences": "That's right, Bianna. And at one point the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, they bothagreed with the idea that a ceasefire would not come until Hamas no longer posed a threat to Israel. So, the through line of this hearing really has been the Secretaries underscoring how important it is for the supplemental bill, which the administration requested for over $100 billion in additional funding for Israel, Ukraine, as well as other issues be passed all at once, rather than be diverged as some in the House of Representatives -- House Republicans would like to see. The argument that they have been making is that these issues are inextricably linked particularly when it comes to the access of Iran and Russia. Secretary Blinken making the point that look, Russia is supplying Iran with increasingly sophisticated military technology in exchange for Iran's help on the battlefield in Ukraine. And that, in turn, is being used by Iran to target American forces in the region, as well as, to supply and support these Iranian proxy groups, including Hezbollah and Hamas, that pose such a big threat to Israel. So, their argument is that these are all interconnected, that they can't just play, quote, \"whack-a-mole\" with funding as Secretary Blinken said because adversaries -- the U.S. adversaries are watching this very closely. And if funding is separated in anyway, they say that that will pose not only a threat to the U.S.' ability to continue to supply Israel and Ukraine with appropriate munitions, equipment, as well as humanitarian aid, but it will also dip into, in effect, the U.S.' own military readiness, because it will affect the U.S.' ability to replenish its stockpiles that is currently dipping into to help support, of course, the U.S.' allies. And so, the through line in all of this has been to really solidify this support for the supplemental bill, but also, you know, the importance of Israel protecting civilians in Gaza and taking stock of the, you know, the massive number of casualties we have seen in the Gaza Strip. Secretary Austin reiterated that he has spoken to his counterpart multiple times about the need to get aid into Gaza, about the need to try to avoid civilian deaths. So, we will see how this plays out on the Hill in the coming days. It is likely to be, still, even after this hearing, a very contentious process between the House of Representatives and the Senate to get this bill passed. Bianna.",

But what we do know, again, from our own news gathering, is that images from the site show multiple large craters on the ground. What we do understand, again, this is from Hamas-controlled Gaza. Palestinian officials reporting that 20 homes -- 20 homes were completely destroyed. Right now, there are attempts to pull people out from under the rubble. You have to remember, that comms are limited, ambulance services, emergency workers are all stretched. So, oftentimes, what you're going to see at these scenes is the survivors of the blast. We'll be trying to pull out people from the rubble. We're already hearing from doctors on the ground of some horrifying injuries, allegations that families, people have been leveled, basically crushed by their homes in this explosion. I'm going to read you just a little bit from what the director of the Indonesian hospital, this is a hospital nearby. He says, \"What we are seeing is a scene no one can imagine.\" Again, this is a doctor nearby near the scene treating people, injured martyrs, charred bodies. This is one of the largest neighborhoods, most densely populated neighborhoods in the north of Gaza. Again, it's right up near that border with Israel, an area that has received heavy bombardment, heavy artillery strikes in the last few days, but those have obviously only intensified as the ground offensive has started. So again, this is very much a breaking news story. We are getting more information now as we can on the ground. We are speaking to doctors and Palestinian officials inside Hamas-controlled Gaza. We are reaching out to the Israeli military as well, but preliminary reports here of many, many people killed, 20 homes potentially leveled and the families inside their fate very much uncertain as people try to pull survivors out from under the rubble.",

And Ithink the description that you put on the way that the IDF is deploying its forces is quite accurate. This war that has been imposed in Israel almost four weeks ago, put the IDF in a very difficult situation, clearly we're in total surprise, and there was time needed to recreate the plan so that it will be effective and relevant for the traps that's clearly Hamas has put up for our soldiers. And also to plan a way where we can be effective while not breaking all of the rules. I've heard the item just before that was put there. Of course, I have no details about the blast in Northern Gaza but you've seen from the outset that the IDF has clearly delivered this message that we need to operate against Hamas. We want the area to be clear so that we can operate with as few casualties as possible. And I think you see that also in the way that the IDF has conducted its operation, moving very slowly, not falling into traps, but also trying to avoid, to the extent we can, damage to, you know, enforcing casualties on civilian population in Gaza. This is very difficult when Hamas is using them as human shields all the time, any step of the way. But this is clearly -- that we were operating.",

The hostages issue is an open wound in Israel society. We need to understand, I'm sure the audience can understand they've seen the pictures of babies and elderly snatched from their homes into Gaza and we need to have them all back, all of them back. And there's another thing, Bianna, that we need to take care for looking into the future. We need to restore security, but also sense of security to our own population. Two hundred thousand people, Israelis, have evacuated their homes from the surrounding area of Gaza because they believe, first of all, now it's a war zone. But also in the future, how safe can they continue to live in their own homes and protect their children when gunmen are in harm's way, just minutes of walking from the fence after they've unfortunately been able to demonstrate. They can break holes, multiple holes in the offences and infiltrate our communities in such barbaric action.

A family of nine people, including two children,both under the age of 10, were found shot dead inside their home in Volnavaha, which is in Russian-occupied eastern Ukraine. It was taken by Russia early on in its full-scale invasion. Images released by Ukraine show that multiple people had been shot in their bed, some still cuddled up to each other. We're only showing one of the photos. This is the least gruesome of the pictures released. Exactly what happened is far from clear, but according to Ukrainian prosecutors, soldiers arrived and demanded that the family leave so that their home could instead be used to house Russian troops. The family said no, but the gunmen came back days later and shot all nine while they were asleep. Local officials on the Russian side said that two Russian soldiers were arrested and said the initial assessment shows that the murder motive was a domestic conflict both Russia and Ukraine are now investigating.
