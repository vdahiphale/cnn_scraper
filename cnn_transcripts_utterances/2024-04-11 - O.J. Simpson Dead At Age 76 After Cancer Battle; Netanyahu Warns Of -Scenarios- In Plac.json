Simpson has died at the age of 76.We'll look back on the complicated legacy of the former American football star who was controversially acquitted for double murder. Then fears of a wider conflict in the Middle East that Benjamin Netanyahu issues a new warning, saying his government is preparing for scenarios in other locations. Plus, an increasingly desperate situation inside Ukraine as Russia launches a major attack on the country's power plants. I speak to Poland's Foreign Minister who calls these strikes a war crime. We'll begin tonight though with the death of a one-time American hero whose life included a spectacular rise to fame and an equally spectacular fall from grace. Legendary American football star O.J. Simpson has died at the age of 76 after battle with cancer. Simpson was a star athlete, actor, as well as a broadcaster. But he went from being a pop culture icon to the most famous murder defendant in history after, of course, the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. And although he was acquitted in the trial that became a national obsession, Simpson became a pariah to many who still believed he was responsible for the murders. Here's CNN's Stephanie Elam now on the life of O.J. Simpson. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) STEPHANIE ELAM, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  O.J. Simpson's soar to fame as number 32 for the Buffalo Bills --",

And it was a fact that he had personal memorabilia trophies and pictures, and they were rightly owned by someone else, but he and his cronies decided that they were going to figure out how they could storm this hotel room in Las Vegas to get them back. So, two of his cronies actually had guns on them. We don't know -- I don't think O.J. necessarily knew that at all, but they went to the room, found the items, found the rightful owners, wouldn't let them out of the room. So, the charges were really justified here, but yet, everyone looked upon him still as a celebrity when I was at the courthouse for the preliminary hearing, it was so strange. It was like it was a red carpet premier. And that's not the fact, this was a preliminary hearing in a felony case, and then when we got to the trial, O.J. was out on bail at that point, and he was very personable. He was so nice to everybody, he would just be in the hallway during breaks, he would talk to people in the gallery, anybody. Sometimes he would just sort of stand around because he'd finished talking to everybody. But I remember meeting him and I'm from California, I'm a graduate of USC, and so he loved that. He just loved that he found someone that had that USC, those USC roots and just talking like crazy, very personable. His sisters were there for that entire trial, never saw his kids. But his two older sisters, one is deceased now, they were just sort of -- stood there on the sideline, nobody really knew who they were, but they were there, and I spoke to them, very kind people.

But the issue with the Goldmans this whole time is justice. There was a civil trial after the criminal trial, there was a civil verdict that he was liable for the wrongful deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, but collecting the monies that they were due was extremely difficult. And I've spoken with David Cook, that attorney for years, and it was difficult for them to get it because he tied it up. There were pensions and then once he moved to Florida, there were real estate holdings that you really couldn't touch. But if you remember that book that came out, \"If I Did It\" by O.J. Simpson. Well, the Goldmans got the right to that book, and it was republished as \"I Did It\", and that book got on the bestsellers list, and that's how the family got some of the justice, the monetary justice, which is all they could get at that point with that civil verdict.",

So, when this happened, it was a changing that was seismic for his life. And I think it's really important to say that O.J. Simpson didn't really see himself as a black-man. The more famous he got, he thought he was, you know, trans-racial, that he was passed that. Once this court case came down to the end, he realized that, that was not the case. So, there were a lot of black people in America who didn't really care what happened to O.J. Simpson or whether he did it or not. But what you did see is that when the verdict was read after the stress and tension  that was building in Los Angeles in the '90s, they were just happy to see that the system could work for a black person. So, you saw a lot of people cheering in that way, and just to put this into context, Isa, you have to keep in mind that in '91 was the Rodney King beating that was caught on camera with a camcorder, and it showed those four white officers beating that black man. Shortly thereafter, there's the trial, they're acquitted. And three of them are acquitted for using excessive force that leads to the Los Angeles riots, and the city burned for a few days there. All of this tension because black people in the city felt like they were being over- policed and that things -- that there wasn't equity. Shortly thereafter in '94, you have this murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, and then you have O.J. Simpson's trial. So, you kind of look at what happened with O.J. Simpson's trial in Los Angeles through the lens of what was going on that entire decade.

The infamous white Bronco chase, as you know, sparked one of the most watched events in TV history. On June 17, 1994, around 95 million people watched the chase unfold, making it an iconic moment for '90s pop culture. Decades later, FX premiered a 10-part series dramatizing the case of the century. Bringing the discussion of Simpson's legacy to a new generation. Meanwhile, before the infamous murder trial, O.J. Simpson was a beloved sports icon. Let's get some context on this. Christine Brennan joins me now. And Christine, great to see you. Look, to this day, I think it's fair to say that O.J. Simpson's name really spurs strong feelings from a lot of people. Before we just focus on the sporting perspective and the sporting appeal, how will he be remembered?",

But, yes, I mean, it really was reality TV before there was reality TV. We had had Tonya and Nancy in the Olympics, the figure skating drama, January and February of 1994, and then June of 1994. Just a few months later came this story. And it certainly was a must-see television, and it spawned an entire series of -- with the TV ratings, you know, of reality TV and shows and things about the networks had never done before. And so, there was that. And riveting moment for sure. And of course, the trial itself as well. So, yes.
