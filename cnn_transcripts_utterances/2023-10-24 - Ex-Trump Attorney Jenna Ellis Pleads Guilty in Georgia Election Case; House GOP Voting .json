And Jenna Ellis today, last week, Ken Cheseboro and Sidney Powell, all three of them pleading, they were three of those who provided that defective legal theory. Today's plea is important because Ms. Ellis really spoke to the false facts that underlie the assault. So, I think it's a significant milestone as we continue to seek accountability for the events of the 2020 election.",

It was not scheduled by Judge McAfee. And I sat directly behind Jenna Ellis, and she had some really range of emotions. It was interesting because as she was being read, you know, the accusations against her which she was pleading guilty, it seemed as though she had a smirk with every -- it seemed as though she had a smirk while she was hearing those charges against her. And then in a very striking moment, in an unprecedented moment so far in this trial, she stood up and addressed the court. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

I endeavored to represent my client to the best of my ability. I relied on others, including lawyers with many more years of experience than I, to provide me with true and reliable information, especially since my role involved speaking to the media and to legislators in various states.What I did not do, but should have done, your Honor, was to make sure that the facts the other lawyers alleged to be true were in fact true. In the frenetic pace of attempting to raise challenges to the election in several states, including Georgia, I failed to do my due diligence. I believe in and I value election integrity. If I knew then what I know now, I would have declined to represent Donald Trump in these post-election challenges. I look back on this whole experience with deep remorse. For those failures of mine, your Honor, I have taken responsibility already before the Colorado bar who censured me, and I now take responsibility before this court and apologize to the people of Georgia. Thank you. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

She's going to do 100 hours of community service and $5,000 fine, but perhaps most importantly, as with the case in other plea deals, she's going to have to testify against the remaining co-defendants in other future proceedings and trials related to this case.

You would think it does increase the legal jeopardy, for sure, now the fourth of the co-defendants in the Fulton County case to enter into a plea agreement.Jess, stand by for one minute. I want to bring back Ambassador Norm Eisen here. Norm, as we said, four co-defendants have now entered into plea deals. She, Jenna Ellis, agreed to plead guilty to one count of aiding and abetting false statements in writing, again, this has to do with statements she made, alongside Rudy Giuliani in a Georgia hearing in December of 2020. None of the co-defendants has pleaded guilty to the RICO or racketeering charge yet, though. So, how do any, or do they, any of these guilty pleas, perhaps impact that, which is maybe the bigger of all the charges here? EISEN:  John, they enable prosecutors -- the guilty pleas do -- they enable prosecutors to prove up the Rico charges against the most senior individuals who have been charged, of course, Mr. Giuliani and above all, the former president. And that works in a variety of ways. You need to prove two predicate acts, two of the enumerated criminal acts under that RICO statute as one of the elements of proof, for example. Well, now you're going have Mr. Cheseboro, Ms. Powell, Jenna Ellis come in, and that streamlines the proof. Five months had been set aside for the Cheseboro trial, Cheseboro and Powell trial, because of that painstaking process. Now, it can move much more quickly. And when you look at Ms. Ellis' tearful presentation, admitting that these falsehoods that Donald Trump still continues to push on the campaign trail were lies that she was misled, that's going to be very powerful for a jury, to his defense stands on two legs in Georgia and federally, John. One is that he actually won the election and the other is that's the factual predicate and the other is the legal argument. Therefore, I had the right to challenge it in the way that I did. Well, Ms. Ellis, Ms. Powell, they were purveyors of those falsehoods about him winning. They've backed down, they've pled guilty. Mr. Cheseboro was a main architect of the legal theory. He's backed down. So, it pulls the rug out from under Donald Trump's defense. This is very, very ominous for him as a state and federal criminal defendant, same for Giuliani.",

Nothing can be acted upon until the speaker of the House is elected. And today, they're trying to nominate someone who would need to get a majority of the vote in the conference to get nominated. Then a majority of the House vote, a much higher threshold, 217, to be elected speaker. Unclear if that can happen. But in talking to a number of the Republicans over the last day, it is very clear, they are getting an earful from their constituents back home and they are concerned that this fallout could cost them the Republican majority.

Steve Scalise, the House majority leader, and Jim Jordan, the House Judiciary Committee chairman, experienced themselves when being nominated over the last three weeks to be the next speaker but unable to get the votes in the House amid a rebellion in the ranks.Right now, there's going to be a lot of focus in this vote that's happening on Tom Emmer the House Republican whip. Emmer is considered the front runner for the Republican nomination. How close does he get the 217 votes on this first ballot? And if he does not, what happens next? If nobody gets a majority on this vote with the seven candidates, they will keep voting until somebody gets the majority, the lowest candidate will drop off until they get to that point. So, it could be several hours until we know who the Republican nominee is. And the question is, how close they are to that 217 number threshold. And I can tell you, Kate, in talking to some conservative members, some hardliners, part of that House Freedom Caucus, some of them are concerned about Emmer's voting record on spending issues. So, that could be an issue for him in the days ahead if he does get the nomination. But any of these other candidates also have their own issues within the ranks. So, so many questions here about whether the House can actually move out of this state of paralysis, Kate.",

She pleaded guilty to the aiding and abetting of making false statements in writing. She is now the fourth person in this wide-ranging Fulton County case to enter into a plea deal with prosecutors.While that's going on, in Washington, D.C., there is currently behind closed doors. Republicans are meeting once again to try to nominate a House speaker. Two people have now dropped out of the race, Congressman Dan Meuser and Congressman Gary Palmer. That leaves seven remaining candidates. One of these people hopes to emerge in the next several hours to be the Republican choice to be speaker, whether they can win on the House floor, that's a whole other thing. With us now, CNN Senior Political Commentator and former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger and CNN Political Commentator S.E. Cupp. And, Congressman, I do want to start with you very quickly on Jenna Ellis. This is another plea deal. In this case, Jenna Ellis pleaded guilty to the aiding and abetting of making false statements in a hearing alongside Rudy Giuliani. You were so central in the House January 6th subcommittee, investigation there. I just want your reaction now that four people have pleaded guilty before our eyes in this case.",

You've had these two people drop out, but of the remaining, only Tom Emmer right here and also Austin Scott voted to certify the election in 2020. So, these are the only two people who said the election was legit and it's seen in Republican circles, S.E., as a knock against them.S.E. CUPP, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Yes. And I think most people at home are hearing Tom Emmer and Austin Scott and thinking who and who? You know, these are not well-known public-facing members of Congress and that's probably because they've kept their heads down and were not among the more vocal election deniers that we're parading around in the Republican Party. So, whether they have a shot, I mean, this is a huge question and there's multiple layers here that are going into it. Yes, there's the policies that these guys represent. Can that get enough votes? Then there's the consensus. Will they be able to form a consensus not just inside the Republican Party, but across the aisle if that's still important? And, finally, this doesn't get mentioned a lot, but it's important that the Republican speaker of the House would be able to fundraise, and for two people you've probably never heard of, that's going to be a heavy lift. You know, Republicans still want a speaker that can help raise money for Republicans. I'm not sure Tom Emmer and Austin Scott, you know, have the name I.D. to really do that in the way that Kevin McCarthy definitely did. BERMAN:  Congressman, I am curious. Were you in that conference room right now, and not so long ago, I mean, we're talking months at this point, you would have been, would Tom Emmer be someone you could get behind?",

Yes, to an extent, like knowing what I know now and if I was in a position where I had to pick one of the candidates running for speaker, one of the things I'd want to guarantee is that he was going to put Ukraine aid on the floor for a vote. That's important. He did vote to certify the election. But, you know, I'm just even seeing a tweet today from Matt Gaetz that said, all the speaker candidates have committed to releasing all the January 6th footage.Well, okay, so two things. First off, you it's been released to a guy named Tucker Carlson, who basically went really quiet after he got it, which means it doesn't prove his point. But it's going to show again that the demands of these people, like Matt Gaetz, first off, are being met, which is frightening. But, secondly, their demands are still this obsession around January 6th. I mean, the number of them that told us, you know, Liz and I, to move on from January 6, but yet they're still talking about it, it's amazing to me. So, yes, I guess if I was there knowing what I know now, I would probably vote for Tom Emmer or somebody like an Austin Scott. I think if they failed to reach the level, I would see myself being one of the crazy eight that just would refuse to vote for anybody else because I couldn't imagine voting for somebody that is running for the third, you know, second in line to be to be president of the United States, still refusing to tell the American people the truth, which is Donald Trump lost.
