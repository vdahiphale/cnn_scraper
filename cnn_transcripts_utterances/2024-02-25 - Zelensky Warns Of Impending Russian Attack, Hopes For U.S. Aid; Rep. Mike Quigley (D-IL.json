But her coalition is plenty big enough to cause all sorts of headaches for him in the general election if he can't corral it. And what we've seen is some pretty consistent patterns. He's only won about 40 percent of the vote among independents in each of the first three states. He's lost college graduates in the last two states, even while winning convincingly. And consistently now in that AP vote cast study, 60 percent or more of Haley voters are saying they won't vote for him in a general election. She's making a stronger case against him by far than she was at any point through New Hampshire. So, you know, I think she got it about right in her speech last night. Her coalition is not 50 percent. It's not a majority, but it's not nothing either. And as long as she has the money and the money seems to be coming in, she appears to be determined to make this stronger case against Trump that she failed to make in '23 when she had the platform of those debates and even failed to make in Iowa and New Hampshire when she had concentrated on national media attention.",

The other positive effect of the money is she's not paying millions of dollars with illegal fees to keep herself out of jail like Donald Trump is. And then, of course, the age-related issues, right, between Joe Biden and Donald Trump. I mean, these folks are really up there in years, right? That's being as nice as I can be on a Sunday afternoon. Companies have contingency plans for people their age. And then the reality is, as a Republican, Donald Trump cannot beat Joe Biden. He's literally the only Republican with a heartbeat that cannot beat Joe Biden and wouldn't be 20 points in front of him right now. And we continue to go through this exercise over and over again as Republicans across the country. And just look to the last few election cycles. Look no further than Hershel Walker here in Georgia.

It hasn't been increasing yet, even though economic optimism is growing. And that's a pretty ominous divergence.But probably the best news for Democrats this spring is the continued evidence of this fracture in the Republican coalition. You know, Donald Trump is the dominant figure in the Republican Party, but he is a quasi-incumbent president. And consistently, we are seeing somewhere around 40 percent of the vote saying no. And as I mentioned, losing independence, losing college graduates in the last two states and at least 60 percent of Haley voters in the AP VoteCast study in all three states saying they would not vote for him in the general election. Roughly 80 percent of Haley voters in the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for CNN and others say they will not vote for him if he is convicted of a crime. Not all of those voters in the end will abandon Trump. Many of them will go back to the Republican nominee because they are loyal Republicans and they are really down on Biden's performance. But Biden doesn't need all of them to abandon Trump. This is a closely divided country, and this is a signal to Republicans that they are taking a general election risk by renominating Trump, even though he is the dominant figure in their party, because the evidence is just very consistent from state to state. By the way, she may not match these numbers in the Super Tuesday state. I mean, she had a lot of time and money to campaign in New Hampshire and South Carolina. It may not be as broad a coalition, but it is a real coalition. It's a consistent coalition and it's consistent with where Trump has had trouble in the past, white collar and suburban voters.",

We felt loss for the future potential children that we were trying to have.I think a lot of people hear that embryos are going to be protected in Alabama, and they rejoice in that.

That is according to White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. And though a final deal is still days away at the earliest, Sullivan says representatives from Israel, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have come to what he calls an understanding. This morning, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke about talks with Hamas. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Whereas earlier in the week, we started -- things really appear to be at a standstill between Israel and Hamas. Both sides very much hardened in their positions.But now, after Israeli negotiators returned from this key summit in Paris on Friday, they seem to have returned, bringing a guarded sense of optimism. We've heard from both Israeli and American officials indicating that progress is being made in the talks. Tzachi Hanegbi, Israel's national security advisor, saying that those negotiators who were in those meetings on Friday did not feel like they came back to Israel empty handed and that it would perhaps be possible to move forward towards a deal. We also heard from Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security advisor, today saying that the negotiators in Paris had reached a -- quote -- \"understanding on the contours of a potential deal.\" And what else that we know is that tomorrow, an Israeli delegation is set to travel to Doha, Qatar to continue those negotiations. So, there is certainly a sense that progress is being made. There is certainly a sense of momentum. How close that actually brings us to achieving a deal is another question altogether. But we do know that time is certainly of the essence. We are about two weeks away from the start of Ramadan and Israeli government officials have indicated that if there is not a deal before then, that the Israeli military will move forward with this major ground offensive into that city where we know that there are one and a half million Palestinians currently living there. And so far, we haven't heard any details about exactly how the Israeli government intends to evacuate them before moving forward with an offensive, something that U.S. officials have been very clear needs to happen if that offensive is to move forward. What we do know, though, is that the Israeli prime minister, even as he is engaging in these negotiations, even as he is indicating that perhaps a deal could be made, he is preparing for that offensive, reviewing plans drafted by the Israeli military for that civilian evacuation, but also critically for that major military offensive into what he has described as Hamas's last bastion.
