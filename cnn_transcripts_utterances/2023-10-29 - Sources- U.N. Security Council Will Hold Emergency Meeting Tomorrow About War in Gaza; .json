Jim, we'll get to you in a moment.We begin in Gaza where Israeli troops continue to advance as officials say the second stage of their war with Hamas has begun. Moments ago, we learned that President Joe Biden spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Their conversation comes as U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned that there is an elevated risk of the conflict expanding across the region. The IDF said its air strikes hit more than 450 Hamas targets in just the last day including command centers, observation posts and missile launch sites. Sources tell CNN that one of those strike hit this mosque, killing 13 people and leaving dozens of others injured. New video from inside Gaza published by an Israeli newspaper shows IDF soldiers raising Israel's flag on a hotel roof. CNN has asked the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the video. An analysis by CNN shows that Israeli troops have now advanced at least two miles into northern Gaza. Desperation is sinking in for the civilians still trapped in the enclave. The main U.N. agency in Gaza says thousands of people broke into some of its warehouses stealing critical supplies as the Israeli bombardment continues. Meanwhile, more aid is trickling into Gaza. Today ten aid trucks were able to pass through the Rafah border crossing and communications in Gaza have been partially restored. Sources tell CNN the U.N. Security Council will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow about Israel's ongoing ground invasion. Let's send it over to Jim Sciutto on the ground in northern Israel, Jim.",

But the concern, and this speaks to national security adviser Jake Sullivan's point, is about expansion of this conflict, escalation.And one focus of that concern is Israel's northern border with Lebanon. We've been there the last several days. And what's going on is what one could describe as a low-level conflict already. There's artillery fire in both directions, there have been attempted incursions on the ground by Hezbollah fighters. Earlier today, myself and my team, we found ourselves right in the middle of that exchange of artillery fire. Israeli forces firing into Lebanon, Hezbollah and other Lebanese forces firing into Israel in a number of ways with mortars, with artillery, also with bombs attached to the bottom of small parachutes, IEDs coming in from the air. It speaks to the danger up here and it's one of the reasons many of the communities along the border have been evacuated for the safety of residents there. Of course though, that mass of Israeli military activity remains inside Gaza. And aur Jeremy Diamond, he is in Ashkelon just north of Gaza where he's been keeping a close eye on Israeli IDF military operations there. We don't have a lot of vision into the exact extent of those operations, Jeremy, but what did we learn today about how far Israeli forces are moving in?",

And last night we heard from the Israeli prime minister as well as the other members of this emergency war cabinet -- the defense minister Yoav Gallant and Benny Gantz, the former defense minister and a former member of the opposition. And in a united front, they really described this war in existential terms saying that it is Israel's second independence war and making clear how they view the stakes, and also making clear that this will be a long and drawn-out campaign inside of Gaza. At the same time, as you have been reporting on today, Jim, we have been watching activity in northern Israel and in southern Lebanon really beginning to pick up. Shelling in both directions and the Israeli air force saying that they struck Hezbollah sites in southern Lebanon from the air. Now, this is a tinder box situation as you well know, and all eyes right now are on the north to see whether or not that develops into a really substantial and full second front in this war.",

Jomana Karadsheh in Beirut, thanks so much.Joining me now, former retired major general Dana Pittard to speak to some of the military aspects of this ongoing conflict. Thanks so much for joining us this Sunday afternoon. I want to ask you first because there is some precedent in U.S., recent U.S. military history for large urban warfare operations in effect. We saw that in Fallujah, we saw it in Mosul. In each of those cases there were corridors that allowed civilians to -- or most civilians -- many civilians to leave before the bulk of the military action. This is a different circumstance here because the civilians blocked even at the Egyptian border from coming out. They can't come out via the Israeli border. What's to be done from a military perspective to prevent further civilian casualties, or to minimize those casualties? MAJ. GEN. DANA PITTARD (RET), U.S. ARMY: Well, good evening, Jim. You're right. In Mosul operations that took place there against ISIS, there were some limited humanitarian corridors. But ISIS was exactly allowing them to leave in droves, but the humanitarian corridors were, in fact, there. It is a dilemma. And ideally between Israel, the United States, the rest of the world working with Egypt and getting Egypt to open up the Rafah crossing point, that would be very, very helpful so the United Nations can provide -- and other entities can provide aid to civilians that are moving from the north to the south of Gaza and into Egypt.",

The intelligence operations to try to find the hostages and other things that are of value to Hamas, the cyberattacks, we've seen that. We've seen a number of those. And then the preparation for the ground invasion which was very deliberate. A couple of raids, clearing the routes, clearing ambush -- potential ambush sites by Hamas. But this is going to be a long campaign. The stated objective of Israel and Israel's defense forces is to destroy Hamas. Hamas must be eliminated as a terrorist organization. That will take time.",

Now, Perry's family released a statement to \"People Magazine\" saying that they were heartbroken for the tragic loss of their beloved son and brother. They went on to say in this statement that he brought joy to the world as an actor but also as a friend. Matthew Perry wanted to be remembered as someone who helped people. And it's part of the reason why he shared a lot of his struggles with addiction, why he shared a lot of it in his memoir that was released in 2022. He said he wanted to help people whether it be one-on-one or as a group. He also said that he wanted to be remembered as someone who lived well, loved well and who was a seeker.

That means from the beginning in season 1 which debuted in 1994, that he was struggling with addiction.We know that the opioid epidemic is a huge problem in America and Matthew Perry was part of that. He really wrote about it candidly and beautifully and wanted to help others, but this was a serious, serious issue for him to say the least. He wrote that at one point he was having 55 pills per day. He had been to rehab more than ten times, spent more than $9 million on his road to recovery. He has had a brush with death not just once, but twice. He said that when he was in rehab once his heart stopped. He also had his colon rupture about five years ago and was in a coma and hospitalized for months. So this is a man who has been through it all. And I was watching when Billy Bush gave that interview to you last night. And I know Billy and I do agree with a lot of what he said. However, I think what is so shocking about this is that it seemed that Matthew Perry had just turned a new leaf, right. This was a year ago that he came out with this memoir, it seemed like he was on the road to having a new chapter. And I hope that he is at peace. And I know everybody in Hollywood feels that way.

I was perhaps slightly surprised this time yesterday when we had a really sort of fulsome conversation with the adviser to the prime minister here who still felt very optimistic that not only were those talks ongoing, but they would get to the point where we would see the release of some, perhaps not all, but some of the civilian hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza.Look, I think there's a kind of step back and have a look at the wider story here. Israel's ground invasion which started -- the second phase of which started on Friday in Gaza, has been roundly condemned, here, in Turkey, in the UAE, in Saudi Arabia, in Egypt, around this region. There are real concerns about all civilians caught up in this humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. That, of course, includes those who have been held hostage in Gaza, not just by Hamas, but by other groups as well. And there was real concern that this conflict could spill outside of what is going on in Gaza which is a catastrophe and out to the wider region. There's two issues here. Firstly, as far as these Qatar-led mediated talks are concerned, yes, they are ongoing. Yes, there is still optimism here in Qatar, that that they will land in a good place and get these talks across the line. We do know some of the parameters. We're looking at possibly an exchange of women and children being held by Hamas for women and teenagers being held in Israeli prisons. This also has parameters around a pause in the fighting and additional aid to be allowed through that Rafah border crossing. And I think the pause, which was one of the parameters has been one of the real concerns since Friday because the Israelis said it out loud. I mean, Benjamin Netanyahu said it in his press conference yesterday, they have upped the stakes as far as this military action is concerned because Israel believes that only by upping the stakes will they get the hostages from Hamas. I have to say, that is not necessarily the perception from those I'm speaking to who are involved in these negotiations. They say it's just making them so much harder. And then, of course, UAE calling for an emergency meeting at the U.N. Security Council tomorrow. They really want to see the Security Council come together and reflect in a resolution what was agreed at the General Assembly on Friday which is for a sustained, durable cease-fire in Gaza to address the humanitarian situation and the issue of spillage going forward -- Jim.",

He's still likely to testify before some of the court cases, specifically the January 6th case that is in Washington in federal court. So we certainly have not heard the last from Mike Pence. But in terms of being a candidate or endorsing someone specifically, I'm told at least for the moment he doesn't plan to do that -- Fred.",

We'll see how the court cases progress. But, Fred, you're right, add that to the long list of court cases that are standing in the way of Donald Trump, yet he continues to hold a very commanding lead in this Republican primary campaign that, of course, is beginning in less than three months' time here in Iowa -- Fred.",
