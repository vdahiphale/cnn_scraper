New legal trouble for Donald Trump, E. Jean Carroll seeking more damage is in the form of more money above and beyond the first $5 million because of what Donald Trump said in the CNN town hall. And then there's the case of all those classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago. Apparently Donald Trump's attorney took highly detailed notes about them, notes that are now in the hands of the special counsel. Our panel dives into what those reveal. Plus, Senator Tim Scott wants to be president. Will he break with Donald Trump or will Trump tried to make Scott his running mate? And this image exploded on Twitter this morning. It sent shockwaves through the stock market, but it's fake. There was no explosion near the Pentagon. The real world danger of artificial intelligence is not a distant worry, it's already here. But let's begin with new legal trouble for Donald Trump. E. Jean Carroll's attorney today added this statement to their legal complaint, quote, Trump, undeterred by the jury's verdict, persisted in maliciously defaming Carroll yet again. She was talking about this moment in the CNN town hall. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

At that point, no one is safe.And so I just think that we should tread lightly here. Yes, we should be vigorous in our pursuit of the truth and trying to figure out exactly what transpired here.
