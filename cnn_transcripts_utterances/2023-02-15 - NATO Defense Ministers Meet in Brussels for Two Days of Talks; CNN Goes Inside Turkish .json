Haley is the Former Governor of South Carolina and Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.

First up, the NATO Secretary General says alliance members need to ramp up their production of ammunitions even further to help Ukraine. Jens Stoltenberg earlier welcomed new pledges by allies, which include more heavy weapons and military training as comments come after NATO Defense Ministers met in Brussels for two days of talks. The NATO Chief says Ukraine has a window of opportunity to tip the balance in the war and time he said is of the essence. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That means realistically, doesn't it more U.S. defense spending likely is that possible? JULIANNE SMITH, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO NATO: Well, I think what we saw over the last two days is not just the United States but all of the NATO allies came together here at NATO Headquarters and pledged additional forms of assistance. We were able to convene the 50 plus countries that are already providing assistance. And they came to that meeting ready to do even more.

And that's not happening at NATO. I'm here, meeting with NATO allies each and every day. And I don't see any change in the level of resolve that you see across this alliance. Of course, we debate things, we have different perspectives. Unity takes work to maintain. But that's the strength of the alliance, when we come to a common position we're able to then affect regional and broader global security in a way that counts. In terms of where this ends, it's hard to predict. We know one person who could end it today that's President Putin. And we will do everything we can to continue to apply pressure on Moscow to affect his strategic calculus. But I think you're right that many allies in the United States expect some sort of negotiation at some point. But right now, we are very focused on getting everything the Ukrainian military forces need getting all of those capabilities in their hands, and completing as much training as possible so that they're ready for this spring offensive that we expect to see in the weeks and months ahead.",

They're going to continue to send strong signals to industry to turn on production lines where necessary.

They've participated in NATO missions over the years. And they represent the values that we all hold dear so they could join tomorrow. We are, as you noted, waiting for two countries to ratify what we call the accession protocols. This is a process we have to go through. What's been remarkable is the speed with which 28 other allies have gone forward with the ratification process. So we will continue to encourage Finland and Sweden to meet with Turkey specifically when they can obviously the earthquake is all consuming right now. But we want to continue to see those three countries come together and address some of the concerns that Turkey has raised. And Hungary hopefully in the coming weeks will be in a position where it's ready to complete the ratification process.

Just in the last fewhours, Turkish state media has reported that a woman and two other children were pulled from the rubble in Antakya 228 hours after the earthquake struck. And across Southeast Turkey there are search and rescue teams still working around the clock in the hope of finding survivors. Thousands of people of course, waiting for news of their loved ones were still missing, presumed trapped under the rubble. But the window for finding survivors is closing and this is quickly becoming more of a recovery effort, as survivors start to come to terms with the sheer scale of the devastation. Here in Istanbul, we're already beginning to see families impacted by the earthquake being evacuated to the city. Some are being hosted in university dorms, for example, while others are being hosted by generous volunteers. Now there really has been a huge outpouring of support across the country. And in this city we've seen humanitarian aid center has been set up to help distribute donations to those most in need. The Turkish government, meanwhile, has a significant challenge ahead. More than 50,000 buildings have been deemed unsafe by authorities and now require immediate demolition. According to the authorities, more than 7000 personnel are currently working on assessing the damage caused by the earthquake with nearly 400,000 buildings already examined so far. And then there is the question of accountability. There is a growing sense of frustration and even anger here in Turkey, with many now questioning whether enough was done by the government to prepare for a catastrophe of this scale. Now the government says it has committed to rebuilding parts of the country impacted within a year and there's already an investigation into allegations of construction negligence. Turkey's Justice Ministry says it has already identified more than 100 potential suspects, with several people already arrested. But as the death toll continues to climb, we could still see further backlash against President Erdogan's government to come. Nada Bashir CNN, Istanbul.",
