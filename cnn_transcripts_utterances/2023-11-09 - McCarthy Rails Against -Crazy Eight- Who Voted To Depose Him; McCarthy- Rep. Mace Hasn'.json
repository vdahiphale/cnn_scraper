One, Tim Burchett of Tennessee. He was surprised by his vote to oust him. But he also said that Nancy Mace, someone who hails from a competitive district in South Carolina, he said that she does not deserve to be reelected. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

LEIGH ANN CALDWELL, EARLY 202 CO-AUTHOR, THE WASHINGTON POST: Right, whether it's a public involvement or a very private behind the scenes involvement. Because we know that that happens too where it's not so obvious of the things being done. But, look, Kevin McCarthy is still angry. He did not go quietly. Even when they were still -- when they were in the process of electing Speaker Johnson to be speaker, he was still trying -- he was still running for speaker, trying to pull votes away from Johnson toward himself. And so, this is going to be a very long process for this House to repair itself.

And the second thing, though, is you saw a rejection of the anger politics. And that I think is very good for Kentucky and for the country overall. We were up against not just the Cameron (ph) campaign, but five Republican Super PACs that were running very gross, very false attacks.
