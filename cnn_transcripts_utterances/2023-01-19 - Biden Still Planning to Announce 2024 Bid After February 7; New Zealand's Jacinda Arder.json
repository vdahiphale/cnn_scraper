That's where these become incidents and perhaps even raised at the diplomatic level.Another example on the flipside, just a few weeks ago, we saw a U.S. reconnaissance aircraft intercepted by a Chinese aircraft in international airspace. Again, that's key here. What made that different is the U.S. accused China of acting in an unsafe manner and getting too close to the U.S. aircraft.

I didn't know if he gave me the finger in traffic one day or something but I knew he did something to me and crossed me in my past. And it wasn't until last week that a reporter asked him on T.V., are you George Santos or Anthony Devolder today?
