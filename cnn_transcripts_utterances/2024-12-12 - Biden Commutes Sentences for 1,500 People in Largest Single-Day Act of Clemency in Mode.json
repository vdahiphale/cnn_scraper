      "sentences": "Well, Kate, President Biden is using one of the remaining tools available to him in his final days in office to grant clemency to a wide swath of individuals, the president saying that this boils down to trying to give people a second chance.Now, in all, the president is commuting the sentences of nearly 1,500 individuals, the single largest act of clemency in a single day. To put that in perspective, the previous record was set by President Barack Obama when he commuted the sentences for 330 individuals in the final days that he was in office. Now, the White House says that these individuals who will be impacted were placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic. And the White House says that they have shown a commitment to rehabilitation and reintegration into their community. On top of that act of clemency, the president is also pardoning 39 individuals who had noncriminal charges that they had faced, that are not violent crimes that they had faced, and that includes drug offenses. Now, the president in his statement had said, quote, America was built on the promise of possibility and second chances. As president, I have the great privilege of extending mercy to people who have demonstrated remorse and rehabilitation, restoring opportunity for Americans to participate in daily life and contribute to their communities. Now, it comes as President Biden has faced significant pressure to grant more clemency in his closing days in office. There are some who are pushing for him to take several dozen inmates off of federal death row. But this pressure for more acts of clemency really has heightened since President Biden had issued that full and unconditional pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, which really drew fierce backlash from Republicans and Democrats in the president's own party after the president for months had said that he would not do so. Now, an administration official said that the president's pardoning of his son doesn't really impact his view overall on the clemency power. They say that he's been committed to that. As president, he believes it's a way to make the country a bit more just, also, in some ways, to try to deal with some of the wrongdoings of the criminal justice system in the past. And this is unlikely to be President Biden's final act of clemency. He did say that he is planning to take more steps in the final weeks that he is in office.",

These are sightings that go back a couple of weeks all the way back to November 18th in Morris County. It's about 43 miles west of New York City.Some witness reports to authorities indicated that some could be up to six feet in diameter. The Coast Guard reporting as well over water multiple low flying aircraft near one of their vessels. We reached out to the Coast Guard for more information here. The FBI really leading this investigation with New Jersey State Police and the Office of Homeland Security and Preparedness while the Coast Guard is really going to be trying to address the jurisdictional responses here. Federal agencies, though, John, I should mention, have ruled out any connections to local, state or federal governments when it comes to these sightings.
