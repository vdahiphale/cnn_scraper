GREG LANDSMAN (D-OH): Well, no, the - first and foremost, that what we all witnessed on - on Saturday was this - an attempted assassination on, you know, president - former President Trump's life. And it's a - it's - it's not OK. None of us should be OK about it. And - and that overtook, as you can imagine, the - the - the conversations that - that I was having at home. I spent most of Sunday with constituents talking through what it means. And, you know, overwhelmingly, I heard folks say, you know, we really do need to dial it back. I mean people should be leading with their convictions and - and fight for what they believe in. But to do it with strength and kindness and, you know, a thoughtfulness that we don't always see. And that's what we're expecting of - of the president. And I think he - he is - he's shown that. And the same thing with Mr. Trump. And he has said, look, you know, his - his speech is going to be about unity. The frustrating part of yesterday was that, you know, those of us in southwest Ohio know Mr. Vance. That's not who he is. He's not a unity pick. And - and Mr. Trump had many options. So, it was unfortunate that at a time when we all need to come together and - and be as thoughtful and careful in our rhetoric, not our convictions, but our rhetoric, that somebody like Mr. Vance, who's known for turning up the temperature, that's what he does, that that was unfortunate.",
