That's what Aidan Reilly did during the pandemic. He was home from college scared like the rest of us and decided to channel his uneasiness to solve a problem. The reason that so many people go hungry and so much food goes to waste is a logistics problem. There's no easy way to connect farmers with the food banks and no ability to transport the food, so from his pandemic couch Aidan and his friends cofounded the Farmlink Project. In just two years he and a mobilized force of students and young people from around the country have moved more than 70 million pounds of food, prevented nearly 41 million pounds of CO2 going into the air. And just think of all those people who can now make a good breakfast, lunch, and dinner because Aidan saw nourishment instead of waste. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

She refurbishes discarded computers and opens schools based, labs across rural Kenya. To date she has reached 6,000 students and 15 teachers, and works with 15 schools and counting.

So one night in her pajamas scrolling through Facebook, she saw the tragic images of a little boy from Syria dead on the shores of Greece.Now, as a mother, health care worker, and human being, she was horrified. So three weeks later she was using her medical skills at a refugee camp in Aleppo. Then in 2017 she created Mobile Medics International, bringing teams of medical volunteers into places that desperately need it. In the last six years they've done 23 missions on five continents helping more than 30,000 people. Teresa's work shows us that even in the middle of destruction the helpers are there with their skills and their love. Living, breathing reminders of hope to those who have lost everything.

When his classmates critiqued him, this Purple Heart Marine felt seen for the first time since coming home. He went onto graduate from art school, and in 2013 launched CreatiVets to help others like him find peace through song writing and visual art.
