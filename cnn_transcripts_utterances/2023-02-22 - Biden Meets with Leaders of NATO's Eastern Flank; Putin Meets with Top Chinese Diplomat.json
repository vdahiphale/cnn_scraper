It wasn't something that was going to draw massive headlines but the president's reassurance commitment and pledge to NATO's easternmost coalition members was a critical one, particularly in person. And it was also a very substantive, untold meeting behind the scenes, one that is increasingly critical given just how uneasy these nine nations have been over the course of the last year.Keep in mind, this group of nine nations came together in this alliance inside of the NATO coalition in 2015 as a result of the Russian aggression toward Ukraine that led to the illegal annexation of Crimea. And the president made very clear both to the leaders in attendance but also broadly about the stakes of the moment. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

But his allusion to the fact that there was a significant number of issues to discuss about the path forward, a very uncertain path, certainly an arduous path as you look at a war that shows -- it was no signs of ending or decelerating anytime soon.These countries are critical not just for their assistance on both defense and humanitarian aid over the course of the last 11 -- almost 12 months at this point, but also because they serve as frontline defense for not just NATO but also places where American and NATO troops are, weapons systems as well and have asked for more of both. And what the result is of these discussions going forward and how this lays the groundwork for what's next. Certainly, a critical element of a trip that had no shortage of them, guys.",

And it was really one where Vladimir Putin was trying to rally the nation behind what he called them to -- and the Russian leadership called the special military operation.And you know, one of the interesting things that he was saying, he was saying that he believes right now there's a big battle going on, on Russian lands, as he put it for Russian people. So, obviously, the Russian leadership and Vladimir Putin himself already saying that he believes that the places where Russia is fighting now are actually Russian territory. Obviously, under international law, it's a whole different thing. And the U.S. certainly says it's a whole different thing and all this is Ukrainian territory. But this was a big event. This was a huge event. It was definitely a big event, and an important event for Vladimir Putin, who obviously understands that he has to keep Russians behind the special military operation because, of course, as we've been reporting over the last couple of weeks, really the last couple of months, the going has been pretty tough for the Russian military on the battlefield.

How much should we deduce from a failed test, especially in the context of Russia suspending its participation in the New START Treaty?MIKE LYONS, RETIRED MAJOR, U.S. ARMY: Well, it does show that they have ineffective weapons that have been stored for a long period of time. We see this in the current weapons systems that they brought to the battlefield already. They need winds and they would have liked to have had this to be some kind of victory for them to show that they can still do this. And it does question as to what the rest of this fleet looks like of these missiles that have been in storage for tens of decades and have likely not been maintained. So, it's not something they wanted to do. They had to tell us because of the previous START treaty that they're in. And it's not good news, that they're not going to participate in the next one, that's that strategic talks limitations. You know, we've always been able to separate the two between our you know diplomats and what's going on when it comes to arms control.

So, I -- you know, they are -- you know, they don't always play their cards out there. I do believe that the -- you won't see this necessarily coming. I think that they're going to wait this out and see how Russia is doing on the battlefield first. Because China does not want to be aligned with a loser.
