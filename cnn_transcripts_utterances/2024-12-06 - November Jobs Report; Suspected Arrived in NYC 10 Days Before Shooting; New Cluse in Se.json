She is a woman who has changed the way that we even buy tickets at - to concerts. And so she - I don't think we can overstate how important she has been to pop culture.

      "sentences": "Good morning.This is the rebound that economists were looking for, 227,000 jobs added in the month of November after a very dismal October jobs report. The unemployment rate ticking up slightly to 4.1 percent. The unemployment rate hasn't been above 4 percent for six months now. And so the Fed may look at that and say, that is a signal that we can cut rates a little bit. See that unemployment rate trending above 4 percent for some months now. I want to zero in on October though, because October we saw 12,000 jobs added. That was because of the Boeing strike, because of the two hurricanes that we had. We did get revisions, but only up by 24,000. So, it is really a dismal number for October, about 36,000 jobs added total. That is because maybe there just wasn't a lot of hiring because of these hurricanes and maybe employers just didn't report that they were hiring. But all in all, today's numbers signals a very strong jobs market. The one thing we do want to look at is the sectors. Where are we adding jobs, so people know potentially where to look. It's the usual suspects, healthcare adding, leisure/hospitality adding, government adding jobs. Also, you had transportation and manufacturing adding jobs. That signals the end of the strike. So, more jobs coming online there. Retail, though, John, did lose a little bit. So, that was interesting ahead of the holidays. What does this mean for the Federal Reserve and whether or not they're going to cut rates? Well, there are odds that are out there about whether or not they're going to cut rates. Before this jobs report, odds were at 71 percent for a rate cut. Now, after this jobs report, 91 percent. So, economists feeling like in December we could see another rate cut.",

Both big things that loom over this investigation at this point.Now, some of the key things we learned, of course, is when this person actually got into the city, according to law enforcement. As you mentioned, some of it arrived about ten days beforehand. He was moving at points around the city. But then finally checked into the hostel for what appeared to be the duration leading up to the shooting on November 30th. As you mentioned, he checked in with a fake New Jersey ID. And among the investigations or among the interviews law enforcement has done, according to a law enforcement source, this clerk was having a conversation with this person of interest as has been described by police as he was checking in and was asked to lower his mask because they were flirting back and forth, and that smile that showing of the face could end up being the most significant clue in this as we move forward, at least what we've seen so far to this point. But that, of course, goes to who this person is. The other question is where? So, when you look at the route of sort of how this unfolded, obviously the shooting happened early in the morning. It happened in midtown Manhattan outside the Hilton Hotel there. From there law enforcement, as we bring up some of the route, saw him or essentially tracked him heading north on a bike towards Central Park, which is where you see that yellow line hitting the south portion of Central Park there. And then new video that we've seen shows a person leaving Central Park around 85th Street or so. So about 30 blocks north of where the shooting actually happened. And law enforcement has seen this video, and they do believe it is likely that is the gunman. So again, it gives you a little bit of a trace of where this person was moving in the immediate aftermath of the shooting. This video is about 15 minutes or so after the shooting would have taken place. But, of course, now the question becomes, all right, what do you do with this information? They have a water bottle that was left around the scene with a fingerprint. But as we understand from law enforcement, that fingerprint was smudged as well. Also, a cell phone left at the scene. Likely trying to get into that phone as well. You see some of the timeline there. But, of course, the main question, as we're waiting on this third day now of trying to find out again who this person is and where this person is, trying to see if any of these clues and pieces create anything substantial for law enforcement or even substantial to the point where the public can know about it.",

He prepared his escape. But I think he's making mistakes along the way. And those are the things that, which, you know, in my experience, when I was looking for fugitives or members of the gangs, I would look for the mistakes. And those mistakes will lead you to where he is. I do not believe he's in New York City probably. Most likely he's returned to maybe where home is.

So, it has to be assumed that it's either possibly in the backpack, which is in Central Park, or he has it on his person. This individual could be very much dangerous if cornered. So, it's out of precaution, you know, to be careful, to advise the public, don't approach this. Leave it to law enforcement. They're trained. They know how to deal with this individual. So, using the proper authorities to provide the clues, asking the public for clues, and then letting the law enforcement entities to close in on him and affect the arrest, having him captured alive is obviously what we want.",

He had to go back to that place. He knew of the location where the meeting was going to be. So, he, obviously, canvased that at a certain point in those ten days. So, did he have his mask on all those times?So, I believe there's probably images out there that they have and they're looking at those images and looking at that - and tracing that and seeing where he may have been, not just at the youth hostel and not just outside the hotel, but in between.",
