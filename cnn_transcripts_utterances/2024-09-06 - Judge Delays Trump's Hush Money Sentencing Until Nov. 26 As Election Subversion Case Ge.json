      "sentences": "Accordingly, I want to point out, Paula, that we are getting some new reporting from CNN's Kaitlan Collins about Trump's view of this decision by Judge Juan Merchan.Trump's legal team apparently pleased. The reporting is that while they maintain the case should be thrown out, his legal team is pleased with the decision to delay the sentencing. Trump was apparently with his lawyers when he found out. Excuse me. Paula, I do want to get back to something that you mentioned about Trump's attorneys in the federal election subversion case. Because there, they're trying to stop Judge Chutkan for moving forward with the case, in part because they feel that certain testimony, specifically around his actions regarding January 6th and so forth, that should stay private until potentially after the election. They believe that it could have an impact on voter's minds. What do you think we're going to see next with that case? How are we going to watch that argument play out in court about what should be made public?",

      "sentences": "Yesterday, his lawyers were arguing in court, trying to convince the judge, Tanya Chutkan, not to allow the release of any additional evidence in the January 6th case. Because they argue that it could potentially impact the minds of voters.But that is an argument that they lost, as we saw yesterday -- late yesterday. Judge Tanya Chutkan, she released her schedule for that case. And going forward, there's a possibility that never-before-for seen evidence that was collected in this investigation, related to Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 election, could be released before the November election. Because the way that she laid out the deadlines, the discovery deadlines in this case make that a possibility. So that is certainly a concern for the Trump legal team. And their goal yesterday was to just try to delay anything of substance from happening in that case until after the November election, but they we're not successful. So that is likely a big concern right now, probably the greatest legal threat for the former president between now and Election Day.",

      "sentences": "OK, what if he wins? What if he loses, Paula? Then how do his legal woes -- these -- this particular one and others play out? REIDHis attorney general would have the power to, again, just toss those federal cases. When it comes to the New York case, he has already been convicted. But like I said earlier, I think the sentencing, assuming it still happens, it would be an extraordinary event. You have a president-elect potentially being sentenced to probation, possibly even prison time. That sounds like another trip back up to the Supreme Court. I'm confident that his lawyers would likely try to prevent the sentencing at all and then try to block whatever sentencing he has. Then of course, there's that case down in Georgia. That would likely just sort of be put on ice and delayed because you can't put a sitting president on criminal trial. So really, it's pretty clear he has to win the election if he really wants to avoid these significant, potentially illegal consequences.",

Jean Carroll cases. There's a defamation case where he owes her $83 million. And then today, he and his lawyers were in court fighting a $5 million judgment from a trial last year. So, yes, it would be expected that most of those would continue. But I'm confident that his lawyers would try to find unique legal issues to prevent him from having to actually pay that if he is reelected.",

      "sentences": "Yes, that's correct. As prosecutors learn more information, Brianna, more charges are expected. And that's what the district attorney said here a little bit earlier.And it's hard to wrap your head around what happened here this morning. On the one hand, here at the Barrow County courthouse, we had back-to-back father and son court appearances for a mass shooting. And that has gutted this community and appalled the entire nation, as you know. On the other hand, Brianna, we had the families of some of the victims in the courtroom just steps away from the suspects. And understandably, some cried at different points during the proceedings. And as for the legal case against Colt Gray, the 14-year-old accused of killing two fellow students and two teachers at Apalachee High School here in Winder, he was arraigned on four counts of felony murder. As we have previously reported, the teenage suspect is expected to be tried as an adult. Gray's arms were shackled and he was wearing a green top up and tan pants. The 14-year-old remained virtually motionless, other than shaking loose hair out of his face when he first sat down. After initially saying that the suspect faced the death penalty, Judge Currie Mingledorff corrected himself, saying that he's only eligible for a life sentence, given that he is a minor. Once the proceedings were done, District Attorney Smith made it clear more charges are entirely possible. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Read that as they believe Russia is more likely to carry out just such an attack and that's causing great concern. They've set up for years an entire unit to do this kind of thing. It's called the General staff Main Directorate for Deep-Sea Research. Goes by GUGI. Those are the Russian initials. GUGI sounds innocent. It is not. It has its own formidable fleet of surface ships, submarines, naval drones to do reconnaissance and potentially carry out a sabotage attack.",

And the vast majority of Internet traffic travels on these cables underwater, fiber optic cables. Telecommunications, civilian, military, government, which means industries depend on it. The financial markets, the energy markets depend on it. Also in Europe, energy travels on these cables. So if you wanted to find a good way, a very good way to damage and do damage to an ally, like the U.S. and its allies without firing a shot, this would be a fantastic way to do it. It's all often -- for a long time, considered a key vulnerability for the U.S. and its allies. And now they see Russia with an enormous so amount of activity around these choke points.",
