That is the word from Austrian police and government officials today who say they foiled aterror plot that forced the cancellation of three Taylor Swift concerts, scheduled to start tonight. Three teenage suspects were taken into custody. Police say at least two of them were radicalized online and a security official says, the main suspect intended to kill himself and a large number of people. A source telling CNN that U.S. intelligence warned officials in Austria about the alleged plot. Now as you might expect, fans who had flocked to Vienna to see the concert, Swifties as they're called, are crushed by the cancellations but they are safe. Nick Paton Walsh joining me here. And Nick, what more do we know about the suspects and this alleged foiled plot?",

He announced, it seems at the end of July at work, that he was quitting and going off to do something big. Seems to have changed his appearance as well, had access to precursor chemicals, which he seems to have installed at his home, causing police to spend hours yesterday combing through that area and evacuating 60 households nearby, according to local media. He appears to have given his allegiance to ISIS online in probably early July over some kind of internet channel, radicalized online. He was in contact with a 17-year-old boy -- man, I should say -- who appears to have met him online, had recently broken up with his girlfriend. The extent of the 17 year old's involvement in the actual act is unclear. And there's a 15-year old too, who appears to be in contact with both as well. Whether he was going to be part of the plot or knew about it is unclear but the details of how they were thinking about doing this are utterly chilling. Because in the 19 year old's possession, there were knives, a police blue flashing light, suggesting he perhaps tried to put that on a vehicle to gain access to the area, and counterfeit money as well along with Al Qaeda materials. And the suggestion that he downloaded the instructions for this explosive device from the internet. So we're talking about here possibly a teenage suicide bomber, who said he was willing to kill himself in this act. Quite how he meant to carry it out unclear but he seemed, he says, according to officials, to be aiming at the periphery around the concert, the fans who wanted to overhear the concert rather than get in themselves.",

Of course, this was about the situation in Gaza. These were pro-Palestinian hecklers. And what she said was that, if you want Donald Trump to win, say that. And she said, I'm speaking now, your turn will come later. And I think this is so interesting and it does speak to the balance that she's trying to strike on this issue in particular. She doesn't want to break with President Biden in his strategy for the Middle East. But at the same time, she has tried to appear more conciliatory to the situation of the Palestinians. And in a state like Michigan, with that heavy concentration of Arab Americans and Muslim Americans, it will be a balance that she will continue to have to strike. Now we are told that she met behind the scenes with a number of Arab American activists as well, who are trying to lobby her to support an arms embargo on Israel. She doesn't support that and the White House was clear this morning that she doesn't. But it is an issue and she will have to demonstrate some wiggle room on this area going forward, which has been such an issue for Democrats. Now, later today, she'll meet with union workers at a union hall. She has been endorsed by auto workers. That's another huge constituency in the state of Michigan. What you're seeing her try to do at all of these stops is really continue this momentum that Democrats have been enjoying since she joined the ticket. Last night in Detroit was a huge crowd, 15,000 people at an airport hangar. That's the largest crowd she's had so far. The real question will be whether they can maintain that going forward. She has her events this week. Next week will be the Democratic National Convention.

Adam Lucente writes for \"Al-Monitor\" and used this piece in the wake of, in the hours just after the announcement of Tim Walz, to take a deep dive into some of Walz's positions on, for example, the war in Gaza, on Iraq, Iran and on Syria. And Adam joins us now from New York. This show, of course, normally based in Abu Dhabi. We have a sort of keen focus on what is going on in the wider Middle East region. And I was fascinated to read what you penned. And we did hear Kamala Harris responding to a heckler last night, which puts this in place. Some have said that this is an all progressive ticket, which would, if you are looking at that, through a sort of foreign policy lens, suggest more of a sort of bent to the Arab American sympathies. Based on your research, is that true in terms of foreign policy? ADAM LUCENTE, NEWS AND BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, \"AL-MONITOR\":  Yes. With governor Walz, he's actually considered a mainstream in terms of foreign policy. Certainly, with regards to Middle East policy, especially on the Israel-Gaza War. Remember before he was governor, he was in Congress, in the House of Representatives, representing the same state and he voted for aid to Israel. And as governor, he voted -- he condemned quite forcefully the October 7 attack as governor. At the same time, since the war began, he has called for a ceasefire and he's called for more aid to the Gaza Strip.

And friendly, an uptick in policing and what the police are doing with those who are causing trouble. You've spoken with the far right in the United Kingdom extensively, including a man by the name of Tommy Robinson, who is the face of what's known as the English Defence League. You've said, and I quote you here, \"Protecting \"their women\" -- in inverted commas -- \"from Muslim men was a key mobilizing narrative and it's been the key theme this week, even if it's based on a lie.\" Elizabeth, how does that sense of possession play into this?",

But I think it does make sense to talk about them because there is a lot of people that follow Tommy Robinson and who are very influenced by the anti- Islam rhetoric which he continues to mobilize. So this is a nationalist idea that states have mobilized toward war for a long time. And ultra-nationalists and the far-right also mobilized. So they have a key part of the narrative is that the state has let down this particular group of people and that they themselves, the men of the group, have to mobilize instead. Because the state won't do it, they will do it instead. So we know that the anti-Islam radical right, has always mobilized around, for instance, grooming gangs, so-called child sexual exploitation and this very strong core to protect women and children. And so violence against women and children requires the men of the group to kind of respond with violence in turn. And I think, even though, as you say and I wrote, this is based on a lie, that really strong emotion in the wake of that absolutely terrible killing of those three girls and attacks on those other children more than a week ago now. The emotion was so manipulable because it was so strong and that gave it a lot of momentum. And frankly, some people didn't care whether it was a lie they were following or not, it seems, in the aftermath of last (INAUDIBLE) in Southport.",
