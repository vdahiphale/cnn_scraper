Tonight, South Africa formally accuses Israel of committinggenocide in Gaza as the landmark case in the International Court of Justice begins. The South African Justice Minister will be joining us this hour. Then Ukraine's President Zelenskyy continues his surprise tour of the Baltic states today, meeting the Latvian president to shore up support. I'll be speaking to the Latvian Foreign Minister shortly about his visit. Plus, we are set to hear from Donald Trump this hour. He has been attending closing arguments in his New York civil fraud case. We have all the details for you just ahead. But first this evening, chilling overwhelming, incontrovertible. That's how a South African lawyer describes the evidence against Israel as it stands accused of genocide at The Hague. A historic hearing began today, three months after Israel went to war to destroy Hamas, leaving much of Gaza an inhabitable wasteland. The Hamas-run Health Ministry in Gaza says more than 23,000 Palestinians have been killed and counting, many of them women and children. South Africa is asking the International Court of Justice to immediately stop the war. It's accusing Israel not just of committing genocide against the Palestinian people, but also creating conditions of life that are quote, \"calculated to destroy them as a group\". It says this intent has been nurtured at the highest level of the Israeli state. Israel will officially respond in court on Friday, but it's already fiercely condemning the hearings as one of the greatest show of hypocrisy, their words in history. Well, South Africa's legal team says publicly- available evidence supports their case, noting that the world has watched in real-time as the horrors unfolded. Have a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Which has never happened before we filed the papers. Even the Secretary of State, Blinken, his visit, his tone was different to the one which he had prior to us filing the purpose.

And then within the next few days, we should get an idea of how this court feels about those very important preliminary measures.

Blinken wrapped up his five-day tour of the region by meeting with Egyptian President El-Sisi. He applauded Israel's decision to allow a United Nations team north of Gaza to assess the situation and see what has to be done in order for Gazans to begin moving back to their homes. Blinken also says the Palestinian Authority agreed to what he describes meaningful reform. Well, the leader of the Houthi rebels is vowing that any aggression from the United States in the Red Sea will not go unanswered. He accused the U.S. and U.K. of trying to involve other countries in the fighting against Yemen. And says the recent response from the U.S. Navy is proof that Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea are making an impact. Meantime, Iran says it has ceased a whole tank in the Gulf of Oman that was the focus of a dispute with the United States.

Our Nada Bashir joins me now from Beirut with more on both those strands.

Now, of course, according to Iranian media, that vessel was seized off the Gulf of Oman and then taken to Iranian territorial waters as an act of retaliation after that very same vessel was seized and confiscated last year by the United States while carrying Iranian oil. Now, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, a court found that it had been transporting and selling Iranian oil. Of course,  in contravention to sanctions on Iran to a customer abroad, and other time, having carrying almost 1 million barrels of Iranian crude oil. Now of course, that would be in contravention of those sanctions today. Iranian media saying that an order had been sent down by an Iranian court for the seizure of this vessel.

Those negotiations lasted for about eight years with results two years ago, they started a full-out war. So Russia is not interested in  negotiation.
