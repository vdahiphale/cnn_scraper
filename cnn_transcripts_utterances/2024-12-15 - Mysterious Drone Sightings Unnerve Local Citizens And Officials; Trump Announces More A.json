Boston Police say they have arrested two people for flying aircraft dangerously close to Logan International Airport, and it comes as state and local officials become increasingly frustrated by the lack of transparency about where these drones are coming from or how dangerous they might be. There are reports of sightings in at least six states now. Reported incidents include drones flying near military facilities and one even causing a New York Airport to temporarily suspend flights. Federal agencies are now facing intense pressure to provide answers. Today, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas offered this reassurance. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

And, you know, look what I am hearing from Homeland and what I am hearing from FBI is, we don't see a threat here.And look, honestly, every video I've seen and I've spent the last couple of days looking at every one of these videos, every video I have seen on Twitter, on the internet are all airplanes. They are literally all airplanes. Some of them will show an airplane that's kind of stable out there and says, that's a drone and actually, it is an airplane flying towards you at 30,000 feet, and I can see the lighting on it. And if there are drones out there, by the way, and if any of these pictures that they have shown are actual drones, these drones then are complying with FAA lighting requirements, a green on the right, a red on the left with a strobe. And so it is not Iran, it is not aliens if there are drones. My guess is, if there are drones -- again, because again, all I've seen are airplanes, then it is more than likely some company that's out testing drones or something like that and has no requirement to tell the public that they're doing it because they're actually operating these things legally. There have been no accusations of illegal operations. By the way, as a pilot myself, I can fly over a military base whenever I want. Those restrictions don't exist. So I think there is a lot of mass hysteria, and I've heard stories of people pointing lasers at these \"drones\" and then the drones' lights go off. Actually, let's be clear, I've been lasered as a pilot before, you're supposed to turn off all your lights once you get lasered so that they can't find you because it can actually damage your eyes.",

Look, look, my opinion and I obviously served as a congressman for 12 years, when a congressman says something, people take that as an official statement, as gospel.I want to give credit to Andy Kim. Andy Kim woke up yesterday morning or something and said he saw all of these drones. He is concerned and then later said, look, I talked with civilians who showed me on Flight Tracker that they were all airplanes. I give him deep credit for being willing to say that. What you have as a member of Congress or as a public official is your people are upset, they are angry. You don't want to be the one to go to them and tell them they're overreacting, because that's not what a politician wants to do. They want to reflect back your fear. So they make a statement saying, gosh, the FBI needs to say more. The FBI comes out and says, yes, we don't see a threat here. I don't know what else to say. We are not seeing the drones that you're seeing, and then politicians say, well, they are lying to us. And so we are in this catch 22 where, frankly, politicians need to be a little more responsible and tell people like, hey, first off, here's what we do know. It is not Iran. It is not a mothership off the coast of New York and it is not aliens. And they are -- they're very polite and compliant with FAA lighting requirements.",

It is -- look, if you're a helicopter flying, there are issues with drones, so many times there are drones that fly over airports, there are drones that fly over military bases that shouldn't, and so to the extent you can give local and state authorities, I guess, some kind of, you know, tools to deal with that or, or opportunities to call something a restricted area, I am all for that.What you can't do, though, is give local authorities and state authorities the ability to deem airspace rules. And this is like what they're talking about. You can't stop a drone from flying in federal airspace because there is some hysteria going on at the moment. And look, the thing is, we have a very lax airspace in the United States and that is a really good thing, because it is the reason we have such a rich pilot community and so many people that go and become pilots and why it is so strong. You can fly without talking to air traffic control. You can fly over military bases. The idea that all of a sudden now state and local is going to have control over airspace authorities, I don't think we fully thought through.",

He is an IBM executive who will be the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security. And the other is Bill White, another businessman who will be the ambassador to Belgium, and like so many other Trump nominees so far, these two individuals donated it to the effort to get Donald Trump elected.In fact, White contributed more than a hundred thousand dollars to various campaign committees and other groups that are aligned with Donald Trump, and this is a trend. In fact, a CNN analysis found that more than -- nearly three dozen of the picks that Trump has made so far were people who donated to Donald Trump, and it includes eight of his Cabinet members and their spouses, giving $37 million to Donald Trump's campaign or the groups that have been aligned with him throughout this election cycle. Two other people close to Trump or two other Cabinet nominees, New York Representative Elise Stefanik and Florida Representative Mike Waltz, they also will be in Donald Trump's Cabinet, and they also contributed money to Trump by transferring it from their campaign committees to Trump's aligned committees. And then also, on top of all that, of course, is Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest man, the Tesla CEO and the person who has been incredibly close to Trump, he gave $262 million of his personal wealth toward trying to get Donald Trump elected this past cycle. And when we asked the Trump campaign about all of these people giving money to Trump and then finding jobs with him, they said, \"Millions of Americans fed up with failure in the White House and federal government joined President Trump in the movement to restore our nations greatness. Some who will work with President Trump are among those millions of people who supported the campaign and helped the president win a decisive electoral victory.\" -- Fred.",

In fact, most of the funding for this project will pay a graduate student salary for the next year.Basically how this transpired is, I was driving in to Midtown Atlanta the day after the fire at the biolab facility in Conyers and you could tell that the air quality was much worse than normal. So I went into the lab, we started up our instrumentation, and we started to measure in midtown, about 21 miles away from the incident, and we wanted to monitor the air as best we could. A couple of days later, the city of Conyers contacted us, looking for help, and we told them we could bring out an air quality trailer and as part of this, we could bring out a special research instrumentation that we could try to measure halogens with, which was one of the key chemicals that was coming out of this plume.",

He did not name any specific religious groups during his warning. After the conference, he will meet French President Emmanuel Macron. And it is the world's most polluted city. Every day in Delhi, India, more than 30 million people wake up to thick, burning, toxic smog. The city's Skyline barely visible through the dense air. CNN's Hanako Montgomery introduces us to children struggling to breathe in India's capital. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) HANAKO MONTGOMERY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): For three-year-old Chahat and his baby sister, clean air is a luxury that their parents cannot afford. MUSKAN, MOTHER (through translator): I feel scared that my children might die. I'm filled with regret when I think about what might happen to them. MONTGOMERY (voice over): Delhi's air is so toxic that Muskan says her kids have needed a nebulizer since birth. She spent months saving up for this machine, rag-picking the very trash that's also poisoning her children, earning just a dollar a day. MUSKAN (through translator): During the winter months, their ribs start to hurt. Mucus freezes in their chest. They vomit, too. We're so worried. I have three children. They keep falling sick in this dust. MONTGOMERY (voice over): But her children are the lucky ones. DEEPAK KUMAR, FATHER (through translator): The doctor asked us to buy a nebulizer, but we don't have that kind of money. MONTGOMERY (voice over): When Deepak's daughter struggles to breathe, they rush to a nearby clinic where he says each breath costs more than his daily wage. Nights are his worst fear. No doctors, just balms and thoughts of mounting medical costs. KUMAR (through translator): I want to leave Delhi, but I can't because I need to pay off a debt for my daughter's health. MONTGOMERY (voice over): Every winter, toxic smog blankets Delhi. A deadly mix of smoke from crop fires, coal plants and traffic. Officials block cars and close schools, as air pollution can hit 60 times the World Health Organization's air quality guidelines. But like winter, the smog returns every year. And its biggest victims are the tiniest lives. MAJINDER SINGH-RANDHAWA, PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE CONSULTANT: The human lung also develops, still, about eight to 10 years of age. It's not in its mature form 'till that time. And a developing lung, if it's exposed to all these pollutants, that has when it causes long-term problem. MONTGOMERY (voice-over): While India's poor are bound to these slums, the wealthy rush to hospitals.",
