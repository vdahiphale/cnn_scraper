I'm Abby Phillip in Washington, and you are live in the CNN NEWSROOM.Unprecedented political retribution, that is what is on the agenda in the Tennessee Statehouse right now. All day, protesters have been at the Capitol in support of the so-called Tennessee 3, the Democratic state lawmakers who are on the cusp of being expelled from that chamber. And any minute now, the GOP-dominated chamber will vote on whether to remove them from office because -- get this -- they protested on the House floor, calling for stricter gun laws after the Nashville shooting that left six people dead, three of whom were children. Now, if the vote passes, it would be the first time in that body's entire history, more than 200 years, that a violation of House rules resulted in members being ousted. And so, just to recap, these three lawmakers, they may be stripped of their elected positions for speaking out of turn after three 9-year- olds were gunned down in their grade school. CNN's Ryan Young is on the scene for us. Ryan, you have been there all morning. And emotions are clearly still running high as this process goes on. What are you learning there from the folks who have taken time out of their day to gather in support these lawmakers?",

We had more than 1,000 people show up here this morning, braving the rain. And they're still rallying at this point, because they want the lawmakers on the inside who are having discussions to hear their voices consistently. And they said that's something they wanted to press. But, as I was walking through here, Abby, we saw some of these folks talking to each other just about what's going on.

And it really shouldn't be up to other Republican House members whether they get to stay or not. They broke rules. And, as the professor said, there is a mechanism to deal with. That is censure. But, really, I want to remind our viewers of three words, legitimate political discourse. That is what Republicans officially called the insurrection on January 6, 2021, which was violent, which led to multiple deaths and many injuries, and was an attempted crime. They're now calling this an example of an insurrection. This was peaceful. It was purposeful. There was no violence and there was no attempted crime. So, just when looking at the outrage and the behavior on the right, it's important to remember who these people are and where they're coming from.",

It's how you keep 100 people with varying political differences together to do the work. However, this is just -- the timing, to say it's terrible is an -- is an understatement. And it's sad, because now the message of what the Democrats were trying to say is completely lost. We're now talking about these Republicans trying to kick these Democrats out. I think the vote hasn't happened yet. I think this is a real opportunity for the Republicans, some Republicans, to show some grace and say, that's not acceptable, but we're not going to kick these people out.

And we had Republican lawmakers in the hours and days after that school shooting saying publicly the Congress has no role here and they don't plan to do anything. We just have to live with this. So, American voters, parents, we're all frustrated. These Democratic lawmakers, I think, were representing their constituents. Again, Stephanie's right. Decorum is important. But there's frustration here. And so, as Stephanie said, it's a chance for Republicans to give some grace. It's also a chance for Republicans to go ahead and act like Republicans and conservatives. And just because you don't get your way, just because you can't convince a majority of voters to vote for your far right, extremist policies doesn't mean you get to kick them out of office. And that's what Republicans have decided to do. They're going after democracy. They're making it harder for you to vote, to speak, to protest, to assemble, to read books. This is a party that is really out of ideas. And they were punished in the 2020 election. They were punished in the '22 -- 2022 midterms, and I believe they will probably be punished in 2024 as well.",

And, nearby, demonstrators stormed the office of the investment giant BlackRock, lighting flame -- flares and chanting anti-reform slogans. The French government's plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64, that's what has ignited similar protests all across the country. CNN's Melissa Bell is live for us in the French capital.

That march that began a few hours ago is now coming to its destination point, which is here at the Place d'Italie in Central Paris. And you can see there's been quite a lot of tear gas. The air is pretty thick with it. There are flares. You can hear those, the anti- police chants very much directed at the police forces. And that's what we have seen over the course of the day, continuous scuffles along the sidelines of this march. And that is now intensifying here at this destination point. It's what we have tended to see these last couple of weeks. For many weeks, there had been remarkably peaceful protests, where it had been the unions really ensuring a lot of the security. The police had been relatively restrained. What we have seen more recently -- and it's happened again today -- is a hardened core of protesters really taking on the riot police. What we have also been seeing these last couple of weeks, Abby, is a change in the techniques of the police, with accusations, allegations of police, a disproportionate use of force by the police. And that is something that's being investigated. And you can see at scenes like this how tense it can get between the sides, those who are determined to take on the police in the name of fighting this reform and trying to get the government to back down, and the police who, despite the fires being lit there on the center of the Place d'Italie, but all along the march's length determined to try and cause as much disruption to Central Paris as they can, in order to get the government think about it again -- Abby.",

He's a longtime peace negotiator under Republican and Democratic administrations, including serving as a former special Middle East coordinator under President Clinton and a special assistant under President Obama. He's now a counselor at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Dennis, thanks for joining us. First, to start, can you just give us your reaction to what we have seen transpire in Israel over the last two days? DENNIS ROSS, FORMER U.S. ENVOY TO MIDDLE EAST:  Well, look, we are -- we always knew that the reality of having Ramadan on one hand and Passover on the other take place at the same time was bound to create a real potential for violence, especially triggered by those who would like to see violence. We know that those who barricaded themselves within the Al-Aqsa Mosque last night had the very real purpose of wanting to trigger something. We know what's happened now. It was not Hezbollah that launched these rockets from Lebanon. It was Hamas. And as Hamas is launching from Lebanon, it's not launching from Gaza. There were a couple that were fired, but they're basically trying to shift the focus. It signals that they don't want a war over Gaza, but they also feel that Israel is constrained by what it can do in Lebanon because of Hezbollah. Hezbollah itself allows Hamas to operate and then claims it had nothing to do with this. So, all of this suggests that we're at a point where there's a great potential for escalation if one side or the other miscalculates.",

      "sentences": "Israel undoubtedly will respond to the fact that there were three dozen rockets fired out of Southern Lebanon and at least three mortar shells fired into the city, the town of Metula in the north.So, Israel will retaliate. They will probably try to retaliate in a way that hits only those areas where Hamas was operating. If they hit targets that Hezbollah considers to be theirs, Hezbollah then -- Hezbollah may then decide that they will fire rockets into Israel. If the two of them begin an exchange, that could easily spiral out of control quickly. Hezbollah can hit Israel with 3,000 rockets a day for several weeks. Israel won't take that. They will end up going into Lebanon on the ground to try to stop that. So you can see how quickly this could escalate and get out of control. My guess is, neither side wants it to get out of control, so it probably won't be something that escalates that way. But there's clearly a danger. As I said, calculations always seem great when you're in the abstract or in the laboratory. When real fire begins, a lot of things go out the window.",
