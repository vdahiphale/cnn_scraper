Tuesday is when the report came out from Hindenburg, which is a short-seller and a research firm. And within nine days his net worth, according to Bloomberg now, is about $61 billion -- almost half of what it was at the beginning of last week.Now, like you asked, Adani Group has come out with a statement. They have, of course, called these reports false. They've also gone ahead to say that in terms of the statement and the accusations by the Hindenburg firm, this is also attack -- a calculated attack on India. Now, despite these claims and despite Gautam Adani himself coming out yesterday in a video message to calm the nerves of investors who have lost so much money in the last couple of days, the markets are still in red when it comes to the stock shares of the Adani Group. And as far as the political fallout is concerned Christine, you have opposition lawmakers in Parliament for three consecutive days demanding an independent probe into the report -- the Hindenburg report. And also going ahead and asking for the Indian government to make a statement on the accusations made by the Hindenburg firm, which has claimed that the Adani Group has committed fraud. Now, according to critics, Gautam Adani seemed to be close to India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, hence the opposition lawmakers are asking for that statement. Even today, the shares of the Adani conglomerate -- most of them opened in red. Investors are still extremely worried and nothing is calming their nerves for now, Christine.",

Some analysts though predict modest cost cuts could come next.All right, looking at markets around the world, Asian and European markets are mixed this morning. China will fully resume travel with Hong Kong and Macau. A big boost economically for that region. On Wall Street, stock index futures right now leaning lower here. A huge Nasdaq rally during the day yesterday. The Nasdaq soared more than three percent. That's the best -- get this -- the best start to the year for Nasdaq since 1975. The S&amp;P gained more than one percent. But then there were a bunch of big tech earnings after the bell. Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon all reporting disappointing results during the quarter.

One hundred eight-five thousand jobs forecast added in January. The jobless rate ticking higher to 3.6 percent. All right. In just a few hours, the Department of Labor will release that jobs report -- a key measure of inflation we'll be looking for in the wage part of that report. Let's bring in chief economist at Morning Consult, John Leer. Good morning. What are you expecting? JOHN LEER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MORNING CONSULT (via Webex by Cisco): Good morning.
