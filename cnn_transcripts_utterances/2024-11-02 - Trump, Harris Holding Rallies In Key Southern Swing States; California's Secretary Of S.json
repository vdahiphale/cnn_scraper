I'm -- I'm Fredricka Whitfield.All right, top of the hour, and we have officially entered the homestretch for the 2024 presidential race, as there are now just three days left until Election Day. And right now, both candidates are holding dueling rallies in key southern states. Donald Trump is holding the first of two campaign events in battleground North Carolina. Vice President Kamala Harris is holding a Get Out the Vote Rally in the swing state of Georgia before heading to North Carolina later on today. Today is the last day of early voting in North Carolina. And so far, more than 4 million people in that critical swing state have already cast their ballots, exceeding the total number of early voters four years ago. CNN's Alayna Treene is covering the Trump campaign. She's joining us right now from that rally that he's holding. Alayna, what can you tell us about his closing message in this final stretch?",

But, look, what his closing message is and what his campaign wants his closing message to be is likely going to be different than what you hear him say on stage. Now, Donald Trump, his team did share some of his prepared remarks with me prior to him coming on behind me. And a lot of it is what you would expect to hear.They walked through saying that he will say that he wants to end inflation, that he will stop the invasion on the border, that he will bring back the American dream. These are all themes that his campaign has really been trying to instill in the minds of voters in this final, crucial stretch. They told me that really this is the closing argument. This is the impression they want voters to have as they make up their minds and head to the polls on November 5th. Now, of course, Donald Trump has been veering off topic a lot, particularly in recent weeks at these rallies. You're seeing a lot of some of the anxieties that I know he and his campaign have about this election kind of seeping into the forefront. And one of those key concerns is the gender gap. Now, there's no secret that Kamala Harris is doing better with women than Donald Trump. But that's even more problematic right now, Fred, because if you look at the early voting data that has come in, it shows that women are outpacing men. And so they have not solved for that gender gap. And it's something Donald Trump is continuously bringing up in his conversations. Now, he actually talked about it this morning while doing an interview with \"Fox &amp; Friends.\" Take a listen to what he said. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: Can you imagine a wife not telling her husband who she's voting for? Do you ever hear anything like that? Even if you have a horrible -- if you had a bad relationship, you're going to tell your husband. It's ridiculous. It's so stupid. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

We want to make sure that this was not something that boys will be boys kind of attitude in California, that we would basically deal with this as effectively as we can with every method that we have. Since then, we've written additional legislation in California that makes it a criminal offense to even harass a -- a person who works in the polls. And so -- yes, yes, we -- we've done that. We -- we made sure that people understand that attacking any kind of box in California voting box, it is a federal offense and will be prosecuted as such. We've been working not only with our local officers, but our statewide officers and the federal officers as well, in terms of assuring that we will have a safe voting place for everyone and that we take it very seriously. So we've done that. We also have monitors at many of our places. We have that come in and make sure that those who are observers watching the -- the election, we have a lot of observers who come to see the election in certain areas to make sure that they are following the law. We've trained most of, we've sent information out to all of our police officers, the police stations to make sure that they understand California's Voting Rights Act so that they don't take these things as minor offenses, if someone is doing something or blocking the polling place or standing outside campaigning in areas that they should not be.

But there is always still the question of, do they actually turn out? You know, looking at early voting numbers, some certainly are. We are not going to have a good handle on how much these voters follow- through in casting the ballots until after Election Day. But if we see the energy, if Harris manages to get them invigorated and ready to go to the polls, that could make all the difference. And I remember when Biden was at the top of the ticket, one of his biggest challenges was the disappointment in young voters. He lost young voters rapidly. And that was one of the huge warning signs for his candidacy. And so to have Harris now seeing more support and really focus on this age group, it is really interesting. And it shows what a different kind of candidate she has been. And I would also note, one of the most interesting things when we look into the polling on the youth vote, is it is where the gender gap is most clear. Young women are far more likely to back Kamala Harris, while young men, they give Trump the edge. And so it will depend on who in the young voter category is turning out. WHITFIELD: Oh, interesting.

If you look at the backdrop there, a pretty diverse crowd. But we are zeroing in on the power of the youth vote. If you look at just George so far, 18 to 24-year-old are outpacing other younger voting blocs in early voting. In other battleground states, the non-profit Voters for Tomorrow group is predicting record youth vote totals. Even in Michigan, youth votes are projected to exceed 200 percent of last election. That is extraordinary. What do you suppose it is that is motivating or driving younger voters to the polls this time around?",

Whether it was the Kamala Is BRAT tweet or Taylor Swift endorsement.There have been a lot of things in the Harris campaign strategy, since she became the presidential nominee, that have been very tailored to younger voters. And another thing I saw reported recently that is interesting is that young people are starting to be reminded of things that Trump said in the past. Like the \"Access Hollywood\" tape many say they have not seen before. That could also be having an impact that younger voters are being reminded that some of things some of us can never forget. But they are seeing Trump right now and that could be an effective strategy for her.",
