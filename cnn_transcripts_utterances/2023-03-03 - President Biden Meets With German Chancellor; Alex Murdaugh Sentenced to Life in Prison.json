It was a dressing down like I have never seen, going through thefamily history of the Murdaughs, letting Alex know that he had to remove that portrait of Alex Murdaugh's grandfather from that very courtroom where he was just convicted of murder, so he could have a fair trial, letting him know about the power his family has, and trying to understand how he could do something like this. Judge Clifton Newman handed down those consecutive life sentences to Alex Murdaugh while expressing disappointment and bewilderment. Abby, he is an extremely respected judge here in South Carolina. He's had a very measured tone throughout the past six weeks. But he went for it with Alex today, telling him that he knows that he has got to feel something when he closes his eyes at night.

There were no victim impact statements made this morning before sentencing on behalf of Maggie and Paul Murdaugh.Instead, prosecutor Creighton Waters spoke about them and talked about getting justice for them. This is something that has been very difficult for really everybody in this community to see. There has been so much power in this family. There has been so -- there's so many cases. The judge alluded to that. There's so many other victims who the judge still has to oversee charges, those financial charges against Alex Murdaugh, and 90 some different charges that he continues to face. I talked to the attorney general this morning, and he said they will still pursue those, even in light of this life sentence that Alex Murdaugh has. Now, just a few moments ago, Alex Murdaugh's defense attorneys spoke as well. Abby, they say they do plan to file for an appeal within 10 days, a notice of appeal. They maintain that there was just too much reasonable doubt and that they don't think all of the information about the alleged financial crimes of Alex Murdaugh should have been allowed into this trial. Now, look, he got up on the stand and admitted to them. He admitted to lying. He admitted to stealing. And they say that that maybe prejudiced the jury against him, in the defense's point of view. But, again, Abby, it only took three hours from the time that they were charged for them to come back with a verdict. And according to that juror interview this morning, they had decided what they wanted to do within 45 minutes of first polling each other and having a discussion about it.",

And they were moving. And the jurors were very moved by his testimony. But then the next day, on cross-examination, got to give credit where credit's due. I mean, they clearly painted Alex as a liar who can just look you in the face and lie to you.

JOEY JACKSON, CNN LEGAL ANALYSTGood to be with you and Sara. And here's why. Of course, the judge everyday instructs the jury after the conclusion of the case that you're not to discuss the case, you're not to render any decisions or conclusions. Having said that, remember that the jurors are there and they're locked into day in and day out. They were there for six weeks. They're not formulating their opinions automatically, even though the judge says don't render the final determination until you deliberate. So they go into that jury room certainly with an idea as to what they want to do. And they speak about that idea. And it's one thing to have a reasonable doubt. It's another thing to have a doubt that's not founded upon reason, that's not founded upon good judgment, and that has no basis in fact. And so the way I see it is that the jurors came in there, they listened to all they needed to listen to. It was rehashed. They heard closing arguments, they heard rebuttals, they heard all they needed to hear. And based upon the actual defendant himself and his attempt to get on the stand and to give a rendition of events, which, one do you believe, the first one, the second version...",

      "sentences": "Yes.So, Abby I think you and I talked at length about this and how it's a double-edged sword, right? It was never a defense. Addiction is not a defense to a crime, but it's certainly an explanation for the lying and conning and thieving. And this is exactly what I was saying that, at some point, it's going to turn and backfire. And this judge weaponized it. He said, well, maybe you didn't kill your wife and son, but the monster in you did, the addict in you did. So, you know -- and to Joey's point that those eggs that we were talking about yesterday, I didn't take those eggs lightly. I had a brownie case. When jurors bond in that way where they're sharing food for six weeks, and they're really tight and good friends, I always fear that it's pro-prosecution. In my experience, it has been. And so I just think that, also from this juror's interview with ABC earlier, there's a mere presence instruction that was not given in this case, that your mere presence at the crime scene cannot by itself indicate guilt. It's not proof beyond a reasonable doubt of guilt. So, to him, the video alone, even without the lie, was enough to decide verdict in this case. I think he has a strong appeal. I think that if he -- when you take the stand, it sort of locks you into harmless error. But I think he has a lot of other grounds, Fifth Amendment, the admissibility of all the motive evidence. So we will see where it goes.",

We all want it to end immediately. It could end today if Mr. Putin would pull U.S. troops out. That doesn't appear likely right now. We'd like it to end soon. And so do the Ukrainians. What's really important and what President Biden has stressed with every one of his foreign counterparts is, we have got to make sure that nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, that, whatever we do in terms of helping President Zelenskyy get to a point where only he can decide he's ready to negotiate, that he can do it on his terms in circumstances that he can tolerate, the Ukrainian people can tolerate, and that, at the end state, it gets to Ukraine being satisfied that their sovereignty is being respected, that their independence is being preserved.",

There's another package announced today coming from the United States really about more ammunition for the kinds of artillery and rocket systems that they have already been provided.
