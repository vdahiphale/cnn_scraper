She was 74 years old.Along with her sisters, Anita was part of one of the biggest groups in the '70s and '80s with three Grammy Awards and more than a dozen top 20 hits. The next hour of CNN NEWSROOM starts right now. I'm Pamela Brown in Washington. And you are live in the CNN NEWSROOM on this first day of 2023. New developments tonight in the Idaho murder investigation. For the first time, we are hearing from the parents of the suspect in this case, 28-year-old, Bryan Kohberger and they are warning against in their words erroneous assumptions. He is facing four counts of first degree murder in the brutal slains of four young students at the University of Idaho. His arrest is no doubt a relief for a community that has been living in a state of fear since November 13th but as a shock to Kohberger's family. CNN's Veronica Miracle joins us with the latest. So, Veronica, tell us more about what the family is saying today.",

There are no words that can adequately express the sadness we feel and we pray each day for them. We will continue to let the legal process unfold. And as a family, we will love and support our son and brother. We have fully cooperated with law enforcement agencies in an attempt to seek the truth and promote his presumption of innocence rather than judge unknown facts and make erroneous assumptions. We respect privacy in this matter, as our family and the families suffering loss can move forward through the legal process.\" And, Pamela, Bryan Kohbger's attorney has also said that his father came to Washington State to make that cross country drive with Bryan in that white Hyundai Elantra that police had been looking for, all the way to Pennsylvania. It was there so that he could go home and be home in time for the holidays with his family at his parent's house. And that is exactly where he was apprehended by police. According to his attorney, he says at that time, his attorney says both Bryan Kohberger and his father were cooperative at the apprehension. And it is important to note that police have not indicated that Bryan Kohberger's father is, at all, implicated in these murders at this time. Pamela?",

Businesses have lost employees because students -- this is a college town. And so the employees are students and many of them have gone home because they've just been afraid to be here.And so the sense of relief that we're feeling as we walk through Main Street and talk to people, it's just truly profound. We were at the police department yesterday, and there were people bringing, you know, somebody brought by a cake, another business owner, you know, brought by another gift, because they want to express their appreciation to the police department, which for the last seven weeks has really been under scrutiny from not only this community but the entire country.

What do you think?O'TOOLE: I think there's a good possibility of that. And the way I would describe known is that it does not have to imply a close relationship. It doesn't even have to imply a relationship where they were physically around one another. It could imply something that was in passing on social media, or just driving through the neighborhood. So no one has to be defined, I think, very broadly. But I do think there's a very good possibility he was aware of these victims, he was aware of that house.

I mean, that is a much more intimate kind of crime than say shooting someone.O'TOOLE: Yes, it is. Bringing a knife -- a knife is not really an effective weapon. And I say that because you have to get close up and personal with the victims when you use a knife, even to the extent where one hand may have to be on the victim's body while you stabilize them, so that you can stab them. So -- and then factor in this as well, when this offender -- and this is prior to Bryan's arrest, when this offender went into the home, it was in the middle of the night when people are sleeping, there was no intent to rob, there was no intent to sexually assault, it was to kill. And the veracity of these homicides, I think is extremely powerful. And once the information is released about the differences in the injury pattern to the victims, I think we'll be able to see if there was one or two victims who were targeted.",

It's just so awful and horrific. And your heart, again, just goes out to their families.What do you make of the fact that Kohberger has been a student at a nearby university getting his PhD and criminal justice and criminology? And it's interesting, the source I spoke to yesterday, who was chatting with him on December 16th said he made it clear, he was really interested in behavioral criminology not procedural. O'TOOLE: Well, it's -- it really is interesting. And when you -- in working a case, like a serial murder case or a mass murder case, we always go in and look for what are they reading? What are they studying? And in most cases, it's not a formal degree program that they're in. But we do know that offenders will read up on how to do it better. They'll read up on how to avoid being apprehended. They'll read up on, you know, forensic evidence, not that they're necessarily experts, but that is pretty common. But to be in a structured doctoral program, I think is very interesting. It's not the first time though. Ted Bundy got his degree in psychology. BTK, the Bind, Torture, Kill offender got his degree in criminology as well. And then, of course, the Unabomber got his PhD in mathematics and he was constructing bombs which required some kind of a science background.

Sometimes general public will think somebody just snapped and became a violent offender, that doesn't happen either. Violence begins in the brain. And by that, I mean, there's the rumination about violence, the thinking about it, the going over and over it and looking for ways to learn more about it. So it evolves over time. And again, in my experience, with cases like this, whether it's serial or mass, is that the behavior starts at a pretty early age. And if there are personality disorders involved, and we'll know that as this case evolves, there are some mental health conditions, some -- including personality disorders that have a heavy genetic dose to it as well, not saying that's applicable here, but they'll certainly be looking at that in terms of trying to better understand the behavior. But it goes back quite a ways. It doesn't just start at 27, 28 years of age.",

Now this could have huge health ramifications down the road. Not only do these young people have to grapple with diabetes, but diabetes puts you at a much higher risk for complications of things like heart disease.

You can use those points potentially for next holiday season. So that's resolution number two, open a new credit card this year, get that signup bonus as long as you're not carrying a balance. Also, book your trips using a credit card that has travel protection. We saw no better reason for this than the Southwest meltdown. Those folks who were booking with an American Express Platinum or a Chase Sapphire, those folks, they can get paid back for all the expenses they incurred even if Southwest doesn't, which Southwest, it looks like, is going to pay most people back, but they will protect you even if it's a weather cancellation.

And that funeral, it was interesting because the Vatican today also, for the first time, released photographs of Pope Benedict after he passed away and said that Pope Francis, his successor, actually was one of the first by his side after he passed away.And then the Vatican also released that letter that Pope Benedict left behind. And it really spans a lot of topics. He thanks his family, he obviously thanks the Catholic Church, also, the country where he's from Germany, what he calls his second home here in Italy as well. And then he talks about the wrongful things that he's done and asking for forgiveness. That was really a very interesting passage in that final letter. I want to read you that passage really quickly where he says, quote, \"To all those I have wronged, in any way, I sincerely asked for forgiveness. What I said before to my compatriots, I now say to all those in the church who have been entrusted to my service, remain firm in the faith. Don't get confused.\" So Pope Benedict there, obviously, alluding to the fact that he has wronged some people. Some folks taking that to mean that maybe he's talking about some of the abuse scandals that came to light while he was Pope. But we also have to keep in mind as well, Pamela, that in the final months of his life, he also acknowledged that he had made mistakes in cases of abuse, while he was already the archbishop in Munich in the late '70s and early '80s as well. So that's also something that this could pertain to. It was quite interesting because the last sentence of that letter that was released after his death, he said that he realized that he had committed sins, that he was someone who had a person with mistake, but he's still requested humbly, he said, to be admitted into God's heaven, despite the fact that he was an imperfect human being, Pamela.",

But as of now, the baby has yet to be born. But congrats to him and his growing family. Well, if a call like that is not dramatic enough, those two college football semifinal games were shocking, to say the least. TCU upsetting Michigan and the defending national champions, the Georgia Bulldogs, pulled off a crazy comeback from behind for a victory over Ohio State. One week from tomorrow, Georgia and TCU will face off in the national championship game. Morgan Moriarty joins us now. She is the college football reporter for Bleacher Report. Let's start with the Michigan-TCU game. The Frogs were unranked to start the season. They were a big underdog yesterday. Who expected this outcome?",

If it wasn't for USC losing to Utah in the Pac-12 title game, Ohio State wouldn't have been in this.Instead, they come into this game as an underdog and they do pretty much what no other team has done against Georgia all season. They're able to hold off Georgia's pass rush and that gives Ohio State quarterback, CJ Stroud, a ton of time to throw. We really saw Georgia's secondary very exploited in one-on-one matchups going up against those Ohio State receivers. Obviously, Marvin Harrison Jr., although he was out late in that game, but he had a great game. Credits with CJ Stroud, he finishes with 348 yard passing, four touchdowns. Just incredible job by him. I can't wait to see what he does in the NFL. But Kirby's right, I mean, Ohio State was the better team. Credit to Georgia for coming back in that last-minute drive, putting together a touchdown. A guy who catches the touchdown pass A.D. Mitchell, wasn't even in the starting lineup for most of this season. He missed nine games due to injury. He catches the winning touchdown pass. Credit to Stetson Bennett, you know, he had a pretty good night, although it was a little bit of a slow start. But, yes, I mean, Ohio State did an incredible job of exploiting Georgia secondary. And I think that's going to be key for TCU. They now know that if you get some one-on-one matchups in the Georgia secondary, as talented as that unit is, you can make some plays down the field.",

You have the game plan for TCU to beat Georgia. I don't know if I'm ready to make a prediction yet, just because I got to see some injury reports. And I think Kendre Miller, you know, if he gets back for TCU, that's going to be key. But this will be a huge matchup.
