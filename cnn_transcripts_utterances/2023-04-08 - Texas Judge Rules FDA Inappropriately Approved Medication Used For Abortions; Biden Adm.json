I'm Fredricka Whitfield, and we begin this hour with a pair of dueling decisions, creating a flash point in the fight for abortion rights. In Texas a federal judge is halting the FDA's more than two decades old approval of the drug mifepristone, one of the main medications used to provide abortions.But less than an hour later, a conflicting court ruling out of Washington state. A judge there ordered the federal government to protect access to the drug in 17 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia. The two decisions are the most significant on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last summer. CNN's Rosa Flores and Arlette Saenz are following all of the developments. Rosa, to you first. Why did the Texas judge suspend the FDA approval of this drug? Take us through the judge's order.",

      "sentences": "Fred, this judge did not hold back in this order. It's 67 pages, and in those 67 pages he rips apart the FDA's approval of mifepristone, saying that the approval was flawed, that the FDA did not consider the risks to girls and women.Let me take you through some of what the order says. This judge says that the FDA's refusal to impose certain restrictions on this drug, quote, \"resulted in many deaths and many more severe or life- threatening adverse reactions.\" It goes on to say, \"Due to the FDA's lax reporting requirements, the exact number is not ascertainable, but it is likely far higher than its data indicate.\" It goes on to say, \"Whatever the numbers are, they likely could be considerably lower had FDA not acquiesced to the pressure to increase access to chemical abortion at the expense of women's safety.\" Now there has been an outpouring of reaction from the medical community, fact checking the statements made by this judge in this order. Let's not forget, this judge is not a doctor. He is not a subject matter expert. So these are the subject matter experts, the scientists correcting the record, saying that this drug is safe. Some of those organizations include the American Medical Association. The president of that organization issuing a statement saying, in part, this ruling, quote, \"flies in the face of science and evidence and threatens to upend access to a safe and effective drug.\" The statement goes on to say, \"The court's disregard for well-established scientific facts in favor of speculative allegations and ideological assertions will cause harm to our patients and undermines the health of the nation.\" Now, Fred, one other thing that's clear from this order is that this judge also did not consider some of the arguments from the FDA, which included what these legal -- what these medical experts are saying, and that is that this drug was approved by the FDA back in 2000 that has been used by about five million women, and that this drug is safe.

Now, in a statement last night, President Biden warrant of the national ramifications of this decision, saying, quote, \"This does not just affect women in Texas. If it stands, it would prevent women in every state from accessing the medication regardless of whether abortion is legal in a state.\" He added, \"It is it is the next big step toward the national ban on abortion that Republican elected officials have vowed to make law in America.\" The president also issued a warning about what this could mean for other prescription drugs which are approved by the FDA, saying that this could potentially, if it stands, put all of them at risk. That was a sentiment that was echoed by Vice President Kamala Harris last night. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) KAMALA HARRIS, (D) VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It is contrary to what makes for good public health policy to allow courts and politicians to tell the FDA what it should do. This is a drug that the FDA approved as safe 20 years ago and has proven to be safe for 20 years. So this is a dangerous precedent. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

Joining me right now on the phone is New York Governor Kathy Hochul. Governor, glad you could be with me. So first, what is your reaction to this ruling handed down in Texas? GOV. KATHY HOCHUL, (D-NY) (through telephone):  This ruling is simply horrifying. And you just wonder, when will this stop? One year ago, women in this country had a constitutionally protected right to an abortion. Roe v. Wade was the law of the land for half-a-century. And within a couple of months from this time we lost those rights, and now it's the MAGA judges and the MAGA legislatures, the extremists in the Republican Party, they just won't stop. And now they're coming after all other forms, medication provided abortions, which have been legalized, as you just reported, for over 20 years. So New York state has to step up as we did after the Dobbs decision when we provided $35 million for providers to be able to ramp up their services in anticipation of more women coming to our state. But with this time, we're also concerned about the next phase, and I think they're going to be coming after the secondary drug misoprostol, which is something that is used for ulcers, and I can see them now challenging this. And this is not as effective as the drug they overruled yesterday, but it's one that in New York we want to make sure that that's available. So I have legislation that's going to the legislature one day, and we'll be talking about requiring insurance companies to cover this as a drug that's used for abortions. So we're trying to figure out all the different ways we can get ahead of this. But it is frustrating as a woman, the first governor of a state that had legalized abortion three years before Roe v. Wade, so this is part of who we are as New Yorkers. These are rights we cherish, have always taken for granted. And this is an insult to all women, and it has to stop.",

We have to get it passed through two consecutive legislatures. We did it just a couple of months ago, and this will be on the ballot in 2024. And this will mobilize women all across the state of New York when we take back the House of Representatives, make sure that President Biden remains our president, and add even more senators to support Chuck Schumer, our majority leader.

Certainly, the fact that he missed the event at the Coliseum last night would normally be cause for concern, but I think was a rather prudent decision on his part because it has been very cold in Rome, and if you're getting over bronchitis, you don't need to be out at 9:00 at night in front of the Coliseum. We saw him on Thursday at a juvenile jail, Fred, which was really a lovely event, and he seemed in very good spirits. He was washing the feet of 12 young people in that jail. That's something that they traditionally do on the Thursday before Easter. So actually, we have seen him every, almost every day from when he got out of the hospital on Saturday. I saw him personally on Saturday and spoke to him and heard his voice was a bit low, soft, kind of whispery voice. Well, we just heard him now. It's quite strong, and he seems to have recovered fairly well. He has one more event to go tomorrow, Easter Sunday in St. Peter's Square. So it has been a challenging week for the Pope.

Think of all the things the Pope has to do, but his fundamental task is to witness to the resurrection of Jesus from the dead. So that we have the successor of Saint Peter -- the successor of Julius Caesar is long gone, long disappeared. But strangely, the successor of Peter is still here in the city of Rome, and the Pope is proclaiming the resurrection within a few yards of where the body of Saint Peter lies.

Now Governor DeSantis has since found out that Disney made this maneuver at the last second, even though this was all done in the public. And when I talked to several long-term Disney historians, they were baffled that DeSantis let this happen. This is a company that he's been fixated on for more than a year, and yet he didn't realize that they were holding these two meetings in the public, where they had shifted the power from the special district to the company.

Florida actually has some unique laws that allow minors to be charged as adults with more frequency and with more lenient standards than other states.So in Florida, the state attorney makes the determination about taking a course of action called a direct file. And a direct file means that the case is taken out of juvenile court and put into the regular court system, and they're tried as adults. The criteria that's looked at is the severity of the crime, whether or not there have been past instances with law enforcement, and the role that that individual person played in the crime that occurred. Of course, here you have the most severe, murder, but there might be different levels of culpability, and a defense attorney will raise that, especially with respect to a 12-year-old who was very young and the context of juvenile court.",

Is there someone who is engaging in actively hiding or helping that person evade law enforcement? So the net could be cast wider, but there's no diminished action on the part of prosecutors just because the victims might have been a part of the criminal enterprise as well.",

Investigators say a dermatologist, Yue \"Emily\" Yu is facing multiple felony charges amid accusations of poisoning her husband with a liquid drain cleaner. Yu's husband says he set up a hidden camera inside the home after he noticed a strange taste in his drink. And according to court documents, the videos show her pouring the cleaner into his lemonade. Yu's lawyer says her husband engineered these events, that they commonly used Drano, this drain cleaner, mixed with lemonade to actually kill ants in the home. So how difficult might this case be?",

It spins clockwise, pulls in that northerly wind. We wind up with all of this cold rain. And it's one band after the next. and we're really starting to set into this nasty, steady cold air and rain right over Augusta.Widening things out, showing you how it's really filled in from the last few hours, so hopefully we can get this next around done. And behind it, even more rain, so it's not over with. This is going to be the rest of the afternoon and into the evening. And yes, it will get heavy at times. You'll see the yellows popping pockets of heavier, steadier rain. Unfortunately, there is the possibility of a few lightning strikes as well. Now it's nothing severe, but it's just annoying to get those delays when you're trying to get this thing wrapped up so we don't have to add an extra day. As for the rest of the evening, here we are increasing the rain chances. You saw it on radar, more and more rain heading in that direction, and it's cold. Our temperatures aren't even breaking 50 degrees. We're in the 40s. On top of it, we add in a northeast wind thanks to that high that's hanging up to the north in the northeast. And it brings it in at about 10 to 15 miles per hour, gusts I saw reaching up to 20 miles per hour. When you factor that in with a 45 degree temperature, it feels like we're in the thirties. So we do need to be careful as we're out there. Yes, it is really nasty. Sunday and Monday, thankfully, we dry out and there's hope, hope, for a little bit of sunshine to finally crank us back up into the 60s. That's it.",
