It was such an incredible moment, if you cover Congress to be so brazen, in sort of how aggressive you are about going after the Speaker. So this is a few that continues. Also, we should know that Matt Gaetz is under investigation by the House Ethics Committee. And at every turn, Kevin McCarthy has reminded us this week, he is not going to be getting involved in the House Ethics probe. So a little bit of a backstory there for you. John?",

He used this term, \"she had limited value.\" The inhumane awful words used by a Seattle officer about a woman who had been hit and killed by another officer's patrol car.He uttered those words just a day after the 23-year-old woman was fatally struck. It seemed like it was all a joke to him. He laughed throughout its comments and all of it was caught on body camera. Now, as you might imagine, an investigation is underway. CNN's Camila Bernal is joining me now from Los Angeles. Camila, a community group is calling the remarks heartbreaking, insensitive, but what are you hearing about a report on the reaction from the officer who just happens to be the vice president of the police officers guild there in Seattle?",

So yes, this is now all under investigation.I want to go over exactly what happened according to police documents. This actually happened on January 23. And Officer Daniel Auderer was responding to this crash. It was actually another officer that hit and killed the 23-year-old Jaahnavi Kandula. And what we're reading through these documents is that the officer that killed the woman was driving at about 74 miles an hour and he was responding to an overdose call. And so, Officer Daniel Auderer was sent to the scene because he was a trained drug recognition expert so he needed to check to see if that officer was impaired in any way. The phone conversation was then recorded the following day January 24. It's a one-sided conversation but as you mentioned, he's heard laughing and saying that this life was of limited value. Here it is you can listen to it yourself. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The Seattle Community Police Commission saying that he was reportedly speaking to the president of the union. We've reached out to everyone involved. We've not heard back from any of these officers.But we do know according to a conservative radio host on KTTH AM, they obtained the statement that the officer gave the office of police accountability. And part of that statement, I want to read it, because this is his defense, saying that it was a mockery to the lawyers and then saying, \"I do understand that if a citizen were to hear that, they would rightfully believe I was being insensitive to the loss of human life. The comment was not made with malice or hard heart. It was quite the opposite\". So again, this is his explanation. We'll have to wait and see what the investigation reveals to then really see what happens to this officer. But a lot of people saying this is extremely insensitive to say that a human life had limited value. Sara?",

The Republican presidential candidate and Florida's Surgeon General advising anyone under the age of 65 not to get the new COVID- 19 booster shots. That's directly contradictory to the CDC recommendation. It says everyone over the age of six months should get that booster.CNN Steve Contorno is in St. Petersburg for us. Steve, why is the DeSantis administration taking on this fight and putting up this particular advice to people without being a doctor?",

      "sentences": "Sara, so Governor DeSantis yesterday held a roundtable with a panel of doctors who have been outside of the mainstream on the coronavirus issue. And, you know, before this event started, there was signage that said no way FDA. So clearly sort of signaling what the tone of the conversation was going to be.And at the end of it, DeSantis said this, quote, \"I will not stand by and let the FDA and CDC use healthy Floridians as guinea pigs for new booster shots that have not been proven to be safe or effective\". Now, that's the opposite of what the CDC and FDA obviously are saying. They're saying that these shots and these boosters are safe, and they are effective. And I should point out that this is not the first time that Florida has been out of step with the rest of the country on the COVID vaccine. He was the -- DeSantis administration was the only one to recommend young children not to get the vaccine. They were the only one to recommend young men not get to the vaccine. And they also were the only states to not work with the Biden administration to help distribute vaccines to young children when they became available. And so this is another issue where DeSantis is not just fighting with the federal government, but also he's out of line with every Democrat and Republican run state in this country. Of course. DeSantis is running for president and one of the things he has been trying to differentiate himself with Donald Trump has been the coronavirus. He has accused Donald Trump of listening too much to Dr. Anthony Fauci. And he has been critical of the vaccines that Trump has counted as one of his top achievements at the end of his term. So this is obviously a step that is going to affect potentially the lives and the health of Floridians. But it's also coming with the backdrop of a presidential race, where COVID, as we see in these cases go up in recent weeks has become centered to some of the arguments we're hearing from Republican candidates, Sara. SIDNER: And yet he is very far behind Donald Trump at this point in time. If you look at the polling, Donald Trump is way, way ahead of him now, further than he's ever been before.
