This sounds incredibly familiar, right? These issues, though, will be front and center as Brazilians take to the polls on Sunday -- listen. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NEWTON (voice-over):  Millions more in Brazil now are armed and ready. Ready to load, aim, and fire. Gun ownership -- who can own them, and why people need them has become an election issue. And it's the president himself, Jair Bolsonaro, who wants more Brazilians to bear arms. He has loosened strict gun ownership laws and made promises of more gun rights to come. NEWTON (on camera):  Win or lose, Bolsonaro's armed masses aren't going anywhere. NEWTON (voice-over):  One of the owners of this gun club tells us Bolsonaro is the best gun salesman he's ever had. DANIEL PAZZINI, SAO PAULO GUN CLUB OWNER (through translator):  He basically did free advertising, encouraging people to buy guns and defend themselves that way. NEWTON (voice-over):  Daniel Pazzini tells me he believes Bolsonaro's opponent, former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, may try to crack down on gun ownership if he wins. He doubts it will work but like most gun owners, he's not chancing it. He's voting for Bolsonaro. Many devout evangelicals, too, are faithful to God and Bolsonaro. Pastor Odilon Santos says it is his right to take the stand on politics and influence others in his battle against abortion, gay rights, and drug legalization. PASTOR ODILON SANTOS, SAO PAULO (through translator):  Our current president has an agenda aimed at protecting all of that -- those principles which are a rule of faith in our practice. NEWTON (voice-over):  As for Lula, he doesn't trust him even though he wrote an open letter to evangelicals saying he wouldn't touch religious freedom. SANTOS (through translator):  His very public stance is that he will regulate not just the church but a lot of things, including the media and social media. NEWTON (voice-over):  To be clear, Lula has never said he will restrict media, guns, or religious freedom. Which brings us to the issue of misinformation as presidential supporters at this rally claim Lula will separate Brazilians from their creator. They accuse judges and bureaucrats of shutting down free speech with new regulations aimed at stopping the spread of false information. Bolsonaro's son tells us his father is defending freedom and will fight what he calls censorship. EDUARDO BOLSONARO, LAWMAKER AND PRESIDENT BOLSONARO'S SON:  It's unbelievable. They just say this is fake news, this is anti- democratic. They actually arrest you. NEWTON (voice-over):  Lula, meantime, campaigns on reversing Bolsonaro's influence on social issues, which he says have ruined Brazil. \"Believe me,\" he says, \"we are going to revive this country.\" In this tight presidential runoff, it has been a ballot box trifecta -- guns, God, and so-called fake news. Where voters stand on each contentious will shape this country's future. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
