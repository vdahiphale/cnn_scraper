I'm going to speak to a former Trump official who has inside information on that crucial meeting.Plus, Russian fighters speaking out exclusively to CNN. And we're hearing incredible new details about their struggle to stay alive. No food for days, no water, forced to drink snow to survive. And padlocks over the frozen burritos. Mustard locked behind plexiglass. All this to keep shoplifters at bay. Our CNN reporter witnessed three thefts in 30 minutes in the same San Francisco Walgreens. She'll tell you about it. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, the Trump flip-flop that could get him indicted. The special counsel Jack Smith investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election is now focusing on an Oval Office meeting, which then President Trump praised election security in which he praised election security. You heard me right there. I mean, sources are telling CNN exclusively the prosecutors are asking former U.S. officials about this meeting, which was in February 2020, a meeting in which President Trump was heard commending officials in charge of security for the upcoming election, which, of course, at that point was about nine months away. In fact, Trump was so pleased at what he heard about election security in that meeting, that he suggested that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security hold a press conference to tout their hard work. Well, in a moment, I'm going to talk to Olivia Troye, former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to Vice President Mike Pence who was closely involved with this meeting. But this is all remarkable to hear because, I mean, you'd be forgiven by saying, wait, did I just get this backwards in some way. Because just a few short weeks later, of course, Biden was gaining steam, leading Trump in national head-to- head matchups. And suddenly, Trump's tune changed. Here he is in April of 2020 just two months after that Oval Office meeting. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Another thing I think is really interesting in this new reporting from our colleagues is that they also asked multiple witnesses if Trump ever retaliated against other officials who contradicted his public criticism of election integrity.This is significant because it all goes to knowledge and intent. So what exactly did Trump know, and what was the intent behind so many of these public statements?

We learned that just yesterday, the special counsel was given thousands of pages of documents related to Rudy Giuliani and his team of folks that were trying to find any fraud related to the 2020 election.One member of that legal team is the former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik. Now, he had previously declined to hand over a lot of these materials to investigators on the Hill when they were looking into January 6th, citing privilege. But now that the special counsel has reached out, they have waived -- the Trump campaign has waived that privilege and they are providing these documents. Now, Erin, that suggests that they don't believe there is anything incriminating here. But you can bet investigators are likely going over this line by line to inform any potential charges. But we also know that Bernie Kerik has now scheduled his own interview, his first interview with the special counsel. That's going to happen in the next few weeks. So I'm sure after they go through these documents, they're going to have some follow-up questions for him. We know they've already spoken with Rudy Giuliani, but they could always call him back.",

RYAN GOODMAN, JUST SECURITY CO-EDITOR-IN-CHIEF: It could be very valuable because it does get into Donald Trump's mindset. If Smith can prove that Donald Trump understood that the election was safe and secure, which this evidence seems to suggest exactly that with multiple witnesses at the meeting, and then when it's not convenient for him to say that, instead he's trying to spin a narrative of an election that was stolen, he turns around and fires the very person that he wanted to give a press conference.",

That was a coordinated effort that was happening at the time.The one thing that was tense was the Russia topic because that was right around the time when the acting -- well, the director of national intelligence, Admiral Joseph Maguire who was a very longtime mentor of mine, and former boss of mine, and I very close, where he briefed about possible Russian interference and the preference of Moscow that Trump be elected over Biden. And that did not go over quite well with the president. A week later, I remember this vividly because I was beside myself and shocked when I had heard that Joe Maguire had resigned.

The bleakest fate, prisoners recruited by the ministry of defense basically as cannon fodder. These so-called Storm-Z battalions surrendering here, have death rates hard to fathom. Here are two rare stories. One of them incredible survival, and another of a young and quick death, told to CNN a great risk from inside Russia. Ex-con Sergiy (ph) barely made it back, now he works two jobs and can't sleep because his ears still ring form shell shock. We first talked when he's been shot for the second time. From 600 prisoners recruited with him in October, he says only 170 are alive, and only two of them without injury. Sent again and again in waves to attack Ukrainian positions. RUSSIAN CONVICT (through translator): I remember most clearly the last of the nine concussions I had. We attacked. RPGs, drones flew at us, our commander yells on the radio, I don't care, go ahead, don't come back until you take this position. Two of us found a small hole and dived in there. A drone threw a grenade at us and it landed in the 30 centimeter gap between us, my friend was covered with shrapnel all over. Yet, I was untouched somehow. But I lost my sight for five hours.",

DAVID PETRAEUS (RET.), FORMER CIA DIRECTOR; FORMER U.S. CENTCOM COMMANDER: Well, I think Nick has it right in that there has to be some degree of fragility. Now, keep in mind that these are the former prisoners. They were treated even worse than the normal bad treatment that Russian commanders mete out to their soldiers.

I've got video here showing Ukrainian forces using those cluster munitions against Russian troops. Do you think that those could be a game changer? And, if not, do they have what they need? They don't even have enough artillery. President Zelenskyy's very clear about that. PETRAEUS: Well, they will be a big help, and, particularly, against, for example, artillery units, which is really one of the most formidable of the Russian capabilities against troops in trench lines, against reserve force assembly areas, and so forth. And they can be very, very helpful. Indeed, they're also helpful because the Ukrainians are running out of conventional artillery munitions. This is yet another type of munition.

It was one that used to be deniable, now, it's very clearly out in the open. And then they really did, though, want to clip Prigozhin's wings. They threatened him. It was an existential threat. They were going to cut off his contracts, and also force his soldiers either to sign a contract with the ministry of defense or go home. Now they've added a third option. They can go to Belarus and train Belarusian soldiers for whatever that is worth. But, Putin, I think, feels that he has sufficiently shown that he is firmly still in control. You will remember the pomp and circumstance a day or two later where he praised the work of the security services, which really wasn't all that deserving of praise. You may recall that it was Prigozhin who lost nerve and realized this wasn't going to turn out well, and took the deal and turned his forces around. But it's still a useful asset for Putin. And I think that's -- the source of this. And if I could go back to the earlier question, I should've pointed out that the Ukrainians do very much need additional artillery ammunition, of all times. They need additional air defense munitions and air defense systems. Odesa is, as we have seen, much less capable than is obviously Kyiv. You've been in Kyiv.
