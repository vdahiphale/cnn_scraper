And some of their demands include a promise to put more conservatives on key committees, a promise of leadership not to play in primaries, and a promise to restore this process that would allow any single member to force a vote on deposing the sitting speaker. That is something that Kevin McCarthy has been adamantly against.But Manu Raju and I are hearing that McCarthy might be willing to negotiate as he's struggling to get the 218 votes for speaker, and he is certainly in negotiating mode right now.

And that's where you go if you want to speak to his crowd, as Melanie just noted, willing to negotiate even essentially his authority, meaning any one member could raise up any day, twice a day, if you feel like it, and say let's have a vote to depose the speaker that's, he's negotiating, you would have to argue from a position of weakness, right?",

But he traveled the country, he raised a lot of money, and yet he still does not have the votes.And so it's clear that he's meeting with hardline conservatives, and that he's going to have to make concessions. But the question of whether he gives them this ask about the motion to vacate, where essentially challengers is authority. And this is what happened with Speaker Boehner, where any single member could challenge his authority. He has said that's a red line for him.

And so they're going to do, so Don Bacon, who is a more centrist Republican from Nebraska, who's on team McCarthy says to the hardliners, if you keep messing with us, maybe we do have to come up with a plan B, but it won't -- you won't like it.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP.

You could also argue maybe that an Elise Stefanik could do it, although with Donald Trump, her biggest benefactor right now political supporter right now, in a very weak position, unclear if that would happen.We have to remember that unlike every other leadership position, the Speaker of the House is a constitutional one, which means that the votes we're talking about happen on the floor, and they happen among every single member.

But first you have seven, seven who say, we want concessions, they want -- they say they want this of anyone who would be speaker. You know, as I said, no leadership involvement in primaries restoring so you could vacate the chair and more conservatives on key Committees, 72 hours to read a bill before a vote, so there's those seven demanding that and that's part of their demands right there.And then you have five more who have said, we will not vote for Kevin McCarthy under any circumstances. Now there's one or two of them in there that team McCarthy thinks they can get, possibly with negotiations, maybe it's a Committee assignment, maybe it's some other concessions. But that's 12. That's 12 for a guy who can only lose three or four. ZOLAN KANNO-YOUNGS, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: And it's not just the concessions, but also just the different ways that he's already trying to incentivize the Republicans to come together here. That includes floating out. Look, we have a plan to bring Ale Mayorkas, the Homeland Security Secretary to Congress. That happens more effectively if we're unified here. That also includes establishing a Committee to focus on competing with China, talking about also kicking Democratic lawmakers off the Committee's. Already we're starting to see in these negotiations, real concessions here and incentives that also could have a real impact on the congressional outlook in the months to come.",

People are getting sick, just like the rest of us are not getting as sick because they have been vaccinated. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, General Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Joint Chiefs, have all indicated they believe that the vaccine works and it should be continued to be a mandate.But now, widespread bipartisan support on the Hill to do away with it. And all the indicators politically, John, are that President Biden is likely to sign that piece of legislation, and therefore the mandate will go away. So what are we left with? What about countries like Japan and South Korea where U.S. troops routinely deploy? And they have to have the vaccine to get into those countries, that will impact readiness. Will there be an impact on recruiting if less troops get the vaccine and still join the military? What will the impact be? There are some indicators not entirely clear that people have avoided joining the military because they didn't want to take the vaccine. What about the small relatively number of troops who have been dismissed from military service because they refuse to get the vaccine, will they be allowed back in? And bottom line fundamentally, what now for the troops? How will they be kept safe from COVID?

One key inflation measure does show prices cooling off in November, but still they remain high. And the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index shows Americans, that means you, are feeling slightly more confident about the economy. This coming as a new CNN poll, look at these numbers, find the President's approval rating, his job approval rating is up to 46 percent after drifting as low as 38 percent back in June and July.

This is inflation that's in the pipeline before it reaches you and I as consumers. Wholesale prices up 7.4 percent year over year, 0.3 percent month over month, both of them harder than expected. I think there's some good news and bad news. The good news is that this 7.4 percent figure, this is actually an 18 month low. And this is the fifth straight month of improvement. So that is a good sign. The bad is that these numbers are still very high historically.And we know that high inflation has really soured Americans views on this economy. Now we actually had some potentially good news on that front today, the University of Michigan saying that consumer sentiment ticked higher this month, that is coming as gas prices fall sharply. But as you can see on this chart, sentiment remains very low historically. And one thing to keep an eye on here, John, is that consumer expectations of employment fell and it actually is now at the lowest level in 11 years. John?",
