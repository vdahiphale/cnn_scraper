The government stop publishing it, and some local governments are so broke. Medical benefits for seniors have been cut, leading to protests. Tough times across the country. Yet this is the Chinese economy, government officials are eager to show the world bustling factory floors, a free trade zone, and an industrial park dotted with international companies. Among the sites we saw on a state-sponsored trip to Northeastern China, rare access inside the heart of what many call China`s Rust Belt. Are you able to have success despite all of the economic challenges facing China right now? UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  China`s economy as a whole is improving. We are confident that we can make a corresponding contribution to the general trend of development.",

Officially China`s economy is improving based on GDP, but the rebound isn`tas fast as many investors had hoped, especially in a post-COVID world. (On camera):  The Chinese government is certainly looking to foreign investment to help jumpstart its economy. But it`s also focusing on factories like this one. (Voice-over):  An effort to make sure it still churn out enough products for export keeping China as the world`s factory. At the same time, upgrading key industries, especially tech to become self-reliant or even leaping ahead of the U.S. and other rivals.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency was established in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter. And a belated happy birthday to you, Mr. Carter turned 99 years old, three days ago. All right, today at 2:20 p.m. Eastern time, don`t be alarmed if you hear an alarm coming from your phone. Here in the U.S., that sounds a little like me or something like that. FEMA will be conducting a scheduled test of the wireless Emergency Alert System. So if you`re not supposed to have your phone in class, you better leave it in your locker during that time, because those devices are all scheduled to go off at two 20 Eastern. Federal law requires the systems to be tested once every three years to help ensure that they`ll be able to effectively warn the public about big emergencies. All radios and TVs will also be tested. Today`s test will be the seventh such nationwide drill, but only the second time it includes all cell devices. There have been some alert system hiccups in the past, like the false alarm at the state level that woke some folks up at 4:00 in the morning. And most notably in Hawaii in 2018, an emergency worker hit the wrong button, sending out a false alarm for an incoming missile that employee lost her job after that incident. Driverless vehicles are continuing to pop up all around the world, once just a tailpipe dream, we now have driverless taxis in certain cities, even driverless tractors, tilling farmland, but our Senior Automotive Reporter, Peter Valdes-Dapena, explores weather will ever get to a place where driverless cars are fully accepted. He says a truly driverless world might always be two years away. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) PETER VALDES-DAPENA, CNN SENIOR AUTOMOTIVE REPORTER:  The idea of driverless cars, I think has been around since cars became commonplace on American roads. Certainly since the 30s. My favorite movie, when I was growing up was probably The Love Bug, where is this Volkswagen. That`s essentially a self-driving conscious entity in an automobile.",

And you had companies talking about driverless cars with somebody in a control tower, talking to you about like, OK, take your hands off the wheel now. And we`ll -- we`ll take you home. This idea`s been around because it just seems so obvious. Automobile self-moving, well, it should be fully automobile and -- and drive itself. Some 46,000 people a year die in automobile crashes, autonomous cars, if they become ubiquitous, would virtually eliminate that. The thinking is since the majority of crashes are caused by \"human error,\" if we eliminate humans, we would eliminate the errors. But let`s face it, when driverless cars are in the news, they`re in the news for screwing up.",

Self-driving is one of the reasons that people are working so hard on artificial intelligence. You know, it`s one thing to keep the land on the highway, but to actually like fully drive requires an almost human like ability to improvise. In the years I`ve been covering this industry, fully autonomous cars are always two years away. And they keep being two years away. Now, when it comes, it`s not going to be all at once. For example, already, we`re seeing things like in agriculture with self-driving tractors, farmers can go out there and program the machine, go home, have breakfast, work around the farm. While the field is plowed by an autonomous tractor. This holds the promise of democratizing automobiles. You don`t have to have a driver`s license. You don`t have to know how to drive. When the world gets to a point where a mom or a dad can take their kindergarten age kid down to a car and say, here son, get in this car. It`s going to take you to school. Because it`s one thing for me to get in a driver`s car and be willing to take that risk when I can put a young child in that car. That`s the ultimate test. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
