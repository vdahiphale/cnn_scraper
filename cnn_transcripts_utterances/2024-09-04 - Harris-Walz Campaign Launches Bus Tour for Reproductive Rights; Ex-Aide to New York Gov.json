DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ (D-FL): You can't trust a damn word out of that liar's mouth, no matter what he says. Florida is ground zero for his extreme anti-reproductive freedom agenda, and he wants to keep it that way. SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-MN): We are just 10 miles from Mar-a-Lago, home of one Donald J. Trump. He is the one who got us into this mess. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

The Hayes estate is the first to take their complaints to court.And we have major updates on two of the many legal issues facing Donald Trump. Lawyers for the former U.S. president have entered a not guilty plea to the revised January 6th election subversion charges. Special counsel Jack Smith updated his instant -- indictment last month after a Supreme Court ruling granted immunity for some of Trump's conduct, which fell within his presidential powers. Judge Tanya Chutkan has scheduled a hearing for Thursday to decide how to proceed with the case. Meanwhile, a judge rejected Trump's request to have his hush money trial moved to federal court. A jury found Trump guilty on 34 felony counts back in May. The federal judge says there's nothing in the Supreme Court's immunity ruling that would change his view of the fact the payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels were private, unofficial acts. Trump's attorneys have also asked to postpone his September 18th sentencing. And a former aide to two New York governors has been charged with acting as an agent for the Chinese government. Current Governor Kathy Hochul says she's furious and outraged at what she calls brazen behavior by her former deputy chief of staff, Linda Sun. Sun was arrested Tuesday and charged with charges including violating the Foreign Agents Restriction Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering conspiracy. CNN's Gloria Pazmino has more now on this from New York. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",
