She says the U.S. could reach its debt limit and default as soon as June 1st, just four weeks from now. We'll discuss the really dire implications for the U.S. economy, if that happens, with the former treasury secretary, Larry Summers.Also tonight, a huge dust storm causes multiple deaths and dozens of car wrecks in a massive interstate pileup. We're tracking this weather disaster in Illinois. And an intensifying manhunt in Texas after a gunman killed five neighbors including a nine-year-old little boy. Authorities pleading for the public's help as this armed and very dangerous suspect has been on the loose since Friday. Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer. You're in THE SITUATION ROOM. And let's get straight to the breaking news. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's very, very blunt warning about the U.S. debt limit. CNN is covering the story from every angle. Our correspondents are standing by over at the White House, on Capitol Hill, and in the nation's financial center in New York City. We're also about to get reaction from former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. He's standing by live. But, first, let's go to our Chief White House Correspondent Phil Mattingly. Phil, one month is not a lot of time to fix this huge, huge potential disaster. What is Yellen warning of tonight specifically and what is the president doing behind the scenes?",

      "sentences": "You know, Wolf, for months, Republican leaders and the White House have essentially been in a stare down, two very non-compatible positions making very clear there's no clear pathway forward in terms of how to raise the debt ceiling unless something dramatic changed.One thing that has changed today with that letter from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen up to Capitol Hill leaders, the urgency of this moment. The timeline in terms of when default would actually occur has always been a little bit of ambiguous, tied to tax receipts which in April came in less than what was expected. Therefore, that timeline now could be as soon as June 1st, giving lawmakers and the White House one month to take action to avoid a catastrophic and first in the nation's history default. As that letter was hitting Capitol Hill inboxes, President Biden was on the phone with the top four leaders in Congress, both Republican and Democrat, inviting them to the White House for a meeting on May 9th. That's one week from tomorrow, Wolf, and that is a dramatic moment in and of itself. The president has not been willing to meet with Speaker Kevin McCarthy so long as Republicans have demanded some type of concessions in order to raise the debt ceiling, passing their own bill last week. The president, not meeting one on one with McCarthy but proposing a meeting with the big four Congressional leaders. And in that meeting, according to a White House official, the president is not going to move off the White House position that they will not negotiate. They want a clean debt ceiling increase. That is not going to change according to that White House official. But the White House official also says something else, saying, quote, the president will discuss how to initiate a separate process to address the budget and fiscal year 2024 appropriations, moving things on a separate track. That's not a dramatic difference from what the president has talk about, saying he wanted to address budget and fiscal issues, just on a separate path. But laying that, talking about those two things together in the same meeting, clean debt ceiling increase, no concessions, the White House official made clear, but starting to detail what a separate budget and appropriations process could be. That right there is the potential off ramp, at least in terms of how Washington can work. The problem right now is that the Republicans want significantly more. The Republicans have their own legislation. So, how this is all going to play out still an open question. But the fact there will be a meeting, there's been invitations to a meeting, they're starting to talk about the process underscores the urgency of this moment, which was laid bare by the letter by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen earlier today, Wolf.",

We're talking about impacts to social security payments, impacts to Medicare, veterans' benefits, federal employee salaries and military budgets. So, we're talking about paying our troops, whether or not we can do that, also borrowing costs. You're talking about auto loans. You're talking about mortgage rates being higher. You're talking about student loans being higher. And then there's of course the economic standing of the U.S. in the global economy.

They point up that our regulatory system is not all we hoped it would be. Vice Chairman Barr of the Federal Reserve System wrote a very thoughtful report pointing up all the various problems in the previous supervisory and regulatory regime. We've got lessons to learn from that. And more urgently, at a time when banks are under more pressure, there's going to be less supply of credit and that's something that's surely going to affect the economy. And so the Federal Reserve has as hard a job in the next several months as I've ever seen the Fed facing. It has to, on the one hand, balance the absolute imperative of bringing down inflation, which is still unacceptably high, with the imperative of making sure that there's an adequate flow of credit to people buying houses or cars or businesses or small businesses. So, it's a very difficult balancing act that the Fed is facing. It certainly is. The former treasury secretary, Larry Summers, as usual, thanks so much for joining us.",

Senator, thanks so much for joining us. The White House says President Biden called the House Speaker McCarthy today to propose a meeting next Tuesday on the debt limit. Do you think that's enough to avert what would be a disaster? SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  It's up to Speaker McCarthy. I mean, listen, just important to note, we routinely raised the debt limit. It's a responsibility Congress has in order to keep paying our bills to make sure that we don't default on debt. We do it pretty routinely. We have done it under Republican presidents, Democratic presidents. Speaker McCarthy and his Republican colleagues have decided to withhold their votes for that routine exercise unless Congress agrees to a set of right-wing conservative demands. This is not the way to do things, to hold the entire economy hostage to your political agenda. It's juvenile. It's irresponsible. It's essentially political arson. Hopefully now knowing that this deadline is only a month away, Speaker McCarthy will say to his people, listen, let's have the fight over spending levels and tax levels in the appropriate course, when we debate the budget later this year. Let's not hold the economy hostage. Let's not default on American debt just to get our agenda across the finish line.",

So, the president can make commitments that will put their ideas on the table, we'll debate them when we debate the budget later this year, instead of threatening default in order to get their agenda moved forward.

And so there is this dynamic at play socially.But the tactic that Tacopina took to be aggressive in the cross- examination really exemplifies why it's extraordinary to try to defend and go at an accuser in this way because it is a very, very thin line where jurors view it as effective representation and also just bullying. In fact, though, he tried to attack, as Kara talked about, her credibility. That's where you want to go here.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) SARA MURRAY, CNN POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over):  The president's son appearing in an Arkansas courtroom today. The hearing related to a year's old paternity dispute, after the mother of his child, London Roberts, accused Hunter Biden of ignoring earlier court orders and withholding evidence. Now, the judge says, Hunter must answer more questions about his investments, art sales and other financial transactions as part of the child support case. He will also sit for a June deposition where he'll be questioned under oath. You can't say these are my tax returns. Good luck, you figure it out, the judge said, ordering up details on Hunter's taxes. The cryptic hide the ball game isn't going to cut it when we get to trial. What began as a 2019 paternity case morphing into a battle over Hunter's overseas business dealings, the now infamous laptop and other financial issues, all as Hunter faces scrutiny from both criminal and congressional investigators. Republican lawmakers have launched a sprawling probe into the Biden family's business dealings, seeking many of the same financial records London Roberts is trying to access. REP.
