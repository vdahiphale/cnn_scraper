The credit rating situation was a good reason, perhaps, to do that. It was a warning shot from Fitch. And as they said, look, the numbers tell the story and I would completely agree with them. Debt too high, our interest costs in America are enormous. And that was the other thing that happened yesterday. The treasury came out and said, hey, we're going to borrow a heck of a lot of money in the third quarter, more than people expected. And that hit a sore spot that Fitch had already created.",

And Texas DPS is admitting to this, telling CNN in a statement, \"There have been instances in which DPS has arrested male migrants on state charges who were with their family when the alleged crime occurred. Children and their mothers were never separated, but instead turned over to U.S. Border Patrol.\" Now, according to this attorneys, most of these criminal trespassing arrests were happening at a public park in Eagle Pass called Shelby Park. Well, Phil, in an interesting twist, earlier this week, city council in Eagle Pass overturned the affidavit that allows Texas DPS to make these arrests in a public park. We've asked Texas DPS about this. We haven't heard back. But it's going to be interesting, Phil, to see if Texas DPS will continue to be at this public park.
