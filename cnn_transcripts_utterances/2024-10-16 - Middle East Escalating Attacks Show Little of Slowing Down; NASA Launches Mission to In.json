      "sentences": "We, scientists, have been dreaming about a mission like Europa Clipper for more than 20years. We`ve been working to build it for 10 years. It`s going to be another 10 years, because Jupiter is so far away, until we have all the science in the bag. HOLMES (voice-over):  The mission is not looking for life on the moon, but rather an environment in which life could survive. The Europa Clipper will gather information on the thickness of that icy shell, investigate the possible ocean beneath it, and study the geology of the surface. So, how does an icy moon far away from the Sun have the energy to sustain life? Well, Jupiter`s strong gravity creates tides that stretch and tug the moon, producing heat.",

So, what we learn with Clipper and the habitability of Europa, this is going to pave the way for the future, for future missions to Europa and elsewhere in our solar system, where we can search more directly for life. HOLMES (voice-over):  This big venture from NASA requires very big equipment. The Europa Clipper is about 16 feet or nearly five meters tall and more than 100 feet or about 30 meters wide. That`s about the length of a basketball court. The scale of the Clipper is primarily due to its massive solar arrays. Another big feat for this spacecraft is a poem. ADA LIMON, U.S. POET LAUREATE:  Still, there are mysteries below our sky. HOLMES (voice-over):  U.S. poet laureate Ada Limon wrote an original poem dedicated to NASA`s Europa Clipper mission. The poem will be engraved on the spacecraft as a way to connect the two worlds, Earth and Europa.",

A pair of three-year-old bears will leave thegiant panda research base near the bears native habitat in Southwest China and they`ll board the Panda Express, a specially chartered cargo jet for a highly anticipated return of the beloved bears to the U.S. Capitol. This panda diplomacy is a bright spot in the relations between rival superpowers often at odds over trade, geopolitics and other issues. CNN`s David Culver has more on the first pandas that China has sent to D.C. in 24 years and the steps they took to prepare for the journey. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

They`re in quarantine. And those you saw there were the zookeepers from the National Zoo, as well as some caretakers from China. MARIEL LALLY, SMITHSONIAN`S NATIONAL ZOO PANDA KEEPER:  So they both have pretty different personalities. Bao Li has a huge personality, so he`s very vocal. He`s very energetic. Always kind of like up doing something. Qing Bao is the polar opposite. She can be almost always found in a tree or sleeping on her climbing structure. CULVER (voice-over):  The panda pair will fill a void at the Smithsonian`s National Zoo in Washington, D.C. For the past 11 months, the panda exhibit has sat empty. Now as part of the terms of the Smithsonian`s exchange program with China, late last year, the zoo`s three pandas were sent back here to Chengdu.",

Today, they`re given on loan, and they are a strategic diplomatic tool, serving as ambassadors of hope and spreading global goodwill. Somehow, pandas were able to unite nations, something we could use about right now. (END VIDEOTAPE)",
