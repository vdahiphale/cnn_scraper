I know you have new reporting on a potential ceasefire deal, but I do want to get you to respond first to these comments made over the weekend by the former president. You're the perfect person to have on and speak to this. You wrote a book, Trump's Peace, the background behind the Abraham Accords and the Trump administration's relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his coalition. We talk about how these comments are being received in the United States. I'm curious, especially since this isn't the first time he's made incendiary comments like this, how it's being received among Israelis, in particular the Israeli government right now, because I know there are some extremist members of this coalition who are actually hoping that President Trump does come back into office.",

So, we see this change in Israeli public opinion over the last few weeks. The interesting thing is that if you look at Donald Trump's comments since the beginning of the war in Gaza, you see that he, you know, in general says that he supports Israel, but he didn't say one positive word about Benjamin Netanyahu. In fact, you know, according to a \"Rolling Stone\" report at the beginning of the war, Trump told his associates that Netanyahu should be impeached because of the failures that led to October 7th. And, you know, I met Trump in April 2021, three months after he left the White House, and he was very clear about what he thinks about Netanyahu when he used the F-word about him.

It doesn't mean that it's going to happen tomorrow. This is going to take, best-case scenario, another two weeks of talks, but there are two negotiation teams in Doha in the same compound in separate rooms with Qatari and Egyptian mediators shuttling between them.

Barak, if you could weigh in on the phone conversation yesterday, the first in, I believe, over a month between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, not necessarily the tone, but what came out of it. And that is that Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed to send a delegation to Washington. The U.S. has been public about their concerns of any operation going into Rafah.

This is the plan that was approved the most -- the highest number of times ever. So, I think everybody wants to see whether there's a hostage deal or not. If there is a hostage deal, we will go into at least six-week ceasefire, so this whole thing will be postponed even more.

And this time he's coming to the region and he's not visiting Israel. So, I think that tells a lot about what Blinken thinks he can achieve in a visit to Israel.

Zhong Shanshan is facing online attacks accused of being not patriotic enough, in part because of the designs of some of his product packaging. On the bottles, you can see a temple, you can see a crane. Some Chinese people feel these images are inspired by Japanese culture. Now, that's upsetting to some people because of long-standing animosity between the two countries. Some Chinese people even claim the red bottle cap resembles the shape of the Japanese national flag. CNN has reached out to Nongfu Spring for comment. STEWART (voice-over): A perfect storm that has triggered a nationwide boycott, with people uploading videos of themselves pulling Nongfu Spring's water off store shelves, all in the name of patriotism. All of this is proving to be a heavy blow to business. The online campaign has cut into Nongfu's sales, as well as its share price, wiping about three billion dollars off its market capitalization since the end of February, according to a CNN calculation.
