The capital Kyiv among the targets at least four people are reported dead including a pregnant woman after a residential building was hit. More Russian attacks in the central and northern regions aimed to cripple the electrical grid. People are being urged to conserve power to keep the system stable. Well, Ukrainian officials claim the Kamikaze drones are Iranian made and an aide to President Zelenskyy is blaming Tehran for quote \"The murder of Ukrainians\". CNN's Fred Pleitgen got a closer look at these latest additions to Putin's arsenal. And here is some of Fred's reporting from last week. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Russia continues its bombardment of Ukraine's Kyiv infrastructure across the country scenes like this one in Central Ukraine are common sight wreckages of power plants. That tactic is familiar the weapon until recently was not. A kamikaze drone seen here after an attack on the other side of the country in Kharkiv cheap, self-detonating and unmanned they are a new weapon and Russia's war on Ukraine. The marking say - but this is no Russian made weapon. Its name is Shahed designed and manufactured in Iran known as loitering munitions, it could circle a target and the lightweight airframe can travel long distances. The U.S. government says a Russian delegation traveled to Iran in June to inspect the drones seen here and satellite imagery obtained exclusively by CNN. In recent weeks, Russia has massively stepped up its use of the drone's evidence posted on Ukrainian social media on a near daily basis. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

The European Union Foreign Policy Chief says the EU will look for concrete evidence of Iran's involvement. Well, despite Iran's denial, just last month, U.S. levied sanctions against several companies in Iran that it claims were involved in sending drones to Russia. Iran has spent billions of dollars annually to develop its drone program, which is run by the country's Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC, that name might sound familiar. Well, if it does, it's because it's the same military body currently engaged in a bloody crackdown of protesters. Well, today marks one month since the start of those anti-government demonstrations ignited by the death of a 22-year-old woman in police custody. Mahsa Amini died last month after being detained by Iran so called morality police for allegedly not wearing her hijab properly. Well, U.S. President Joe Biden calling on Tehran to \"End the violence against his own citizens for simply exercising their fundamental rights\".

I know that you spoke to rights activists from Iran late last week, what can the U.S. do to show its support for Iranian protesters at this point? ROBERT MALLEY, U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY FOR IRAN: Well, thank you Becky. And first of all what I say is exactly echoing what you said just a minute ago, which is that Iran's leaders should stop pointing the finger to external actors who have nothing to do with what's happening in their country, they should listen to their people. And as you say, they should listen to the international community and stop providing deadly drones to Russia, which is being used to kill innocent Ukrainians. What we've done from day one from when the protest started is three things. Number one, we've made clear that when there's - there's a struggle between peaceful protesters who are protesting for basic rights in this instance, the right of women and girls to wear what they want the right to peacefully assemble and to speak against a government that is using brutal repression against peaceful demonstrators. There's no doubt on which side we're? We're on the side of those fundamental rights, and of those fundamental rights being respected. And so you've heard the President, you for the Secretary of State.

YURIY SAK, ADVISOR TO UKRAINE'S DEFENSE MINISTER: Hello, Becky, and thank you for having me. Now, these drones are dangerous because they fly on low altitude, and they fly at pretty slow speed. So on the one hand; it's easy to detect them. But on the other hand, it means that they are undetectable for the certain types of air defense systems, which means that they present a threat to the cities, which we have seen today. Today, as you've said in your previous report, you know, this strike at Kyiv was deadly, you know, block of the partners was destroyed, in addition to other, you know, five out of 30 drones, just so that you understand. So 30 drones in total that fired at Kyiv, five of them actually reached that target, one of them hit a block of residential apartments, killing at least four people, among them a young couple, and a lady in that couple who was pregnant with a six, six month, six month pregnancy.

The reversal of the off payroll working reforms introduced in 2017 and 2021, saving around 2 billion pounds a year.

The government's economic credibility has been destroyed, they have harmed our economic institutions, people are paying higher mortgages, the same set of people doing U-turns isn't going to fix it the only way to change this as a real change in government.",

And I'm sorry that given the speed at which things moved at the weekend, I haven't had time tosit down with her one to one as would normally be the practice before parliamentary exchanges. Now I understand the role opposition party's play. I've stood at that dispatch box myself, but behind, behind, behind the rhetoric and I was listening very carefully. I don't think she disagreed with a single one of the decisions that I announced to Parliament. And that is important for the country and markets to know. And I think there is also agreement on the process of policymaking. I support the independence of the Bank of England introduced by Gordon Brown, and I know she supports the independence of the OBR set up by George Osborne. The government, the whole government supports the independence of those two important institutions. Now I fully accept. And I don't think I could have been more clear that we have had to change some decisions made in the last few weeks. But what I reject, what I reject wholeheartedly is her broader narrative about conservative economic management. Let me remind her, let me remind her that the UK's unemployment rate is the lowest since 1974, that's below France, Italy, Canada, Belgium, Sweden, Spain and the Netherlands and massively lower than 2010. Let me remind her that since 2010, our growth rate has been the third highest in the g7. She may not want to hear this, but these are the economic facts. Our growth rate since this party came into power has been higher than Germany, France, Italy, and Japan and faster than any g7 country this year. Looking to the future, we have the largest technology sector in Europe, more foreign direct investments than anywhere in Europe - one country that is a legacy to be proud of. Now, I was listening carefully for some questions about the measures that I announced. But she didn't ask any and I think she agreed with him. But I will pick her up on --. She talked about the NHS. Let me tell her, maybe they don't want to listen about the NHS. She talked about the NHS, because of the global financial crisis, which happened on her party's watch. The NHS went through one of its most difficult periods ever, and this party protected the NHS budget. Then in 2017, we were able to give it his biggest single increase in funding because of the difficult decisions that we took and that party opposed. So Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, we inherited the financial crisis. We dealt with a global --.",

But he said we found our promises and pay our debts in what was an opening statement to the house. As he explained that he didn't get the UK's debt falling as a percentage of GDP by the EU terms that this government has now performed. Let's bring in Bianca Nobilo, who has been listening into the exchanges between Jeremy Hunt, Bianca and the opposition Chancellor, who was certainly electioneering as she spoke there earlier on today. I mean, you would expect to hear most of what you heard from the opposition. But what more did we get of substance from the new finance minister?",

So we knew that from thismorning, he went into a little bit more detail. But by and large, what the questions are going to be about now and going forward is how they will pay for some of these measures. And we got an indication of that this morning when Jeremy Hunt said that he's going to be asking departments to be looking at where they can cut and he wants them to be making savings. Now he's done he just got into this job. So what will now happen is when he meets with the cabinet when he meets with individual secretaries of state of all the different departments, the pressure will be on for them to produce areas where they can save money and that will be one of his priorities going forward. But a bruising day for a prime minister who's had other members of her cabinet perform in a very strong way and she's just been now she's now she's finally appeared but has been basically in hiding before then, Becky.",
