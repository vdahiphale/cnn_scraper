Everyone here recognizes that China is the next big threat, perhaps not in quite the same way that the United States does, but there's commonality on that. Commonality on the understanding that the way the relationship has been with Russia, sort of the world dependent on Russian oil and gas, economies tied to Russia, if you will. That cannot be allowed to exist with China. So I spoke with the European Commission President Ursula Von DerLeyen, the European figure here about what she sees China's relationship with Russia at the moment. And as she said, China has signed a memorandum of agreement with Russia for full support. She said everyone is looking to see if that support includes military support. She has the same view that Europe cannot be economically dependent on an aggressive China, that security comes ahead of the economy. So I think that was a message that resonated in the room here. People very keen to see exactly what China does. Does it give military support? So far, that's not seen, but it's giving a lot of other support in the meantime, like buying Russian oil.",

      "sentences": "Well, the North Koreans are trying to probably make -- to prove that their ballistic missile and nuclear program has now advanced to the point that these solid fuel missiles that they unveiled at their big military parade in Pyongyang last week that could be mass-produced. In fact Kim Jong-un has ordered, you know, the mass production of these nuclear-capable, solid-fuel ICBMs. And solid fuel is very dangerous because they can just roll it out of a cave or somewhere in hiding without having to set it up and fill it up with fuel well within view of spy satellites. This could be a surprise attack kind of weapon.So we don't know if this latest ICBM is one of their new solid fuel mockups that they displayed in their parade or is it something like the Hwosong-17 which North Korea last tested back in November. Both of these ICBMs were in the air for more than an hour -- an hour and 8 minutes to be precise. And they both traveled extraordinarily fast. We're talking something like 22 times the speed of sound. North Korea fires these weapons, they test them on what's called a highly lofted trajectory. So they fire up, you know, hundreds and hundreds of miles above the earth, they essentially go into space. But if they were to be launched on a flatter trajectory, theoretically these missiles could reach the mainland U.S. And that's why the United States is, not only condemning and pointing out the U.N. Security Council violations, but also urging other countries to condemn North Korea as well. The problem is it's really difficult for the U.N. Security Council, as you know Paula, to get anything done lately with North Korea because China and Russia have permanent members and they have veto power. And they're just not cooperating with any sort of an issues that the United States has, whether it be North Korea or obviously much anything else.",

Well, the U.S. military issued the statement late last night announcing that they will be calling off the recovery efforts for those two objects downed over Lake Huron and Alaska.Now, the implication here, Paula, is that now it is very unlikely that Americans will really receive a fulsome explanation about exactly it is that the Biden administration shot down. Still though, the military said that they had used a variety of capabilities and that included imagery, airborne censors, below-the- surface sensors and ultimately they were unable to find any debris. Now the Canadians issued a similar statement last night saying that because of the snowfall in the area that it was shot down in the Yukon region, about 100 miles from border of the U.S.-Canada, that they were also unable to find debris. And so they called off their search as well. Now, this is important because the Biden administration for the last two weeks has really said that they needed to find the actual debris to be able to accurately identify what these objects were. And over the course of the last week, we really heard some doubts from administration officials saying that it was unlikely that they would be able to find it. Now, that doubt became reality last night when they officially called off those searches. Now President Biden really breaking his silence here on Thursday about all of the objects that have been shot down. He tried to level with the American people. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Those they know how to equip, those they are already prepared and trained to use. So that would be the first way to go here. Secondly, we need to keep in mind that Russia has a very, very sophisticated air defense system, the S-400. It has a very, very long range. And so the question is would these planes be useful on the eastern front?

The bottom line of this is we learned more what the Chinese learned. We learned what they're up to. We learned what their capabilities are in addition to the satellites as well as communications systems back and forth. We had a whole week to gather signals intelligence and we have their little black box. And so ultimately it was a success. Now, with regard to these other balloons, I think we're going to find out that there are some volunteer organizations out there that do weather balloons, and they may have lost three of their weather balloons along the way. I understand why we shut this thing down. It is winter in the Arctic. It is cold, the snows are there and maybe in the spring we'll be able to renew the search.

We learned from text messages that Mark Meadows turned over to the January 6th committee that he was involved with efforts both in Congress and at the Justice Department to try to stop Biden's election win. What we're learning now from both the stances here of Pence and Meadows is that while why the special counsel's investigation is clearly ramping up, it's going to be a difficult road for the special counsel in court to try to convince these former Trump aides and officials to testify.",

Now what was released this week was just portions of the grand jury's report on efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia.And what the grand jury recommended was that one or more witnesses may have committed perjury when they testified. We learned that the grand jury heard from 75 witnesses in all, and that's everyone from election officials and state officials to election deniers and some of former President Trump's aides and advisers. Now, what we don't know is who exactly it is that the grand jury believes committed perjury as there were no names in this report. We also don't know what other charges were included or potentially recommended to the Fulton County district attorney. We're just going to have to bait for wait for that, including the biggest question of all, which is whether the district will ultimately charge Donald Trump, Paula.",

He was a top official at the Justice Department during the Trump administration. He was the liaison between the Justice Department and special counsel Robert Mueller. And prior to that he was a prosecutor in the southern district of New York for almost a decade. Ed, thank you so much for being with us. There are many former Justice Department officials -- I swear half of them are on TV. But have a really unique perspective to help us understand everything that's going on here. Let's start with Mark Meadows. Obviously he is not just a witness for the special counsel investigating January 6th. He is the witness, but they're already facing some legal challenges. How do you see this playing out? ED O'CALLAGHAN, FORMER DOJ ADVISER DURING MUELLER SPECIAL COUNSEL: Thank you for having me, Paula. It is interesting to see this playing out with the top former officials being subpoenaed now. I will say as a former prosecutor, it's not so surprising to me that these are happening now. Jack Smith has been -- he was appointed special counsel in November, but he's only been on the ground here since January. And what I suspect has happened is that Jack Smith has met now with his team to see what has been done and what hasn't been done, and the fact that subpoenas went out to some of these top officials now seems like it's the right course to me. The other thing I would caution is that Jack Smith being the seasoned prosecutor he is, and knowing not just the track record here of some of the witnesses who have been subpoenaed in terms of asserting various privileges that may protect them from having to give testimony. Jack Smith knows that these folks would likely assert several privileges. And that means that there's going to be some litigation over them. And so it's no surprise that Jack Smith has gone ahead and issued these subpoenas and now it's going to be a matter within the courts to determine the parameters of how he's able to enforce those subpoenas, what these witnesses will or will not have to testify to.",

That special counsel is Rob Hur. You know him well. You worked together at the Justice Department. How do you think he's going to approach this investigation? O'CALLAGHAN: He's going to approach it very diligently, Paula. Rob is again -- he was the U.S. attorney in Maryland. He was -- he sat in the seat I succeeded him into, within the deputy attorney general's office with regard to special counsel Mueller's investigation. And he's just a very thoughtful prosecutor with extreme integrity. So what he's going to do, frankly, is going to follow a similar path. Again, there was some investigation that was conducted before Rob was named special counsel here. He will evaluate that and then make decisions as to, again, what stones have not yet been unturned, where he thinks avenues of evidence may still lie and pursue that. He'll have to get a team assembled as well which I know he is likely doing. And they will ask questions of people around the current president, just like Jack Smith is asking about officials from the former president. And we may see indeed some similar assertions of various privileges during Rob Hur's special counsel investigation as well.",
