Welcome to our viewers here in the United States and around the world. I'm Wolf Blitzer with a special report in The Situation Room, Trump Trial Today. Let's get right to the breaking news on the opening statements and testimony in this, the first criminal trial of a former president of the United States, Donald Trump, at the defense table as prosecutors and his lawyers began cutting to the heart of the hush money case against him. CNN's Kara Scannell is joining us live from New York, where she was inside the courtroom today. Kara, we now have the first official court transcript.",

(END VIDEOTAPE) SCANNELL (on camera):  Now, David Pecker was on the stand for about 20 minutes today. He was explaining to the jury how the National Enquirer operates, saying that they did pay for certain stories. He testified, on the celebrity side of the magazine industry, at least on the tabloid side, we used checkbook journalism and we paid for stories. He also said that any story that required a payment of more than 10,000, required his approval, and he testified that he had two email addresses at AMI, one that he used for general businesses that his assistant often looked at, and one that he kept confidentially. Now, before Pecker left the room, he walked past Donald Trump's table, said hello to the table, It wasn't clear if Donald Trump had responded. We couldn't get a good vantage point of that. But Pecker will be back on the stand tomorrow where he will get into what the prosecutors say is the core of this testimony. These catch and kill deals and the conspiracy they say was hatched at Trump Tower in 2015. Wolf?",

      "sentences": "Absolutely, Wolf. And everything in criminal prosecution starts with the law. Prosecutors have to establish elements of an offense, and we flagged the important one points here today, falsifying business records, that's the crime, with an intent to defraud. But here's the thing, and most important in this case, is for the purpose of committing another crime, or aiding or concealing, covering up a crime. And you heard the prosecutors today literally call it a conspiracy and a cover up. So, that's what we're talking about here, this aid or conceal.Now, this Kara talked about this August 2015 meeting, and this is critical for prosecutors' efforts to establish an intent to defraud on the part of the defendant, Donald Trump. What they're saying is that these three people got together at this August 2015 meeting and didn't just agree to falsify records, but agreed to falsify records for the purpose of helping the former president's campaign chances. The crime is the cover up of the campaign in 2016. Now, you also have to establish that records are falsified, and remember, the jurors know none of this. You and I might, many viewers might, but jurors don't. And so they have to establish how business records were kept within the Trump Organization. And you have these three employees, Jeff McConney, Rhona Graff and Deborah Tarasoff, who can actually testify as to what happened within the Trump Organization, how they falsified records or allegedly falsified records, put them together and what they did. Now, what was the purpose of all of this, and Kara touched on this a little bit, we all remember 2016 swirling around the Trump campaign were questions perhaps about this personal misconduct that they might have, and this is the allegation on the part of the prosecutors, it's collaborated to benefit the president's campaign by essentially shushing these personal intimate relationships.",

Stormy Daniels might have had a reason for moving forward with this. She came forward with the story.And finally, Wolf, really important here, two big points made by the defense, using the term President Trump is innocent. That's not something that prosecutors have to establish, this idea of innocence versus not guilty. They said he's innocent, they swung for the fences here. And most importantly, they are attacking the very heart of the charge here by saying that there's nothing wrong with attempting to influence an election. It's called democracy. Now, look, a core part of the case is this allegation that Trump should not have been influencing an election. The defense went right after that here, attacked Trump on it.

That is an argument he's making to a political case to the American people rather than actually trying to improve his standing as a defendant in the case.And I think the distinction is key to understand because this is part of why the jurors are instructed not to consume media around this case, not to be on social media. It's exactly because this will happen in that space and it shouldn't go into their calculations. Will the American people buy that Donald Trump is being sidelined in this campaign in some way by Joe Biden, who has absolutely nothing to do with this Manhattan D.A.'s case? We'll see.

And now we're learning that, allegedly, one witness in the classified documents investigation told investigators that Trump offered to pardon his co-defendant and his valet, Walt Nauta, in this case, if he was charged with lying to the FBI when Trump is re-elected in 2024.Now, of course, there are a lot of caveats there, but this is really notable because it's coming from this redacted interview that we're getting. We don't know who which witness it is in the classified documents investigation who is saying that Trump did offer to pardon Walt Nauta, who, of course, we know was subsequently charged with lying to the FBI in this case. And the reason we still have a lot of questions about this is because this is someone who said that they have not spoken to Walt Nauta since Donald Trump left the White House, but they did go to Mar-a-Lago several times throughout the course after he left the White House, and they spoke to him about the classified documents. And according to this interview, they told him to essentially make sure he returned them to the National Archives or otherwise warned that he would give the Justice Department a reason to indict him, something that we do know later happened. It's not clear why this was not part of the charges that was brought against Donald Trump.

If you do that from the defense perspective, you got a chance. And the prosecution of course was distancing themselves, saying, well, everybody's got a past, he may have a history, but this is about corroboration and schemes and other witnesses.

Thank you very much.Coming up, new filings reveal just how much money Trump world is spending on legal fees and who that money is coming from as he tries to make -- make up a cash deficit just ahead of the general election. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) [18:51:19] BLITZER:  Tonight as testimony has begun in Donald Trump's first criminal trial, there's new evidence that is huge legal bills are draining millions of dollars from his so-called Leadership PAC, money that could have been spent on Trump's presidential campaign. Brian Todd is back with us. We're here at the magic wall. Break down the new campaign finance report for us, Brian, and what it reveals. Well, Wolf, the former president and presumptive GOP's excuse me, legal expenses pardon me. are really racking up as his first criminal trial gets underway. And that's just one of the many legal challenges he is facing. His Save America Political Action Committee fronts the vast majority of the cost of these legal issues. And that's becoming a big drain on Trump. Let's take a look at Save America at their legal expenses, expenses in just in March. According to a new filing from the Federal Election Commission, Save America spent nearly 3.7 million on legal related expenses just in March. That -- pardon me -- that is nearly three out of every four dollars that it collected al together. Save America has spent more than $77 million on legal fees for Trump and his associates since the start of 2021, when spending shifted from his 2020 campaign to his current bid for the White House. At the same time, these legal expenses are draining, Trump's coffers, President Biden, and the Democratic Party, are seriously expected their war chest, just take a look at the disparity here. Heading into April, Biden's campaign reports $85.5 million in cash on hand, that is nearly double the Trump campaign with $45.1 million, pardon me, Looking at the Democratic National Committee versus the Republican national committee, you see the same pattern, the DNC has $45.2 million in cash on hand, the RNC, just $21.6 billion. That is a major early fundraising advantage, that is money that Trump and his political action committees could be spending on advertising, polling, and field offices. They're instead going to these mounting legal fees and that could be an issue for Trump is special officially as we head into that stretch run of the election season, Wolf. The conventions coming up and all of that, they've got real money problems on their hand because of these trials.",

      "sentences": "Well, Wolf, President Biden and his advisers are seeking to stay above the fray, focusing on issues of policy and substance and declining to wait in and comment on Trump's legal issues. You'll see today, President Biden was in Virginia highlighting $7 billion in clean energy investments. Vice President Harris, for her part one was in battleground, Wisconsin, highlighting Trump's role in the overturning of Roe. Biden is expected to do more of the same tomorrow, he heads to Florida, Trump's figurative backyard.And when you look at just the schedule for the first two weeks of this trial, Wolf, President Biden would have been on a swing through Pennsylvania. He's going to Upstate New York later this week and campaign and White House officials say, expect his schedule to stay incredibly robust as Trump is kept in court through June. Now, advisers tell me that they're using this time with Trump in court and off the trail to essentially hunker down and craft strategy and plans for the months to come. But publicly, the campaign has wasted no time trying to rib the former president, their new and now opponent in the 2024 race, with some sharply worded missives. Strategically using language like Sleepy Don, Stormy, and Hush, and sort of oblique reference to the trial in those statements. But despite and all of that, I'm told by both campaign and White House officials, Wolf, that there's no formalized effort to monitor the daily developments of the trial. There's no war room, there are no daily memos, there are no individual staffers who are tasked with reporting up to campaign and White House brass on what happens each day. I'm told they're getting their information like the rest of us its watching the proceedings on TV -- Wolf.",
