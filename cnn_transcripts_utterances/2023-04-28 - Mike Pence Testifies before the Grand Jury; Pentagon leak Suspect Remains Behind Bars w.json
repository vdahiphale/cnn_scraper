      "sentences": "Former Vice- President Mike Pence testified before a federal grand jury on Thursday for more than five hours, that testimony would have been about what happened after the 2020 election leading up to January 6th. All of those conversations, he directly would have had with Donald Trump, the President at the time, at a time when Donald Trump was pressuring him to overturn the vote. Pence refused to do so, Pence has also spoken about thoseconversations publicly, he's written about them in his book, then he has been on a tour about. Now, he is talking about them really regularly. But never before has an investigation has a grand jury and have prosecutors gotten Pence under oath to reveal exactly what he thought, what he felt, and what was said to between him and Donald Trump on those crucial days as part of this investigation. So this is a really significant moment in the January 6th criminal investigation being led by Special Counsel Jack Smith at the Justice Department, it is also quite a momentous moment in history. There has never before been a vice-president called to testify in a subpoena about the President that he served alongside, and that did not happen in Watergate with Richard Nixon, it did not happen with Whitewater with Bill Clinton, which both had very active grand juries. So this is different. It also is a very crucial moment putting Mike Pence here, because the Justice Department had to fight for this testimony. They went to court over this. Donald Trump tried to block the testimony. He tried to limit what Pence could say about the direct conversations, lost those court battles. Mike Pence also went to court to fight on this and did not want to testify under subpoena, but he did get a little bit of leeway from the court, being able to protect what he was doing when he was the presiding officer on January 6th. But today, that federal grand jury did hear from Mike Pence for more than five hours, one-on-one. The grand jurors would have been able to ask him questions, they would've been able to piece him into the investigation, a very active investigation that they have heard from many, many witnesses on. And now, the prosecutors will take that to testimony and see how it fits, tried to fit it into potential charges as they look towards the future. It will become, at least part of the record of what will now be known about January 6th to the Justice Department and potentially to the public later on. Katelyn Polantz, CNN, Washington.

You know, Mike Pence did the right thing on January 6th. After that, he has been circumspect. He has gone so far in criticizing Trump and no further. You know, he said we will never see eye to eye about what happened that day, which seems a pretty, you know, kind a mild way of describing those events, it's certainly well short of what others like Liz Cheney have said, saying that it would disqualify Trump from being President again. But I think the fact that the Justice Department, you know, went to this effort, brought him in, first of all, it suggests that if that vice-president can be compelled to testify, others that they are seeking are going to be compelled to testify as well. But, it just underscores just how much -- how many nets Donald Trump is facing and how they are tightening around him. He held a rally after the Manhattan, you know, D.A. indicted him. He is looking at potentially two more federal indictments, and a very serious investigation in Georgia.
