This is CNN NEWSROOM.Just ahead, emergency services in Taiwan are racing against time to rescue victims trapped under the rubble after the island was hit by its strongest earthquake in 25 years. The very latest on the efforts. Then the deaths of seven aid workers in Gaza trigger outrage around the globe. We will discuss how this impacts the future and aid missions. Plus, NATO foreign ministers are gathering in Brussels with one mission ensuring military support for Ukraine in the years to come. We begin in Taiwan and we want to show you live pictures where it is 8:00 p.m. there and rescue operations are underway after the strongest earthquake there in a quarter of a century. At least nine people have died, more than 900 are injured. You can see that building there leaning on its side. Rescue workers scramble to free dozens of people who are trapped in highway tunnels. Dozens have been rescued so far. The 7.4 magnitude tremor shook the island's east coast just before 8:00 in the morning, local time there with the epicenter close to the eastern coast there, Hualien City. It was followed by strong aftershocks. And this is a glimpse of what emergency workers are up against now. The quake triggered landslides that forced the closure of a major highway. You're also hearing that some of the initial deaths included hikers killed by falling rocks in a tourist hotspot. CNN's Hanako Montgomery has this update from Tokyo.",

We also know that of the nine people who died, all of them were killed in Hualien County where, you know, it was very close to the epicenter, and actually where most of the significant damage has been taking place.And just for context, Hualien County is located on the eastern coast of Taiwan, it's a very popular tourist destination. It's also a rural area, and coincidentally where most of Taiwan's earthquakes actually occur. So we also know that 56 people were trapped in Hualien County. Originally, that number was up to 131. But rescue operators were able to rescue all the people trapped in those tunnels to safety. Now, in terms of the rescue operations, the Taiwanese defense ministry has dispatched military troops to coincide and to work with local governments try to get people to safety, get them out from underneath the rebels of their homes and buildings. And this is really common protocol that you see in Taiwan. When you see a natural disaster of this magnitude, military troops do work with local governments to try to get people again to safety. But one thing that was actually affecting disaster relief efforts today were the damage roads. You saw, you know, a main highway from Taipei, the capital of Taiwan to fallen county actually partially destroyed. So military troops had to use some aircrafts to get to that part of the island.",

You can see them jumping over the stands as authorities are trying to contain them. Many painted their hands yellow. Thousands of Israelis took to the streets this week demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Meantime, the killing of seven aid workers in Gaza is sparking international condemnation demand for answers and drawing an apology from Israel for what it is calling a grave mistake. World Central Kitchen has released the names and photos of the seven killed in that Israeli strike, saying they were heroes and beautiful souls who died when in what it calls a targeted attack. Many of them in their 30s. The aid convoy says its convoy -- the aid group, I should say, says its convoy was fired on despite coordinating its movements with the IDF in advance and being clearly marked. The Chief of Staff of the Israeli military is apologizing for what happened. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) LT. GEN. HERZI HALEVI, CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF, ISRAEL DEFENSE FORCES: The IDF works together closely with the World Central Kitchen and greatly appreciates the important work that they do. The IDF completed a preliminary debrief. I want to be very clear, the strike was not carried out with the intention of harming WCK aid workers. It was a mistake that followed a misidentification at night during the war in a very complex conditions. It shouldn't have happened. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

It is a trickle of aid that's able to get through the land routes.What World Central Kitchen had done was open up that maritime route with ships of aid that would come from Cyprus to this jetty, this makeshift jetty that had been set off -- set up off northern Gaza. The fact that they're announcing the suspension of their activities, a huge blow to getting aid to the Gazan people and of course it leads to further pressure on Israeli authorities to do more -- to let aid in. Now, as you mentioned, we heard yesterday that fairly fulsome apology in English from the head, the chief of the general staff who spoke of not only the fact that this had been a mistake, explaining more about the circumstances of how this strike had happened, a misidentification, he explained and how they intended the IDF to do more to further coordinate, to better coordinate their work with humanitarian agencies. Because remember that that has been crucial to their message in these last few weeks, that they're trying to work hard to get relief to the more than 1 million Gazans that the U.N. believes are now facing famine. This not just a blow, of course, to the families and friends and colleagues of all those who lost their lives tragically yesterday, but also to the image of Israel in the messaging that it's been given -- giving about what lengths it's going to to try and get help in. And I think it's significant also that we heard such angry words from President Biden himself, not just the White House over the course of the day, but President Biden speaking of his outrage and his heartbreak. And I think that's something that you've heard more and more clearly expressed by the American president.

First of all, the U.S. does assess that it was the Israelis who were behind the strike on that diplomatic compound.However, the U.S. then also says that they are not certain what kind -- this is the Pentagon, by the way, that they're not certain what type of building that was, whether or not this was a diplomatic building. However, we do have to say this was Iran's diplomatic compound of the Iranian embassy in Damascus that was hit. This was one of the annex buildings to the actual embassy. The U.S. then also goes on to say that it had no prior knowledge of the strike taking place and also did not know the target of the strike. It was interesting, the spokesperson for the Pentagon saying that the U.S. does not condone or support strikes on diplomatic buildings. So that certainly is kind of an interesting nuance in all of that. But you're absolutely right, the Iranians definitely coming out and saying that they hold the U.S. also accountable for this. This was actually the Iranian foreign minister, quite powerful actually in the hierarchy there in Iran. The U.S. yesterday at a U.N. Security Council meeting, once again saying that it did not know anything about this strike. And certainly was not involved in it in any way, shape or form. The U.S. definitely going quite a ways to make that point. And, of course, one of the reasons for that is that the Iranians certainly do have and are a force in the greater Middle East region. Certainly, if the Iranians want to retaliate against the United States, it could be quite dicey for a lot of the American forces that are still on the ground in Syria and in some other Middle Eastern countries as well. And that's also why the deputy U.N. ambassador of the United States yesterday at that Security Council meeting warned the Iranians not to escalate the situation by lashing out now against Israel or, in general, lashing out in the Middle East. Certainly, a very important point as we are in a very important time window right now as well. The Iranians have said yesterday, once again last night, that there will be a decisive response for them at this point.

This is a major reason why distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers trying to deliver desperately needed help to civilians.\" Incidents like yesterday simply should not happen.\" The president also spoke by phone with Jose Andres, the chef who founded World Central Kitchen, to extend his condolences for the lives lost, including one dual U.S.-Canadian citizen. But this episode really lays bare more of the tensions that have been existing between President Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. For months now, the administration has warned Israel to take greater care to protect civilians, increasing their warnings, talking about the suffering facing the civilians, Palestinians in Gaza. And he's also pressed Israel to make it easier to get humanitarian aid in. Now, this also comes as the president is facing domestic pressure here at home with Arab, Muslim and young voters increasingly frustrated with his handling of this conflict and his relationship with Netanyahu as they've waged this campaign in Gaza. Last night, the president hosted a meeting with a small group of Muslim leaders where one attendee told CNN that they did discuss the death of these workers. Now, this meeting was attended in part by some doctors who have recently visited Gaza to see the suffering there firsthand. One of those doctors told CNN that he walked out of the meeting in protests and trying to show solidarity with the Palestinian people. So these are all frustrations that President Biden is hearing directly from Arab and Muslim and young voters directly. And it also comes, as many are closely watching to see whether this incident, the death of these humanitarian aid workers, will in any way shape the president's approach going forward when it comes to his handling of the crisis, handling of Netanyahu at a time when he is facing a lot of pressure here at home. And the international community has also expressed outrage about the way that this campaign is being waged in Gaza.",

As you mentioned, this law is very controversial. We've seen pretty much court ping pong with this law with the law going back and forth between several layers of the court.Well, the appeals court just issued an order last week that kept SB4 blocked. Now, the oral arguments that are happening today, they're going to be in the same court. The same justices are going to be hearing oral arguments. Now, last week, the order that was issued was a 2 to 1 vote, and in the majority opinion, the chief judge made it very clear, and she didn't have to go into all these details, but she did, in her majority opinion, she, in essence, said that her concern is the constitutionality of this law. That she doesn't believe that this law is in line with the U.S. Constitution. Now, I want to dial back the clock a little bit because it's not just this justice who has concerns about this law being unconstitutional. It's not just Democrats. There's also a Texas senator, a Republican, when this law was being debated on the Texas Senate floor, who came out and said that he didn't believe that this law was constitutional. Now, this is notable because this individual is not just a Texas Republican. He is a prior author of the law who said that this law was -- this bill was taken away from him, given to another Republican. And the reason why all this happened was because he was not comfortable with the clauses that were being added to this law because he was not comfortable about the constitutionality of this law, where this law was going. Here's what he said on the Texas Senate floor. Take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

He specifically said that under the U.S. Constitution, that's a power left to the federal government.Well, guess what the majority opinion from the appeals court also said. Something very similar. I'm going to read it to you. It says, quote, \"The Texas removal provision,\" -- meaning deportation -- \"bestows powers upon itself that are likely reserved to the United States,\" i.e. the federal government. Now, this chief judge goes even further and says to the state of Texas, yes, I understand that you're frustrated by the immigration issue on the southern border. And the state of Texas has argued that it is being, quote, \"invaded by migrants,\" and that the federal government is not doing enough, and that it has a right and a constitutional right to defend itself. But this chief judge specifically said that the inaction by the executive branch, by the president, in essence, federal policy, when it comes to immigration, in part, was due because of inaction by the legislature, Amara. And you and I both know that Congress has been in a gridlock and a lot of times does not fund these policies properly. Well, that's what the chief judge said in her majority opinion, and it's the same court that's going to be hearing oral arguments today. Now, could these justices change their minds? Absolutely. But we're going to have to see.",
