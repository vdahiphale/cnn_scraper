You can see this came off this church. Of course, it's still dark here. We're an hour behind you. So as you can imagine, we haven't been able to assess all the damage right now. But this right here shows you how strong some of those winds were, knocking this off the top of the church. If you look up there, though, we don't see any major roof damage. But this is what people were concerned about, that these storms were to be hitting later on in the night and that people would not have the chance, after hearing the tornado sirens, to get out of the way. Luckily so far, we haven't heard anything about any injuries in this general area. But as you can see, the damage here, this steeple is pretty massive. I mean, when you walk over to it, you can see how solid it is. This thing was just blown right off. Emergency crews have cleared this area. We're actually told the firehouse nearby, that was slightly damaged, as well. And there may be a House within a mile away from here that suffered some damage, as well.

So Miller is one of those people who was inside the White House, talking to the president, including on January 6th, as the speech writer preparing that speech that he gave on the Ellipse to his supporters before they went to the Capitol and rioted. And the thing that we know Miller has talked about before, because he spoke to the House Select Committee about it, was what Trump wanted to put in the speech and this question of whether Trump was going to mention Mike Pence. It was one of those things that was in the speech, and then it was out of the speech. Miller was involved in those discussions. And so that's one of the things that this grand jury likely would want to know from him. And what this represents, with all of these other people that are going into the grand jury, as well. Top Pence advisers, top Trump advisers, Miller now. Those people are all the firewall around Donald Trump's presidency. And clearly, the Justice Department now, with this special counsel, they're chipping away at that. They're trying to get more and more questions very close to Donald Trump.",

COLLINS: Also, other action on Capitol Hill this morning. As Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress are preparing to act to pass legislation that would avert a nationwide rail strike. That coming after President Biden called on them to do so after he warned that a strike could deal a devastating blow to the nation's economy. This is overriding what union workers had wanted to see happen here. It's also frustrated some progressives on Capitol Hill, who say the offer should include paid leave for those rail workers. CNN's M.J. Lee is live at the White House. M.J., you know, Biden came into office promising to be the most pro-union president in the country's history. I know that's something that is very close to his heart. So I imagine this was not necessarily the decision he wanted to make here, but what led him to this? M.J. LEE, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: You know how often the president will describe himself as pro-union. It is a label, as you said he wears proudly. So this decision to publicly call on Congress to take action to avert the strike and, essentially, force some of his allies in the union to sort of be accepting of something that they're not entirely happy with, that obviously came with some political risk. And ultimately, it wasn't something that the president wanted to do at the end. He knew that there would be some backlash. You know, you look at some of his public statements, and they've been almost these sort of pained statements, explaining why he had to do what he had to do. But ultimately, you know, the White House did see this coming a mile away. Our reporting is that by mid-November the White House was making contingency plans for precisely this scenario, the scenario where talks would ultimately fall apart. And that's when we are told the president picked up the phone and called congressional leaders, called some of his top cabinet officials, and told them, Yes, my public statement is coming. I'm going to call on Congress to act.",

You know, dozens of unions were involved in these negotiations. And ultimately, four of them ended up rejecting this agreement that was agreed to earlier this year. So there were plenty of rank-and-file members that were happy with it. You know, one labor strategist I talked to, they said this is hardly Biden sticking it to the unions. They said this is not President Reagan and PATCO. This is obviously the 1980s situation, where he ended up firing thousands of air traffic controllers that were on strike.

(SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE) Much of this battle is fought avoiding the artillery threat, in underground bunkers like these, where local Ukrainian commanders like Pavlo (ph) can respond to Russian attacks. \"They're assaulting our positions from early morning till night,\" he tells me. \"But the real problem is we are heavily outnumbered,\" he says.
