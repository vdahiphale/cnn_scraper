As you can see, sort of abullish day, not much to talk about our markets, but these are the main stories we're following for you. Pakistan attacks as Iran. Tonight, you'll hear reaction from prime ministers across the board. You're also going to hear the CEO of Uber on why he now wants to deliver groceries and delve further into our lives. We are live at the World Economic Forum in Davos. It is Thursday. It's January the 18th. Here's AI Al (ph). I'm Richard Quest, spruce you off a bit. Together, we mean business. Good evening. The temperatures dropped somewhat and it is snowing, but it is our fourth and final day at WEF. It's all over, but the singing, as they say, so that you'll have to join us all later tonight at the piano bar at the top. AI was the biggest talker of the day and arguably of the week. OpenAI's Chief Executive Sam Altman took the stage, telling leaders they should be optimistic, not afraid. Now, Davos may be winding down, but we are most certainly not. On QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, we've saved, if you will, the best for last. First, we start with Pakistan's retaliatory strikes in Iran. The latest sign of a spiraling conflict on the fringes of the Middle East. Pakistan says it was targeting separatist hideouts along the border on the Iranian side. The Iranian state media reports 10 people have been killed. Now, it follows Iran's deadly strikes in Pakistan two days ago, where it says it was strictly going after Iranian terrorists. Both countries have long fought militants near their shared border. Jim Sciutto is with me from Washington. Jim, now, I mean, the obvious but first question is, is this the sort of escalation that we would have -- you know, that's coming from Hamas and Israel? Can we draw links, however, tangential?",

      "sentences": "Well, let's help the flash points right now in the region because they are numerous and dangerous. Ofcourse, you have a hot war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas. You have something of a low-grade conflict on Israel's northern border between Israel and Hezbollah, like Hamas, also backed by Iran, you have Iranian militias that have been firing on US forces in both Iraq and Syria. You have now a low-grade conflict between the US and UK against Houthi rebels in Yemen, which have been targeting international shipping of countless countries that go through the Red Sea, and now you have here on the Iran- Pakistan border trading of strikes in both directions. Now, that's dangerous because it's another flashpoint. But of that current array of flashpoints, this one might be relatively more manageable, and that when you look at the Iranian strikes, yes, they cross the border into Pakistan but against what Iran says are ISIS targets there. This, of course, followed an ISIS attack in Iran a number of weeks ago. Pakistan then striking in Iran against what even though Iran's foreign minister said today were non-Iranians. This is a Baluchistan kind of separatist group that is often based itself on Iranian territory. That smoke signal from the Iranian foreign minister might be something of a tempering effect here saying, okay, those were not our people that were struck there, a sign that perhaps Iran does not want a conflict on that border. That said, Richard, you and I have been watching flashpoints like these for, well, our entire careers.",

Does Iran want a broader war? Does it want direct conflict, for instance, with US forces? And since those October 7th attacks on Israel, the general read -- and these are not certain assessments -- but the general read has been Iran doesn't want a broader war. It's happy to see its proxies striking and causing damage where they can, does not want direct conflict with the US. The trouble is, there are more fronts now and more proxies coming into conflict, direct conflict, in many cases, with, for instance, US and UK and western forces. What does it take?
