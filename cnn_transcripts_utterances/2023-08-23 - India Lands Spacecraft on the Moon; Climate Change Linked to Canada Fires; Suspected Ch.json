India is also the first ever to land a spacecraft near the challenging terrain of the unexplored lunar south pole. CNN's Vedika Sud is live in New Delhi.

In fact, when we set up our live shot here a few minutes ago, there was barely any smoke. As you can see, it's completely burning. People have lost their livelihoods, they're losing their homes. A lot of people are choosing to be defiant and trying to hose down their homes with water in the hope they'll be able to save what is left of what they have; 93 wildfires have erupted across Greece in the last 24 hours. It's been a herculean task to try and put these fires out, get them under control. Locals are telling us more should be done. The fire department is telling us that they're doing what they can with the resources they have. In other parts of Greece, in Alexandroupolis, we saw a massive forest fire, also 18 bodies charred, found dead in the forest. Just from seeing, having this experience, it's absolutely shocking to see homes set alight. As you can see, this home, in this garden over here, they've obviously left the hose open to try and protect their property. Look, Greece has seen enormous rainfall in June, record temperatures in July and wildfires spreading across the board. The question now becomes, what will be done to save this very important forest that's absolutely vital for the city of Athens? You can barely breathe, I am covered in ash and dust.

There's been a lot of conversation about the lack of access to schools, not just in that region but across the country. There are not that many secondary schools in Pakistan. As a whole, there are more primary schools rather than secondary schools. I've been speaking to education experts. They're saying it's a really big deal that these ninth graders, between the ages of 10 and 15, most of them were ninth graders, they were actually expecting their exam results. And they did pretty well. So it's not that people don't want to send their kids to school. That area was heavily affected by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake that affected parts of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as well. So it's not just a lack of interest in building infrastructure there; it's also very difficult. It's a very mountainous spot, a very remote part of the country. But there is a need for oversight. As Ivan just mentioned in his package, there is a very hokey attempt -- people want in every possible way to make sure that their kids can get to school. So they use automobile parts, random bits and pieces. It's almost like these steampunk contraptions that are made locally. And there is an incredible need for oversight because, if there is a need for climate-resilient, proper infrastructure there, not just schools, and if the situation is that there -- it is too mountainous a terrain for proper roads to be built there, then there is definitely a requirement by the administration, the current one. The previous successor of the administration have really not looked into this, is the criticism. But the way forward is to make sure that they're climate-resilient, that if there is a need for cable cars, if that's the best possible way for kids to get to school and for them to commute in those regions, perhaps there's a need for better oversight.

But Giuliani is expected to come here. It is part of the revolving door that we've seen here of defendants coming and going outside the Fulton County Jail. Of course, Giuliani is among the most notable names, perhaps the most notable, next to the former president, Donald Trump. It's Giuliani, who prosecutors accuse of meeting with Georgia lawmakers three times after Trump lost in 2020 to spread election conspiracy theories and election lies. Giuliani, as I mentioned, is expected to surrender here. He said that this is an unnecessary indictment and has repeated and parroted the phrases from the former president, that this was political in nature. Giuliani joins Ken Chesebro, a former Trump attorney, as well as a former campaign attorney, Ray Smith, who surrendered earlier today. Both are accused in this indictment and charged in this indictment. Chesebro, for his role in the fake electors scheme; Smith, prosecutors allege, was in the room when fake electors met in Atlanta in December of 2020. He, too, according to prosecutors, spread election conspiracy theories and election lies. There's a number of people who have already turned themselves in. They range from people like bail bondsman, Scott Hall, who was part of the process of illegal accessing of voting data in rural Coffee County as well as the former GOP chairman here of the state of Georgia, David Shafer, who was instrumental in that fake electors scheme.

Teams have their ups and downs. Not the Yankees. They've been good every year for about 30 years. They hadn't lost nine games in a row since 1982. But that's what happened to them last night. Fans, I think they're finally realizing in New York that this is not going to be their season. It's not going to go their way. But tonight, they have a chance to do something they haven't done in more than 100 years, Becky. That's lose 10 games in a row. So we'll hear what their manager had to say coming up here on \"WORLD SPORT.\" Not happy times there in the Bronx for, like you said, the Bronx Bombers. Not a lot of bombing going on with these bats these days.",
