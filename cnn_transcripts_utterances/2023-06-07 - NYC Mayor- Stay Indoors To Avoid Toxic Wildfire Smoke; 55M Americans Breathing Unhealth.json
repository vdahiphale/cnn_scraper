These are live pictures of the haze.Now across many parts of the northeast at one point yesterday in New York City topped the list of the world's worst polluted cities. And today, New Yorkers can barely make out the city skyline. It looks almost like the surface of Mars there. There's a code red air quality warning in effect for Philadelphia, where all residents are urged now to stay indoors. Even here in Washington, D.C., we are seeing the effects as well. CNN Meteorologist Jennifer Gray, she's been helping us understand this. Jennifer, looking at that map there, first of all, boy, look at that ranking to see the U.S. well above for a time, New York City well above some of the worst polluted cities in the world. Tell us about that ranking and tell us how long it's likely to stay like this.",

      "sentences": "Well, New York City right now is topping the world for the worst air quality of any major city in the entire globe. So New York City's at that number one spot right now.Now, this changes about every five minutes. So in the next 10 or 15 minutes, that could drop to number three or four. But regardless, over the last two days or so New York City has fallen somewhere within this top 10 lists of the poorest air quality in the world. Toronto has been right up there as well with New York over the last couple of days as well. So it just drives home how horrible the air quality is across the Northeast, New England, even into the mid-Atlantic. You can barely make out the skyscrapers there. I don't even know if you can see it on your television. I can barely see it from here, but the smoke is so thick. We've seen visibility less than a mile, New York City is less than a mile right now because of the smoke. We've seen ground stops at airports because the visibility is so low. So this is basically going to hang around, Jim, for the time being. We need a huge shift in the weather pattern before we start to see this led up a little bit. So it's all driven by the wind. Right now those winds are out of the north and it's pushing that smoke all into the Northeast, New England. You can see all of those little red and purple dots that indicates unhealthy and very unhealthy air quality. Some of these cities are even in the hazardous category, which is the worst. So that's why people are urged to stay indoors, especially those who have respiratory illnesses, children, especially kids and adults who have asthma really need to stay out of this, especially because this is going to most likely stick around for quite a while unfortunately. As long as we have this high stuck here and the low right to our east, these winds are going to funnel right in between. And at least for the next seven to 10 days, I don't see any huge changes in the weather pattern. Jim, remember how long we were stuck in that weather pattern, when we had the atmospheric rivers roll across California?",

So we're going to be talking about this for quite some time as long as these winds are out of the north. And I'm not saying we're going to be in this weather pattern for months. But I'm just saying you can be stuck in these weather patterns for quite some time.So as long as the winds are primarily out of the north, we're going to continue to see the smoke from the fires down here. We're still early in the fire season in Canada. So we still have a long way to go before these fires are extinguished across Canada and portions of the Northeast and even into the U.S. But the wind will vary, right? So some days it's going to be worse for the Northeast, some days the winds are going to shift a little bit more and it'll be worse for the, say, the Ohio Valley. But when it clears out for somebody, it's going to be bad for somebody else. That's really going to be the big story over the next couple of days and even weeks, Jim.",

It's the wind flow that's carrying the smoke down from Canada, but it's also that low pressure system that's kind of capping it there.

You can smell that sort of woodsy smell.And that is amazing, because these fires are so big, they're so far away and there are so many fires, and there's so much smoke that is being felt and you can smell it from hundreds of miles away when I've been in Los Angeles or San Francisco or other places that get inundated by wild land fire smoke, usually you're 10, 20, 30 miles away. But to see it in New York City, I mean, there's the world famous ball that drops on New Year's Eve. As you look downtown there, you can maybe see 10, maybe 15 blocks or so but then you can't see beyond that. It is just bizarre to see here. If you look out east, that's where the sunrise is very, very dark down there and you still have better than orange sort of haze, as you look east in Manhattan. And then I'm going to have you swing all the way around here, Ron, look west, look into the sort of the sky there, that's - the sun is on that side. That should be very bright and you're not seeing it - any of it. This is one thing you're seeing when you look at the people here in Times Square, the number of people not taking pictures of the billboards or themselves or other things, but taking pictures of the sky and just how bizarre it looks. People in masks as well. We talked to a few people who were in masks are in from New Jersey for the day, young people who are concerned about their own health and breathing in the smoke. You can feel it in your throat, you can feel that sort of scratch in your throat from breathing the smoke in it. It's also affecting the airports here a couple of the airports are Yes, sir.",

I've certainly been - I'm sure you've been in worse conditions in terms of air quality in your life.I think if you have underlying conditions: if you have asthma, if you have lung conditions of any sort, if you're elderly, if you're very young, those sort of things, you want to try to protect as much as possible. But it is even affecting the airports here with some of the airports reporting flight delays, because visibility is just so poor, so it is affecting people. But most people - I mean, this is New York, and people are not going to stay in - this is time squared. This is sort of the beating heart of the city. And it hasn't really changed behavior here very much today. And I think people are just kind of looking at it as an oddity and they may have a sore throat, but it'll be worth it in the end, end.",

As I said, the short-term effects are mostly - as the smoke as a respiratory irritant. But remember that when a wildfire burns, it burns not just organic material, grass and trees, but it burns structures and vehicles, and all of that toxic material goes into the air.So there are different studies looking at places where people have been exposed for a very long period of time to the toxic smoke from wildfires. And that's when you start to see an uptick in cardiac disease in the weeks - in the months and years after that, as well as even a hint that may be things like lung cancer can be found in higher rates in people who are exposed for very long periods of time to this kind of toxic smoke. But I think the risk, in this kind of particular episode in the United States is very low for that.",

And as a rule, if some of the kids in school will be at increased risk for recess outside, maybe it's best to keep all the kids inside until the air quality improves.The other thing that people in other parts of the world that are subject to this kind of toxic air all the time do is they wear a mask. And if you've ever been to Beijing, during a hot summer when the sky looks like it does in New York now, but every day when you go out on the streets, people are wearing smoke masks. And I don't think that's necessary now, but if I had a respiratory condition that increased my risk and I had to go out, I would absolutely wear a mask now.",
