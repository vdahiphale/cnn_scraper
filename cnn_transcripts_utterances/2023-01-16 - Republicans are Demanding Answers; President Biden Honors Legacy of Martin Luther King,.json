Did that have an effect on the outcome of the election, the fact that there wasn't a big red wave as anticipated? It could have some effect.Joe Biden -- I mean, this is out and out hypocrisy. With that said, there are obvious differences between Trump and Biden here, right? So, Biden is a case study on what to do when you find documents that you're not supposed to have and you turned them over into the National Archives, whereas Trump was defying a subpoena and covering up documents and refusing to turn them over, which is why Mar-a-Lago was raided. So, there are significant differences here, I think, in terms of the potential charges they're facing. It appears that Donald Trump has been investigated for possible espionage charges and obstruction of justice. These are not things that Biden will likely face although we don't know what it is in the documents. He is cooperating. With that said, I couldn't agree with Charlie Dent more that this goes to the core of the Biden brand, which is his competence, that he's the adult in the room, that he holds himself to a higher standard. So, I think it will damage his brand even though we are not going to be talking about what is essentially a paperwork issue going into the 2024 election, but these are the two likely candidates, and Biden has hurt his brand.
