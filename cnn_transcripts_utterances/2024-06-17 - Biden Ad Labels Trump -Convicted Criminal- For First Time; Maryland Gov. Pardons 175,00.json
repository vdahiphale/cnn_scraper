Would it be assistance with technological help, with their missile or even their nuclear program?

A pair of nuclear-armed pariahs are meeting face-to-face, in one of the most secretive places on the planet. What Putin needs that Kim Jong Un has. I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE. Tonight, we are just 10 days away, it's hard to believe it, from the first 2024 presidential debate, right here on CNN.

That was handed to you by a man who also received a pardon today. What drove you to do this now? GOV. WES MOORE (D-MD): This meant so much. Because, I mean, this was a great day, not just for the individuals and the families. This was an important day for the soul of our state. And they've been going on -- the Last Prisoner Project has actually been going around the country, and asking individuals, who are still languishing, still dealing with the impact of cannabis convictions, and asking them to write letters, to lawmakers, telling their stories, and asking lawmakers to act on it. And so, when they came in today? And they were very helpful with us, throughout this whole process. And they came in and they said, we'd like to -- we'd love for you to be able to sign the pardon, the mass pardon, the largest mass pardon of its kind, in our nation's history, with that pen? I was speechless. And I told him I'd be honored to. So, that pardon, now basically pardoning over 175,000 convictions, for misdemeanor cannabis charges, I signed with their pen, that they've been going around the country, asking families to write their stories.",

And the other one, I mean, what I thought about when I saw this yesterday, and circulating Saturday night, was the G7 video, where Biden is there. And it's the \"New York Post\" that posted this. It was a pretty misleading video, because what you're seeing here on the left is the \"New York Post\" edit, that version. That's all people could see. It zoomed in. It was claiming that Biden appears to be wandering off. But when you actually zoom out, like you do here on the right, you can see the full picture from the unedited source pool cameras, where very clearly he was talking to sky divers, who were just out of frame, as he was standing next to other world leaders.
