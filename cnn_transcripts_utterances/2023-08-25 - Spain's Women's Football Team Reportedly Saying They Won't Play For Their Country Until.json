Tonight, Spain's women'sfootball team reportedly saying they won't play for their country until the president of the association is removed. This coming after he forcibly kissed a player after the Women's World Cup. He's remaining defiant, saying he won't resign. We're going to ask one of Spain's top football journalist about the moves. Also history-making mugshot turning a political rallying cry. We're going to ask what's next for the former U.S. president after his fourth arrest. And then Russian investigators say they found the flight recorders from the deadly crash believed to have killed the boss of the Wagner Group. Tonight, all 19 defendants in a 2020 Georgia elections subverting case have now surrendered to authorities in Atlanta. This is a massive case with massive implications for the upcoming 2024 election. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A mugshot and inmate number P01135809 will forever be associated with the former President, Donald J. Trump was arrested on state charges related to election subversion in Georgia, Thursday. He was booked and released on bond at the Fulton County jail.

Kelly. She is from the Chicago area, she surrendered, she's charging this RICO indictment with also coming down here to try to intimidate -- allegedly intimidate Fulton County election worker Ruby Freeman. And according to District Attorney Fani Willis she's alleged to have told Freeman that she was a loose end that needed to be tidied up. Now, shortly after she turned herself in about an hour left before that deadline, Pastor Stephen Lee who is from Illinois also accused in this RICO indictment of doing the same thing, coming down here and trying to intimidate Ruby Freeman. In fact, Freeman called 9-1-1 on the pastor, and there's video of their interaction with him. He was released, and shortly after his surrender, we spoke to his attorney who claimed that his client was simply coming down here to knock on doors, and has no personal connection to the former President Donald Trump. As far as what's next, Lynda, we're looking ahead now that all 19 defendants have surrendered, looking ahead until Monday where the former Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows -- the former chief of staff, the former president, he's got a federal court hearing where he's trying to get his criminal proceedings moved from the state court to federal court in hopes of getting that dismissed. He and his lawyers are arguing that there is a federal statute which says that anyone who is a federal official operating in that capacity, who is alleged to have committed a crime while working as a federal official deserves to have and has the privilege of having the criminal proceedings heard in a federal court. So he's hoping to try to push that there. We also earlier today saw some of the defense from another one of those defendants, fake elector Cathy Latham who in a legal filing claimed that she was taking directions from the very top. You know, we reported a lot about this, and it's worth reminding our viewers how we got here. This is more than just an infamous phone call where Donald Trump asked the secretary of state here in Georgia to find 11,000 more votes. This is about an orchestrated pressure campaign to pressure Georgia lawmakers to overturn the election results, to pressure Fulton County election workers. And it's also about a scheme to illegal access -- illegally access voting data in a rural county that was friendly to the former president. So this was a sprawling investigation that is going to take time to play out. Fani Willis has suggested October as a trial date, we should expect a slew of legal filings between now and then.

Also quite frankly, how long that investigation is going to last, it's going to take. What I think is interesting is that the investigative committee did come up with this statement earlier, right, they said that they have now recovered both flight data recorders or the voice recorder, cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder. So, certainly, they should be able to get some readouts from that to see why this flight crashed so abruptly. The other thing, as you mentioned, that they also said is that they have recovered all 10 bodies of the people who were on that plane. So, certainly, it seems as though at least, the recovery work as far as that is concerned, has been complete, and we know that all those bodies have been transferred to that forensic institution near the area of the crash site. So, that's certainly ongoing right now. But of course, there are still a lot of wild cards in all this. The big question of course, is going to be, are any international investigators going to take part in that investigation? Certainly, at this point in time, it does not look like that is going to be the case. It looks like it's going to be a fully Russian investigation. We've already heard from Vladimir Putin that he is urging patients, he is saying, look, the investigation is ongoing, and he believes that at the end of it, the truth will come to light. Now, of course, it is a question whether or not that is going to be the case, it's obviously a very complex investigation. One of the things that we do think is going to happen fairly quickly is that they are going to be able to tell whether or not Yevgeny Prigozhin was actually on that plane. The other sort of thing that we're looking into to see whether or not it's going to happen is whether or not the company that manufactured the aircraft, Embraer, whether they are going to have any sort of representatives there. They of course, have been saying that they have been complying with international sanctions against Russia. And so, therefore, have not really had any operations inside of Russia since 2019, they've actually said. So that is also very unlikely. So, as far as the transparency is concerned, right now in these early stages, it's very difficult to tell, but the Russians certainly are saying that they are working around the clock to get to the bottom of what happened.

But the core issue of whether there is more to come, he left it as vague as always. But there is an overriding message that if necessary, they will do more to put up rates if inflation isn't going to come down fast enough. Now, where it gets interesting, Lynda, is that the fed chair has tied himself again and again and again to a two percent inflation rate. And a bit like the rain that's now coming down on top of me, that two percent inflation rate just is not there yet, but it's always threatening and the reality is, if he really means two percent, then he has to do more higher rates for longer. Otherwise, he won't reach it.",

Russianresistance is fierce, and videos like this show Ukrainians are coming under attack. And there are reports that Moscow is bringing up reinforcements. But the amid the grueling fighting, troops appear to be punching holes in Russia's defenses, widening the breach of the enemy lines in the south. And that's some Russian military bloggers. One reports that a build-up of armor and says the Ukrainians are getting ready for a decisive blow towards Tokmak. We're also hearing about a new wave of drone strikes in Crimea. Ukraine says Thursday, its troops launched a daring coastal raid on the peninsula, killing dozens of Russian troops. And despite those recent successes, one Ukrainian official wants the counteroffensive is no cakewalk given Russian air power. NATO countries, Denmark and the Netherlands, have pledged to give Ukraine F-16 fighter jets to counter that threat, but delivery is likely months away. And the U.S. says it will now begin F-16 training for Ukrainian pilots in October at a base in Arizona. Denmark says its training for Ukrainian pilots has already begun. Well, Ecuadorians have voted to stop oil drilling in the Yasuni National Park, one of the most biodiverse places on the planet, which is part of the Amazon rainforest. The Ecuadorian state oil company has been drilling in the park since 2016, producing tens of thousands of barrels a day. CNN's Rafael Romo is in Ecuador with more on the park and the voyage. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) RAFAEL ROMO, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Yasuni National Park Ecuador, a sprawling 2.5 million acres, or one million hectares in the Amazon rainforest, a UNESCO biosphere reserve. One of the most biodiverse places on Earth, as well as indigenous tribes, living in voluntary isolation. But Yasuni is also an area rich in oil, especially one section of the park, known as Block 43, with revenue earning potential the government wanted to control. It was an environmental dilemma for an oil-producing country, a dilemma voters faced in last Sunday's vote. In the end, nearly six out of every ten voters chose to protect the Yasuni. \"We have saved the greatest biodiversity that has been recognized and nationally and internationally,\" the leader of one of Yasuni's indigenous communities said. In 2007, then-President Rafael Correa proposed the international community give Ecuador $3.6 billion to leave Yasuni undisturbed, but the plan failed. In 2016, the Ecuadorian state oil company began drilling in Block 43, an area that is only 0.01 percent of the national park, but produces more than 55,000 barrels a day, or 12 percent of Ecuador's total production. Over the last decade, environmental groups pushed for a referendum to protect the Yasuni, collecting signatures to comply with legal requirements. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

That pavedthe way for the referendum that Yasuni, those on environmental groups, had been calling for, the group says the oil must be kept underground, and the Amazon rainforest untouched. (END VIDEO CLIP) ROMO (voice-over): Celebrities joined their cause, including Leonardo DiCaprio, who called the Yasuni a global biodiversity hotspot. The people in wildlife living here are threatened by the fossil fuel industry he added. But Ecuadorian energy minister, Fernando Santos, said earlier this month that depriving his country of the funding generated at Yasuni would be, \"catastrophic.\" Santos estimates Ecuador could lose $1.2 billion a year in revenue, assuming a price of $60 per barrel. The energy minister said oil in the Yasuni could last another 25 years. Some voters agreed that Ecuador should continue tapping its largest oil reserve. \"Ecuador needs those resources to make ends meet,\" this voter said. But most were convinced by environmentalists who say preserving the Amazon is more important than any money that could be made by drilling in one of the richest ecosystems in the planet.

The number is actually downfrom the more than 1,000 people who were reported earlier as listed as unaccounted for. The wildfires killed at least 115 people and destroyed the historic town of Lahaina. Maui County is formally assigning blame of the wildfires to the island's utility companies. The county has filed a lawsuit against five different companies. It says the utilities ignored the National Weather Service's, red flag warnings and the high wind watchers and that negligence in not shutting off that equipment led to the fires breaking out. Japan says it's strongly requesting that China reverses its ban on imports of Japanese seafood. China made that move Thursday after Japan began releasing treated radioactive wastewater from the crippled Fukushima nuclear power plant. Beijing says it wants to protect the health of Chinese consumers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) WANG WANBIN, DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF INFORMATION, CHINESE FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTRY (through translator): The disposal of the Fukushima nuclear contaminated water is a major issue of nuclear safety. Its impact goes beyond Japan's borders and the issue is by no means a private matter for Japan.

It's about consent. And it says in the absence of consent, this is considered sexual aggression. It's considered a crime. And in the actual protocols of the federation itself, it has the law stated and then it does go one step further and says any forced kiss would be seen as inappropriate behavior and there would be immediate actions. Unfortunately, those immediate actions were to protect the president. And in doing so, they actually falsified statements about Jenni Hermoso, which she never actually said. And it's just gotten bigger and bigger and gotten more and more out of hand.
