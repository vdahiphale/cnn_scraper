And this is CNN TONIGHT.And sources telling CNN, a federal judge is denying the DOJ request, to hold former President Trump, in contempt, for failing to turn over classified documents. We've got more on what all this means, in just a moment. And tonight, our polarized politics are on full display. There's Kevin McCarthy, who is threatening a floor fight, in his battle to be Speaker, as his own party's conservative hardliners are vowing to block him. And there's Kyrsten Sinema, quitting the Democratic Party, to now become an Independent. So, what does all of this say about leadership, more broadly, and the new Washington that's coming in January? And how do we all move forward? Plus, Brittney Griner is back, on American soil, tonight. We're learning more about what she went through, in her nearly 300-day ordeal, in Russia. Tonight, I'll talk to one of Brittney Griner's friends, who also played in Russia, and she says she'll never go back. Here with me now, to talk about all of it, is CNN Political Commentator, Karen Finney; also, former Congressman, Joe Walsh; and CNN Political Analyst, Alex Burns. I'm glad you're all here. I'm taking off my bracelet. Not because I'm getting ready to do anything crazy. But it keeps hitting the table, Alex. So, don't get afraid! We're going to go right now into what's going on, about Donald Trump. Because, I have to ask you, this federal judge declining, now, to hold him in contempt, for what's been quite obvious to everyone, in the sense of, \"Look, there were documents that belong to the United States. You didn't hand them over. They were at Mar-a-Lago. There was a protracted fight about that in the courts. It's resolved in some limited respect, but not fully.\" What does this mean to you? ALEX BURNS, ASSOCIATE EDITOR AND COLUMNIST, POLITICO, CO-AUTHOR, \"THIS WILL NOT PASS\": Look, I think \"Protracted\" is the operative word there, right, that this is a checkpoint. As you know, better than anybody else on the panel, this is a legal checkpoint, that is going to be one of many, many, many to come. And I don't think it's even clear, as we're having this conversation, right now that this particular issue is fully resolved, as much as the judge has indicated that the Justice Department, the Trump folks, ought to get together, and see if they can work this out on their own. I don't think are the judges foreclosed, taking that kind of action, at some future point. I will say, as a political reporter, the part of this that just really speaks to me. Every time, we do hit, one of these checkpoints, I think it's just another reminder that this is going to be Donald Trump's lived experience, for the foreseeable future, while he is ostensibly trying to become President of the United States, again.
