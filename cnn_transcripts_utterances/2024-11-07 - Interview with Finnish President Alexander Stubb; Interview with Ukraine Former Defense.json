I asked Ukraine's former defense minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk.Then, a Washington insider addresses the fallout from Tuesday's election. Walter Isaacson speaks with Politico bureau chief Jonathan Martin. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. From day one, Joe Biden made protecting and enhancing democracy the hallmark of his presidency. Now, he offers Donald Trump the traditional official courtesy that Trump had denied him four years ago, a White House meeting in order to facilitate the peaceful transfer of power. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JOE BIDEN, U.S. PRESIDENT:  The struggle for the soul of America since our very founding has always been an ongoing debate and still vital today. I know for some people, it's a time for victory, to state the obvious. For others, it's a time of loss. Campaigns are contests of competing visions. A country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made. I've said many times, you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your neighbor only when you agree. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

This week, the American people, knowing exactly who Trump is, returned him to the White House, declaring their hardships mandated a change of worth going back to the future for. In a moment, we'll look at what this means for America and the world. But first, for more on how Washington prepares to shift back to a Trump presidency, chief U.S. national affairs correspondent Jeff Zeleny joins us. Jeff, welcome to the program. And I know you've been analyzing and discussing and talking ever since the results came in. But let's just talk about what President Biden did today. You know, he didn't do anything unusual. He actually offered the American people what they have, you know, come to deserve over the last, you know, couple of hundred years. JEFF ZELENY, CNN CHIEF U.S. NATIONAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Christiane, so utterly normal for one president to extend a branch and a phone call yesterday to the president-elect and invite him to the White House. That meeting is likely to happen next week. And he said it was a free and fair election and, you know, lick your wounds and move on. But the reason it was extraordinary was because a President-Elect Joe Biden four years ago was never afforded that courtesy. And the questioning of the legitimacy of the last election really was a shadow and more than that, a cancer that hung over the Biden administration and the whole presidency. But, Christiane, when we take a step back on this, I mean, the whole reason Joe Biden ran for president in 2020 was to stop Donald Trump. The whole reason he ran for re-election, he thought, only I can beat him. But what an extraordinary turn of events as President Biden was pushed from the ticket because he was not equipped to serve. That was clear. Now, he will be taking his leave, and Donald Trump is coming back stronger than ever.",

That was a lesson that Democrats saw in themidterm elections that, you know, really help them, stop them from a huge Republican win. So, this was the first presidential election after the Dobb's decision. So, I think Democratic strategists thought that this would be enough to sort of stop the bleeding in other areas, on the economy, on the right track, wrong track. But it simply wasn't. And one of the reasons is abortion rights has played out in an election in many places already. Some states have passed referendums. And voters simply did not believe that Donald Trump supported a national abortion ban. He was successful in some terms of muddying that issue. He, you know, certainly is responsible for the Supreme Court justices are writing that decision. But since then, he's sort of been arm's length from that. So, I think an over reliance on abortion rights as a message and also the fact that Vice President Harris was - you know, to win she needed to be seen as the changed candidate. And so, challenging to sort of differentiate yourself when you are still in that administration. So, she entered this 107-day campaign with so many headwinds. Many of them were because of the Biden-Harris administration, the economy they inherited, et cetera, that simply was not enough to overcome and overtake that.",

This is part of his legacy. He, of course, is aware of that.

I know you were, you know, doing your stint in government as a minister. Now, you're president during the first Trump term. Do you remember what it was like?

And I think the window of opportunity that we have right now is from when the election result came to probably inauguration day. And then we'll see what happens. You know, my starting point is that Zelenskyy will probably need four things. One is territory. Two is security and security guarantees. Number three is justice. So, Russian war criminals indicted.

He got a unified European Union. He got a unified transatlantic partnership. He got a rejuvenated NATO. And the icing on the cake, of course, is that Finland now doubled NATO's border with Russia.

He has said, Europe must stop outsourcing its security and write its own destiny. You know, there's an idea that, you know, banding together with Germany, the two big powers in Europe, but both are very, very, very grievously wounded.

Because the U.S. wants to be asuperpower, and in order for it to be able to compete with China, it needs allies. Those closest allies come from Europe. There are about 40 of us who have both the same values and interest that the United States have. Now, one thing that I tell my European colleagues is it's time to start taking care of our own security a little bit more than what we will see with a new Trump administration. I think correctly so. He's going to force or at least persuade European states to increase their defense budgets. And remember, that in 2014, there were only three countries in NATO that hit that 2 percent margin. Now, they are 23. So, the movement is already there, but I would argue that we are probably going to have to increase our defense expenditure. And then the way in which it happens is a different story. I think we do it for two reasons. One, because the United States wants it, and two, because it's in our self interest in the current security political situation.",

If you, of course, look at raw donations, then it comes from the U.S. And I do think that Europe needs to take more responsibility. But this is probably one of the incentives also to start ending the war or trying to find some kind of a peace settlement. I think the money funnels, at the end of the day, are going to be a little bit more in a win-win situation, because, of course, when the war is over it's going to be all about reconstruction.

Now, that trend has swung over to the other side, and I think it already started sometime during the financial crisis, because that's when a lot of people felt not comfortable with, say, the capitalist financial system that we have. It hit mortgages, it hit jobs, it hit growth. And suddenly, people felt quite sort of disoriented and thought, hey, listen, globalization was supposed to be a good thing to us and especially to me. And then, suddenly, you're in a situation where it didn't. And of course, Brexit was a manifestation of that as well, because it was very much a rejection of the other.

You know, Walter, maybe the most memorable act that Trump ran on was that Kamala Harris wants to use taxpayer dollars to pay for trans surgeries for prisoners, which almost sounds like a conservative parody, but it's actually true. This actually happened in California. And it was a gift from the gods for the Republicans who just put this on repeat in television ads and ran it again and again and again.
