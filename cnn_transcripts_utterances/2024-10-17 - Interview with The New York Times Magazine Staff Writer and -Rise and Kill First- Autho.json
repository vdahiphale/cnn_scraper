      "sentences": "Hello, everyone, and welcome to \"Amanpour.\" Here's what's coming up.The Hamas leader and mastermind of the October 7th attacks, Yahya Sinwar, is dead. Investigative journalist Ronen Bergman joins me from Tel Aviv with the latest. Then, as the war rumbles on, where does this leave ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas? What about the hostages? We get the American perspective from former top diplomat Richard Haass. And reaction from retired Israeli General Noam Tibon, who rescued his own family on October 7th and hundreds more. Plus, what does this mean for the future of Hamas and the Palestinians living in Gaza? President of the Palestinian National Initiative, Mustafa Barghouti, joins me. Welcome to the program, everyone. I'm Christiane Amanpour in London. The leader of Hamas is dead. Israel says its forces have killed Yahya Sinwar, the architect of the October 7th attacks, after its soldiers encountered three terrorists, they say, during a routine operation in Gaza and engaged them. Only after the battle did they find a body resembling Sinwar's. Israel analyzed the corpse and then confirmed that the DNA did indeed match. This is a major development and perhaps even a turning point in Israel's war on Gaza and beyond. Investigative journalist Ronen Bergman joins me now from Tel Aviv. Ronen, first and foremost, I want to know what is the reaction amongst Israelis right now? How is it being received? RONEN BERGMAN, STAFF WRITER, THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE AND AUTHOR, \"RISE AND KILL FIRST\":  Well, I think that many Israelis, at least these who I spoke with, are happy, but also concerned. Happy that the person who masterminded a massacre of October 7 is dead. And this is something that they have expected, that looked for for a long time. But also, I think many Israelis, that includes leaders in the military and the intelligence community are very much concerned of two things, one, that this will not bring an end to the war. And second, that this will still not solve the fate of the 100 hostages dead and alive that are still held by Hamas in Gaza. And these concerns, Christiane, are not just about what Hamas will do. I think even more, these concerns are directed to the government of Israel and to the prime minister of Israel, that they are afraid we'll not see even this as a sort of symbolic act of winning and continue forward.",

He was not in the vicinity where the alleged Sinwar was killed. He is believed to be somewhere else in Southern Gaza. And it is assessed by Israeli intelligence that he will be the successor. The late Sinwar was holding two hands. He was the leader of Hamas in Gaza, but also, he replaced Ismail Haniyeh as the political leader, the head of the political bureau of Hamas. These two hands, if given to Mohammed Sinwar, I think in the coming future, we should expect a more hard line from Hamas and not something that would get us anywhere close to the final ceasefire and exchange of hostages.

And they had the plan of popping up in areas where they had previous alert that the IDF is not present. What could have happened now -- and this was a totally coincidental exchange of fire. The force didn't know that they are there. They didn't know the force -- I think there could be a mistake of them coming out of the subterranean network, thinking that this is clear of what they see as enemies forces and then just bumping into that force that soon brought drones to drop bombs and artillery of that building and being killed.",

Ronen Bergman, thank you very much indeed.Now, President Biden was briefed on the situation on his way to Berlin by his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan. The United States has hoped such a development would give the Israeli prime minister an exit ramp in Gaza. So, let go now to Richard Haass. He's the former senior State Department official and president emeritus of the Council on Foreign Relations. Richard Haass, welcome back to the program. What is your -- you've probably heard Ronen Bergman and all the pluses and worries about this development. What is your initial reaction to the impact of the killing and the elimination of Yahya Sinwar? RICHARD HAASS, PRESIDENT EMERITUS, COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS AND FORMER U.S. DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL:  Well, what Ronen said, as you yourself heard, was quite sober, because you could have a leadership change, if possible, for the worse, or at least more of the same, or you could have a leadership vacuum where there's no one to negotiate with. But I think from the Israeli side now, there's some big decisions to make. Is this something now that creates an opportunity, if you will, for the small ceasefire, not a permanent one, but something that would allow perhaps more food to go in, for the people of Gaza and obviously, to get the Israeli hostages out? A bigger thing, could this lead the way to the kind of aftermath that we've been talking about for over a year now, but nothing's really been put on the table? We want to get an Arab stabilization force into Gaza to provide security, to provide a framework for some new governance. Might this be a moment where the Israelis can essentially declare victory and say, OK, now, we're prepared to turn the page or open a new chapter and begin a conversation with Palestinians about what might come next? Or, in some ways, similar, Christiane, to the conversation the Israelis are having in Lebanon, do they see this as a tactical advance, which it is, and do they decide to double down and say, OK, we're making progress against Hamas, we've now weakened the leadership, now, let's press our advantage? So, I think the Israelis have some very big decisions to make.",

I thought theIsraelis had essentially, you know, come to the position where they were running low on targets in the north and other than opportunities, for example, to go after Sinwar, they were going to focus mostly either on what they were doing in the north against Hezbollah or preparing for the retaliation against Iran. So, I've been somewhat surprised by the intent, the continuing intensity of Israeli military operations in Gaza. I assumed it was because -- but the assumptions are dangerous, I grant that, that -- because one was seeing the revival of Hamas in certain spaces that the Israelis thought had been cleared. There's also other reports of, you know, some in Israel have different plans or ambitions for Gaza to make large areas of it, either demilitarize or even open it up to Israeli settlement. But it didn't make sense to me, quite honestly, in the context of what the Israelis were doing in the north and preparing to do against Iran.",

So, that even makes this now decisions that much more stark. OK. So, you've had another tactical advance in Gaza. You've gotten rid of the existing leadership, what now? What is your definition of victory here? Is it to continue to degrade Hamas or is it to get an Arab stabilization force in? Is it to get the hostages out?

So, that's one thing. And just earlier, he had said -- a couple of weeks ago, you know, the pagers, the killing of Nasrallah, the head of Hezbollah, et cetera, was all, you know, good military and intelligence victories.

To end once and for all what they call the ring of fire around Israel. And that's why they say Iran is the head of the octopus and that has to be decapitated. So, your view on what you think Israel will do, because it's bound to respond eventually, sooner rather than later probably, it's obviously feeling successful and empowered, Sinwar is gone, Nasrallah's gone, et cetera What do you foresee as the result or the impact of a strike on Iran?",

I've been advocating theIsraelis focus on sites with that either produce or store things like missiles or drones rather than expanding the confrontation. Iran's still sitting on close to, what, 3,000 ballistic missiles. That's far more than Israel can handle, even with American help. I'm not sure a much larger war with Iran serves anyone's interest right now. So, I would - - you know, I would hope the Israelis would think about that. But let me make a more basic point, Christiane. Israel has had military advances, both in the north as well as in Gaza. But war is not simply a military undertaking. There has got to be a political component of what you are doing. You can't simply sideline Hamas through attacking them. You've got to allow the emergence of another political entity that Palestinians can rally around. And that's what I see missing from Israeli strategy. You can't -- you're not going to create a situation where you're not going to have armed Palestinian resistance, including the West Bank, simply by reducing Iranian support for Palestinians. There will also be indigenous support and opposition to Israel coming from Palestinians in both Gaza and Hamas. Again, it calls out for a political dimension of Israeli foreign policy to coexist with what they do in the military realm.",

I would try to get a deal in Gaza to get the hostages out, to get a ceasefire, and I would press Israel as hard as one could, publicly and privately, to introduce a political component, to lay out some type of trajectory for the Palestinians to at least realize some of their ambitions. I would press Israel for a narrow military response for the moment against Iran. Not to me -- again, it doesn't solve the Middle East. The Middle East I don't think is a problem to be solved, and I get nervous when I hear people talking about regime change and other such things. Middle East is a situation to be managed, and I would press the Israelis to avoid overreaching, to think that they can solve a part of the world that I believe resists solution.",

But he also told me that in 20 years he estimates that we will be weakened because of internal struggles between us, within Israeli society. And as soon as they recognize that we are weak, they will attack us. And they also said clearly that we, as Jews, have no place on these lands, on the lands on which the State of Israel is located. These are Waqf lands. These are Muslim lands. These are lands that do not belong to us. Therefore, we as Jews have no right to exist on the lands. Therefore, there is no compromise.",

BITTON (through translator):  Since the day the IDF entered the Gaza Strip, his priority is to maintain his rule. He put the issue of releasing the prisoners as a second priority. Now, the first priority is to maintain Hamas' rule. The condition for releasing the hostages will only be the IDF's withdrawal from Gaza and the end of the war. The hostages are being used to achieve his goals. Unfortunately, Israel made a mistake during its military operation, and in its thinking that only military pressure would bring the release of hostages, which I said in the first month of the war, I thought a military effort was important in order to dismantle Hamas, destroy it, and to hurt its military capabilities. It's an important effort, but in order to return the hostages, it's not enough. Because Sinwar thinks only about the continuity of his rule. He is going to sacrifice even 100,000 Palestinians in order to ensure the survival of his rule. He is willing to pay with the lives of militants, Hamas members, civilians. He doesn't care. And therefore, Israel's mistake is that it did not create an alternative to Hamas' rule, and didn't replace Hamas' rule, and didn't allow an improved version of the Fatah or Palestinian Authority forces to enter in order to make clear to Sinwar that he has lost everything, both his military capability, but mostly his authority in Gaza. That would have caused Sinwar to make a deal to return our hostages in exchange for prisoners. Today, he feels he is in a powerful position. He is running the negotiations while still operating from within Gaza and still controls the areas from which the IDF evacuated He also controls the humanitarian aid, and therefore, he feels strong, and won't sign an agreement to release the hostages unless the IDF withdraws from Gaza and the fighting ends.

His elimination is an important landmark in the decline of the evil rule of Hamas. I would like to say again, in the clearest way, Hamas will no longer rule Gaza. This is the beginning of the day after Hamas. And this is an opportunity for you, the resident of Gaza, to finally break free from its tyranny. I call on everyone who hold our hostages -- I call on whoever lays down his weapon and return our hostages, we will allow him to go out and leave. And in the same way I say, whoever harm our hostages, blood on his head, we will reckon with him. The return of our hostages is an opportunity to achieve all our goals, and it brings the end of the war closer. To the people of the regions, I say, in Gaza, in Beirut, throughout the entire region, the darkness recedes and the light rises. Deif, Haniyeh, Sinwar, Nasrallah, Mohsen, Aqil, and many of their associates. I'm calling you, people of the region. We have a great opportunity to stop the axis of evil and create a different future, a future of peace, a future of prosperity in the entire region. Together, we can repel the curse and promote the blessing. Now, it is clear to everyone in Israel and in the world why we insisted on not ending the war, why we did insist, in the face of all the pressures, to enter Rafah, to 45 stronghold of Hamas, where Sinwar and many of the murderers hid. I would like to express my deep appreciation to the IDF and Shin Bet fighters and their commanders for their determined and courageous action. There are none better than them. Today, we clarified again what happened to those who hurt us. Today, we once again showed the world a victory of good over evil. But the war, my dears, is not over yet. And it is difficult and it exacts heavy prizes from us. I wish to express my condolences from the bottom of my heart to the families who lost their loved ones. I want to hug the families of our fallen heroes. Their supreme sacrifice, including the last few days, brings us closer to victory. As King David said, I will pursue my enemies and destroy them, and I will not return to their end. Citizens of Israel, we are in the resurrection war. Big challengers are still ahead of us. We are required for long patience, for the unity of the ranks, for courage, for a firm stand. Together we will fight, and with God's help, together we will win. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Well, I'm afraid that what happened is not really compatible with what the Israeliside is saying. I think they were looking for a photo of victory or an image of victory, but Sinwar gave them a different image. And the fact that they distributed the images of his body, which is something that is unacceptable, by all terms, has revealed that he was fighting. He was not hiding in a tunnel, as Netanyahu claimed. He was not hiding behind Palestinian civilians, taking them as human shields, as Israeli propaganda used to say. He was not hiding behind Israeli prisoners or captives, as they also claimed. He was fighting. And this image will make him look like a hero for most Palestinians and most Arabs and most people who are against Israeli occupation and against the oppression that Palestinians are subjected to. So, in my opinion, Sinwar, one more time, has failed the Israelis. He has failed their intelligence. They couldn't get to him. He -- not only on the 7th of October, but during the whole last year, they admit that. And he fought. He fought. He was courageous, and he was not a coward, as they claim. But the big question here is, after the death of Sinwar, will this push for ending this terrible war? Will this force Netanyahu to accept a ceasefire? I doubt it. Because, in my opinion, Netanyahu doesn't care about the Israelis hostages, as he claimed. He doesn't care about their lives. All he wants is to expand this war, and he's substituting an occupation in the West Bank by enlarging it and making it an occupation of West Bank, of Gaza Strip, of big parts of Lebanon, as he hopes. And he wants to drag the whole region into a terrible regional war, hoping even to drag the United States into a war with Iran. So, the death of Sinwar, if it is true, will, in my opinion, expose Netanyahu even further as a person who doesn't want to end this terrible situation. And let me tell you quickly that today, at this very moment, the people of Gaza are suffering horribly. The north of Gaza is without water, without food for 13 days. They are under terrible siege. They are bombarded constantly. Civilians are dying around the clock. People were burned to death in most recent Israeli strikes in an area which is a hospital. So, the public of Gaza is suffering. 150,000 is the number of Palestinians killed or injured since the 7th of October. And this atrocity, this massacre must stop. And it will not stop unless the United States of America forces Netanyahu and Israel to stop.",

I'm assuming you feel you have to defend Sinwar, although, I don't understand why, because Hamas is against you and against what you stand for. And nobody can really know what Sinwar was doing. Certainly, Ronen Bergman says that he was probably coming up, as they know, for air, for oxygen, and was caught with, you know, his defenses down, so to speak. But nonetheless, what I want to know is, do you believe that -- do you -- I mean, we've heard from people from Gaza in the last few hours, it's been reported, that some of them are glad that he's gone because they believe that he brought down the horrendous rain of bombs and fire on them for the last year. Some of them are not glad because they think, you know, he's the only so-called resistance leader. But those who are glad, don't you think they have the right to be glad and to hope for something else? Because nothing was going well for them while Sinwar was in charge.",

That's been your life's work as well. Do you believe that there is any window now for some kind of rebooting of a political situation? You certainly have the United States on your side.

And finally, that they would recognize the State of Palestine. If these three things happen, we will believe those who speak about two-state solution. If they don't say that, then it's just a hypocrisy. Giving Israel time, more time, to continue to the occupation and continue settlement building and continue what Netanyahu is doing, which is killing any opportunity for peace or for two-state solution. I think we can get to peace. But now, at this very moment, I don't think I have to be fair and honest with you, as I try always to be, under Netanyahu's government and his fascist ministers like Smotrich and Ben- Gvir, there will be no opening to a window of peace.",
