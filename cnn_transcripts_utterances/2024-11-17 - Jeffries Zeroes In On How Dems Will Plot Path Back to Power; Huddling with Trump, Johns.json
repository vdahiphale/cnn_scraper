I'm Manu Raju. Inauguration Day is still 64 days away, but Donald Trump is already roiling Washington and unnerving many around the world, including some in his own party. While he's picked mainstream Republicans to lead some critical posts in government, his choices for Defense, Health and Human Services, Intelligence and the Justice Department show how Trump 2.0 is much different than Trump 1.0. So how will Republicans in charge of the Senate handle these controversial picks? And what does this all mean for how Trump will govern when he assumes office on January 20th? Now, Trump last night took a break from Mar-a-Lago to attend a UFC fight at Madison Square Garden, where he was flanked by Speaker Mike Johnson. Elon musk and three of his most criticized cabinet picks, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard and Matt Gaetz. But Trump will soon return to making some critical personnel decisions. And so far, there has been one overarching theme, he is rewarding loyalty. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

These are people who he knows are going to make the Senate very uncomfortable, who he knows would have a very uphill battle in any normal confirmation environment. But he also knows from four years of being president and four years of not being president how thoroughly he has a grip on his party, and he's really trying to say, I think you know, I dare you to reject these people. I dare than I'm willing to provide. I dare you to say that this person is beyond the pale, and the question is going to be where does the Senate dig in its heels if anywhere? I think Mark's right that it's very unlikely that he is going, that Trump is going to pull any of these people back.

Like this is also just a person who won following through on campaign promises. He promised retribution he promised vengeance. And he promised these kind of figures having prominent places in his administration, and he's delivering it. And for a lot of those supporters, that is the point of the Trump vote. And so I don't think that's the fullness of the electorate. We saw on Tuesday. I think for a lot of people, they rejection of the administration and weren't thinking of this as an endorsement of every single thing he's talked about. But for the hardcore base, the folks he listens to the most, they voted for Trump for the purposes of RFK Jr. riling the big pharma, right?

They're morally wrong. And that's not going to win us any election. REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL): We have policy issues that are out of touch with the American people. Our tents got to get bigger.

I don't really -- I don't really see that. If, you know, when I hear Representative Moulton and talk about the lecturing tone that comes from Democrats, I certainly think that can be true. But on the biggest issue that was probably true for in the last four years was inflation. And I think for two years, the Biden White House was basically trying to tell folks their problems weren't as big or the economy was better than the indicators were telling folks felt. And so it wasn't a right-left thing where that was happening. It was really a party that was in service of an incumbent and an unpopular administration, and a bunch of people across right and left who did not have the political courage to stand up and say that some of that was unpopular. And that cuts across a lot of different groups. I just think some of the ideological handwringing isn't, to me, reflective of the last four years, because it was progressive and moderate who refused to face the evidence in front of them.",

My panel is back. So, I mean what's key is that there are some major issues that Donald Trump needs to deal with early on his administration. And there's one that he's not even the president yet but he has huge sway over, which is to fund the government past December 20th. Republicans have not made a decision on how to deal with that. And Trump's going to have huge say. Does he kick it into his new administration? Have to clean up the mess. They clean up everything that's been left over. And also raising the national debt limit to avoid a debt default. This happens time and time again. But Trump is going to have to confront this early in his administration. This is going to be a very complicated beginning of his administration. HIRSCHFELD-DAVIS: Right. I mean, we are going to see a repeat, most likely of what we saw the last two years, which is this very tiny majority that Mike Johnson has to corral. And there are many members on the Republican side who do not like to vote for spending bills. They do not like to vote to raise the debt ceiling. Whether that means a shutdown or a debt default. They don't particularly care. They don't want to do it. And so it's going to be a very tricky dance for him the way it's been the last two years.
