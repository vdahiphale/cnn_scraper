Iran and its Lebanon-based proxy Hezbollah have warned Israel of retaliation after two high-profile assassinations last month. The deputy leader of Hezbollah was killed in an Israeli airstrike while Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed while visiting Tehran.The strikes could come at a critical moment in negotiations for a ceasefire in Gaza scheduled to resume this week. The USS Georgia, a nuclear powered submarine armed with cruise missiles, is now on route to the Middle East and the Pentagon has ordered the Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group to hasten its arrival in the region to join another carrier strike group already there. Meantime, as Israel waits, its military continues preparations to both defend as well as offensive operations. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REAR ADM.

The exact timing and most importantly the scope and scale of such an attack are still unclear, but there's no question that there is real concern in this region at the moment about the possibility of further escalation, escalation that could potentially spiral this region further into conflict.The Israeli military says that it is now at, quote, \"peak readiness,\" making preparations for both offensive as well as defensive scenarios here, increasing flights over Lebanon where the key Iranian proxy of Hezbollah is based. At this hour, though, they still have not made any changes to those home front command guidelines, giving no new instructions to civilians to prepare for the possibility of war. But even as these preparations are being made, there are still intensive diplomatic efforts being directed at Iran to try and get it to change its calculus. Both the British prime minister as well as the German chancellor speaking with the Iranian president trying to urge restraint, trying to urge de-escalation, and one of the key reasons for that, of course, is what's expected to come later this week. And that is on Thursday when the United States, Egypt, and Qatar are trying to convene Israel and Hamas for the next round of negotiations to try and finalize a ceasefire agreement. Already though there have been questions about whether or not Hamas will actually attend those talks. And then of course, there's the possibility of this regional escalation. Should an Iranian attack happened before those talks on Thursday, that could certainly put that effort into doubt and put the possibility of a ceasefire that could really lower the temperature in this region even further into question.

But what we could understand from the remarks of Iranian officials is that there could be a combination of measures or various, you know, actions against Israel.And in terms of quality or the timing of the place of the operation, there are uncertainties. But what it seems clear and inevitable is that the retaliation will come. It's not a matter of if, but, when and how. And in parallel, we have been seeing ceasefire negotiations taking place. Maybe Iran has had the concentration not to disrupt that process. And the outcome of that process I think might qualitatively impact Iran's response. However, it will not, you know, rule out Iran's retaliation and it will come, you know, sometime. U.S., you know, military buildup in the region has been a factor for Iran. Kind of, you know, trying to temper Iran's response against Israel, as well as to send a signal to Tehran that, you know, in case Iran responds U.S. will also engage in order to defend Israel, or maybe this could escalate into a regional war. But Iran also, you know, tried to somehow send signals to the U.S. or respond by some positions by adding some new military equipment including some drones and undetectable cruise missiles, and which was somehow, you know, a signal to the U.S. that if it engages in this conflict Iran will try to target American assets or warships in the region. So these back and forth has been happening in the region between Iran and the other parties but Iranian officials are saying that this is inevitable, but the quality and the timing is not certain.

Videos released of several areas inside Russia showing Ukraine's soldiers taking down Russian flags and raising Ukraine's. And while the Kremlin claims its forces have held up Ukraine's advances in some areas, posting videos of bombed-out alleged Ukrainian vehicles, the numbers the Kremlin does admit are staggering. Almost 30 villages under Ukrainian control, more than 120,000 Russian civilians evacuated in the Kursk Region alone and more under evacuation orders in Belgorod region to the south. Russian President Vladimir Putin irate, vowing to respond while ripping into Ukraine and its Western allies.
