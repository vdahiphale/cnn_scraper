The dark and dire warnings aimed at millions in the path of Hurricane Milton, now strengthening again to an extremely dangerous category 5. Plus, the Kremlin calling legendary journalist Bob Woodward with new reporting tonight the Put -- Trump and Putin have shared as many as seven secret calls after Trump left the White House and that Trump gave Putin peculiar gifts. Kamala Harris tonight seizing on this new reporting. And KFILE striking again, unearthing in an interview J.D. Vance did not want Trump to see. But he'll see it tonight. Let's go OUTFRONT. And good evening. I'm Erin Burnett. OUTFRONT tonight, we are following several breaking stories, including bombshell new details about Donald Trump's secret calls after he left office, and his peculiar gifts to Vladimir Putin details on that in just a moment. I want to begin though first with what is shaping up to be the worst hurricane to hit Florida in 100 years. At this hour, Hurricane Milton gaining strength now back to category 5, which simply is the highest rating that exists. Dire warnings from officials tonight, some saying this is not survivable and we've got new video of the category monster from space, right now heading straight towards Tampa for a possible direct hit, anticipated 20 million people in the path of that storm. Debris already piled on the ground from Helene just two weeks ago. You know, all kinds of small pieces, concrete, wood, things that become missiles with 160 mile an hour winds are already dislodged and in piles, it's horrifying to contemplate what might be about to happen. And right now, one of the largest evacuations in Florida history is underway. Right now, it's just bumper to bumper. There's questions about gas. People obviously worried about running out of it. I mean, all of these deeply serious concerns in these final hours ahead of what meteorologists are calling an historic strike. Chad Myers begins our coverage OUTFRONT live from the weather center here. And, Chad, so tell us exactly what happens here. How soon does this start?",

Some of these storms that are kind of south and west of Key West, those could rotate enough to make a small tornado and it's a small tornado until it hits your house and then it's not a small tornado anymore because it did hit the one thing that you cared about.But I think probably o'clock tomorrow afternoon is when we'll see the first tropical storm winds on the west coast of Florida. And by this time tomorrow night, the entire state is going to have tropical storm force winds, except possibly there in the panhandle. Hurricane hunters are flying through the storm right now. There's a little break during the day. That's why we didn't get to category 5 earlier, but it's 165-mile-per-hour storm. That is higher than it was supposed to be in the 11:00 forecast by 15 miles per hour. So this is not slowing down. This is not getting down to that, oh, we're going to suck in a bunch of dry air and it's going to get some shear. This is concerning. This is concerning that this storm is continuing to be this strong for this long. Now, we talk about the cone. The cone is still north of Tampa. New Port Richey, all the way down to almost Naples, because it can still wobble. It actually wobbled earlier today. It wobbled a little bit farther to the south, which means that now, Anna Maria Island towards Sarasota, you're going to get worse weather than might you might get up in Denen when the storm could have been closer to you. The big story here, yes, there's going to be wind, and there's going to be wind damage and trees are down and roofs are going to be gone. But why they say to please get out is because of the water. The water will be and it's moving. Talk about storm surge, it's not just some lake that kind of fills up your yard. This is moving water that could knock down your home and it's going to be 10 to 15 feet above the normal sea level. All of a sudden, that's going over barrier islands. That's knocking away homes that aren't elevated, that aren't on stilts not on pillars and yes, we're going to have this large area. People ask me all day, where's it going to hit? It's going to hit everywhere. This whole purple area we'll see category winds or higher. So millions will be without power.",

Let me just read part of the statement none of these made-up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump derangement syndrome. Woodward is an angry little man and is clearly upset because President Trump is successfully suing him because of the unauthorized publishing of recordings he made previously. There was just a little taste of the statement.Now, CNN presidential historian Tim Naftali, who, of course, exert -- has been the head of the Nixon Library, tells OUTFRONT that former presidents talking to adversaries actually, you know, that may not be new in concept, but there is no record from Woodward's reporting that a really crucial thing happened which is that a single person in the intelligence or national security community knew about Trump and Putin's calls. In fact, \"The New York Times\" reporting tonight of the 19 officials that they spoke to, not one was told about these calls. So that's crucial, and context always matters here. Trump's desire to be close to Putin is important, his admiration for him is important and his clear support of Putin's view on Ukraine as just one example opens the door to something deeply serious, a former president talking with a sitting world leader in secret, contradicting U.S. government policy. So let's just take Ukraine and what Trump has said publicly tells us a lot. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

LULU GARCIA-NAVARRO, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: I think it's really interesting that that's the way the Trump campaign responded. It says to me that they know how damaging this is. At the end of the day, Donald Trump has had this very long-standing relationship with Putin. The way that this is described, I have to tell you, not only is it highly unusual, it sounds almost romantic in nature. Don't tell them that I gave you this gift.

This is really appalling. I mean, this is some -- he assuming some of these conversations, maybe all of them happened after Putin invaded Ukraine, after we had sanctions against Russia, Trump is sitting there having private conversations with Putin who we are doing our best to defeat in Ukraine. Who knows what they're saying? He kicks his aide out of the room. Is he giving Putin advice on how to deal with the Republican Party and how to make a good case for himself here in America? Is Putin giving him, Trump, advice? Is Putin giving Trump instructions? Is Putin promising Trump certain things? If Trump rallies the Republicans to be not pro-Ukraine and instead pro-Putin.
