The high-stakes sit-down comes in the shadow of Russia's war on Ukraine, North Korea's recent missile tests, and tensions over Taiwan -- increasing tensions over Taiwan.CNN's Selina Wang joins us live from Beijing. Selena, this meeting is going to be so closely watched because the buildup has been so intense here. And I know the White House has said they're really just trying to get a sense of where his red lines are. Biden has said he's not going to make any concessions in this meeting. What do you expect is on the table from the Chinese side?",

The U.S. said so themselves that they're just trying to build a floor so that this relationship doesn't tip over into conflict.The two men -- they do have a history. Biden has said many times before that they know each other well. But there are just too many fundamental differences here for one face-to-face meeting to solve that. Now, the White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said quote, \"The leaders will discuss efforts to maintain and deepen lines of communication between the United States and the PRC, responsibly manage competition, and work together where our interests align.\" So on the table here is Taiwan, the war in Ukraine, concerns around human rights in China. Possibly, also areas where they could cooperate, like on climate change and North Korea. But going into this meeting there is just so much mutual distrust. America has labeled China -- the Biden administration -- as America's most consequential geopolitical challenge. Whereas, Beijing sees Washington as trying to contain and suppress its rise. The most recent example they point to are those sweeping chip sanctions from the Biden administration that choke off China's access to these advanced chips, Kaitlan.",

Now, Taiwan -- it is a self-governed, democratically-ruled island, but it is central to the very core of the DNA of the Communist Party that this idea Taiwan is a breakaway province that must be reunified.

And also, off the back of the midterms, obviously, Biden is slightly empowered but it's nothing compared to Xi, who has got this third unprecedented term. He's got absolute control over his country.
