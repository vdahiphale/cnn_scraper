      "sentences": "Today there is growing discord between the Biden within the Biden Administration on how to handle 1000s of migrants arriving at the southern border. The Department of Homeland Security put together a plan months ago that included flying some asylum seekers to cities deeper inside the U.S. for processing. But that plan is dead for now at least.Sources tell CNN The reason is in part because the White House grew hesitant over the complicated logistics. CNN Reporter Priscilla Alvarez has been following this. So Priscilla, this is just the latest dead end. What is going on behind the scenes here?",

Priscilla Alvarez, thank you.Well, as the midterms approach, one voter group has become a clear challenge for Democrats. Right now historically left leaning Latino voters are shifting toward the GOP with the potential to swing some major races. In CNN 's latest poll, just over half of Hispanic and Latino voters say they would lean toward the Democratic candidate. That number is considerably down from just four years ago. And 21 percent of Latino voters say they support neither party. Hispanic Americans make up a fifth of registered voters in more than a dozen hotly contested House and Senate races. That includes Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Nevada, and Texas. Joining me now to discuss is Democratic Congressman Ruben Gallego of Arizona. He is up for reelection this year, and is also the Chairman of the Bold PAC, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. So let's just go over those statistics because in 2018, in the midterms, 69 percent of Hispanic voters said that they voted for Democratic House candidates. So why do you think we're seeing the shift from some Hispanic voters away from the Democratic Party? REP. RUBEN GALLEGO (D-AZ): Well, I think you're going to see some shift. But right now, all we're seeing is that we are pretty close to hitting 2018 numbers with Hispanic voters. There is, of course, some headwind, we have a very hard economic situation for working class Latino families. But overall, you know, we have Latinos running in some very competitive seats. And what we've seen so far, again, Latinos are ready to vote for Democrats, maybe not at the highest level that we've ever had it 2018, it was a pretty high level. But we are still pretty on track to hit the numbers that we need to hit.",

We have Latino candidates running in Nebraska, we have Latinos in the northeast, we have Latinos in Arizona, and they all have very different experiences.So to cast everything as a border issue, I think is not the way to go. Also people you know, they have a lot of other issues going on, too, whether it's inflation, whether it's trying to find work. At the same time, you know, there's a lot of good things that we're seeing right now Latinos have the highest unemployment - highest - has the lowest unemployment rate in the history, since we started taking labor statistics. We have the highest amount of Latino businesses that are being opened up right now. So there's a lot actually to be talking about and the border is not going to be I think the prime, I would say the prime thing that most Latinos are going to be talking about.",

      "sentences": "Of course, this is not a monolith we're talking about, but you have taken aim at your own party even recently, in a Vox interview, I want to play it and show our viewers what you said. You said people aren't excited for Democrats, because they never know what they're going to get. We get into power and we're afraid to use that power, we get into this vicious cycle where we sometimes only win because the other people are that bad when we need to show that by us winning, this is what you get.You get a middle class lifestyle you need to live, you get to live the American dream. So what can Democrats do to change that messaging in your view?",

      "sentences": "Well, exactly. Like talk with the Democrats are at their core, right? We are the party of the middle class, of the working class. And but we need to also deliver, for example, we should get back into power and deliver the child tax credit. Something that was extremely important to Latinos, 60 percent of Latino kids while there was a child tax credit, were lifted out of poverty.We should talk about childcare, because most of our houses like my house was were led by women, and they need childcare in order for them to go to work and go to school. We need to continue talking about college. Latinos want to be rich, they want to be successful. They know that that avenue to do that is college. College now is so unaffordable, and or they have to deal with the college loan that happens with that. That's why the President's college debt plan is extremely important among Latinos. So what's important is really to win and do something, not just win and hold the ground. And I think that's what has happened in the past, largely because of two very reluctant senators in the Senate.",

But the Defense Secretary Ben Wallace backing while tacitly backing the former Prime Minister Boris Johnson is a big deal. He's a heavy hitter and also somebody that was tipped for leadership himself.He's popular with the members and he's taken seriously and widely respected within the party. And if we look at the wider move, well, I have some papers to show. The Sun says Bojo: I'll be back. We also have the Daily Express. \"He couldn't could he? Will Boris be back in Number 10? But for the part of the opposition parties here, they think the mere prospect of Boris Johnson returning to Number 10, Downing Street warrants a general election right now as we can see here on the cover of the Daily Mirror. Now those who want Boris Johnson back in power will argue that he's the only one that has a mandate to continue and the legitimacy to continue as Prime Minister because he was the last Prime Minister to win the election back in 2019. They argue you can't put another leader and Prime Minister in place who hasn't won the public vote in this country and they say he could be somebody to unite the party because of that. However, the prospect of Boris Johnson uniting the party is a difficult one to swallow because his acrimony that he had with his former chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who's likely to stand against him is becoming an ever bigger problem in Westminster today. There's a lot of factionalism between the two. So it may be that Penny Mordaunt, the current leader of the House of Commons could emerge as a unity candidate, or at least make the case for that. But ultimately, it might be the Conservative Party members that decide and if they do, if it gets to that stage, then Boris Johnson according to all recent polls, would have the edge, Bianna.",

They also say her death does not appear suspicious or criminal.In a statement the university called this and unthinkable tragedy saying our hearts go out to her family, her friends and the many others who knew and loved her.

Residents in Jackson, a majority black city were left without reliable safe drinking water for weeks over the summer. Activist blamed systemic neglect, under investment and years of discrimination. EPA Administrator Michael Regan has described the situation as a long standing injustice. CNN's Nadia Romero joins me now. So what more are we learning Nadia?",
