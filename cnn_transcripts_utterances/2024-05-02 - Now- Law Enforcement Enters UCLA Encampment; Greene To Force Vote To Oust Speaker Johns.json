I'm Kasie Hunt.We're going to get back now to our breaking news. These are live images of the UCLA campus where police have entered the protesters' encampment there. And right now, the two sides are seemingly at a standoff. Demonstrators have been told they need to leave or face arrest. CNN's Nick Watt is on the campus of UCLA near that encampment for us. Nick, bring us up to speed. What's going on here?",

We have a line of LAPD officers in front of that. We have a line of CHP (California Highway Patrol). You see they have zip ties attached to their belts. They have gas masks attached to their belts. It was -- it is, we are told, going to be the CHP that ultimately makes arrests. That is from a source earlier. Now, Tom (sic), if you spin around you will also see that there are -- there is another line of LAPD. And then beyond that is where all of the Palestinian -- pro-Palestinian protesters who have gathered in solidarity with the encampment have been for the past six or seven hours -- maybe even eight hours -- since we first got the rumor that there was going to be a law enforcement presence moving into the encampment. So right now, as you say, Kasie, it seems to be a little bit of a standoff in there. We are relying on word coming out, livestreams coming out. But it appears that the protesters -- many protesters who are still in there are determined to stay no matter what they are told about arrests. They've been here for a week and they ain't leaving.

And as you said, she's basically daring Democrats to save him. And there are House Democrats who are having internal conversations right now about this who are actually unhappy with their leadership. That their leadership did not try to extract some concessions from the Republican leadership -- from Mike Johnson, specifically -- in exchange for voting to save him. You see Republicans continuing to put these messaging bills on the floor that are putting moderate Democrats, swing district Democrats in a really tough position.

And so, we haven't seen Donald Trump really aggressively insert himself into this ongoing drama, and part of that is because he is so close with Marjorie Taylor Greene and personally likes her. But it's also because there is this idea that if he does get involved and does tell Marjorie Taylor Greene that she needs to stand down, and that he supports Speaker Johnson, it could cause more chaos. And that's something that Donald Trump and his team are trying to avoid leading up into this election is the -- is the concept and the idea that Republicans can't govern.",

And so, that's something that Senate Republicans, in particular, want him to focus on, right -- is not just campaigning for himself but helping other Republicans up and down the ticket.And Republicans have a pretty favorable map for the Senate this year and the more Trump is out there trying to help their candidates, especially in these races that they should win in states like Montana, for example, and Ohio -- I think Nevada is more of a reach state for them, but that's another possible place that we could see Donald Trump campaign because of how close it was last time.

And you have a lot of forces out there that have tried to diminish the work that we do. And, quite frankly, I think there's things that people in the media have done to diminish some of the work that we do. But I always tell people you better step back and be careful with what you're playing with here because you're playing with fire. If we suddenly have a country that trusts nothing and there's no sources of common truth, it's going to be really hard to govern. It's going to be really hard to avoid protests and know what's really happening on these campuses. And if you look back at the history of the country, a free press is such, like, and awesome, distinctive, needed, necessary, vital piece of this awesome country. And it's how we know so much of what's happening. It's how we expose so much malfeasance. And so, I think on the consumer end, people have to figure out a couple of news sources that they trust and that they think, on a regular basis, are getting the closest approximation of the truth. And I think us, in the media, we have to be a little more humble and we have to realize our job is to be clinical in delivering the information, try to get to the closest approximation of the truth.
