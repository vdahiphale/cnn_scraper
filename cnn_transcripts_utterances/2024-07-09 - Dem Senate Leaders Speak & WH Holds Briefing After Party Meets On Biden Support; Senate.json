Why doesn't anybody in the President's family urge him just to go to get checked out to say, the coast is clear?KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Okay. So just to step back just a little bit, because I think you weren't in the briefing room last week. I don't want to go backwards, but just to share a little bit about that night. The President said it was a bad night. He talked about it. He had a cold, right? He talked about his schedule, right, being abroad. And so we spoke about what that night was like for him. And we understand what the American people saw, what you all saw. We've spoken to that. And I also would say, and I think you know this, Peter, you've covered a couple of administrations at this point - administrations at this point that the President, every president, has a White House Medical Unit that is with him 24/7, that is available to him 24/7, that is unlike any other American, right? That is not the norm. That is uncommon. Just down on the other side of the colonnade is where the medical unit is. And I did share in the - that the President checks in while he's exercising with his doctor on - a couple times a week and so he has that. He has something that most - majority of Americans, all Americans, I would probably argue, don't have, which is a full medical unit that is with him at all times. And he gets a full, full physical, annual physical, that we share with all of you. And that is very different, very different than an everyday American, who sometimes they're lucky if they can go get a physical. They have to get into a car. They have to take public transportation. The President has, again, a medical unit that's with him here at the White House and travels with him.",

One of them, Steve Cohen, said today, not only are they not on the same page, but they're not even in the same book. How does the White House - is the White House concerned about that?JEAN-PIERRE: Well, look, we - I've said before, right, we respect congressional members. They have their opinions. We respect their opinions, many of them that we've got - we had to - opportunities to deliver really good results on behalf of the American people. But there is, the whole Congressional Black Caucus, they support the President. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus support the President. Those are pretty impressive numbers. Sen. Coons, Sen. Fetterman support the President. There's also another list here that shows support for this president. You're going to have some congressional members who feel differently. It is - that is up to them, right? The President wants to continue. He's going to have those conversations. He's going to engage with congressional members. He's going to continue to do that as he has. That's not going to stop. Obviously, the campaign is doing their work. We're doing - continuing our engagement with congressional members as we do pretty much all the time on whatever issue we want to work with them on. So that's not going to change. You heard from AOC, the Congresswoman from New York. She said, the matter is closed, and I support him, right? You heard from Maxwell Frost, who was on CNN today, gave - was very supportive on CNN. So you do have others out there, just today - just today or yesterday, giving support to the President. I can't - you know, you're mentioning one person, but there are others as well.",

Doug Jones, former senator sitting right over here, he knows, they go to lunch, and they all talk about, you know, issues at hand and that there was serious concern in the room about the future. So we can dig into all of this. But so far, the top line from this very important day on the Hill has been that Joe Biden lives to fight another day as the Democratic nominee. SANCHEZ: Absolutely.

And there is that partial building collapse where a lot of that children's hospital, or at least part of the children's hospital, just really just fell over.And you can see the debris itself. I was actually out there just a couple of minutes ago that it's really small. It really seems as though the building was annihilated by that missile. And you know, one of the things that we have to keep in mind is that this children's hospital was not only the biggest children's hospital here in Ukraine. It was also one of the biggest in Europe. You were just mentioning that number, about 600 children that need to be relocated. Well, I spoke to a doctor who was on the ground here, an adjacent building, when this explosion happened. She said, first of all, it was a massive blast that took place. But then the hospital staff also came out here, many of them in panic, and saw that this building had collapsed. And of course, they had people who they were working with, who they believed could be inside that building. And of course, those children were being treated as well. And she said all that they could do was hope that they had been brought to safety as that rocket missile alert had been in place, that they had been brought to safety before the building collapsed. One of the things that the Ukrainians are actually saying is almost a miracle, is that not more people were killed in the strike on this specific location. Of course, it was two adults that were killed here. Dozens of people were injured here in this specific strike. But in total, all over Ukraine, in this big missile barrage that took place, 43 people were killed in total. And as far as this strike is concerned, the Russians continue to say that they were not behind the strike on this building. They say that it was a surface-to-air missile from the Ukrainians that went astray, the Ukrainians not having any of it. They say that it's clear it was a Russian missile. They called this an attack on their health care system. They also called this an attack on the children of Ukraine as well.
