And Don -- President Trump and his team, basically, were avoiding him during the last month or two. Some of the videos of him being with him or older videos. But I think they even knew -- anyone in the circle here in North Carolina knew that there were a lot of rumors about him about to be broken and let the public know. So he hasn't been transparent with almost everything he -- that comes out about him, he then admits to them, but only after he's caught. And that's not good for North Carolina.

And in defense of the Trump campaign, I knew they we're trying to walk away from him a while back and not wanting him to be on the stage. So -- but this should be as no surprise to the party. And with all due respect to Michael Watley, who's now chairman of the party, of the national party when he was North Carolina chairman, they should have done a better vetting job for such an important job. You can get away with this when running for lieutenant governor, where there's very little vetting. But when you run for the governor's office, believe me, people are going to check into your background. It's a very, very important job, honored to serve.

I lost my reelection by 10,000 votes out of 4.6 million. And that was due to a very small percentage dividing their vote and splitting their ticket. And so it does work to the Democrats advantage and probably does work against President Trump. Because most of our presidential elections in the past have been -- you know, we're a purple state. it's going to be always one or 2 percent at the presidential level and at the gubernatorial level.

Then Wednesday, the walkie-talkie attacks killed 20 people, wounded more than 600. And now today, on Friday, we have this attack. I mean, clearly, Israel has decided to pull out all the stops as far as pursuing Hezbollah as a -- as an organization. But clearly, this effort is causing real worries that Lebanon and Israel are about to be dragged into a full-scale war. These attacks -- also the attacks of this week, and also going back to the late July assassination of the senior commander of Hezbollah's military wing, all underscore what is clearly an infiltration by Israel, a compromising of Israel of Hezbollah's internal security.

Angulo's funeral is the last one of the four fatal victims of the September 4th shooting at Apalachee High School. It was standing room only inside the church for a very emotional mass, Boris. Besides the Angulo family, there were many students and teachers from Apalachee High School who were here earlier today showing their support. There were also many people from Winder and neighboring towns. Atlanta Archbishop Gregory Hartmayer officiated the mass, which was held mostly in Spanish, as a sign of respect for Christian Angulos' family and his Mexican heritage. After the mass, we spoke with Armando Martinez, an Apalachee High School student, who was close to Angulo. This is part of what he told us. Let's take a listen. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) ARMANDO MARTINEZ, APALACHEE HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT &amp; FRIEND OF TEEN LAID TO REST: He was just blessed with the grace of God that made everybody just enlightened whenever he was around. It's sad that he was taken from us and the other victims from the mass shooting. But all I can say is that it's going to impact us very hard.
