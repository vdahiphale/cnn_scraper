Good morning to our viewers here in the United States and around the world, I'm Kasie Hunt, it's Monday, October 30th, 5The Palestinian Ministry of Health says the death toll has now passed 8,000 people. Its data sources in Hamas-controlled Gaza say an additional 20,000 people have been injured. The Palestinian Red Crescent says Israeli airstrikes heavily damaged the Al-Quds Hospital. It says Israel warned Sunday to evacuate the hospital, which the World Health Organization says would be impossible without endangering patients' lives. The Red Crescent also says they received ten aid trucks by the Rafah Border Crossing from Egypt. But as fast as that aid is coming in, some of it is being looted from U.N. warehouses. The U.N. says thousands of people broke in and took flour, hygiene supplies and other necessities as quote, \"hunger and desperation grows.\" The White House says President Biden spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Sunday about ensuring the continued flow of aid and about protecting Gaza's civilians. President Biden's National Security adviser warning Sunday there's an elevated risk of a wider regional conflict that could require a U.S. response. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

      "sentences": "Kasie, good morning. Over the last several days now, we have seen signs that instead of an all-out ground invasion, the Israel Defense Forces may have chosen to do targeted raids into Gaza, followed by a gradual incursion of troops. And  yes, in the last few minutes, the IDF spokesman Daniel Hagari said that additional forces entered the Strip, and about the activity will only intensify in the coming hours and days.The Israeli military had previously said that over the last few days, they have targeted over 600 terror targets, including weapons, weapon depots and dozens of anti-tank missile launching positions as well as hideouts and staging grounds used by Hamas. Israeli troops have advanced more than 2 miles, about 3 kilometers into Gaza, in their expanding grounds operation according to a CNN analysis. Something that continued overnight. The IDF said that they killed dozens of terrorists who had barricaded themselves in buildings and tunnels, and who at points tried to attack Israeli soldiers in charge of the offensive. And just to give you an idea, Kasie, about how the offensive is being carried out on the ground, the Israel Defense Forces says air-cop guided by troops on land struck a staging post with over 20 Hamas militants inside and did the same thing at Israa University in Gaza. Where according to the IDF, the militant Islamist organization had an anti-tank missile launching post. A big concern here in the Middle East is that, this conflict may boil over earlier today. The Israeli military said that its aircraft struck military infrastructure in Syrian territory in response to launches towards Israel coming from the country. And now, we have learned that the U.S. is also sending a Marine unit to be on alert in case there's more activity in Lebanon. Kasie? [05:05:00] HUNT:  Right, Rafael Romo for us in Israel, thank you very much for that. Let's bring in Major General Dana Pittard to help us understand more about what's going on. General, it's always good to see you, thank you for being with us this morning. Can you help us understand what does the second phase mean exactly? DANA PITTARD, RETIRED U.S. ARMY GENERAL:  Good morning, Kasie. Obviously, the first phase was preparation phase going against Hamas, command control modes, trying to cut off the head of Hamas, intelligence operations, cyber attacks, psychological operations. Now this phase, the ground phase which I truly believe has begun is a deliberate phase where the IDF is moving from the north, and possibly in the northeast, again, very deliberately because of the terrain. The urban terrain densely populated, ambushes, really at every turn, block-by-block, street-by-street, building-by-building, subterranean, because of the tunnels of Hamas, as well as above-ground, and of course, on high rises very difficult. So that part of it has begun. There is a chance that others like Hezbollah and Syria are trying to pin down Israeli forces to the north. Israel has responded. But there is a serious concern that this could be a wider conflict at some point.",

Unfortunately, that also hampered humanitarian assistance for the Gazan and Palestinian people.So what the administration wanted was for Israel to allow some level of connectivity.

It's got air capability.It's got land and sea capability, certainly. And it will give the U.S. options in the area. The concern from the U.S., and that's one reason why you're seeing even more military resources, U.S. military resources being sent to the area is to avoid this becoming a wider conflict. And becoming a wider conflict centers around really one country. And it's Iran, which is supporting Hezbollah, which in some ways is pulling -- in some ways is pushing Syria, and certainly is funding Hamas.

      "sentences": "Hi there, Kasie. Well, I think that this certainly was a lot more than a protest. What unfolded there certainly seems to have been a manhunt against Jews that took place at that airport, against Jews and Israelis. Essentially, what happened was that a flight from Tel Aviv landed atthat airport in the capital of the Dagestan region called Makhachkala, and a crowd, an angry crowd had gathered there, and they did indeed force their way onto the airport area where the planes were parked, and then tried to storm that plane. They were there, overwhelmed the security forces, charged the area and were then searching that plane to see if they could find Israelis or Jews in it. A search in the terminal building as well. Obviously, a really angry crowd, they were confronted by security forces, but it seemed as though the security forces were essentially caught off guard and a lot of people did make it inside the terminal building. Now, there's some pretty troubling scenes that we've seen on various social media and media channels from inside Russia of crowds of large people confronting folks who apparently were on that plane from Tel Aviv, taking people's passports away and making them prove that they are not Jews. So, obviously, a lot of anger unfolding there, and certainly, some pretty troubling signs for the people who were on that plane, and also for people who were on other planes that arrived at that airport as well. There was one passenger on another flight that had come in from Dubai, who talked about the fact that they were stranded on their plane hours after it landed, because it was simply unsafe to leave the aircraft. Now, there has been some condemnation of what took place there last night, the mufti of that area, the religious leader of Dagestan, he came out and he told the people that it was wrong to act in that way. There is also an investigation that is under way, and the latest numbers that have just come into us is that the Russian authorities are now saying that 20 people were injured in those clashes. It's unclear whether any of them are Israeli or are Jewish, and that 60 people have been detained, Kasie.",

The federal judge overseeing Donald Trump's federal election subversion case has reinstated the gag order that prohibits Trump from making statements targeting the special counsel's team or potential witnesses. Trump responded on social media, claiming his right to free speech is being infringed.Right, less than six weeks before the Maine mass shootings, police were asked to check on Robert Card after a fellow National Guardsman expressed concern that he would snap and commit a mass shooting. Card was found dead, Friday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His body was discovered inside a boxed trailer, belonging to a recycling facility that he had recently been fired from. Officials say they also found a note he left for his family. They say it doesn't read as a suicide note, but lists pass codes to his phone and bank account. And the Los Angeles medical examiner says more steps are required before they can reach a conclusion about actor Matthew Perry's cause of death. Police say that no foul play is suspected after Perry's body was found unresponsive Saturday in his hot tub.
