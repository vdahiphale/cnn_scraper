We'll look at what lies ahead.Also ahead, searing heat means absolutely no letup in the fire burning in Greece. Local residents plead for help. We're live in Athens with more on that. And then crime in San Francisco is apparently so bad that some shops are resorting to locking up everyday items like coffee. First, though, some breaking news, China has a new foreign minister. But we still don't know what happened to the old one. In a surprise announcement, Beijing says former Foreign Minister Wang Yi has returned to his old job. Wang was already the top foreign policy adviser to the Chinese President Xi Jinping. He replaces Qin Gang who hasn't been seen for more than a month. There's been little word on where Qin is or what happened to him other than vague statements we're getting from Beijing. CNN's Marc Stewart is digging into the story for us. Have you managed to find anything else, Marc?",

      "sentences": "Well, continuing on the theme of vague statements, Max, it was just a few hours ago at a Foreign Ministry briefing that a spokesperson was asked about the whereabouts of Qin Gang and we had a very cryptic statement saying no information to provide, adding that China's diplomatic activities are being carried out as usual. Well, let's fast forward several hours and within the last hour or so we received word that Qin Gang has now been replaced by Wang Yi.Now as to where he is, what happened, that is a narrative we simply do not know at this point. But it is very fair to say that Qin Gang was one of the most visible and most respected advisers to Chinese leader Xi Jinping. He had had a very forward focused position. Serving as U.S. ambassador, he is the person who gave remarks after that spy balloon was shot down, rebukes, if you will. He is also the person who helped with the meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and himself when he made -- when Secretary Blinken made that visit to China. So right now his whereabouts are not known -- is not known but a very familiar person in this post before, Wang Yi, is now going to be in charge of China's foreign policy agenda. I guess you would say in many ways and we are going to be anxious in the next few hours to see what other information is released -- Max.",

Thank you.Now a day after Israeli parliament passed a controversial law weakening the power of the nation's Supreme Court, the court itself may be the center of a looming constitutional crisis. For now it appears to be a lull in those protests but last night police used water cannons to push back demonstrators who were blocking a main highway in Tel Aviv. On Monday just hours after lawmakers approved the first part of its divisive judicial overhaul plan, several petitions asking the Supreme Court to nullify it were filed. Meanwhile, Doctors in Israel are walking off the job in protest. Hadas Gold joins me live in Jerusalem. Why do you think there's been this lull then in the protests, Hadas?",

I'm right outside the Acropolis, which is actually shut down for a number of hours today, just as a preliminary measure to protect from the heat, as Greece faces a third wave of prolonged heat wave which has basically been the cause of many of these fires that we have seen erupting. This means that temperatures today have reached over 110 Fahrenheit. And we expect the same will be the case tomorrow before they drop again as of Thursday.Meanwhile, the situation in the fire front is not really improving, I'm afraid, Max. I mean, the three large fires burning -- there's one in Rhodes, there's one in Corfu, and one on the island of Evia. Evacuations continue. We've heard of rekindlings. We know that the fire has reached a number of other villages that needed to be evacuated in Corfu just in the last few hours. The winds are picking up as we heard this person say just to you right now. And the firefighters on the ground seem to be facing a very difficult situation. The Civil Protection and Climate Crisis Minister Vassilis Kikilias earlier today said that Greece has been fighting with over 500 fires in the last 12 days alone. That's sort of -- you know, that's about 35 fires a day. Obviously not all of them as big as the main ones that we are seeing. But the problem is that conditions are expected to deteriorate further tonight, before we see what may well be the hottest day of the day tomorrow, Max.",

We're getting this information from the IAEA, which is the U.N.'s nuclear energy agency, and from its chief Rafael Grossi who says that there were IAEA experts at the site over the weekend who spotted these directional anti-personnel mines.So the explosives would be pointing away from the plant, they say. These are anti-personnel which means that they are designed to maim, hurt or kill humans. So the explosives almost certainly not a threat to the plant itself but of course extremely worrying. As you noted the IAEA saying that this is not in line with the kind of security that you want to see around the nuclear facility. They did say that they have been informed previously about mines both inside and outside the facility. And that they were told that it is part of a military decision in an area controlled by the military. The Russian military has been in control of this area, occupied this area, and the plant itself for quite some time. We have heard from senior Ukrainian officials including President Zelenskyy that they are worried about what they call a potential terrorist action by the Russians because they believe, the Ukrainians believe, the mines have been placed on the roof. That has not been confirmed by the IAEA. And of course Russia denies that they would carry out any kind of act like that that would threaten the plant -- Max.",

So I think that the main problem is that this constitutional amendment basically stripping off some jurisdiction of the high court of justice is considered by many to be problematic because this would be opening the door for the rest of the judicial overhaul.And I think this is the main worry because the government and some ministers have already said that this amendment is only the (INAUDIBLE), it is just the salad that would open the appetite for the rest of judicial overhaul. And the problem is that this amendment basically would allow what we call in the literature, constitutional capture, capturing gatekeepers and their independent body's positions and putting, you know, loyal governmental personnel in these positions. And this in turn would allow the rest of the judicial overhaul to go through more easily. And this is why it is so a worrisome.",

      "sentences": "Yes, so I think that the challenge here is that we're not dealing with an ordinary law. This is basically a constitutional amendment. This is an amendment to basic law, the judiciary, and there are already some implications, calling the high court of justice to review and perhaps strike down this amendment.And I want to say that the court has various tools in its toolkit to intervene even in such a constitutional amendment like many other countries in the world which prohibits certain amendments to core democratic values. Our Supreme Court has already announced that Knesset, even when it met the basic law or amend the basic law cannot undermine the core values of the state institution democratic. Now I think that the main challenge is, it is quite clear that this amendment violates core democratic values. The only question is, does this amount to really undermining the core values of the state as a democratic state? And I think here the biggest challenge of the court would be to look at the bigger picture because now as we know democracies do not collapse, you know, in a single piece of legislation, but in an incremental process. And this is indeed the first step in an ongoing plan, steps as we already know because the government is not hiding the big plan. So I think that the court would have to adopt what we call the unconstitutional constitutional amendment document and place the bar already at the first step, you know, when the first step, in a way undermines the judiciary, and allow the government more powers to continue with their plan.",
