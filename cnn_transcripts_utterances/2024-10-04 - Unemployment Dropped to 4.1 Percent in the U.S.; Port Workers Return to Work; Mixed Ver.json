In September, 254,000 jobs were added and unemployment dropped to 4.1 percent, exceeding expectations.Also, after days of standing on the picket lines and hampering the nation's port system, nearly 50,000 dock workers are returning to work today. A tentative agreement was reached last night. Still, the deal needs to be ratified by those union members. And joining me now is someone who was part of the final stages of the strike negotiations. White House economic adviser, Lael Brainard. Lael, thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate it. I do want to jump right into this strike and how this tentative deal was reached, but there were reports of people across the country hoarding toilet paper, apparently, because they were worried about the impact of this strike. Of course, that had nothing to do with the strike, but can Americans breathe a little easier this morning?",

And of course, you know, a lot of retailers had already been preparing in advance. So, this period hasn't been disruptive at all. We haven't seen any direct effects. And now, with the ports back open, don't expect to see any.Of course, there are parts of the country that are affected by the devastation of Hurricane Helene and we're doing everything we can to get recovery up and running in those parts of the country. But of course, those are unrelated, and having the ports back open will only help with that.",

He pushed really hard for that, and he got it done.And yes, I think it is important that the companies came forward to make a generous wage commitment. That's important because these workers, for the six previous years, some years, they didn't see any wage gains. Other years they saw only $1. And don't forget these are workers that came out every day during COVID. They risk their lives to keep goods moving for American families and consumers. And the companies did actually do very well following COVID. And this allows the companies to share with the workers, those benefits. And it puts the collective bargaining process back on track. So, I think the president and the vice president, they strongly believe collective bargaining works. And this is an instance where by sticking with that, we've gotten good outcomes for American families.",

The top count in this case was a civil rights charge relating to the death of Tyre Nichols, that the officers acting in their capacity as officers violated his civil rights, which then caused his death. This was a federal case. It was before a federal court. They're all still facing state charges, but on the federal case, the top count there, the jury deciding to acquit these officers in just about six hours after deliberating, they had their verdict. The officers, as you said, are facing still that witness tampering charge. They were convicted on that. And now, we wait for their sentencing. They're set to be sentenced in January, but the judge remanded them to jail until Monday to have a bail hearing to determine if he's going to release them until their sentence, Jim.",

And there was none in the sky yet.So, me and my friend, Dan Jackson, loaded up our kayaks to be around 150 pounds and navigated down Class 5 Rapids, walking a lot as well, because the main goal was to get down there, bring them, like, amazing supplies, and just make sure they were OK.

The man known as the Polar Bear giving the Mets lead, stunning the home crowd in the process. New York would tack on an insurance run too to win 4 to 2 and advance to the National League Division Series. The Mets popping bottles, I know, in the clubhouse.

The Falcons hosting the Buccaneers on Thursday night. Football and a quarterback, Kirk Cousins, stepping up when it matters most in prime time. Down three with a minute 14 left, Jim, in the fourth. No timeouts. Leads his team downfield. Set up (INAUDIBLE) for a 52-yard field goal as time expires, and they would be able to force overtime. But this extra period didn't last long. Cousins hitting KhaDarel Hodge here on the first drive. He broke through, scampered 45 yards for the walk-off touchdown. So, Kurt Cousins's breaking the franchise record, 509 passing yards in this 36-30 win that delivered on Thursday night. And there's another full slate of games, of course, this weekend.
