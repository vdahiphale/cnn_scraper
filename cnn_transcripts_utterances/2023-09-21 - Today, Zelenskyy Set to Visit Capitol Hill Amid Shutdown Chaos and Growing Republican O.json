You support that, you'd be a yes on that?D'ESPOSITO:  Well, there's a couple proposals and one more that we're going to discuss this morning. The bipartisan group to Problem Solvers Caucus came up with a plan to really meet the numbers of the Fiscal Responsibility Act as well as include funding in there that the president asked for for Ukraine, but while including checks and balances, which I think is super important. We don't -- many of us don't mind supporting our allies, but we want to make sure that we know where the funding is going, what it's being used for, and that's included in this plan.

You know what Mayor Adams has said about that.

Of course, the president appoints the attorney general, who was then confirmed by the Senate, 70 to 30, by the way, in Merrick Garland's case, with substantial Republican support. Merrick Garland, then appointed about a year-and-a-half after he became attorney general, appointed Jack Smith as special counsel. Merrick Garland made clear there is that historical wall of separation between the president and DOJ. Garland even said the decision to charge Donald Trump was not even mine. That was Jack Smith. So, there's another wall of separation here. No evidence whatsoever to indicate any involvement by Joe Biden in those indictments of Donald Trump.",

DOJ is going to defy that.If DOJ defies that, watch for the House to try to hold DOJ, maybe the attorney general, in contempt. But, ultimately, Phil, that's a symbolic gesture.
