And I would like to commend, especially, the United States for providing unprecedented support to Ukraine -- military support and battalion (PH) support, and also help them to repair the energy grid -- the gas infrastructure -- in addition to the air defense systems we are providing. And we do that because we stand in solidarity with Ukraine but also because this is in our own security interest to ensure that President Putin does not win in Ukraine.",

This is a war of aggression by Russia against an independent sovereign democratic nation in Europe with internationally recognized borders. NATO and NATO allies are not party to the conflict but we help Ukraine to defend themselves. The right for self-defense is enshrined in the U.N. charter. Most wars will end at the negotiating table. At the same time, we know that what happens around the negotiating table is dependent on their strength on the battlefield. So if we want Ukraine to prevail as a sovereign independent state, we must provide military support to Ukraine. So when there most likely will be some negotiations at some time and they are able to achieve a result which ensures that they prevail as a democratic state in Europe.",
