The defense has rested in his criminal trial in New York, and while closing arguments won't begin until next Tuesday, things are heating up in another case, the classified documents case out of Florida. New photos from June, 2022, shows this -- Trump aide and codefendant Walt Nauta moving boxes around Mar-a-Lago. Prosecutors say that Nauta move these boxes shortly before a Trump attorney was going to look through them after getting a subpoena to turn over classified materials.Today, the judge in this case, Judge Aileen Cannon, is expected to hold two hearings where she's going to be hearing motions to dismiss cases from co-defendants, including Walt Nauta. CNN's Katelyn Polantz has more on those for us. Katelyn, bring us up to speed. These photos come out. What do we know? What do we need to know more about?",

      "sentences": "Well, Kate, there's hundreds more documents available in the filings in this case in the southern district of Florida accusing Donald Trump, Walt Nauta, Carlos De Oliveira, of a conspiracy around hiding classified documents from the federal government, mishandling them. But Kate, it's really a slow burn, a very slow burn as things progress toward trial in this case. That's because Judge Aileen Cannon is taking all of the requests that the defense team has made in this case before trial, motions to dismiss, motions to suppress evidence, motions to toss out everything the FBI collected in the search of Mar-a-Lago in August previously -- in a previous year. All of that she's doing one at a time.And so today is a hearing on a part of some of those requests. Today, she's looking at Walt Nauta's motion to dismiss. He's accusing the prosecutors of unfairly choosing to charge him because -- charge him with conspiracy and obstruction of justice because of his unwillingness to continue cooperating with the investigation. Prosecutors say he lied to us. We charged him because we had a reason to charge him. He was much different than other witnesses in this case. But then there are other things that Judge Aileen Cannon isn't going to talk about today in court, but that she's going to have to work through, specifically Donald Trump's request that were now seeing all of these court papers on trying to toss out the evidence from the FBI search. He also is trying to toss a lot of testimony from his former lawyer, Evan Corcoran. He wants to cut out huge parts of the case against him. Judge Aileen Cannon, well get to that eventually. But looking at the court papers now, it's giving us a fresh look at a lot of aspects of this case, including those new images of Walt Nauta carrying boxes after -- he was carrying boxes many months ago, but he told the FBI he didn't know much about moving those boxes.",

That is one of the hardest hit towns. And what you can see here just at the outskirts of town, John, is mangled trees, pieces, huge pieces of metal strewn about and crumpled like they're pieces of paper tossed throughout these fields.Again, at the edge of Greenfield, this is in southwest Iowa, this is where the brunt of these storms hit. In neighboring Montgomery County, for example, 28 homes were impacted. And I'll take you across the street here at the edge of Greenfield where you can see really the expanse, John, of how far this debris was tossed around. This is not a highly populated area right where were standing. It's not like there are homes crunched together, and still you see all of this debris strewn about on these fields here in Adair County. Just to put in perspective, John, how big of an impact a tornado like this is having in a town like Greenfield, Greenfield is small. It's only 2,000 people. The square footage is less than two miles. And that massive tornado just ripped through town around 4:00, between 4:00 and 4:45 yesterday afternoon. Ever since then, it was a search and rescue effort. Here is a moment when one woman in this heart -- this heart-wrenching moment was able to reunite with her dog. Here is that moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

We expect to go into town and we'll bring our CNN viewers the latest pictures from inside that town where the hardest hit -- the hardest hit spots from that time tornado are still trying to rebuild John. BERMAN:  All right, Whitney Wild outside Greenfield. I'm not sure our audience saw it, but we had this overhead footage of the town, and you can clearly see the path of destruction that tornado took as it went through, just a straight line of houses destroyed there.

France's foreign minister is speaking out and just poke out saying that now is not the, quote, right time, for any of its E.U. neighbors to recognize Palestinian statehood.So joining us right now is Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a key member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Thanks so much for coming on. So let's talk through this -- Norway, Ireland, Spain, in quick session, they announced these plans to recognize a Palestinian state. Hamas comes out with a statement applauding the announcement, saying \"We call on countries around the world to recognize our legitimate national rights, support the struggle of our people for liberation and independence, and the end of the Zionist occupation of our land.\" That's a statement from Hamas and Israel. And Israel, obviously, they are condemning this every way they can, recalling ambassadors, and saying that this shows the world that terrorism pays. What do you think of this? What do you want to hear from President Biden? SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE):  Well, I expect what we'll hear from President Biden is a continued strong stance of support for Israel's right to exist and for the ongoing effort to try and resolve the Arab- Israeli conflict by reconciling Saudi Arabia and Israel, something that President Biden and his senior team and a group of us here in the Senate have dedicated a lot of time to in recent months. There is a positive path forward here, Kate, that would lead to a Palestinian self-governing territory, but through negotiations directly, where Saudi Arabia would recognize Israel, Israel would announce a new path forward for negotiations directly for a Palestinian self-governing state, and the United States would provide security guarantees. There's been a lot of effort put into this. That's what was underway just before the October 7th attacks next by Hamas. Let's be clear, Hamas is a hateful terrorist organization dedicated to killing Jews and destroying Israel. So that they put out a statement today cheering on these announcements by Spain and Norway and Ireland should suggest that this is not a constructive step at this time and we should continue pressing for a two-state solution through negotiations.",

As you know, Benny Gantz a decorated military leader of Israel and now a part of the War Cabinet, has said that he will leave the governing coalition by June 8th if there isn't some plan. There is deep frustration I think both inside Israel and here in the United States about the lack of a path forward. So what is it that Prime Minister Netanyahu will be saying to us? Hopefully, is that that he recognizes the absence of a plan for a positive path forward is a real challenge.",

President Ruto is a great partner in a significant democracy in a troubled region. Just look at the countries around him, like Somalia and Sudan and Ethiopia and he has a good partner in security, in public health, in promoting opportunity and the digital economy. We have a talented ambassador, Meg Whitman there and this long overdue state visit will be a great opportunity for our president and leaders in our Congress to show that they recognize the critical importance of Kenya in East Africa, but also in the world.",
