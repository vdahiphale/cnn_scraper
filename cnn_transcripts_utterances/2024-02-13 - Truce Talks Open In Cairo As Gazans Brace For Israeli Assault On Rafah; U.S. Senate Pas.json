Tonight, crucial talks inCairo as negotiators including CIA Director Bill Burns made to try and secure the release of hostages held in Gaza. But with Hamas not at the table right now, can progress be made? Then, all eyes turn to the U.S. House after the Senate passes a $95 billion aid package for Ukraine and Israel. We'll have the latest. Plus, a record- breaking Super Bowl in more than one way, 123 million viewers tuned-in, making at the U.S. TVs biggest audience since the moon-landing. We'll have that and much more coming up. Do not return until everyone comes home, the living and the dead. A message today from families of hostages being held in Gaza. They're urging Israeli negotiators to remain in Cairo until a deal is reached that secures their loved ones' release. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi is hosting a new round of talks involving senior U.S.-Qatari and Israeli officials. Hamas is not there. But says it could return to Cairo if progress is made on brokering a truce. Well, a pause in the fighting can't come soon enough for the people of Gaza. Some Palestinians who had fled to Rafah and now fleeing once more ahead of a threatened Israeli ground offensive. Even though, there's virtually nowhere safe to go. U.S. President Joe Biden says Israel must not launch that offensive without a credible plan to protect civilians. But the IDF says it hasn't yet presented evacuation plans to the Israeli government. Well, I want to bring in CNN's Nada Bashir who joins us live from Cairo. Good to have you there for us, Nada. So Israel has once again launched deadly strikes in Rafah in the south of Gaza. Human Rights Watch is calling out Israel for what it describes as unlawful acts of aggression. Just take us through the details.",

Important to remind our viewers,of course, that more than a million people are concentrated in Rafah, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced on multiple occasions. Many of them after they were told by the Israeli manager to move south for that protection. Now, of course, we have seen a series of airstrikes, local officials say residential buildings were struck. We know of course, there has been a growing death toll amongst civilians. And we've been hearing from people on the ground now is that many are choosing to evacuate themselves  from Rafah and move farther north, to move back to central Gaza, an area which again is still coming under heavy bombardment, it has been almost entirely destroyed after more than four months of war and airstrikes. So, you can imagine the desperation many of these families choosing to make their move over fears that we could see a ground operation. Of course, this comes amidst ongoing negotiations, but for many, this is a moment of sheer desperation in Rafah. A warning to our viewers, some of the footage in this report will be distressing. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) BASHIR (voice-over): Seemingly endless chaos in this field hospital in Rafah. Doctors, volunteers crammed into the small tent, delivering whatever care they are still able to provide. Overnight on Tuesday, another round of airstrikes on a city once thought to be the only safe place left for more than a million displaced civilians. Just 24 hours, prior airstrikes carried out by Israel was part of an operation to secure the release of two hostages killed, more than 100, according to the Palestine Red Crescent.

And of course, we have also heard that it appears clear amongst the mediators that they are determined to push forward with some sort of prolonged truce. At this stage, it's looking to be a truce that would last at least six weeks. And the hope by many in the international community, in particular, the mediators involved in this like the likes of United States, Qatar, Egypt, and other people in the region is at this six-week truce. If it is established and agreed upon, will provide the time and space, not only to allow for gradual release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but will also allow for a framework to be established to move forward towards a lasting, full ceasefire. At this stage, an agreement is not said to be imminent. Hamas had said that they are prepared to send a delegation, if indeed there is progress. But of course, again, all eyes on the situation in Rafah, if indeed we do see a ground operation as many fear, we will see by the Israeli military, that could place those talks in jeopardy.

You have to set red lines for Israel. And one of those is the increase in violence that's happening in the West Bank by the military, by settlers, the   increase in arrest, the increase in the number of people killed, the fact that the economy and the West Bank has been hit hard, also over 20 percent down according to international observers. So, all of these things now sort of bear all that pressure from these countries is bearing fruit, if you will, and it's bearing -- and that's why we're seeing countries like the United States, like France,  most recently sanctioning 28 different settlers for their violence against Palestinians, and those 28 that have been sanctioned, will no longer be able to travel to France.

But that kind of posturing and jockeying is going to happen for some time. And in the middle of all of it, will be aid to Ukraine. The question will be, if things for Ukraine get even more dire as they are in -- badly in need, even more so of this aid that is stalled in the United States Congress. Does that change the calculation at all on Capitol Hill? Does that force any change in the posture of the Republican leadership? But at the moment, there are no indications whatsoever that the Republicans in the House will change how they will approach this issue.

It hasn't yet ruled on whether genocide is taking place, an accusation that Israel denies. Well, for more on this, I want to bring in our David McKenzie who is following the story for us from Johannesburg. Good to have you with us, David.

And it could be, as some have speculated that Israel is trying to ratchet up the pressure for some talks, but the South Africans at least, are taking this at face value. They have returned to the International Court of Justice with this appeal. This is basically an appeal to the justices to try and get further what are effectively temporary restraining orders as -- or restraining orders of a kind. They say that they want \"to prevent further imminent violations of the rights of Palestinians in Gaza.\" And I'm quoting there. Now, they are able to do this based on the rules of the court for an ongoing matter, if they believe, which clearly do, that there could be further violations of the Palestinian people by Israel in the coming days if there's this major offensive. Which would be going against on some level, according to South Africans, the ruling by the ICJ in late January.

The Super Bowl, you know, going in overtime, and then you see, Ithink, a lot of people hung around to see Taylor Swift get down on the field. It was a made for TV moment where she embraced her now boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and you know, they were being showered in confetti. And so, you can see why this Super Bowl rated so well. I will say it is remarkable that the NFL continues to post these sorts of numbers because, broadly speaking, the industry is in decline as streaming services have really upended everything. So, while broadcasters are seeing lower ratings, even Major League Baseball and the NBA, they've been unable to really sustain those live audiences that they once enjoyed, you know, maybe 10, 15 years ago. The NBA is not only surviving, it's really thriving and breaking those records.",
