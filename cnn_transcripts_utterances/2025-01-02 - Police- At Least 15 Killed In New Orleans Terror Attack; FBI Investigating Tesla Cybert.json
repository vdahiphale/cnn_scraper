And according to our next guest, going ahead with the game is a good thing.CNN senior national security analyst Juliette Kayyem writing in The Atlantic, \"Getting on with activities as normal, to whatever extent is possible, is the correct approach. Responses to terror or violent attacks need to be based on the specifics of the incident, but the default should always be to remain open. A nation, any nation, must have the capacity to mourn and move forward simultaneously.\" Juliette Kayyem now joins us live from Cambridge, Massachusetts. Juliette, nice to see you this morning. So given what you just wrote there, how do you strike the balance between carrying on these largescale events and substantially ramping up security? JULIETTE KAYYEM, CNN SENIOR NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST, FORMER ASSISTANT SECRETARY, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY, HARVARD PROFESSOR (via Webex by Cisco):  It is a balance, first of all. The primary concern is can the city and public safety officials guarantee the safety and security of the next event or just the city being open. We've seen over the course of the last two decades from Nice to Berlin to here in Lewiston in Maine and New England those cities essentially shutting down in response to terror incidents or major violent incidents. That may be helpful in some instances. But for the most part if the city can guarantee that the next event is safe and secure, as New Orleans has promised, then they -- then they should proceed. The default is then you're sort of waiting for things to always be safe. That's not going to happen in a city like New Orleans. And so what New Orleans has to assess now is what kind of changes can they make to the safety and security of the Sugar Bowl tonight that will guarantee not only that people are safe but that they perceive themselves to be safe. And that's what you see going on in the last 20 hours or so as they ramp up for this event tonight, which I hope does continue.",

U.S. officials have been particularly alarmed by propaganda and recruitment efforts by the Afghanistan-based branch of ISIS, ISIS-K, especially since the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan has left the government with poorer intelligence-gathering capabilities in the country.\"So given that, how much concern is there about these lone wolf attacks, as well as the threat of ISIS -- how much does the threat of ISIS pose to the U.S. right now?",
