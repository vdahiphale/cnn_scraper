I'm Jim Acosta in Washington.We begin the hour with a crucial ruling out of the State of Texas that arguably marks the most significant blow to women's rights since the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade last summer. A Trump-appointed Judge in Texas ruled Friday that the FDA's more than two-decade-old approval of the drug, mifepristone should be halted. It is one of the most trusted and widely used drugs for medication abortions. The Court did pause the ruling for one week so that an appeal, which is already underway can be filed. Democrats are slamming the decision with the Biden administration vowing to fight back. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

DICK DURBIN (D-IL): Remember what they said about the Dobbs decisions? Well, we're going to let each State decide the law on abortion as it relates to the residents of that State. Now, look, what's happening. Here comes a Judge in Texas who has decided that he is going to call into question the legitimacy and efficacy of a drug that's been on the market for 20 years, not just in the State of Texas, mind you, but nationally, if he has his way.

I'm right here in Central Tel Aviv, and as you can see around me, there are literally thousands of people who have come out. Now the folks say that, quite frankly, for them, they believe that democracy is under threat here in this country. They believe that the division of powers is under threat, and with that, the rule of law as well. And the simple reason for that is that despite the fact that the proposed law to reform or overhaul essentially, the Supreme Court of this country has been put on ice, it hasn't completely been shelved yet, and the people here obviously feel that that could become a law that then would allow the government to essentially control Israel's Supreme Court. Now all of this, of course, happening in that very volatile security environment that we've been here in this country over the past couple of days. You have of course, had the Israeli Security Forces on two occasions raid the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, then you had those rocket strikes coming from Lebanon to Israeli territory, the Israelis responding not just bombing targets in South Lebanon, but in Gaza as well. Right now, all of that has calmed down to a certain degree, but the situation obviously, still very tense. And the folks here, they have taken that into consideration. On the one hand, they do have their speeches. As you can see, the crowd also is very lively. But there is no music, for instance, being played. And at the same time, of course, they also understand that a big event like this could also be a target as well. You did have a terror attack that took place here in Tel Aviv, only a day ago, where one person was killed. So right now, obviously, the security environment here in the city, as in the whole country remains very tense -- Jim.",

Joe Biden's approval rating is like 41, 42, 43, 44 depending on what poll you're looking at, but the average candidate in the special elections and federal and state legislative are outperforming Biden 2020 performance by five points on average.

It started with a patient of mine that I had, a young woman about 31 or 32, who came to me with advanced kidney disease and she had just gotten married, she went to her gynecologist who drew some blood for just basic tests and the tests came back with really weak kidney function. We determined that she was going to be on dialysis very soon and I told her we need to start talking about dialysis options or transplant. The next time she came to see me she told me that none of her family members or friends came forward to donate. And my heart was just breaking for her because this young woman whose life was just starting, she wanted to get pregnant, have a baby and on dialysis it's extremely difficult to become pregnant and carry a pregnancy to term. And I just knew wouldn't be possible for her and my heart just broke for her.And since then I was just thinking about donating. I wasn't sure if I could donate for a while because I have a history of bladder cancer. But since I haven't had a recurrence, I contacted our transplant team about two years ago and asked them could I be a donor. And they said since you haven't had any recurrences, you probably can. So this November, I started the workup process and it turns out that I was a good donor --",
