That, frankly, is intention with this notion that the Justice Department should not get involved in politics, should not muck around close to an election. And those two are at loggerheads with each other, one has to give way to the other.And the resolution of this tension, at least according to Judge Chutkan, is the administration of criminal justice, no person is above the law. So, I think you're right that he should be treated like every other person, every other accused in court. What's important to remember, though, is that every other accused, including the president has a sixth amendment right to an effective assistance of counsel. So if his lawyers say, hey, this is too quick, I cannot be effective, I cannot prepare, then there's going to be a problem in terms of whether this thing can move at the pace the judge wants it to move.",

She has a keen sense of what a sophisticated litigation entails after the Public Defender Service. She was at a major law firm and did all sorts of commercial and criminal litigation.

The June 7 letter says, I have full authority, that was before Special Agent Ziegler and I testified in front of the House Ways and Means Committee. And then, the June 30 letters released after our testimony was voted out by that committee and made public. And it was clear that United States Attorney Weiss changed his story because he says I have full authority to charge. The June 30 letter, he echoes that saying a full authority charge. And it's a very important paragraph then he has right then where he says -- after that he says, I don't have the authority charge outside of Delaware, I would have to partner with a U.S. attorney where a venue exists.

That's the provocative question recently raised by \"New York Times\" opinion columnist David Brooks that sparked a heated online debate.He wrote -- quote -- \"I ask you to try on a vantage point in which we anti-Trumpers are not the eternal good guys. In fact, we're the bad guys.\" The elites, argues Brooks, while talking a good game about supporting the marginalized actually perpetuate a system that serves themselves. He traces the phenomenon to the 1960s when high school graduates were forced to go to fight in Vietnam while the offspring of the educated class got college deferments. And then in the 1970s when to fix racial imbalance busing was imposed on working class communities but not the upscale ones. Brooks writes, \"The ideal that we're all in this together was replaced with the reality that the educated class lives in a world up here and everybody else is forced into a world down there. Highly educated parents go to elite schools, marry each other, work at high-paying professional jobs and pour enormous resources into our children who get into the same elite schools, marry each other and pass their exclusive class privileges down from generation to generation.\" He cited the ground breaking work of my next guest in his book \"The Meritocracy Trap: How America's Foundational Myth Feeds Inequality, Dismantles the Middle Class, and Devours the Elite.\" Daniel Markovits joins me now. He's a professor of law at the Yale Law School and the founding director of the Center for Study of Private Law. Professor, what does merit mean as we are using it, and what's wrong with it? DANIEL MARKOVITS, AUTHOR, \"THE MERITOCRACY TRAP\"/PROFESSOR OF LAW, YALE LAW SCHOOL: Well, first off, thanks for having me on. It's a pleasure to be here. So, what merit means is that people get ahead based on their accomplishments rather than on say their race or their gender or their religion or their parent's breeding. The problem is that accomplishments depend very, very heavily on the investment that parents make in their kids' education. And the elite today have so much more money than everyone else and have an infinite taste for investing in their kid's education. And so, they spend vastly more sums than anyone else can afford and then they produce kids who because education works accomplish more than anybody else. And that means that while they are very hard working, their advantages are undeserved and unfair.",

I mean, the feature of the system we built is that when the elite does everything it's supposed to do, when it teaches its kids to work hard, to get good at things, to study, to try, it also gives them enormous undeserved and unfair advantage.And whether people should feel guilty for giving their children virtues but unfair advantage, that's between them and their gods. But the point of the analysis is that this is a kind of structural inequality. And whether we feel guilty or not, or whether you feel guilty or not, what people should do is try to change the system. Try to democratize education, try to democratize work, try to support mid skill -- middle class jobs, policies that will produce those jobs, rather than further policies that concentrate privilege and advantage in the elite.",
