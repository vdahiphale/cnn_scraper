Sir, good morning to you, always grateful to have you on the program.Let's just start kind of big picture here. This is obviously the second time that something like this has happened in this incredibly unprecedented election season.

But the fact that his interest seems to be toward the war in Ukraine.He claimed at one point that he had himself been to Ukraine, he was trying to recruit others to go to Ukraine to fight. We don't know if that's a motive or not, but that's certainly something that the FBI will be taking a look into to see whether or not that's what motivated him since the former President has not been at least vocally a very strong supporter of Ukraine. So, whether or not that has anything to do with it remains to be seen. You know, sometimes, you have these kinds of cases, not attempted assassinations, but just criminal cases in general. You never find a motive. So, they'll have to rely on the forensic evidence, statements, anything that they get in order to be able to bring this case to trial. He is alive, so, they have to be very careful because there will be a trial at some point in time. HUNT:  Chief Ramsey, we heard yesterday from Jared Moskowitz on our air, he's congressman. He's part of a Task Force that's aimed at investigating the response to the first incident, trying to understand what happened there. I want to show you what he had to say yesterday here on CNN, and then we'll talk about it. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. JARED MOSKOWITZ (D-FL):  I'm very concerned about, you know, the status of the Secret Service's ability to keep the former President safe in outdoor -- in outdoor environments. But I went to Butler. I could not believe how close the roof was to the stage. The protocols going on right now and the resources being committed to the former President, in my question, it seems to be wholly inadequate.

Florida police yesterday detaining a man in connection with their investigation. Law enforcement sources telling CNN, the man is Ryan Wesley Routh, a 58-year-old Hawaii resident with connections to North Carolina.As the investigation begins, we at CNN are learning more about Routh. He reportedly spent months in Ukraine trying to join the fight against Russia. He was even interviewed by the \"New York Times\" last year. That reporter today, writing this, quote, \"Mr. Routh, a former construction worker from Greensboro, North Carolina, said he never fought in Ukraine himself. He was told that he had no military experience, but like many foreign volunteers who showed up at Ukraine's border in the war's early months, he was eager to cast aside his former life for something far more exciting and make a name for himself. By the time I got off the phone with Mr. Routh some minutes later, it was clear that he was in way over his head, like many of the volunteers I interviewed, he fell off the map again until Sunday.\" A representative of the Ukrainian military confirmed to CNN this morning that Routh was never a part of their foreign legion. Here's Routh speaking with \"AFP\" in Kyiv. This was back in April of 2022. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) RYAN WESLEY ROUTH, SUSPECT IN DONALD TRUMP'S SECOND ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT:  Putin is a terrorist, and he needs to be ended.

This is a strange chapter, I suppose for this person who was detained in connection with the apparent assassination attempt against former President Trump. What more do we know about this episode?MAX FOSTER, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT:  Well, as you can see, he was certainly in Ukraine. He wasn't allowed into the foreign legion, and he wasn't -- anything to do with the foreign legion as we understand. But then moved into this self-appointed role, trying to recruit people into the foreign legion, but because he didn't have that association, it seems like, you know, it wasn't the right route to go if you wanted to join the foreign legion. We're still digging around on that, but you know -- you know, if you look at what's happened since, it seems he's moved his attention from Ukraine to Taiwan using website under the name Taiwan foreign legion. He listed himself as an international volunteer center coordinator, trying to get people to fight in case Taiwan went to war with China. But the interesting thing is, according to our sources, some of the people he claims to have recruited had never, you know, agreed to be recruited or had their names used, and they certainly aren't -- weren't being recruited. As you know, Kasie, there is no foreign legion in Taiwan.",

Tito Jackson was 70 years old.All right, time now for weather just days after Francine cleared out, we're now bracing for another tropical storm, this time in the Carolinas. Let's get to our meteorologist, the weatherman, Derek Van Dam with the latest. Derek, good morning.   DEREK VAN DAM, METEOROLOGIST:  Good morning, Kasie. The good news is that the storm has not strengthened overnight, the bad news is, we still have a very rough next 12 hours or so across the coast of the Carolinas. So, if you're extending your weekend, perhaps along the beaches here, we will have to deal with some high surf, strong gusty winds, and the potential for some localized flash flooding as well. There is a tropical storm warning that extends basically just south of Charleston through Wilmington and Morehead City. This is a low pressure, we're calling this a potential tropical cyclone. We don't want to split the difference and fine-tune the naming here, but the point is that, this will just bring about of heavier rainfall and the potential for gusty winds in excess of 40 miles per hour throughout the course of the day today. So, you can see the system moving onshore within the next 12 hours, bringing rainfall with it too much of the Carolinas, even into Virginia, parts of northern Georgia and eastern Tennessee, several inches of rain. We're talking about 3 to 4 inches, especially along the coastline. So, heads up, Wilmington, you've already had a very wet 2024. Now, in terms of winds, current wind-gusts right now, about 26 to 35 miles per hour, this will bring on some form of storm surge across the coastal areas, but it remain very small, very weak, 1 to 3 feet at best as the system moves onshore. So, Kasie, kind of a rough day in the Carolinas elsewhere, rather quiet.",
