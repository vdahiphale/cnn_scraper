The former president is expected to turn himself in on Tuesday to face criminal charges and appear before a judge. The Trump legal team says it's ready to challenge the indictment and the Trump campaign team says he'll head back to his Mar-a-Lago estate Tuesday night to deliver a speech. Right now no one knows what the charges are exactly. The indictment is still sealed, yet many Republicans are already rallying around their leading candidate for the Republican nomination. And New York City is preparing for the security nightmare of a first ever arraignment of a current or former president. We're covering every angle of this unprecedented moment from here in Washington, D.C. to Mar-a-Lago and Manhattan. Let's begin with CNN's Kristen Holmes in West Palm Beach near Mar-a-Lago in Florida tonight. Kristen, how is this going to play out over the next few days? And I suppose it's a surprise, you know, it would have been a surprise if he weren't making some kind of a speech on Tuesday night. We knew he have to say something.",

We have to keep in mind that as you noted this is a huge security concern and a huge security effort so there are still details that are being pounded out. But what we know is that the former president will leave Mar-a-Lago, we believe, Florida tomorrow afternoon.He will arrive in New York. He will spend the night at Trump Tower and then head down to the courthouse Tuesday afternoon. After that he will get on a plane almost immediately after his arraignment, after that public unsealing of the indictment, and come back here to his Florida home where he will deliver a primetime address. And I am told by sources that this will be the opportunity, and I'm sure that he will take it, for him to spin his own narrative. And that's really what we have seen from the president, not just with the last recent days in this indictment, but for the last several months around all of these legal entanglements. We have heard him talk about how it is a political hoax and a witch hunt. And I do have some reporting from sources who say he really spent most of the weekend texting and calling allies, supporters, talking about how he believes that this is a political plus for him. But here's the thing. As you mentioned, these Republicans, they have gone out there, they have defended him, they have gone on board with this idea that it is a political hoax and witch hunt, but none of them have actually seen the charges. So the question is whether or not that messaging around the former president changes once we actually see what he is charged with -- Jim.",

What I've seen is law enforcement certainly bolstering their presence here over the weekend, even staging some of those barriers that are used for crowd control.And the key here is just in case, because it's not -- if we're going to talk about the what is happening here in Lower Manhattan, it's important to remind viewers of the why we've seen law enforcement just steadily increased their presence in and around 100 Center which is the building that you see behind me which all eyes will be on come Tuesday when Donald Trump travels here to officially face those charges. There is of course the security concerns that come with transporting a former president that is still under Secret Service protection but also that the potential violence that we may see, again, again this coming from law enforcement saying that for the last two weeks they've been mothering online chatter for any potential word of protest and the concern with that is that we could see that in a post-January 6th world, devolved into some possible violence. And that is why authorities have been keeping a close eye on the building that you see behind me. But we should mention, Jim, as we send things back to you, that law enforcement officials here in New York City, saying that they have no credible threat right now that they've identified but that doesn't necessarily mean that they'll let their guard down for the next two days.",

Great panel having both of you gentlemen on tonight. Thank you so much. John, let me talk to you first. This is obviously an unprecedented moment. That word unprecedented, it gets used a lot. This is -- I think it's bigger than unprecedented. Donald Trump is the first former president to be indicted. Do you think that -- I mean I know you were intimately familiar with what happened with the Watergate 50 years ago. That was once seen as the mother of all political scandals here in the U.S. but to see a former president of the United States go into a criminal courthouse to be arraigned, paint that picture for us.

They were going to charge him with obstruction of justice and bribery for his role in the coverup, but Ford pardoned him and that ended the drafting. After that any effort obviously has been moot to try to pursue the case further.Obviously with Bill Clinton there were some talk by the Special Counsel Ray that he wanted Clinton to know that he could charge him with perjury but they worked out an arrangement so it didn't get that far. So, yes, we are unprecedented. But, you know, Jim, what strikes me as most unprecedented about this is Trump's treatment of the process, his belittling the judiciary, his attack on the prosecutor, his attack on the judge. [20:10:09] I don't know how much this judge is going to tolerate. If that happened during Watergate, they had a very tough judge, John Sarica, he would have hauled any defendant who played these kinds of games before him and said, listen, I'm going to give you one warning and if you reach this warning, you're going to find yourself in a very, very tough situation.

The best anecdote for speculation is transparency. The more we can put all of the information out there in real time that is the best way for us to tamp down a lot of the speculation as to what's going on. And the more the people can find out the better. But here's the thing. And in the defense of many Trump supporters out there, and I'm not defending Donald Trump, but in terms of where we are right now many people are very frustrated with the fact that this does appear as though this is prosecutorial overreach.",
