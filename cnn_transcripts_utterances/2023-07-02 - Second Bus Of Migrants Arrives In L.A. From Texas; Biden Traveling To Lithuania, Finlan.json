We want this shooting to be treated just as it happened in rural America.

Now, these new programs could give borrowers some wiggle room to pay off their debt without going into default or damaging their credit. But in order for them to go into effect, the Department of Education must undertake a formal rule-making process, and that typically takes months. Nearly 44 million student borrowers must begin repaying their loans as early as October. So joining me now, Natalia Abrams, the president and founder of the Student Debt Crisis Center. Natalia, thank you so much for being with us because there are so many, many people who are probably very confused right now about their options. Clearly, the president's post-COVID debt relief program is off the table. That was struck down by the Supreme Court. But while he sorts out his, quote, plan B, there are a lot of programs that have been passed by Congress, have been on the books for a while, that people can avail themselves of.

You're absolutely right, there are programs that have existed before what's gone on in this past year with President Biden's cancellation program, that can help you re-pay your student loan if you're struggling, if you make zero dollars, you can pay zero dollars.The I guess pitfalls with these programs is you have to know about them and you have to sign up for them and re-apply each and every year. But these programs have not been touched. Public service loan forgiveness has not been touched. It's not impacted by anything going on right now, and that really is important and a question we're getting asked all the time. The other thing I'd say is these programs, which are called income- driven repayment programs, they are not a substitute for student debt cancellation.

I don't see any problem with it.And I will say in my experience, there's often a bit of a disconnect between prosecutors and the agents who investigate these cases, with the agents wanting sometimes to be more aggressive and the prosecutors not willing to go there because they're the ones, of course, who have to prosecute the case in court and defend it on appeal.",

So these are real issues that are going to happen in the future, and these are issues that are also happening now. So when you look at this, you look at the profits the studios are making, the money the executives are making, you know, the actors -- writers for instance have been asking for what essentially adds up to about $460 million, which is kind of two CEO salaries. Now is that where this is going to end? Well, of course it's not. It never is that. And it's always about the money, because nothing says I love you like cold, hard cash. The thing is, are they going to be able to find a deal? If the actors join the writers on the picket line, you are going to see some serious rubber hit the road. And at that point, the director's guild, who actually had a deal last month, they might suddenly feel like they maybe moved a little too fast. We don't know. What we do know is this. The last big-time the actors joined a national strike was in 1960 when, and this will be a surprise to some in the Republican Party, as well, Ronald Reagan was the head of the Screen Actors Guild. So the great communicator obviously knew how to get a thing or two done. Maybe we need someone like that to step in at this point, because this is serious business and it looks like it's a little bit where the, well, train may have gone off the rails a little bit, at least until July 12th.",

As that strike wears on, many other businesses are being forced to lay off their workers.CNN's Natasha Chen has more on the devastating ripple effect. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) NATASHA CHEN, CNN NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Yolanda Cendejas Garcia, a janitor, was laid off from Paramount Studios shortly after the writers' strike began. Fewer productions means less to clean. Nearly two months later, she's collecting plastic bottles for cash, she's buying cheaper groceries, and says she'll soon lose health insurance, and worries about buying her diabetes medication. And now SAG-AFTRA has announced an extension of talks over its deal with studios, while its 180,000 members have already overwhelmingly authorized a strike. These actors could add to more than 11,000 writers already on the picket line and halt more productions. YOLANDA CENDEJAS GARCIA, LAID-OFF JANITOR, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS (through translator): The few savings I had are going away. When am I able to work again or what am I going to do? I don't know.",
