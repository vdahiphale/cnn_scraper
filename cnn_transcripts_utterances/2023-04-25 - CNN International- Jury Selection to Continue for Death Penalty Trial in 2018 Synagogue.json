If you're just joining us, let me bring up to date with our top stories at this hour.In the coming hours, U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to announce his bid for a second term in 2024. This announcement comes amid concerns about his age and new polling that reveals a majority of Democrats don't want him to run again. And with another ceasefire in place in Sudan, the U.K. has started a large-scale evacuation of British nationals from the country. Britain's foreign secretary says priority will be given to the most vulnerable, including families with children and the elderly. Gun violence is again rocking parts of the U.S., including Oklahoma. That's where one person was killed in a shooting at Rose State College. The suspects are now in custody. Police say the two were acquainted through a domestic situation. The community college went into lockdown during the incident. And in California, one person was killed and four others were injured during a shooting in San Francisco on Sunday night. All victims were said to be in their early twenties. Police in San Francisco say this was not a random attack. But so far, no arrests have been made. In the coming hours jury selection will continue for the death penalty trial of a man accused of killing 11 worshippers at a synagogue in 2018. The process began Monday, but no jurors have been selected yet. CNN's Danny Freeman has the details. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

Throughout the day, federal prosecutors and Bowers' defense team took turns questioning potential jurors about their knowledge of the case and their beliefs on the death penalty.Bowers is accused of killing 11 Jewish worshippers and injuring others at the Pittsburgh synagogue on October 27th in 2018.",

And I'm -- I'm just shaken by it.FREEMAN (voice-over): Prosecutors alleged Bowers brought multiple guns to the synagogue that Saturday morning while three congregations were worshiping. The criminal complaint says Bowers started shooting outside and then inside, targeting people praying and expressing his desire to kill Jews. Bowers faces 63 felony counts and prosecutors are seeking the death penalty in this case. His defense team offered a guilty plea with life in prison in exchange for taking capital punishment off the table. One of his defense attorneys is Judy Clark. She has represented other federal death penalty defendants like the Unabomber and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev from the Boston marathon bombing. But federal prosecutors have not budged and the judge prepared potential jurors if they make it to the sentencing phase, they should expect to weigh the death penalty in this case. Ahead of the trial, congregates from the Tree of Life Synagogue gathered Sunday, to pray as their fellow worshippers' day in court has finally arrived.",
