It is Wednesday, July the 3rd, 9 a.m. here in London, 4 a.m. in Washington, where U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to speak with Democratic governors and congressional leaders in the hours ahead as concerns mount of his re- election bid following a poor debate performance.These numbers aren't helping. A new CNN poll shows three-quarters of Americans believe Americans would have a better chance of beating Donald Trump with another candidate, one other than Mr. Biden. Democrats are sounding the alarm, saying their party must deal with the fallout and make sure that Trump doesn't return to the White House. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. PETER WELCH (D-VT): The big question going into that debate was the age question. That is what the Biden campaign wanted to put to rest. The outcome of the debate was that that question on age was intensified. We have got to deal with that. That's the real issue and have frank conversations about it. The reality is, from that debate, America can't unsee what it saw. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

CNN's MJ Lee has more on the debate fallout from Washington.(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) MJ LEE, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The Democratic firewall around President Joe Biden is beginning to fracture. Texas Congressman Lloyd Doggett becoming the first Democratic lawmaker to publicly call on Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election following last week's poor debate performance. The congressman saying in a statement: President Biden's first commitment has always been to our country, not himself. I'm hopeful that he will make the painful and difficult decision to withdraw. The White House facing a barrage of questions about the president's debate performance. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: It was a bad night. He was not taking any cold medication. That is what I can speak to. I've asked his doctor, and that's what he stated to us. LEE (voice-over): And urged to release more medical records. JEAN-PIERRE: We have released thorough reports from his medical team every year since he's been in office. LEE (voice-over): The White House press secretary digging in and saying Biden's accomplishments speak volumes. JEAN-PIERRE: With age comes wisdom and experience. LEE (voice-over): Other Democrats beginning to publicly express concern that the president could hurt candidates in down ballot races. REP. MIKE QUIGLEY (D-IL): It's his decision. I just want him to appreciate at this time just how much it impacts not just his race, but all the other races coming in November. LEE (voice-over): As Republicans are ready to pounce on Biden's debate showing to attack their Democratic opponents.",

They're also hearing from a lot of people who are supporting President Biden as long as he continues to decide to stay in. He is the nominee of the Democratic Party right now. He won the process. He has all of the delegates. He has raised millions of dollars, even record amounts of money since the debate, much of that from grassroots supporters.

Trump was scheduled to be sentenced next week on his felony conviction for falsifying business records. But it's now delayed until September the 18th.This comes after Trump's legal team filed a letter seeking to challenge that conviction following the Supreme Court ruling that presidents have absolute immunity from prosecution for core official acts. The judge's announcement on Tuesday underscores the far-reaching implications of the high court's ruling. It could also impact other Trump indictments as well. Now Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka, is speaking out about her father's legal issues and explaining why she's not part of his campaign. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) IVANKA TRUMP, DONALD TRUMP'S DAUGHTER: On a human level, it's my father. And I love him very much, so it's painful to experience. But ultimately, I wish it didn't have to be this way. Politics is a pretty dark world. There's a lot of darkness, a lot of negativity. And it's just really at odds with what feels good for me as a human being. And you know, it is really -- it's a really rough business. (END VIDEO CLIP) FOSTER: After being a full-time adviser to her father at the White House, Ivanka said she would no longer be involved in politics and hasn't been part of her father's 2024 presidential campaign. Rudy Giuliani has been officially disbarred in New York over his part in Donald Trump's alleged election interference efforts in 2020. It's a major blow to the former mayor of New York City and Trump's most high-profile lawyer. In addition to losing his law license, Giuliani is in bankruptcy after landing $150 million in debt for defaming two election workers. He also faces several other lawsuits and criminal charges. A deadly hurricane Beryl is expected to hammer Jamaica, with life- threatening wind and storm surge in the hours ahead as the death toll from the storm rises to at least seven.

Somewhere around 240 kilometers per hour as it did make landfall on these islands.Where does it go from here? Well, the first stop in the morning hours and into the afternoon this afternoon is Jamaica and then into the Grand Cayman Islands and then into the Yucatan. And it may even head up toward the southwestern coast of Texas. What we know right now, though, let's just focus on the next 24 hours. We know that there's going to be significant wave, wind, and also surge action in Jamaica. There will be surges that are greater than 9 meters, I believe. And then you see some rainfall there of 250 millimeters or more. So, yes, this was a big storm. It rapidly intensified. In just 24 hours, it went from 120mph to 165mph. That is considered rapid intensification. In fact, you only need 35 in 24 and we got 45 in 24. The water is still very warm. I think this is going to change a little bit when we get our next little picture here because Beryl is using up a lot of this very warm water. We're going to get a little cold pool in behind it and an awful lot of wind. I think the wind chances in Jamaica are 100 percent with this. Does it steer to the north? Does it steer to the left? We'll have to see. High pressure to the north of the system is going to try to keep it down to the south, but we'll have to see where this goes from here. This is still a very big storm. The last storm that was this large or even close to it was Gilbert in 1988. It moved right over Jamaica. So what does that now? More than 30, 35 years? They're really in for something today. We're going to have to keep watching this. (END VIDEOTAPE)",

They believe that they can always go back and engage Hamas militarily in the future. Now, the situation in northern Israel and southern Lebanon remains extremely tense, with the Israeli military and Iran-backed Hezbollah militants exchanging cross-border attacks. Thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have once again been displaced by the latest evacuation order from the IDF. Meanwhile, the U.N. says it covers nearly 120 square kilometers in Khan Younis and Rafah, about a third of the enclave. That makes it one of the largest such orders since October, and it's forced one of the last functioning hospitals to shut down.

So Israel says that they have to evacuate from this particular area. As you say, it is a vast area.And we have been seeing the footage of many people moving, many people panicking and fleeing the area, as they have seen what has happened to areas under evacuation order before, many of them also saying there's still nowhere safe for them to actually evacuate to. And within this evacuation area is the European hospital. It is one of the last fully functioning hospitals, really, in Gaza. And we have heard from the chief of the World Health Organization talking about the fact that this has had to be evacuated as well. Saying, quote: It is devastating to see the 650-bed capacity hospital out of service at a time when access to health care is urgently needed. He goes on to say: European Gaza hospital, one of the largest referral hospitals in the south, must be protected and made operational immediately. Gaza cannot afford to lose more hospitals. [04:20:00] Now, we've been seeing footage of the patients being moved out of that hospital, including ICU patients, including babies being taken out in incubators. It has put tremendous pressure on some partially functioning hospitals elsewhere that are already struggling under the sheer number of patients and also a lack of medical supplies. Now, we did hear from the Israeli military hours after these evacuation orders were given saying that the European Hospital itself did not need to be evacuated. But by that time, many had decided already to leave as they were concerned about what kind of military operation would follow -- Max.",

And this is something the Biden administration officials came out very quickly and unequivocally about, saying that they didn't know what he was talking about and that there hasn't been a withholding of weapons, bar those larger bombs, the 2,000-pound bombs, for example, that President Biden told CNN he did not want to give to Israel at a time when they were doing operations in densely populated areas like Rafah. So there are a number of public spats that we have seen between the Biden administration and the Israeli prime minister, certainly in recent weeks. And it comes also at a time when the talks to try and release the 120 hostages in Gaza, to try and secure a ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid to get into the Gaza Strip, are pretty much stalled at this point. So it will be an important meeting, clearly, but one which we hear from a source familiar with the ongoing discussions is trying to be nailed down now as to exactly when those two will meet -- Max.",
