Back with us on the breaking news, CNN Political Commentator and Former Biden White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield and Republican Strategist Doug Heye. Good to have both of you back with us.I do just want to reset for people who are just joining us in this moment. Just a short time ago, my colleague, Senior White House correspondent MJ Lee reporting that there have been discussions that President Biden has privately acknowledged the next stretch of days are critical to whether he can salvage his reelection bid for president. This is according to a close ally who spoke with the president on Tuesday that he sees this moment in his clear-eyed. This also comes amid reporting from the New York Times that he's told an ally he recognizes he may not be able to salvage his candidacy if he can't convince the public in the coming days he's up for the job. In the wake of that reporting from the New York Times, I spoke with a member of Biden's campaign staff. And I just want to play his reaction. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) QUENTIN FULKS, PRINCIPAL DEPUTY CAMPAIGN MANAGER, BIDEN-HARRIS 2024: That is false. There are a number of rumors floating out there. The president is in this race to win it. He is the Democratic nominee. And from our perspective, we're going to continue to do everything we can to make sure that we're building a campaign apparatus to reach voters.",

He's not oblivious. The president knows what's going on. Kate, I know you have said, and you said just a few moments ago, you believe he can continue in this race. You believe he can win that. The calls for him to step aside from both Democratic lawmakers and from voters from the American public are growing louder.",

      "sentences": "It's important. But more important, I think Erica, is what we've missed over the past few days. So, you know, Thursday night when Jake and Dana asked their last questions, Joe Biden hasn't faced a question from a reporter that we've been able to see to this point. And we won't see any until we start to see some of the footage come out on Friday.That's eight days. That is a political eternity. And it's what is driving some of this. Yes, Joe Biden was very good. In North Carolina. You usually are when you have a crowd cheering for you, and you're able to read from a teleprompter. That's not a surprise. But we need to see more of Biden and more frequently in answering questions. And to me, Erica, it goes back to Super Bowl Sunday when the president decided not to do a live interview before the game. Now, I never need to see any president on Super Bowl Sunday. But what the White House said is we don't want to politicize the day. OK, fair enough. Then a few hours later, they put out a video, a cut and canned video of the president complaining about Doritos equity and how much ice cream comes in the tube. So, they did want to politicize the day. But the message that was sent was that they don't trust Biden to do a sit- down interview. It wouldn't go well for him. And I think now, we know why if we didn't know that all along. And that's why while this race yesterday is still close, and it is still the movable object versus the resistible force, Joe Biden, that movable object is moving lower in the polls. And the fundraising is the key. Fundraisers quite often are like the animals that will scurry before the earthquake. And if you see them abandon the campaign, you've got very real trouble.",

      "sentences": "Well, what I would have pushed for is to have him out earlier. I think live versus taped when you're doing a significant network sit-down is not as -- is not that big of a differentiation, to be honest with you. I don't think you know he's going to sit down and face George Stephanopoulos who's going to ask him I would imagine a lot of tough and direct questions as he has in the past when he's interviewed him.So, to me, the distinction between live and taped on a major network interview is not all that significant. What I would have pushed for is for him to be out earlier. I think this is where I do agree with Doug. There has been a lag between the debate performance and when we're going to see him out again answering questions. And I think -- you know, I think that has been -- it's been difficult to adjust the narrative -- shift the narrative back to Trump when it feels like those questions haven't been answered. So, I think seeing more of him and seeing him you know, have -- if we could have seen him more quickly, I think that would have benefited him. But we now have this interview on the books for Friday, and then campaign travel. And I think that's going to be a really good -- a good swing for him.",

He has to mobilize his base and put together the coalition that he was able to put together in 2020. But he also has to win a slice of those undecided moderate voters that he was able to win in 2020.And I think where he has an advantage here, though, that has been lost in this discussion that has been so focused on his debate performance is that he's running against Donald Trump who is putting forward a message that does not appeal to those voters. And who put forward a message in the debate on Thursday night that doesn't appeal to those moderate swing voters? One that was really focused on retribution. One in which he lied repeatedly. One in which he tripled down on, you know, his belief that women shouldn't have the right to make their own healthcare decisions. So, Donald Trump is not running a campaign or putting forth a message that appeals to those voters. Joe Biden is. And so, that's where I think he has a big opportunity. And these next few weeks as he's back out on the campaign trail, I think will help solidify him.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, Erica, originally, I was told by advisors to Donald Trump, by people in his orbit that they believed this was going to be the announcement. It is Tuesday in Miami. They sent teams ahead of time.They did say that just because it is home to Senator Marco Rubio, who obviously as we have reported is on the shortlist, that that didn't mean anything to take no read into the fact that it was in Miami. However, now that we have seen in this post-debate narrative, particularly with the focus on Biden, everything seems to be in flux. I got a frantic call on Monday saying that anything that we had discussed about potential planning on that coming up -- upcoming Tuesday was no longer the case that they were trying to decide when exactly this rollout would happen. But also, there was a lot of coasting and sitting back and trying to let this media narrative play out. Because if you'll remember, Donald Trump himself is usually in the media narrative in some capacity. And it's generally not always positive. But instead, right now, the full focus is on President Joe Biden. And Donald Trump has been able to really not insert himself in any way. No tweets, no interviews, just laying low at his Bedminster resort in New Jersey. Now, when it comes to VP, who is it going to be? Well, the speculation still mainly swirls around three candidates, North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum, Senator Marco Rubio, and Senator J.D. Vance. Anyone close to Donald Trump will tell you that they do not know who it is at this point. In fact, they told us there are no warehouses somewhere set up that have giant banners that say Trump-Rubio, Trump-Burgum. They actually haven't done any of that. One person saying it's probably going to cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars to do it in the hours before the actual rollout. But that's where we are.",

When Jamaican official telling CNN the next 48 hours will be telling but he says the country is ready with hundreds of shelters activated and emergency services ready to respond. Jamaica's Prime Minister is blaming climate change for making this storm so intense and dangerous. Quickly, experts are warning Beryl could really just be the beginning for this season. This hurricane season is rising ocean temperatures, of course helped to fuel and generate more extreme weather. CNN's Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir is with me now.

And we're at the beginning of the summer. These are the kinds of storms that usually don't form until the -- we have a -- you know, months-worth of built-up heat in September.

And really pull the country out of the framework -- the legal framework that sets up climate diplomacy around the world, which would make it much harder to reenter later the way Joe Biden did.And so how this turns out will have amazing ramifications when it comes to policies, incentives. Judges after the Supreme Court decision earlier this week, turning over the Chevron deference now.
