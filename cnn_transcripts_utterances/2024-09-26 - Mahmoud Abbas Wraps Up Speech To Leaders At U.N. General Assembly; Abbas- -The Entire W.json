      "sentences": "Yeah. I heard him lay out details about what he called the day after in Gaza, the day after the war ends. Of course, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been under huge pressure from allies and partners around the world to spell out what he'll do the day the war ends in Gaza.And we got a real detailed analysis of it here from Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority President, laying out what he wants, and some of the interesting details in there, and just to backup ever so slightly, unsurprisingly, heavily critical of Israel, calling it a transient state and that it shouldn't be allowed a representation at the United Nations, and he also criticized the United States for the support that it has given to Israel for the war in Gaza. So, laying out the things that you would expect. But, here are some of the details that I picked up on what he was talking about in terms of the day after in Gaza, which set sort of, if you will, a set of Palestinian parameters for what it may look like, and this was an interesting one, because this is clearly in contention with what Israel is looking at as its negotiations with Hamas, not with the Palestinian Authority, but with Hamas over Gaza. So, the Palestinian Authority President saying that not a single centimeter of Gaza should be given up, that Israel's withdrawal should be a full, full withdrawal, that there should be no buffer zones. We know the United States has been critical of Israel's proposals to put buffer zones around Gaza for security. But, these buffer zones would be, if you will, inside Gaza, rather than outside, absorbing Israeli territory. So, that was a very strong point, I thought, from him. He talked about the need to get humanitarian aid, and he talked about the need for protection for UNRWA and other UN officials in there. He also spoke about what's been going through the International Court of Justice and their ruling in the summer about Israel's occupation of the West Bank, and the ICJ has come down firmly in the favor of the Palestinians. And he said that what the ICJ has said should be acted upon within 12 months, and that is that all settlements should be closed, the 600,000 settlers who he said are in these areas should leave. He called for a peace conference within two -- within a year, where there should be announced a two-state solution. A Palestinian state, he said, should be announced at that peace conference a year after the end of the war in Gaza, and he went on to give detail about that. He said there should be an international peacekeeping force between the Palestinian state and the Israeli state. There is so much in there that clearly is at a massive variance with the views of the Israeli government. It doesn't seem that this is a plan and a proposal that can go down, if you will, in face value, and he said that at the beginning. He said, look, we welcome people to come and pour over this and amend it, but this is the position that we're starting from. And he said something that he said earlier this year on a visit to Turkey to -- when he was speaking to the Turkish parliament there. He said, I'm going to go to Gaza. And when he said that a few months ago, I don't think people really thought it carried weight or meaning, because they think and party doesn't want to go to Gaza, because he is not particularly believed to be respected there. Nevertheless, he reupped that position here when he said, we welcome other countries to come with us to Gaza, to go visit, to look at the level of destruction there. So, he is clearly continuing with the narrative that as Palestinian Authority President that doesn't have a political representation inside of Gaza, but has this sort of pan- Palestinian view. He wants to go there and lead an international delegation there, and it's not clear at all that Israel will allow that either, Rahel.",

      "sentences": "Yes. So, you have both the Prime Ministers of Lebanon and of Israel saying that they haven't agreed to it, Mikati and Lebanon saying that he was aware of it, but this was not something that he'd signed off on, and Prime Minister Netanyahu saying he had not yet commented on it. So, they both face political pressures at home not to jump into this 21-day ceasefire, which automatically tells you, particularly given the level of pressure for Prime Minister Netanyahu, where it's coming from within the right wing of his government, which he rarely these days goes against. In fact, I think we can count. I think it'd be very hard to find something to count on when involving either Hamas or Hezbollah, where he has gone against his government.So, there are political pressures on both leaders that mitigate against this happening. And frankly, the participants in the fight, if you will, both Hezbollah and the Israel Defense Force, are fighting today. There has been multiple airstrikes by Israel inside of Lebanon, both along the border and further north and along the border with Syria as well, where the IDF says it's been targeting smuggling routes for weapons that are coming from Syria, but ultimately -- or previously coming from Iran to Hezbollah. So, that's been targeted. Hezbollah this morning, according to the IDF, had fired at least 40 missiles into Israel this afternoon, just in the space of about 10 minutes. A couple of hours ago, they fired another 40 or so missiles into Israel. So, both sides are firing missiles, and the posture from the IDF is to continue to release video that shows troops training close to the border, prepared and ready by the border to crossover, and the Prime Minister has said that he is giving the continued authority for the IDF to do what they've agreed, which is to continue with full force. This is not the atmosphere in which ceasefires generally are born out of, and I don't think this one will be any different.",

And while this storm is going to stay offshore here, we are no doubt going to feel its impact as much as the rest of Florida is going to. Part of what we're seeing this morning is already some of the flooding associated with this storm. This is the result of high tide, which kicked in this morning, and it's about to reach low tide in about an hour or two. And you couple that with some of the rain that we saw move in overnight. And so, this is some of the flooding that's already being attributed to what is happening southwest of where we are.Here in Pinellas County, a mandatory evacuation order went out for folks that live in this part of the county, yesterday. Now, emergency officials late this morning were concerned that the number of folks that live in this low-lying area have not taken to that evacuation order, and a lot of them are still out here. In fact, much of them are showing up to where we are, taking in an otherwise sunny but cloudy day, as we expect some of this more wet and windy weather to move through throughout the day. But, this is the one thing that officials really don't want folks to come out and do, Rahel. And so, as we move through the afternoon, of course, the concern becomes that as this storm stays to the west of us, but continues its track north, we're, of course, going to see the rain. We're going to see some of that strong wind, and then once high tide kicks back in in the afternoon and into the night, well, then we're talking about a storm surge that's being forecasted for this area of Florida to be anywhere between six to eight feet. And when you take all of those things into account, this is when you see most of this flooding. Rahel.",

So, we are expecting it to continue to intensify as it heads to the Big Bend there of Florida, sitting about 290 miles south of Apalachicola, again, will continue to work its way north. We have tornado watches that are filling in across the southeast, fromFlorida up through the Carolinas, because we have this spinning tropical system. So, we do have some tornadoes that are possible coming onshore in the outer bands. You could already see a couple of warnings near Charleston, just north of Jacksonville, another one on the Florida Panhandle there, again, this threat, as some of the outer bands are already coming in with lightning and some heavy rain and gusty winds. Here is the latest track. All that red is a hurricane warning from Apalachicola into Tallahassee and then even up to Macon, Georgia. We are looking at a major hurricane landfall, at least a Category 3 strength could teeter on that Category 4 strength, as it makes its landfall tonight. But, it's a wide hurricane. So, we're looking at impacts really across the entire southeast. We could be looking at tropical storm force winds even as far north as Metro Atlanta, incredibly worried about widespread power outages. Storm surge, this is the catastrophic, unsurvivable part of this hurricane, of any hurricane, really. Look at these numbers here in the Big Bend of Florida, 20 feet of storm surge. That is six meters. Again, unsurvivable, catastrophic. This is the reason why you evacuate and get away from the coastline, is because of this ocean water that just comes in and wipes everything out with destructive ways. It is also a wide storm. Tropical storm force winds are already extending more than 400 miles, and will continue to take over a very wide area. It's a fat and growing even fatter storm. It's incredibly wide. So, again, look at how far the tropical storm force winds will stretch from South Florida all the way up to Savannah and into the Carolinas, and that will continue to spread up towards the Atlanta area tonight and going into tomorrow morning. So, you can see where you have these incredibly damaging, possibly catastrophic winds there in the purple near the side of landfall. But, it's not just a Florida storm. The winds, again, stretch into Georgia with tropical storm force winds in Atlanta. On top of this, we are looking at incredible amounts of rain, a large area with four to eight inches of rain across Georgia and the Carolinas, but we do have this pocket of rain totals in the Appalachian Mountains that are possible up to a foot. That would cause landslides in the higher terrain for parts of western North Carolina and North Georgia, something we are incredibly worried about and need to watch closely. Rahel.",

So, for those that have moved into our area, they've been able to be around it and seen the devastation just from what a simple Cat 1 did, and also from Idalia recently as well. So, for our area, it's helped, but you do have that great influx of people just moving to this beautiful state of Florida, and I hope they heed their neighbors' warnings that, hey, this is something that for our area, we've never seen before. I've never seen in my life with them, numbers of storm surge.So, I really hope people heed that warning and realize that emergency services and like law enforcement, fire rescue stuff, once winds get a sustained 45 miles per hour across the board, and that's sustained winds, that's not even gusts, we cannot go out and respond to calls until the storm has passed and those winds go below that. So, you won't have emergency services for that long of a time. So, get to a shelter or get out of the storm's path.

OF INVESTIGATION: Thank you, Damian. Good morning. Today, for the first time in New York City's modern history, we announce criminal charges against the sitting mayor of New York City. As our highest elected official, the mayor should set the standard for all of city government and exemplify the integrity, transparency, and dedication to serving the public that all New Yorkers deserve. Instead, the indictment unsealed today alleges that Mayor Adams abused his power and position for nearly a decade as Brooklyn Borough President and as mayor, to enrich himself and his mayoral campaigns. As charged, he sought and received illegal campaign contributions, luxury travel, and other personal benefits from foreign nationals as well as individuals and businesses. He allegedly took steps to conceal those illegal contributions and personal benefits, and involved city employees and campaign staff in that concealment. As the indictment explains, this kind of corruption has real costs to the city and to the public. As alleged, the mayor's 2021 campaign falsely certified compliance with campaign finance laws in order to conceal those illegal campaign contributions, and as a result of those false certifications, received over ten million in public matching funds. The mayor's alleged acceptance and concealment of illegal contributions and personal benefits gave overseas benefactors, wealthy individuals, and businesses undue influence over the mayor, influence that federal and local laws seek to prevent. And as charged, in exchange for certain personal benefits, the mayor pressured the New York City Fire Department to forego a required fire safety inspection before the opening of the new Turkish Consulate building. As the city's Inspector General, the Department of Investigation, a city agency, conducts its investigations confidentially and wholly independent of City Hall. We handled this investigation as we would any other, following the facts and seeking to hold wrongdoers accountable, no matter their role or title. Our unique access to city records and expertise in matters of city government make us a critical partner in the fight to root out corruption, working closely with our law enforcement colleagues at the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office. If you have information about this case or about illegal conduct by any New York City official or employee, I encourage you to contact DOI by email at tipline@doi.nyc.gov, or by phone at 212-825-2828. I want to thank the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the FBI for their partnership on this investigation. And I want to recognize and thank the dedicated, hard-working DOI investigators who are handling this matter, Senior Inspector General Eleonora Rivkin, Inspector General Audrey Feldman, Deputy Inspectors General Arturo Sanchez and Trenton Sweeney, Deputy Commissioners Christopher Ryan and Dominick Zarrella. Thank you.",
