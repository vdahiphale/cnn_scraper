The Israeli military is also returning to ground operations in northern Gaza in the Jabalia refugee camp. And that's so significant because you think of the early months of this war. And that's where a lot of the fighting was focused. But the Israeli military months ago finished its fight there were thought that it had withdrew its forces, but it didn't put anything in place in terms of leadership, in terms of a government in that area. And so, a power vacuum is what has existed in its place. One that Hamas has now returned to fill, raising major questions about the Israeli military's overall strategy in the Gaza Strip.

Legal expense.REID (voice over): Facing his former boss, Cohen spoke about his 10 years working as Trump's attorney and fixer, while Trump sat back in his chair closing his eyes not reacting to Cohen's testimony. Cohen said he enjoyed working for Trump and whenever he received direct praise or completing a task, he felt like he was on top of the world. Cohen told the court that when Trump was mulling a run for the presidency in 2015, Trump warned Cohen, you know that when this comes out, meaning the announcement, just be prepared, there's going to be a lot of women coming forward. Cohen claimed that just weeks before the 2016 election, the editor of the National Enquirer told Cohen Stormy Daniels wanted to sell her story about having an affair with Trump, which Cohen said would have been catastrophic and horrible for Trump's campaign. Cohen said Trump got angry with him when they spoke about the Stormy Daniels story. I told him that one of the things that we need to do is obviously take care of it. Trump allegedly responded, absolutely, do it. Take care of it. Cohen testified that it was his idea to include a punitive damages clause in the Daniels deal to ensure that she didn't speak. Cohen said Trump told him to drag the Daniels payment out as long as possible, in fact, preferably until after the election, because if I win, it will have no relevance because I'm President, and if I lose, I don't even care. And he added this damning allegation. He wasn't thinking about Melania. This was all about the campaign. Cohen walked the court through the process of creating several LLCs in order to transfer payment to Daniels. Cohen had to front the money himself and used a home equity line of credit because it was paperless, so he could hide it from his wife. I was doing everything I could and more to protect my boss, which is something that I had done for a long time. Cohen testified that on October 28th, he immediately called Trump after Daniels signed the agreement, telling him that this matter is now completely under control and locked down. Cohen said in early 2017, he tried to get repaid for the money he fronted to Daniels, a needed Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg input for questions about taxes. Cohen said he would be reimbursed over the course of the next 12 months, disguising the payment as like a legal service rendered since I was then going to be given the title of personal attorney to the president.",

We know that's what Donald Trump's legal team wants the jury to believe, that he was a family man, that he loved his wife, that he was concerned about these facts about Stormy Daniels are this story about Stormy Daniels coming out because it would be embarrassing to his wife.Michael Cohen testified today that that was not the issue. This had nothing to do with embarrassment or his family. But this was all about trying to ensure that women voters in particular would not be so offended as not to vote for Donald Trump. The other issue that we know the defense is trying to push is that Donald Trump had no knowledge of this that somehow Michael Cohen was acting as a lone actor. Michael Cohen blew a hole in that theory by testifying very clearly and with lots of detail, that this was all part of a plan orchestrated by Donald Trump and that he knew every step of the way everything that Michael Cohen was doing to suppress this story and to make it appear as if this was a legal transaction or some kind of legal fees that he was being reimbursed for, rather than being reimbursed for the payment to Stormy Daniels.",
