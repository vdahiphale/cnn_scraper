It had the picture of the suspect, Anderson Aldridge, and it had offensive slurs, mocking his weight, basically accusing him of pretty -- you know, engaging in illegal activity and mocked his grandmother and her fundraising efforts to help him go on a class trip to Japan. And just -- again, just pretty vile bullying for this person on this online site, it was updated several times in 2015. A year after that, in 2016, just before Anderson Aldridge turned 16 years old, he decided -- he asked the court to change his name. His name before that was Nicholas F. Brink. The court granted that and that is why his name now is Anderson Aldridge. And then if we fast forward, even more, we learned some really jarring details back in 2021, so just a year ago about his engagement with law enforcement. We touched upon this just a little bit yesterday when he surrendered to authorities. We have some new video to show you of him inside this house where he is really just challenging authorities as they are responding to threats he was making against his mother. Take a listen.

Let me ask you about the red flag laws. You've been a strong proponent of getting the law passed. I just read your campaign materials that you campaign for re-election on having implemented the red flag law in Colorado. The Sheriff of El Paso County at the height of the discussion, the debate over them, opposed them. He said in 2019 \"we're not going to pursue these on our own, speaking of the El Paso County Sheriff's Office, meaning the sheriff's office is not going to run over and try to get a court order. We support the rule of law and if a judge issues an order of the court, then it is up to law enforcement to execute that order.\" So, he says he will follow the law.

So, you will remember the administration purchased 171 million doses of that shot, only 35 million have been administered that amounts to about 13 percent of all U.S. adults having gotten that updated bivalent shot.And so, today, the White House announcing it would -- Dr. Ashish Jha, the White House's COVID coordinator is calling a six-week sprint to try and get more Americans to get boosted ahead of the rest of the holiday seasons. It'll include a public education campaign with some paid advertising on digital and on TV around the world, cap $350 million to boost Community Health Center vaccination efforts, $125 million in grants to support vaccination efforts aimed at disabilities and elderly communities. And then also the CMS, the Center for Medicaid service -- Medicare Services is expected to send out a letter to nursing homes reminding them on their duty to educate their members of the -- of the benefits of COVID vaccination. But the unmistakable message today from Dr. Fauci, from Dr. Jha, was that listen, these vaccines are effective, they have new data to show that these bivalent boosters are indeed effective and that they can prevent deaths. We're in a situation right now where Dr. Fauci and Dr. Jha said we could essentially have nearly every death that's happening from COVID be prevented by these vaccines. But in order for that to happen, more people, particularly those who are vulnerable, who are older in age, need to go ahead and get vaccinated. And that was the push from the White House today.",

      "sentences": "All right, Dr. Narula, let's talk about what's adding to some anxieties for parents, the shortage of medicines to treat some of these childhood illnesses. We're talking flu, ear infections, sore throats. I feel like we've been talking about shortages for months now. What's going on?DR. TARA NARULA, CNN MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: We have. We talked about it when it comes to feminine products, formula, and Adderall, last week, and here we are talking about it with respect to upper respiratory viruses. And so, the shortage is now are with Tamiflu, which is an antiviral drug that we give when someone has the flu. It's given to decrease the severity of symptoms, and the length of time that you're sick and prevent complications. We're also talking about some antibiotics -- common antibiotics like amoxicillin and augmentin that, as you mentioned, are used to treat ear infections, strep throat, and ammonia, very common in kids. And then the last class that we've seen is albuterol, which is used in inhalers for people who have asthma or reactive airway disease. And we think that this is really primarily a problem with demand. We are seeing, as you know, RSV, COVID, flu all at the same time, and manufacturers when they were planning out how much they were going to make many, many months ago, we're not anticipating that we were going to see this triple storm of all of these viruses at the same time. So, it is forcing a lot of people to scramble and figure out how and where, and when they're going to get their medications. But hopefully, those supplies are -- there's really spot shortages, that should be -- it -- they should be able to up -- manufacture more so that in the coming months, we're able to meet the demand.",
