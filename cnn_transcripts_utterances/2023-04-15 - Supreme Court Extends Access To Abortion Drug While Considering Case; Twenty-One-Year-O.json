Thank you very much.Ongoing legal challenges to abortion rights across the country have forced medical professionals who run clinics that provide abortions to adjust how they operate. Joining me now is the founder and president of Whole Woman's Health, a privately owned abortion provider. It operates clinics from New Mexico to Maryland. It offers abortion medication by mail. Welcome to the show. First off, how are you and your staff navigating these latest court decisions? And what are you telling your patients? AMY HAGSTROM MILLER, FOUNDER, PRESIDENT AND CEO, WHOLE WOMAN'S HEALTH: Thank you so much for having me. You know, it is really frustrating to have so much uncertainty and so much back and forth, not only in the court systems, but really all over this country since Roe v. Wade fell nine months ago. We're coming with a very clear message. Our clinics are still open. People can still get access to safe abortion where abortion is protected. And we can offer abortion with mifepristone and misoprostol still, which are the two medications that are approved by the FDA and then have been in play in this country for over 23 years. More than 5 million people have used mifepristone to terminate their pregnancies very safely and effectively in this country. And so trying to have a simple message for our patients, because they have been through so much uncertainty and change, they're traveling hundreds of miles, in some cases, in order to get abortion care. And so, you know, lots is up in the air, the staff and the patients are confused or have uncertainty. And, you know, that's part of the intent with abortion regulations and abortion nurses like this.",

Unfortunately, being an abortion provider in the American South and in the Midwest, for decades now, we've always had to have multiple levels of backup plans because there has been regulatory interference and restrictions, like abortion bans and delays et cetera for a long time.So for those of us working in this abortion space, there's a trajectory, you know, the Roe v. Wade overturn things like six week bans, things like this kind of restriction don't surprise us because we know that the anti-abortion forces want to end abortion by any means that they can and that they're not satisfied only with overturning Roe, that they're interested in restricting abortion access for everyone in this country, even if you live in some of the places where I think people think abortion is protected, you know, on the coasts in some of the more progressive communities. And so we are trying to center abortion as part of regular medicine. Abortion is essential medicine. We've learned that during the pandemic, and just trying to get people access to safe abortion as early in their pregnancy as possible and with clarity and ready to cut through this misinformation. WALKER: And, you know, so many abortion providers like you have had to jump through so many hoops, right? And case in point, you just opened a Whole Woman's Health just opened a new clinic in New Mexico, I think three weeks ago if I'm correct, and that's because Whole Woman's Health had to close four clinics in Texas after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court. What is your biggest concern right now if the availability access to Mifepristone is restricted in some way?",

      "sentences": "Good morning, Victor. Well, it appears that Teixeira knew that his world might soon come crashing down. In this affidavit that was unsealed in court just yesterday, the government revealed that Teixeira had searched on his government computer for the word leak, appearing to look for classified information about the hunt for this leaker.Now, Victor, that was on April 6th, so last Thursday, that was the day that many of these classified documents came to light. That was the first day that we understand Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin got a briefing and that was exactly a week before Teixeira was eventually arrested at his parent's home just south of Boston. Now we know that many of these documents and there are hundreds of them were online on at least two different servers of this social media website, Discord, for months. So the question now is, how and why did Teixeira have access to this kind of information? Now, he was part of what is known as the 102nd intelligence operations wing, that is a military outfit based out of Massachusetts that provides intelligence products for senior military commanders around the world on all types of intelligence subjects. And t Teixeira himself his title was cyber defense operations journeyman. That is military speak essentially for IT support. But because the networks are so sensitive, the information on these networks are so sensitive, you can't just have a normal IT person looking at them. So that's why he had access to such sensitive information. But it does raise the question about why so many thousands of people within the U.S. military have access to this kind of information. Those questions are certainly going to be addressed in the coming weeks and months. And there are also going to be assessments that could take quite some time about the impact on national security of these hundreds of classified documents secret and top secret that are now publicly available.

Now, what prosecutors did and investigators did was identified two crimes, that t could form the basis for his arrest. Now he can be charged with multiple instances of those crimes. So for instance, on that mishandling of Defense Information charge, each document or each instance of having disclosed information could itself be a separate charge.So if it's hundreds and hundreds of documents, he could technically be charged on account of each one of those documents, each one that would carry a 10 year maximum prison sentence that could be stacked upon the other ones. Now, look, no one is getting the statutory maximum for virtually any crime in America. And it would be pretty burdensome, to charge someone with hundreds and hundreds of years of potential prison time. But it could happen. And I think if any charges are added, that's my guess as to how they play out.",

And it was five years before any officials took another look at my appropriateness for maintaining that security clearance. Now, over time, we have gotten to a point where we recognize a need to take more frequent looks.But it's still the case that at some of these smaller units, and because of a lack of personnel investigators to do these investigations, it's still the case that we have individuals, the vast majority of individuals who receive a security clearance at the secret level, are getting an investigation. And then five years later, they're getting another look. That process is problematic, as I said, particularly, particularly when you are young. And, you know, Victor, if we take a look at the other two major security leaks that we've had, over the past couple of decades, Manning and Snowden and then we look at this leak, there are similarities in these young people. You know, we're talking about young people who were disillusioned with either some aspects of what was happening in the military or happening in government, or the solution was something that was happening in our society. So there are signs there, there are indicators there that would tell us that these individuals perhaps should be pulled back on having a security clearance. We just have to put the resources in the time and to getting out of that five year cycle and focusing more frequently on investigations during those periods when people are growing up essentially.",

We know that the special counsel's office Jack Smith, his team has been looking very closely at whether there's been obstruction in that case.And new reporting from Sara Murray and I shows that investigators are also asking about how witnesses have been handled, as they are becoming people who saw things and are testifying to a grand jury in that case. Now the question that the investigators are asking is about the role that lawyers representing these witnesses are playing. Do the witnesses know how those lawyers are being paid? Do they know that Donald Trump himself is being paid -- is paying for those lawyers to represent those people? And are they being coached or persuaded in some way to answer questions and participate in the investigation in a way that could benefit or protect Donald Trump? Those are all questions that are being asked. We don't know what the findings are yet. But this is another piece of this obstruction investigation around the classified documents that is ongoing right now. We also know that investigators are interested in the lawyers, four witnesses in the January 6 probe who are being paid by Donald Trump. And there's more than $60 million that Trump and his PAC Save America have put toward lawyers that defend people around him as well as him himself in these investigations. And so all of that is being looked at in the probe. And there's clearly some piece of following the money to the payments of lawyers that is being done right now by the special counsel's office in this probe. Of course, Donald Trump and his team have been trying to paint an us versus them culture of Mar-a-Lago and the people there and trying to say that his aides are being pressured by Special Counsel Smith, especially in this documents and boxes inquiry. But at this time, no one has been charged and it's unclear exactly where this fits in the investigation. Victor and Amara?",
