The Israeli Prime Minister's office tells CNN that Israel's cabinet will vote on a ceasefire agreement Tuesday. A source says that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has approved the deal in principle. More than 3,000 people in Lebanon have been killed in Israeli attacks since mid-September. The Lebanese Health Ministry says that at least 84 people were killed in Israeli strikes on Saturday alone.Hezbollah, meantime, says that it carried out at least 30 attacks against Israel and ditched troops in Lebanon over the weekend with drones, missiles and rockets. Israel says that some 250 projectiles fired from Lebanon crossed into Israeli territory. Let's get more now from Nic Robertson, who was in Jerusalem. Nic, I mean, it sounds like a pretty big breakthrough here. I mean, what's the latest with the ceasefire deal?",

      "sentences": "It certainly has that feel about it, and this does seem to be as close as we've come so far. Israel still has some reservations. One of the key things for them is that in this proposed 60-day ceasefire, they would have the right to respond immediately if Hezbollah violated the ceasefire, and that appeared to have been something of a sticking point, something they were insisting upon. Where the language around that has finally landed isn't clear.But, we've heard from the Foreign Minister today laying out some of the terms that he believes must happen as part of this deal that Hezbollah has to go back 30 miles north of the border, that's over the Litani River. That's per previous agreements with the UN. But, here is another point. He said, look, we want to make sure that Hezbollah cannot regrow, and there is an opportunity for sort of a broader political dispensation in Lebanon. That's a big ask to have essentially a stake in the sovereign affairs of another nation. That's what he is saying. So, it does appear to all be on track. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the National Security Minister, in the -- in Prime Minister Netanyahu's cabinet, one of the sort of most hardline, hard-right members, outspoken often, has today said that he has actually advised the Prime Minister against accepting the deal. He said, Look, Hezbollah is weak. Now is the time to really go ahead and crush them. And he is telling the Prime Minister, in his words, to continue, continue, continue with the operations. Does that mean he'll vote in the cabinet against this proposed ceasefire? It's not clear. But, it does. We do have a sense here that even the metrics of the uptick in fighting all point towards a ceasefire, because oftentimes, going back 2006, the last time Israel and Hezbollah negotiated a ceasefire, it was the same then. There was an increase in fire, both directions across the border, as we see now. So, I think people are really hoping that this could be the moment, benefits for the Prime Minister, of course, because he will get the ability to return 60,000 Israeli residents to the northern border, where they've been evacuated for well over a year now. That would be a big political plus for him if he does that.",

We have seen the videos that were first released on the messaging service Telegram and then by the Russian TASS media agency. It's unclear. We don't know whether he is speaking under duress, but he explains how he came to Ukraine and was fighting in that Kursk region, the part of Russia where Ukrainians had in a counter-offensive in September, managed to take some territory.We know that the fighting is extremely fierce there, that the Russians have positioned huge amounts of troops, 50,000 according to President Zelenskyy, just a few days ago, with the addition of those North Korean troops in the hope of taking back that Russian territory. We know also that the Ukrainians are facing losses on the Eastern Front, and under a great deal of pressure there. This latest capture, whilst we're talking about just one soldier, we know that British media have managed to track down his father, who has spoken of his fears for his son, the fact that his son had told him that when soldiers were captured, they tended to be tortured. His worries about that happening for his son, and the fear that he might be used as a bargaining chip, Rahel.",

They will instead go to Farmamerica, which is apparently a site where they will be on display. It's sort of like a petting zoo, but that is, in fact, what we are watching.The President sort of ending his comments there, saying, it has been the honor of my life. I am forever grateful. This is, of course, his last turkey presidential pardon, after he decided not to run for re- election over the summer. All right.

So, it is closing one of the chapters that has been a terrible chapter for both Lebanese and Israelis living on either side of their border, unable to have normal lives, and unfortunately, it has also been the cause of a lot of loss of life because of the back and forth attacks.So, it is wonderful to be seen a situation in which at least that chapter could be closing. It is also a very significant event in terms of U.S. foreign policy and Western policy, and of course, Israel's policy to try to contain Iran, which has been the fuel behind Hezbollah and Hamas largely.

Indeed, we heard a short time ago from the British Foreign Minister how much resolve there is among the Europeans to step up and ensure that Ukraine has that support that it needs to sustain itself as it continues to battle Russia.In terms of the United States, we've seen signals. We've heard signals that President Trump would like to see an end to the conflict. In fact, he has claimed that he can pull it off within 24 hours to get there to be a ceasefire between the two countries. That certainly is a tall order, but something that he has said that he would like to see happen. And so, we see this intensified fighting as an attempt by both sides of this war to try to secure their positions, to be in a stronger negotiating position, to be able to push through whatever ceasefire might be arranged.",

And Russia feels very pinched by the advance of NATO and wants to assert himself. That's Vladimir Putin. And so, we see ourselves where we are. So, certainly, you would have some sort of unified G7 idea coming out of this summit and solidarity in trying to support Ukraine in its time of difficulty.

We know that she has a deep skepticism of the way that the American government has been conducting surveillance thus far, really, could be we could see her be challenging some of those practices in the agencies that she is overseeing. You also mentioned some of the meetings that she has had with foreign leaders, leaders that are really viewed by many within government here, as foes of the United States. You mentioned that 2017 meeting where she met with the Syrian President Bashar al- Assad. That is something I know a lot of senators are bringing up that they want to have questions be answered to.

More recently, though, he played a key fundraising role for the President-elect and advised him on economic policy. His track record includes work with some of the world's top money managers, and if he is confirmed by the Senate, he will step into his most high-profile role yet, tasked with carrying out Trump's economic agenda.

I mean, this is a serious job, and investors and CEOs relieved that the President-elect went with a serious person, not an extremist here. Yale professor Jeff Sonnenfeld said there is huge relief in the business community about this selection of Scott Bessent. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, he is a fan too. A source close to Dimon told me that he thinks very highly of Bessent and believes that this is an excellent choice. Jay Timmons, the manufacturing executive who has in the past been critical of Trump, he called this an outstanding choice. And even Anthony Scaramucci, someone who fiercely opposed the re-election of Trump, he praised Bessent as a great guy, a safe and stable pair of hands.And as you mentioned, the market, the market is also reacting positive. You see the U.S. stock market moving significantly higher, the Dow up almost 400 points, around one percent, the NASDAQ up around a half percent. But, the bond market too is applauding this decision, where we see Treasury rates coming down, which is significant as well. I think the hope is that Bessent could be someone who will moderate some of Trump's more aggressive economic promises, especially around tariffs. Just a little bit more about Bessent. He is a hedge fund manager. He has deep knowledge of world markets and the economy. He has worked with some of the most famous investors on the planet, including Stanley Druckenmiller, and notably George Soros as well. And on tariffs, it's clear that Bessent believes in using tariffs as a negotiating tool, but maybe not the blanket tariffs that Trump has called for. Jeff Sonnenfeld told me that Bessent knows history and he does not want to repeat the mistakes of the Great Depression, where tariffs made that economic disaster even worse. Rahel.",

It was of serious concern among investigators, because earlier this summer, around July, this summer, European authorities were investigating incendiary devices that had been put on planes. They believed, allegedly, that this was done by Russian saboteurs. There is no connection at this time when it comes to this crash in Lithuania. Again, investigators saying that this could take days to find what caused the crash, but they believe at this time, most likely it was human error or a technical failure.",

And again, when you look at those images of that plane fully engulfed in those flames, just that massive blaze, you wonder, how did people survive, not just in that plane, but in that home that it, right, that it crashes almost directly into debris flying towards that home. But, authorities are pointing to the fact that the plane did not appear to explode or to have anything happen to it until the moment of the crash. That's why they've largely said, yes, we cannot rule out terrorism entirely, but it doesn't seem that there was any malpractice here and that this is a crash.",

Erik and Lyle Menendez have drawn renewed public interest since the release of recent documentaries on the case, with growing support from some celebrities.CNN's Camila Bernal has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CAMILA BERNAL, CNN U.S NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: This status hearing is the latest step in the brothers' bid to freedom after the Los Angeles County District Attorney recommended their re-sentencing. It is the first time that we'll see them in nearly 30 years after they were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the killing of their parents, and it is nearly 30 years later that this judge will also decide what happens, whether they appear in person or virtually. It is likely that they will appear virtually. And it is a hearing that will start at 10:30 a.m. at a Van Nuys courtroom here in the Los Angeles area. The judge also setting very strict rules around what happens in this hearing. There will be no cameras and no cell phone. In fact, the cell phones will be sealed in bags. Journalists will be allowed to attend, but only 16 members of the public will be allowed in that courtroom, and they will get their seats via a lottery. There is huge attention and interest in this case, especially after a 2023 docuseries on Peacock, where a member of the boy band, Menudo, also alleged that he was a victim of sexual abuse by Jose Menendez, the father of the two brothers. So, that, along with a letter that Erik Menendez wrote before the killings, describing the sexual abuse, is what the defense team says should be used, and is why they are asking a court to reconsider the sentence and the conviction. And so, the district attorney here in Los Angeles agreed with the defense. The problem for the defense is that that district attorney was essentially voted out of office. Nathan Hochman, the incoming district attorney here in Los Angeles, sees this case a little bit different. Here is what he told us. NATHAN HOCHMAN, LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY-ELECT: Now, as to whether or not I'm going to support that particular motion or not, you've got to do the hard work to make that decision. You've got to review thoroughly the facts and the law. You need to actually speak to the prosecutors, speak to law enforcement officers, speak to the defense counsel, and speak to any victim family members as well. Only after I do all that work will I be in a position to weigh in on the Menendez case, because then I'm not going to weigh in on it, I'll have to defend that decision in court.",

Macy's announced that the one employee hit up to $154 million worth of expenses. Now, it happened over the course of three years and caused numerous accounting irregularities. Macy's was forced to conduct an independent forensic accounting investigation to get to the bottom of exactly how this happened.Joining us now to explain is CNN's Business and Political -- Politics Correspondent Vanessa Yurkevich.

But, essentially, during the preparation of their third quarter's earnings report, they realized that there was some funky accounting going on in their small packages expenses department, and they did an independent investigation, and they found that a single employee intentionally hid money to the tune, though, of $154 million, and this did not just happened one time. This was happening over the course of three years.Now, Macy's saying that they are still investigating, which is why they are not doing their full earnings report today. They're pushing that to December 11th, as they try to figure out exactly what went wrong. Macy's also saying this did not have an impact on their cash on hand. This did not have any impact on their vendors. And during this time period, the $154 million that was being hid by this single employee was over the course of three years, and at that same time, the total expenses in this department was $4.3 billion. So, a small amount, but still a significant amount. The CEO of Macy's this morning saying, quote, \"At Macy's, we promote culture of ethical conduct. While we work diligently to complete the investigation as soon as practicable and ensure this matter is handled appropriately, our colleagues across the company are focused on serving our customers and executing our strategy for a successful holiday season.\" That's from Macy's CEO Tony Spring there. But, of course, Rahel, this raises a ton of questions, how did this go on for so long, and why are they just catching it now? This is going to make investors a little bit nervous, as we do wait for their final earnings report, Rahel.",
