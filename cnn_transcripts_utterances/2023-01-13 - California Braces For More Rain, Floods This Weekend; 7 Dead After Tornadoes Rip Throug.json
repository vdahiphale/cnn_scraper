It's feared that Monterey Peninsula near San Francisco could actually turn into a complete Island and be cut off from the mainland. At least 18 people have died in the weeks of heavy rains and flooding. Veronica Miracle is tracking the story for us, joins me now. Where is the greatest concern at the moment?",

Astaggering 15 million people are under flood advisories this weekend. And that is after weeks of destruction and damage. There has been little to no relief. Right now here in San Francisco, it's not coming down, but earlier, it really was raining hard. And this is the first of three storms expected over the weekend, the second of those storms starting tomorrow and that is where officials are very concerned. Down south in the Monterey Peninsula, there is concern that widespread flooding could block off and overflow onto two major roadways, which could potentially cut off access for people to travel in and out of the peninsula, as well as get those emergency services in there. Authorities are already there. They have seen widespread flooding starting yesterday, starting Thursday. So there is concern that this is going to be an issue over the weekend through Monday. And then a third storm is expected to enter the region on Sunday. And that is potentially going to bring renewed chances of rain, flooding all the way through Monday. It's really been a difficult time in California because this comes after years of drought. So, the state needs this water. It needs this rainfall. It has really helped with those drought levels, but the level and the pace at which this rain is coming down has created an incredible amount of destruction. It has really caused the soil to be so dense with water that there are trees falling. There are many landslides. Eighteen people at least have been killed, including a 5-year-old boy who was swept away in floodwaters whose body still has not been recovered. So, an incredible amount of damage. I'll send it back to you.",

And then it just tossed it like it was nothing. If you look across the railroad tracks here, you can see how that metal is just across that large tree. But as we turn our camera to the side here, you can see that industrial building that has been impacted greatly by this, all this happening in a matter of seconds. We talked to people who were inside a store here and they had to run for their lives, went inside a closet, and tried to hide together. Some of their cars are caught -- captured by the roof that fell on top of it. Listen to this person and talk about trying to run for the storm and being glad they made it out. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

Now we also have some drone video, I hope we have that we can show it to you, from above almost, every single roof in a two-mile area has been damaged by the storm. And on top of all this, they got lucky in this area because no one died in this immediate area. But as you said before, we know of at least seven deaths because of the storm. And what they're concerned about as they get to some of these outlying areas, they're going to find more bodies. So it's been a tremendously hard day for some of these people. On top of all that, Richard, the temperature has started to fall and with so many people not having roofs and not having power, they've been trying to bundle up as much as possible because the temperature has fallen some 30 degrees over the last 24 hours in this general area.",
