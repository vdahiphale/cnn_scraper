This is a very, very significant thing that has happened in this investigation because this defense attorney, Evan Corcoran, had previously told the Justice Department that they had done a thorough search at Mar-A-Lago for documents when the FBI went in for that search last August found dozens more, more than a hundred more when he was brought to the grand jury recently. Evan Corcoran declined to answer some questions about advice he was directly giving to Donald Trump or things Donald Trump had maybe said to him. And so the Justice Department went to court under seal and asked a judge to force him to answer those additional questions.

Because there's a crime fraud exception in the attorney-client privilege rule that says that an attorney can't be used to facilitate an ongoing crime. Well, the fact is that Jack Smith is focused on obstruction which is punishable by up to 20 years in prison and it looks like it's Donald Trump and Evan Corcoran, both in his sights. Because it was Jack Smith who drafted the letter signed by Christina Bobb, that said, yes, all the documents had been returned. Well, that could be obstruction. And here's a note just as - from one lawyer to future lawyers out there, young lawyers, don't sign a letter that the drafter will not sign himself. That's what Christina Bobb did.

It's essentially a look at drone operations over the Black Sea.What are the benefits? What are the risks? What intelligence is gathered? And look at the routes and altitudes, essentially just a whole look at those drone operations in general. It's worth pointing out two things: First, even before we learned of the assessment, there was another MQ-9 Reaper flight shortly after the flight with the encounter with the Russian jet. That according to three officials familiar with the flight itself was to look at the area that the Russians were trying to get to, to see if they could reach the wreckage of the drone. Even after we learned of the assessment we now saw on flight tracking websites, an RQ-4 Global Hawk drone over the southern area of the Black Sea. So we know at least that there have been multiple drone flights over the Black Sea since the encounter and this is the indication we have gotten. These drone flights will continue and that's what defense secretary Lloyd Austin promised that the U.S. will continue to fly where international law and international airspace allows which is a whole lot of the Black Sea.",

We later learned that that was wiping the sensitive software off the drone before it hit the waters. So there isn't too much of a great concern here about what bits of wreckage or debris the Russians could recover. Of course, the U.S. hasn't had any Navy ships in the Black Sea for more than a year now since before the invasion, so it wasn't really an option for the U.S. to try to get in there and recover it on their own.",

I think DeSantis laid out a relatively thoughtful view.I don't like the phrase territorial dispute, I agree that that was not good. But if you look at everything else he articulated, it was pretty much mainstream political thought and not all that is similar to current U.S. policy. He said he was not for a further escalation of U.S. engagement in Ukraine. Well, neither is Biden, because further escalation is boots on the ground and I don't think there's really that many people that want that. So I think there is a rush with DeSantis always to try to mischaracterize what he is saying. And I think in this case, it was way overdone. Again, territorial dispute don't - I don't love that phrasing, but also he's not a policymaker. He's a candidate for public office and I guess if you're in my camp, which is we're either going to have Trump or someone else, I'm willing to give Ron DeSantis some latitude here in order to get us a different nominee than the people who I think basically want Trump back for their own personal amusement.",
