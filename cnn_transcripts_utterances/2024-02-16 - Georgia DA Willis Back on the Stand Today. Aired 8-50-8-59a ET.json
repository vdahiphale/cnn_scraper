      "sentences": "Welcome to a special edition of CNN NEWS CENTRAL. I'm John Berman in New York. Kate and Sara are out.Huge news this morning on several fronts. Global outrage and shock at the death of jailed Putin critic Alexei Navalny, and questions about what it means for the world order. Yaroslav Trofimov of \"The Wall Street Journal\" writes, quote, \"Putin clearly feels that the wind is in his sails as the United States appears on the verge of abandoning Ukraine and possibly Europe, and he has no backlash to fear anymore.\" Now, we just heard from Vice President Kamala Harris, and we are waiting hear from President Biden from the White House. Also, any minute now we could get a ruling in the New York civil fraud trial against Donald Trump. A judge has already found him liable for fraud. The ruling, which we are told could come today at any time, could strip Trump of control of his business empire and cost him hundreds of millions of dollars. And in Fulton County, Georgia, courtroom cameras just turned back on, with the prosecutor who brought felony charges against Donald Trump ready to take the stand. You're looking at live pictures right there from inside the court. DA Fani Willis is fighting to keep her case amid allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Now, if yesterday is any indication of what we can expect to see, it will be explosive. CNN's Laura Coates live outside the Fulton County Courthouse this morning. Laura, what are we expecting?",

      "sentences": "We are expecting additional (ph) testimony today from the DA, Fani Willis. Now remember yesterday, she appeared in the courtroom. Everyone was shocked to see that she was not only there, but willing, ready, and able to testify. And testify she did. If anyone was under an impression that she was somehow a shrinking violet or a wallflower, they are sadly mistaken and recognized this morning what these co-defendants might be up against if this trial continues and she is not disqualified. It is a very heavy bar and a very heavy lift to try to disqualify anyprosecutor from a case. It all rests on conflict of interest. Was the conflict of interest in this case a financial benefit derived from her relationship with one of her lead prosecutor? Is that enough to then undermine the opportunity for a defendant, in this case more than a dozen, to get a fair trial, including a former president. Well, she made very clear that those co-defendants, John, are the ones who are on trial, not her, no matter how hard they tried. Listen to this moment. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

The defense lawyers - and I know it's confusing here -- is it's the defense lawyers, in a way, doing the prosecuting and the DA's office doing the defending of Fani Willis here. But the defense lawyers for the various people charged with trying to overturn the Georgia election, what more do they need to get out of the DA this morning?",

It seemed there was something to them. I think Nathan Wade's testimony was questionable.But to this point, in my view, that defendants have not delivered what they've said they'd deliver. First of all, there is an open question about when this relationship started. Thus far, the status quo as we head into today is, both participants in the relationship, Fani Willis and Nathan Wade, say it started after Nathan Wade was hired. There's one witness, that Laura alluded to, who gave sort of general, fuzzy testimony that she heard that it started earlier. That's not going to be enough. They need more to carry that burden. And then in the financial piece, and this is really the crux of the conflict of interest issue, they have shown only that there was some loose intermingling of finances and that cash was paid, but we don't have specifics as to amounts, and they need to really drill down. If they don't deliver today, I think this motion's going to fail.",

And so we began talking about sex instead of money. And the conflict here has never been about who they date or who they see, it's about where the money's going and is she receiving some benefit because of this prosecution.It's going to be important, though, that they narrowed down and try to pinpoint when the relationship started. And the reason is, if there's some proof that - and the judge believes it -- that they have lied, being Mr. Wade and Ms. Willis, that they've lied to the court in their filings, that's a different ballgame. And that changes the story a little bit as well. And the judge has some discretion about what he chooses to do at that point and, frankly, might cause some trouble outside of this case.",

Many of them are asking questions of Fani Willis and others. And then you have the DA's office serving, in a way, as Fani Willis' team here.Laura, my question to you down there, it was chaos yesterday. It was explosive. Does the chaos and explosiveness in and of itself, would that make Judge Scott McAfee say, you know what, this is such a mess. We've just got to take a step back. Is that a possibility?",
