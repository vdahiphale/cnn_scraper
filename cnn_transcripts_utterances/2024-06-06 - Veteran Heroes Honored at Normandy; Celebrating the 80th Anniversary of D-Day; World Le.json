Now, comes at a time when there is a lot to be vigilant about as we all know, because we've covered it for now, nearly going into its third year, this war in Ukraine, who knew that on the 80th anniversary of a war that was meant to end all wars, that Europe would be racked by this land war completely unprovoked by Russia, which departed from its -- from its liberation effort in World War II and decided to take up again under President Putin, the aura of domination, imperial, you know, dominance and trying to gather its sphere of influence again, after all these years.

In other words, not by isolationism. Reagan used that word isolationism, and that is not what was going to make, you know, peace through strength. It had to be when there was an evil abroad, it had to be confronted. And I think this is something that is so incredibly relevant today as a segment of the American population believes in this sort of America first, isolationist quality right now, to the point that the Reagan Republicans are no longer the Republicans that are represented by the majority of the party. And people have spoken over and over again about how the current Republican Party, at least, a major segment of them, headed by Donald Trump do believe much more in isolationism and are not the same, you know, global security Republicans that Reagan Republicans were in the aftermath, of course, of World War II.

We're down here on Arromanches, this is gold beach, where people have come out in huge numbers today to mark what was achieved here 80 years ago. They've come in jeeps like this one, their boards here in 1944 to help ferry across the land, the equipment and the weapons that were needed for the men to ensure that Operation Overlord was the success that it was. And what we've seen down here on gold beach today are huge crowds coming out to pay their attributes, and let me just show you, Isa, in the car next to us. Let me introduce you to a Reggie Pi(ph), this is 100-year-old World War II veteran. He landed here 80 years ago, a couple of weeks on from D- Day.

Improbable as it was against the odds it was, these very young men like Reggie landed on the beaches over consonants that had been occupied. France had been occupied for four years. The German positions were entrenched. The allied efforts to take back this land, inch-by-inch were incredibly brave, incredibly ambitious, and  almost foolhardy. One can consider looking back at what they were up against, and yet, inch- by-inch with the help of a logistics that were behind this, they managed to take back this land, not just in the name of France, but of course, as Christiane, was just saying the name of freedom, Isa.",

State Department spokesperson Matt Miller said that they are looking for transparency from the Israeli government on this strike. They want to see a full accounting of the names of those killed, and they want to see the facts.

We've just lost a veteran today who was trying to get to Normandy at 102 years old passed away. This is a huge moment for our civilization. The president hit it correctly. So, did Majority Leader McConnell, who wrote in an op-ed in \"The New York Times\" how much we have to guard against the incipient threats against our democracy. It seemed to come from without and from within. And I think this is a time to reflect that these people made an extraordinary sacrifice. They weren't there for empire. They weren't there to get anything, to seize territory. They were there because of an idea. And the idea was born back in our American revolution, and it is spread across the globe in really spectacular ways, in which we've shown people that the way of democracy, where the people vote, where the people rule, is exactly the way to go. But in recent years, we've seen an uptick in authoritarianism. It always comes. And this was our attempt, the largest invasion in the history of the world, in the greatest cataclysm that's ever-taken place in the world, the Second World War, to stem and check that advance of authoritarianism. And we did that. And now, as the president correctly pointed out, on the eastern borders of Europe and Ukraine, we're struggling in another similar situation and we have obligations to ourselves and most important to the idea that informs all of us that depression that came before World War II was a kind of practice of shared sacrifice. The Second World War was for Americans putting into practice perfecting the idea of sacrifice. And that's what happened on this day.

And many of the survivors are beginning to pass away and we're losing touch with that. It is our obligation though to bear witness to their testimony in films and news programs, in books, in conversations, in memoir, in just treating them with the respect so that we carry forward to the next generations the idea of their sacrifice and the pricelessness of the ideas that they sacrificed for. This is for an idea, not for empire or conquest. That's the thing that I want to hammer on. Why would a foreign kid from Pennsylvania land there? What was in his interest? It wasn't. It was in our interest. So, it speaks to us about collective freedom as well as individual freedom. He gets to enjoy that freedom or he protects it for others if he loses his life, because we shared that sacrifice. And what we learned making our film, \"The War,\" about the Second World War, the tagline was, there are no ordinary people. We live in an era of celebrity, of bold-faced names. The bold-faced names of this day, Eisenhower and Churchill, heroic leaders in their right, I'm not taking anything away from them, are not there. The people who are the bold-faced heroes are the so-called ordinary people. And you realize when you delve into history and what we have to celebrate, particularly today with this greatest generation, as it begins to close its eyes and take its long-deserved rest, is that there are no ordinary people.",
