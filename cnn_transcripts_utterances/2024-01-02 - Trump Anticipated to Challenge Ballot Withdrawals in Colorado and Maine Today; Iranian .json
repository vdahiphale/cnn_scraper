At any moment now, Trump is expected to appeal both decisions in Colorado and Maine to remove him from their primary ballots. Also today, a key deadline in his immunity fight as his federal election subversion trial that starts the day before Super Tuesday, by the way, nears.With us now is Business and Compliance Attorney and Constitutional Attorney Zeth -- Seth Berenzweig. Seth, good to have you. Let's start with just how, the how the 14th Amendment will be applied here. What do you think?",

      "sentences": "Well, the Supreme Court is going to be called upon as to whether it will exercise jurisdiction over this case. They probably would prefer not to because it's obviously a political hot potato. But they will probably have to accept the case because you have different jurisdictions coming up with different rulings and different standards. So, that's one of the aspects of accepting jurisdiction before the Supreme Court.So, they will have to apply a rule of consistency in terms of what they will do when they likely have it. They will have to make a determination principally whether the Colorado Supreme Court was correct in ruling that Mr. Trump was an officer within the meaning of the 14th Amendment's disqualification clause. And it's going to be difficult for them to, in my view, conclude that he is not an officer when he leads the office of the presidency under the United States. So, they're going to have a number of issues, not only from a substantive standpoint, but they'll also probably look through the lens on some procedural aspects. For example, they may make a determination as to whether the plaintiffs in these kinds of cases have legal standing to assert these kinds of cases. And the Supreme Court may try to avoid substantive rulings by looking at the procedural issues. Time will tell, but we do know that the appeal is being filed today. So, it really is a historic day here in Washington. SOLOMON:  Yes, absolutely. And -- I mean, let's assume for a moment that the Supreme Court picks this up, which, as I understand it, you believe they will. I mean, walk us through when, the when that might happen, because of course, you know, I mean, we're two weeks out from Iowa. I mean, 2024 is fast approaching.",

And in that brief, the special prosecutor noted, really, in keeping with the great precedent that he cited, that -- the question is whether or not the acts at issue were political versus official.And the thing is that we already can read some of the tea leaves on this case. Mr. Trump will of course be arguing in opposition to that and saying that he's entitled to immunity. However, we already have an advanced read because this court, only a couple of weeks ago, in the D.C. capitol riot, D.C. police case, also ruled that presidential immunity was off the table for acts during the presidency that were political and not official. So, I think that's going -- we have a crack in our crystal ball. We don't know exactly what they'll do, but I predict that the hearing will occur as time next Tuesday. That decision will probably be out within a matter of days and will also accelerate very rapidly to the U.S. Supreme Court.",

This movement comes just a few days after the U.S. military sank three boats belonging to the Houthis. The Houthis are an Iranian-backed group from Yemen who have been targeting commercial vessels in the Red Sea.Let's bring in CNN's Natasha Bertrand who is following all of this for us from the Pentagon. So, Natasha, how is the Pentagon responding to this?",

      "sentences": "Well, Rahel, a defense official tells us that they are monitoring the situation closely, of course, because it comes amid all of the rising tensions in the Red Sea with the Houthis, which are an Iran-backed group. Iran does provide support and intelligence to the Houthis, according to the White House.And so, the U.S. is monitoring this very closely. However, it is important to note that this is not the first time that Iran has deployed assets to the Red Sea. They operate there pretty regularly. But the U.S., of course, is eyeing this because of the fact that they say that Iran has been providing the Houthis with the kind of maritime intelligence that they need to select targets in the Red Sea as they hit commercial vessels there. There have been over a hundred attacks by these Iran backed Houthi militants on commercial vessels in the Red Sea since -- really, in the last month and a half. And so, the uptick that we have seen is really remarkable and it has really insnared international shipping and commerce. The fact that Iran is now there, just a day or two after the U.S. shot -- fired on small boats that contained Houthi militants, sinking them and killing all of those Houthi militants on board could be seen as a sign that Iran is trying to present a show of force to the Americans, of course, who are operating in the area. Because if you'll recall, the U.S. also set up a multinational maritime task force to bolster security in the Red Sea to try to prevent the Houthis from launching these attacks and to escort vessels that are transiting the area so that they feel safe going up and through the Suez Canal so that international shipping can kind of get back on track here. So, this is not right now being seen by the Pentagon as a direct threat to the U.S. or any of its allies. Instead, they are watching it very closely. They do not necessarily think that Iran is going to conduct any kind of provocations here. But both sides obviously trying to send a message to the other there that they are in the region. They can respond if and when they deem it is necessary for help.",

What is the presence of this Iranian vessel change?GEN. WESLEY CLARK (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST, FORMER NATO SUPREME ALLIED COMMANDER, FOUNDER, RENEW AMERICA TOGETHER, AND SENIOR FELLOW, UCLA BURKLE CENTER:  So, it is -- you know, first of all, it's going to collect intelligence on U.S. activities in the area. It's going to serve as a deterrent. or they believe it will deter U.S. actions against the Houthis. It will certainly inhibit us in the sense of maneuvering. It's one more factor for us to consider. It raises tensions in the region. It shows Iran's hegemonial aspirations, demonstrates those, and we will just have to see where this goes, John. If the Houthis say, OK, we got the Iranians here. Now, we're not going to interfere with the shipping. Fine. If the Houthis say, now, we got the Iranians here. We can do more to interdict the shipping. Iran has got to get its destroyer out of the way as we protect the shipping. If that destroyer gets in the way, if it interferes with the shipping, if it supports the Houthis, then that is a challenge that will have to be met by the United States militarily.",

So, this is an ongoing struggle. It's going to cause a lot of pain and grief in Ukraine, and the United States and the West have got to provide the assets, more assets, to enable Ukraine to handle this.

And you know what we can expect from this is, you know, this was the civil lawsuit brought by one of Epstein's most outspoken accusers, Virginia Roberts Giuffre.And we have already seen information come out about that over time. I mean, she has accused some prominent men of sexually assaulting her, including Former Senator George Mitchell, Former Texas Governor Bill Richardson. Both of those men and their spokespeople have said in the past that they never met her, they certainly never met her, they never abused her. You know, she also accused Alan Dershowitz, the prominent attorney, sued him, then later dropped that lawsuit saying that she may have been mistaken about including him in this. You know, she also sued Prince Andrew, that's probably one of the most prominent people that she has accused of sexually abusing her. They had reached a settlement where he agreed to pay a substantial amount to a charity. So, you know, as part of a lawsuit, the lawyers collect a lot of information. That includes depositions, calendar entries, flight logs. So, expect we will see a lot of that type of material becoming public with some of these names unsealed. And these names could be anyone from other prominent individuals who she or others. These could be depositions with other accusers, with others involved. You know, we will see names come out in that. We may also see names of people who just work for Epstein that are not accused of any wrongdoing but their names have already become public either through the criminal trial of Maxwell or through other means. So, this will really give us, I think, shedding a lot more light on the Epstein universe, kind of his whole sordid life. The extent of what we learn that is going to be new or a shocking new name remains unclear at this point. But it is certainly going to shed a lot more light on the universe of Jeffrey Epstein and all the allegations that have swirled around him for two decades.",
