Two of the victims are in critical condition.Investigators are now worried that the violence is not over, that there could be retaliation from this. Shell casings just littered the crime scene in this case. And authorities suspect an assault rifle was among the weapons that were used. Authorities are now offering a $22,500 reward for information that leads to an arrest. CNN's Polo Sandoval is on this story for us. And Polo, this all started at a birthday party?",

      "sentences": "And Brianna, one of the reasons perhaps why that casualty count is so high, as the mayor put shockingly high, is because there were hundreds of people who were gathering there just southeast of downtown Akron, Ohio, over the weekend to celebrate a birthday party. And that very quickly took a deadly turn with this drive-by shooting. Police believe that there were about 200 people who were gathering outside of that home in Akron when at one point the driver of a vehicle pulls up and at least one gunman aboard that literally sprayed the crowd with bullets.Now, evidence at this point indicating that some members of that group that were in the crowd that was shot at actually managed to return fire before the vehicle then sped away. But here's the thing. At this point in the investigation, police have not shared any information on a motive. They do not have the description of a suspect or a vehicle. So I want you to listen in on Police Chief Brian Harding as he makes a very public plea for any information, emphasizing that no detail is small enough to share. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",

His police department identifying and confirming his identity is Joshua Brees, who was among four officers who were responding to a disturbance at a dance happening at a private residence when at one point, and the circumstances are still unclear here, but at one point shots rang out and this officer, along with a second individual, were killed.And these incidents are really just the latest of what were supposed to be joyous events turning into a mass shooting situation. Already this year alone, we have seen these joyous events like family reunions, a sporting rally, religious celebrations, ending with shots fired. The Gun Violence Archive that tracks these situations, these mass shootings, now reporting 194 this year alone, Brianna, and as we've seen, these two examples, not just civilians but members of law enforcement making up the growing list of victims in the U.S.",

And we've seen other fast food restaurants bring back their deals as well.Burger King has a $5 value meal. McDonald's also responding with a $5 meal. And then Wendy's has a $3 breakfast meal.

So that got a lot of pushback from customers. And McDonald's has even come out and said, hey, guys, we understand our prices have gotten a little bit out of whack. We're trying to push back a little bit here.And so McDonald's, I think that, you know, people are really going to be looking to them to see how this deal is.
