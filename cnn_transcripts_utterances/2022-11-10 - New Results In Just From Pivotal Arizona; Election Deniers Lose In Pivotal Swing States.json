That's too short of the 51 seats they need to retake Senate control. Over in the House of Representatives, Democrats have won right now 192 House seats. So far, Republicans have 209. That's nine seats short of the 218 needed to reclaim the majority, 34 House seats still haven't been decided. To win House control, by the way, Republicans must win seven seats in competitive contests that are still playing out right now. They have a very good chance at doing that, since they are currently leading in 11 races. Democrats have a taller order. They must win 21 competitive seats to hold on to the House. They are currently leading in 16 races. Let's go to the battleground States right now. Our correspondent, Kyung Lah is an Arizona. Kyung, we expect new votes from Arizona very soon.

We are told that it will be in the range of about 62,000 votes, if not greater. They anticipate it will be greater, but that number has been moving as they work through all of these ballots. Those ballots from Friday night, Saturday and -- excuse me, Saturday night, Sunday, and Monday. These are ballots, early ballots before Election Day and so those are going to be a part of the results that we get tonight. And every single night, we are going to expect about the 60,000 to 70,000 range to be released nightly here from Maricopa County. It is a slow process. They have to signature verify. They are mandated by State Law to follow some certain rules, but this has created an area for some heated political rhetoric, including from what we're hearing from Arizona Republican gubernatorial nominee, Kari Lake, and here, the election officials have pushed back on her assertion that they are doing it on purpose.

That's an estimate. That's just an approximation. Blake Masters who is now running behind would need approximately between 52 and 56 percent of the remaining uncounted vote. Obviously, Mark Kelly needs less. He is currently in the lead in this race. So Mark Kelly needs about 42 to 46 percent of that overall Statewide, remaining vote to be counted.

So hundreds of thousands of votes to still count in the State. But look at this. This is so interesting, because it's a close race. Kari Lake is running a little behind right now, but in this estimate, in this range, Kari Lake needs between 49 and 51 percent, roughly half of that outstanding vote, you know, in order to overtake Katie Hobbs and secure a victory here. Katie Hobbs' range is really similar, 49 to 51 percent is what she needs to achieve in what is left to be counted.

But this is again, as you get into these batches, I'm going to come out here to make sure this is off and bring you the statewide totals now over here again. All right, so Senator Kelly -- this is Katie Hobbs. This the Governor's race.Katie Hobbs, the Democratic candidate for Governor is getting 51 percent if you round that up, 49 percent for Kari Lake. So if you're Katie Hobbs, you need to stay above 50, right? You win if you stay above 50. So these new votes come in and she is getting 65 percent. Again, that's gold. You're not only meeting your bar David Chalian was talking about, you need somewhere you know, if it is above 49 or 50 percent to keep that lead. So you want to get 50 percent anytime in elections. You want to get 50 percent of every new batch that comes in or more, 65 percent, so you're happy. You're happy if you're in the Hobbs' campaign there. Again, it's a Democratic county, but every vote counts. You want to stretch that lead out because you are worried. Kari Lake was a TV anchor in the Phoenix suburbs, you're worried maybe she'll have more support in larger, more populous Maricopa County. So when you're getting those margins in Pima County, you are happy. Now let's switch to the Senate race. Senator Kelly has a bigger lead. It's up to 107,000. Now because of this. It was about 100,000 last time we spoke. Now it's up to about 107,000 because of this and look at what's happening with it. He's at 51 to 52 percent if you round that up to 46 percent. So Mark Kelly, essentially, if he gets 49 percent, he can still win this race. But he wants to get 50 or more in every one of these, right? We can do a statistical analysis, or you could just have common sense. To keep your lead, you want to win more than half of all the votes coming in and you're guaranteed to keep your lead, and look 66 percent. Again, it's a democratic county so Republicans are saying so what, it's a Democratic county. We're going through these votes, some by the hundreds, some by the thousands. Mark Kelly is doing exactly what he needs. So Blake Masters performing at this level in Pima County, he is going to need a gangbuster's performance in Maricopa County where there are more votes, but a number like that does not make you happy. You need to do better even in Democratic areas, if you want to win this state, the Republican needs to do better than that.",

      "sentences": "Well, we're counting votes, and so you have these races. These are the races we've called so far, as you just outlined. Republicans have 209, that leaves them just nine seats away from 218, the magic number. That would be a new Republican Majority, Democrats though are at 195. And again, Republicans did not expect the map to look like this three days after.Now, Republicans, as you note have an easier path, right? We just look at the races where they are ahead right now. They're ahead in 222, you need 218 for Majority, these races are not called, so they could go the other way. We're still counting mail ballots, there's a lot still to go. But right now, the probability is that they will have a narrow majority, but the mathematical possibility remains that the Democrats can get there. It's a steep hill. But I want to walk through the possibilities. And remember, this is the possibilities. Republicans have an easier path. Republicans have a more probable path. But Democrats have a possible path. And let's go through some of the steps. You see right there, they are at 195, right, 195. Let me bring these three races and here are three more. We view these as races are differences, our Decision team has looked closely at these, the Democrats are likely to win. You have one here in New Mexico, one here in Colorado, and there's one here in Maryland. And I want to note, the Republican is currently leading in this race in Maryland, but there are outstanding votes in Montgomery County, just outside of Washington, DC, it is overwhelmingly Democratic. That's where the outstanding votes are. The Republicans lead is narrow. So it is quite likely, in our view, based on voting patterns that the Democrat will win there. So there's one there's two, there's three. Where does that get you? That would get you in this scenario, and it's a scenario to 198, right? So leave that there, let's take the next step. Let's look at some more races here. Here are 14 more races where Democrats are ahead, in some of these, Democratic victory is guaranteed. California has a jungle primary. So in several of these races, it's a Democrat versus a Democrat. So a Democrat will win. We just don't know which Democrat yet. In other races, the Democrats are ahead and of several of those, Republicans have actually conceded, but we have not called them yet because the vote margin is so close. We're a conservative here. So we want to wait and count the votes. But there's 14 more, right? So what does that get you to? That would get you to 212, right? So let's take this out, wipe this out, bring this up. That would get you to 212. Two hundred and twelve, that's tantalizingly close to 219, isn't it, Wolf? And so let's take the next step. Let's take the next step right here. Two eighteen is where you need to get. These are two States with rank choice voting. The Democratic candidates in Alaska and in Maine are currently ahead and they're close to 50 percent, they could win outright. If they don't get above 50 percent when all the votes are counted, that's when they do the second choice. And third choice, they drop out the bottom candidates, and they look at the second third choice, it is not only quite possible, we believe probable, the Democratic candidate wins here and wins here. So that would get you to 214. Again, this is a scenario, watching at home, but this is why --",

It doesn't mean it will happen, but that is a case. Okay, I can see how that works. It would be hard for any Republican to disagree that it is possible.These four, fully transparent is a reach. These are reach. Why? Because Republicans are leading in them right now. This includes the Lauren Boebert district here in Western Colorado. She's ahead by 11,136 votes. They're not done counting here. It's possible the Democrat can win this race. So, that's why we say, it is possible, but it would be a reach. One more I just want to show you, one more of these. Let's bring this back out here and come out here to Central California. This name might be known to you when I come into this district here. This is David Valadao's district. He is one of two remaining of the impeachment 10. The Republicans who voted to impeach Donald Trump. Dan Newhouse has won reelection in Washington State. David Valadao, you see him here. He is ahead by 3,300 votes, 3,386, but there are a lot of votes to count out here. This district was carried by Joe Biden by 13 points. So, that's why we put it on this list. It is possible, reasonable, California, those mail-in ballots. This district has swung back and forth. The vote count has swung back and forth in this district if we watched it, so will the Democrat win? We don't know that. Will the Republican win? He just might. But I just wanted to show you, in this scenario, if Democrats can defy the odds, yes, and get the mail-in ballot counts and get those other four, come back out to the full map, if they can get those other four, it is still mathematically possible to get there. [20:25:00] Again, Republicans have a clearer path to the majority, but the reason we're still counting votes and it's so important to count these votes on Night Three is that there's still a mathematical possibility, 214, they could back that up pretty good. Getting these last ones in there, it is a reach, but it is a mathematical possibility and it's not out of the realm.",

We are simply not there yet. Republicans, there at one point, Kevin McCarthy said we'll win 60 seats. And he said well, when 30 seats, you're looking right now where they are ahead and 222 seats -- all right, 222 seats. In the current House of Representatives, they have 212 seats. If this ends with a 10 or 12. Seat Republican gain, Republicans will have the majority that is significant.

In New Mexico, the incumbent Democratic Secretary of State, Maggie Toulouse Oliver defeated Republican Audrey Trujillo who publicly questioned President Biden's 2020 win. We're also following two major sectors a races that we have not yet called in Arizona, waiting new vote numbers, the race between the Republican Mark Finchem and the Democrat Adrian Fontes remains undecided. Finchem is a state representative and has (INAUDIBLE) backed Trump lies about the election. He's also a self-proclaimed number for the extremist group, the Oath Keepers. In Nevada, where you are following the still undecided race between Republican Jim Marchant and the Democrats Cisco Aguilar. Marchant denies that President Biden legitimately won the 2020 election claims that top congressional Democrats had been installed by what he calls the deep state fall. There we go. That's Finchem and Marchant in their own words. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MARK FINCHEM (R-AZ) SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATE: Ladies and gentlemen, we know it. And they know it. Donald Trump won. JIM MARCHANT (R-NV) SECRETARY OF STATE CANDIDATE: President Trump and I lost an election in 2020, because of a rigged election. I've been working since November 4, 2020, to expose what happened.
