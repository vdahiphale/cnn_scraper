The former vice president is leaving out of his remarks is that there are notable differences in these cases and at this point, it does not appear as though the current president and former president are being treated differently. What we have this case is a situation in which it is not unusual for people to inadvertently take a classified documents from secure facility, if there is someone who is held a security college for a long time. That kind of honest mistake does occasionally happen. But what matters is that one that happens, what people do and how they do it to make sure it is right. In this case, you have a situation where the president, the current president's personal lawyers immediately contacted the national archives to let them know there was this information. They're the case with president Trump is very different because as we all know by now there was a long period of time in which the national archives was trying to recover documents and that they started on May of 2021 and it was not until August 2022 when the federal agents had to trade Mar- a-Lago to recover them back.

Merrick Garland has all of the information, he has got to look at that and make it determination of whether or not it is appropriate run investigation here.But there are a couple of things that are really important. One is that we are talking about the documents that are somewhere between seven and ten years old, and so whenever there are documents taken from the secure, facility there is always a threat or potential threat to national security. These documents are much older, so the potential threat is diminished and in this case. The other issue here is that when we look at the content of these documents, that matters. I've said the same thing with regards to the documents from President Trump's office. The content matters. So, what we know so far about the content is that it would suggest that they are not on the level of seriousness that wouldn't threaten our national security, but we have more information just fully understand that, Christine.",
