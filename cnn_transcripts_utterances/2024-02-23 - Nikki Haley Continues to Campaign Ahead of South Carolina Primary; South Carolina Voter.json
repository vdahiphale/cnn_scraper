They're on the frontlines of fighting for democracy and that's why it is so important that we get this aid and this assistance to them as quickly as we possibly can.

Obviously, Congress would need to actually come back to Washington to get that done.I want to shift over to the war in Gaza, if we could because the US veto to a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. This has been a back and forth and a ton of work, I'm told behind-the-scenes, intensively to try and shape things to try and reach some kind of outcome on your side, the US side, ally side as well. I think my question is, particularly since we saw the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lay out kind of his longer term proposal last night for the first time. Do you feel like what Netanyahu laid out is viable? And do you feel like the Israelis are holding up their end of the bargain given the US willingness to assist them both militarily, but also in places like the UN? THOMAS-GREENFIELD:  Look, we have been clear in the UN, and particularly, in my role in the UN that we have to do everything possible to find a path to getting hostages out, to getting more assistance in and ending this conflict. We thought that the resolution that was presented by the Algerians actually hurt those efforts. We have people on the ground working this around the clock. They're working around the clock to get humanitarian assistance in and they're working around the clock to come to a negotiated agreement that will get hostages out, bring this conflict to an end, initially a pause so that we can get humanitarian assistance in and then have that pause extended for a longer term and eventually have it extended permanently. This is really hard work. The negotiations are hard work. We worked very, very closely with the Algerians to try to help them tailor their resolution so that it would impact, would not have a negative impact on the situation on the ground, but would have a positive impact on the negotiations. We cannot support a ceasefire that only gives an advantage to Hamas so that Hamas can continue its attacks on Israel, but also continue to hold the Palestinian people hostage.",

I know -- I've met with the UN special envoy on sexual violence. I know that she visited Israel a few weeks ago, and I know that she is concerned about this report as well and we will continue to address this issue. We held the what is called an Arria-formula Meeting in the UN to talk about these issues. We support it. We've supported the Israelis in making sure that this information gets out.",
