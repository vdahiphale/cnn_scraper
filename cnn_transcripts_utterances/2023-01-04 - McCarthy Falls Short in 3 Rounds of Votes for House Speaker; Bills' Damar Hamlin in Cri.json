You would think that a rational party would be looking for ways to marginalize and lower the profile of someone, Jim Jordan, who was, you know, such a lightning rod at the center of this. And yet what did we see? We saw not only did we see the right elevating them as their alternative to McCarthy, we saw McCarthy bringing him in as his principal character witness. And again, I think that goes to show what we're going to see over the next two years, which is no real discipline or constraint on the most militant and extreme members of the caucus further risking, further stamping the House GOP and the GOP itself as the party of Trump after an election in which that identification clearly -- you know, they clearly paid a cost for that identification.

These lawsuits comes after a New York law was passed giving adult survivors of sexual assault one year to file lawsuits even if the statute of limitations on their claims has expired.The new year is off to a successful start for Ukraine's military which is claiming yet another major attack on Russian soldiers within its territory. The general star says around 500 Russian troops were killed or wounded in a town of Makiivka in the Kherson region. FOSTER: Meanwhile, Russia is revising the death toll up to 89 in a separate attack on a barracks in the Donetsk region. Moscow says Ukraine was able to target the site because so many Russian soldiers there were using their mobile phones.",

Clare, the numbers for the attack are still disputed, but even if it was 89 -- which I think the Russians are publicly acknowledging -- that would still be the greatest loss of life from one attack that Russia has acknowledged since it wants its invasion of Ukraine. What more are we learning about both attacks?",

We know they have sort of dialed down in a big way the death toll so far in this war. But they are now -- it's sort of out in the open. We're seeing pictures of state media of mourners laying flowers in some regions of Russia.They are now sort of bringing out recriminations as well. They've accused, as you say, the soldiers, themselves, of using their mobile phones even though it's been banned and that they say allowed Ukraine to pinpoint the targets. But we're hearing this morning from a very prominent military blogger, a Russian military blogger who said that that is not at all convincing. He said that is -- and I quote -- a blatant attempt to snare blame. He also says that he thinks the death toll will climb. That the list of missing is known to be larger. Ukraine has put it at around 400 but they say they're clarifying that.",
