No longer a member of Congress, as he was just moments ago, you heard the speaker instruct the clerk to notify the governor of New York of the vacancy in this seat. And this is now, you know, the first time as you guys have said, where you're not dealing with a traitor from the Confederacy or dealing with a convicted criminal.This is the first time that somebody has been expelled from Congress that doesn't fit into one of those categories, which is that notion of precedent that George Santos was raising, and some Republicans were raising as an area of concern that this was setting a precedent. But this is quite astonishing when you think a year ago, when it was first reported by \"The New York Times\" and others how much he had lied to the public about who he was, what he was claiming to be a total and complete fraud. And then, as you noted that ethics report that showed that he was using campaign contributions to fund his personal life. Now, he's obviously pleaded not guilty to the federal charges that are against him. He claims his innocence, and that'll be adjudicated in a court of law. But his fellow representatives in Congress said he's no more befitting to serve in the People's House. And now there is going to be a real political fallout, both in how the House is governed with a even narrower Republican majority now and in the battle for control of the House, because this is a critical district that helped give Republicans the majority in the last cycle, and now is going to be really up for grabs, both in a special election. And then next November.",

We asked him for comment about this historic moment, having one of his own Republican members expelled. He said he would not comment on that. Instead, he tried to turn his attention to other issues that he feels are important facing the House, including getting an aid package to Israel passed through the House, so he would not comment.But it was interesting. Kate noted earlier that speaker Johnson presided over that vote. He's the one who brought the gavel down when he announced that George Santos would be expelled. So he had a very solemn tone when he did that. Normally, he doesn't have to be in the chair presiding over those moments. But clearly, he understood the significance and the weight of this moment. He himself of course, as we recorded earlier, voted against explosion, but at the same time, he told his members, they are free to vote their conscience and they should vote however their districts want them to vote. But no doubt, this is going to have huge impacts for Johnson. Now his razor thin majority just got even smaller, it's going to be harder for them to pass things like government funding, aid to Israel, especially a major visions in the GOP. And meanwhile, they're going to have a special election now, at some point over the next few months where they're going to have to fight to hang on to that seat. It's going to be a tough fight. So clearly, GOP leadership Speaker Johnson feeling the weight of this moment right now, guys.",

This isn't just somebody that used campaign money, he was a fraud. And he got elected under fraudulent claims.Everything about him was a lie. And he didn't even have any humility about him. He was trying to run the Donald Trump playbook of double down, speak tougher, go after the quote, liberals who are going after you are the enemy within the camp. And so it is really a good move by the House of Representatives. I mean, the fact that only six have been expelled, goes to show and, you know, we know how much corruption has been in the House in the past, goes to show how high that bar is to get expelled. But it was the right thing to do. Now, the Republicans have even tighter majority, it's going to be interesting to get this stuff done. It may force them to reach out to Democrats more, but this was the right vote to defend what integrity is left in the House of Representatives.",

And sometimes on the toughest votes that like, you know, if there was a vote for some package that nobody liked, they'd vote for it. That's what leadership is.So in this case, leadership should have been the ones out there voting to expel George Santos to give those who are voting to expel George Santos cover. Plus, it was just right to defend the House. The fact that they didn't goes to show, again, that you're watching this collapse of leadership in the House, more to like, let's please the base than it is to like, let's defend the institution. And I think that goes to show some of the reason that the House itself has lost, respect has lost integrity, and has lost, you know, that I don't know that ability to be the House of all people. It was an interesting vote for me because I would have thought for sure that leadership would have voted to expel as the tough thing to do, and instead they took the easy vote for themselves.",

He tried to sort of -- just mimic it to a point where it was almost, it was so transparent. And that that is one of the reasons I think that it probably didn't work. But the strategy wasn't just about victimhood. It was also just about never stopping to talk.I mean, this morning, George Santos was on \"Fox News,\" hours before this vote. It's hard for me to understand how that would be seen as helpful. He's -- he doubled down at exactly the wrong moment. He in an interview with Manu Raju just a couple of weeks ago, was found -- was caught basically, in lies that were then laid out in the Ethics Committee report. This is part of the problem with Santos, part of the problem for those more than 100 Republican members who voted for this expulsion. He was a completely unhelpful distraction to the institution of the House of Representatives that could not be ignored. Santos was not going to repent and then quietly do the work of his district. He was always interested in being in the spotlight, and that I think a lot of members thought was just completely untenable.",
