First of all, did Donald Trump engage in insurrection or did he not? We said that it would be unlikely the Supreme Court would want to go deep into this. In fact, they went into it one time. Justice Jackson, towards the very end of Donald Trump's lawyers, asked a question about whether Donald Trump engaged in insurrection. His lawyers said no. They offered a sort of convoluted definition of insurrection, but that was it. As predicted, the Supreme Court was much more focused on the procedural questions, starting with, who gets to decide whether and how the 14th Amendment applies? Is it up to the individual states or does it have to come from Congress or some federal source? And to that end, we heard, I think, a really important sound bite. Let's roll that. We can talk about it on the other side. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP) KETANJI BROWN JACKSON, U.S. SUPREME COURT ASSOCIATE JUSTICE:  What is your argument that it's not? Your reply brief says that it wasn't because, I think, you say it did not involve an organized attempt to overthrow the government.",

We can't leave it to the states. We might have sort of chaos if we left it to the states. And then the final question was, does the president count as an officer of the United States under the 14th Amendment? This got into the minutiae of what counts as an officer. Does the president count or not? And we heard the justices ask a question about that. Let's take a quick listen to that. (BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)",

One last point, Jake. People may be wondering, when are we going to get an answer, a ruling from the Supreme Court? Well, they always can and do rule whatever they want, but really important date to keep in mind here. March 5 is Super Tuesday. Colorado, among other states, will be voting on March 5. So I think it's a very safe bet we will get a ruling before then, because I think the Supreme Court recognizes the voters of Colorado and elsewhere have to know if one of the candidates will or will not be disqualified.",

They're really making an argument about the law that no state can disqualify someone for being an insurrectionist because we in Congress could end up acting by two-thirds to remove the disqualification.

Again, they're looking at this pretty obscure provision, Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, the so-called insurrectionist ban, something that really hasn't been litigated since like 1919. So, the fact that this has made it all the way to the High Court, it is a historic moment. Now, I'm not sure if she is going to be on the winning side of this case when all is said and done, but it has been an incredible journey. Her story is amazing. And the story of this case is like the little case that could. Nobody thought this would end up with the Supreme Court, particularly when you look at all Trump's other legal cases.",

And they were referencing a debate where one of the lawmakers asked, well, does it specifically say president in here? And they pointed to the clause about officer of the United States. He seemed to think that worked in his favor. The justices seem to say, no, that shows that there's ambiguity about who this applies to.",

And I think one of the things that signaled that this might be game over for the Colorado voters was that Chief Justice John Roberts said that the voters' case was at odds with the history of the Civil War and what he believes the purpose behind this provision may have been, which is to prevent people who had served the South, fought for the South, for the Confederacy from holding public office. But then they pressed him to look for examples where states had kept national candidates off of ballots based on this. And he was at a loss to give examples. So, it is pretty amazing that you have to go all the way back to the end of the Civil War to think about, what were they doing? Why were they crafting this particular provision? And, unfortunately, the lawyer are advocating for the voters, he wasn't really able to offer a robust defense of how this modern argument about former President Trump fit into what they were thinking back in the post-Civil War era.",

And even Justice Kagan raised this question to one of the lawyers, just saying, look, do we really want to have a state give -- give them the power to decide who runs in presidential elections? And I think -- I believe it was Justice Alito who suggested that this is really one of the reasons they took up the case, was because they don't want all this ambiguity and chaos across 50 different states.",

This is arguably the biggest test of his career. So, they need to issue an opinion here. But he is going to be under such pressure to build a coalition so this does not look partisan. And I think you and I both heard, I mean, there's a possibility they might be able to get somewhere all nine justices will align. That will likely be very narrow. But that could take time. And it may not happen before Super Tuesday.
