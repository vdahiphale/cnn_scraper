      "sentences": "Well, they don't want to interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation. We know that special counsel Robert Hur will now be overseeing the investigation into the handling of these classified materials, now found at multiple locations connected to the sitting president.And in recent days in our reporting on this investigation, we've learned a little bit more about just how far the Justice Department has gone in this investigation. We have learned that the U.S. attorney in Chicago who was tasked with doing the initial review and making a recommendation about whether there should be a special counsel, we learned that he interviewed Pat Moore, who is one of Biden's longtime attorneys. He is the one who uncovered the first batch of classified information at President Biden's office here in D.C. But what's interesting about that interview is we learned that it didn't generate what's called a 302. That sounds technical, a little nerdy, but it's important because that is the form that the government usually uses to memorialize an interview like this. And that suggests that it is more of an informal conversation. We've also learned that the U.S. attorney didn't use a grand jury. He didn't ask them to do searches. He didn't participate in these searches of other locations. So, it seems like the special counsel, Robert Hur, he's going to inherit a pretty thin file of evidence. So, we've learned that what he's in the process of assembling his team and once he gets that together, he'll really have to go and almost start this from the beginning. He'll have the opportunity to re-interview people, do new interviews, fire off subpoenas. We can also use that grand jury to hear from witnesses. So, he's got a lot of work to do, and The Hill could be waiting for a while before this wraps up and they get access to all this evidence that they're asking for.

When I was in the oval office or elsewhere and papers were distributed to groups or people and me, they would often be in striped, paper folder with classified or confidential or another word on them. When a session was over, they would collect the papers, but not the folders. I've saved hundreds of them. He called them a cool keepsake. Now of course, he saved troves of government documents. He claimed that hundreds of pages of classified documents he declassified. But what's your thought on the president keeping these -- these cool keepsakes, the folders for classified documents?",

That's for sure, Alisyn and Victor, and this is all happening just south of the border may be about less than an hour's drive south of there to Rosarito Beach. And what the family is saying is that they are -- they believe that he was killed. Let's put it to that way.In fact, let me read to you part of their statement that was put up on their GoFundMe page and that we've also received from the family lawyer. It says: The family, which has extensive legal training in criminal law, wholeheartedly believed based on their initial investigation, that Elliott was the victim of a brutal crime. Now according to the family this is a resort where he and his wife had visited several times over the last few years, someplace they knew. Even staying in the same room so he was familiar with the area. That he was fluent in Spanish and that he was not intoxicated when this happened. But they are saying that this happened outside of the front door to where their room was. Now, according to the Attorney General for Baja California, telling the \"Orange County Register\" -- and I just want to redo this little bit here. It says, this was a death that was a result of an unfortunate accident from a fall by the now deceased from the third-story floor. The family refutes that completely saying that is not what happened. They have not heard from any of the Mexican officials, the family says. But they did say that they heard from a liaison from the coroner's department and this is what their conversation had -- what they say happened with that conversation. The liaison indicated the cause of death was severe head trauma and that the case forwarded to the district attorney's office to conduct a possible homicide investigation. The liaison also advised at this time the toxicology report had not been completed. The family says they've been pushed to have the body cremated but are going to do their own investigation and so they're not going to do that. But are looking further into this. But clearly no matter how you look at this it's a tragic, tragic story and not a lot of clarity on how this could have happened.",
