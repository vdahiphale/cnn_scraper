And interestingly, she did make mention of others whose views in this country are different. She said, \"There are some in our own country who would be okay, basically with Ukraine giving up parts of its territory, with Ukraine accepting neutrality, with Ukraine for going security relationships,\" she said with other nations. And she said that is a proposal coming from Vladimir Putin and it is unacceptable. Now, I think for President Zelenskyy, he obviously has a pretty tough task ahead for him as you alluded to. He is not only asking for additional security assistance, which he says is important if he has any shot at winning this war. He is also making a deliberate case on something really specific that he has not yet had luck on and that is convincing some of these western countries, including the US that provide long range missiles to Ukraine to be used in the war, to be fired further into Russian territory.",

Public office is a privilege. We allege that Mayor Adams abused that privilege and broke the law, laws that are designed to ensure that officials like him serve the people, not the highest bidder, not a foreign bidder, and certainly not a foreign power. These are bright red lines and we alleged that the mayor crossed them again and again for years. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

These corruption cases, Richard, I should say are easier said than done. And as the U.S. attorney seemed to be anticipating there, a lot of times you'll see a defense of saying, well, what's wrong with constituent service? What's wrong with pushing the fire department to approve a building? Isn't that what mayors are supposed to do? And I should add the Supreme Court here in the United States has really narrowed the scope and the reach of our corruption laws over the last couple of decades. So I think what the U.S. attorney is trying to do is say this was a specific exchange of cash and other benefits in order -- in return for special favors.",

Here in the United States the rule that the Justice Department has adopted is they will not indict thesitting president, and of course the U.S. Supreme Court has told us that the president, when he's in office or after, can't be indicted for anything that has anything to do with the office. If there's consideration of should we have a rule for lower level officials, for governors, mayors, that kind of thing, there is no such immunity recognized in the law right now. I supposed it's possible that prosecutors could say it doesn't make sense to bring this charge right now, but I think the countervailing position is, well, if we have a mayor who's engaged in crime, voters need to know about that, the political apparatus needs to know about that, so that he can be removed.",

I think he's going to either have to be forced out or he's going tohave to lose the election in 2025, and you're right, it's an incredibly difficult situation. I mean, we here in the United States struggle with this situation. What do you do when you have an elected official who has been indicted? We just saw this two times in the U.S. Congress. George Santos, a member of the House from New York. He was indicted, but he wasn't thrown out of Congress. They can do that until after Congress did its own internal investigation. He was removed from Congress before he was ever convicted. Robert Menendez, a U.S. senator from New Jersey, actually prosecuted by the Southern District of New York, same office that's now prosecuting Eric Adams, he stayed in office throughout the pendency of his indictment. He was just convicted a month or two ago and then he resigned. So we do have this problem. We do have people sitting in powerful public office who are under indictment. You know, we have a presumption of innocence in the United States and if they don't want to resign, it's really hard to throw them out.",

But the reality is that probably it's impossible to remain as mayor and defend yourself properly against some very serious charges that will send you to prison for a long time if you get convicted. And so the ultimate question is whether or not he should have -- any prosecution should have been delayed? I'm not saying immunity. I'm not saying immunity. But I'm saying should it be postponed, any prosecution? But Elie Honig raised a good point, as indeed my producer. But could you delay something and he runs for reelection? Don't the public have a right to know that there are these charges pending? In other words, I don't really know the answer to it. It just seems to be all rather shabby all around. Here you have a mayor who can't do his job properly. Justice may be delayed or denied.
