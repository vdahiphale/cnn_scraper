Today, during a hearing on Capitol Hill, Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner Christopher Parrish revealed that two local law enforcement officers actually left a building that would have given them sight. They would have had a view of the roof where the would-be assassin ultimately fired from.",

That person, of course, turned out to be the 20-year-old gunman. Let's bring in Secret Service agent and CNN law enforcement analyst Jonathan Wackrow.Jonathan, thanks so much for being here with us. These are some wild new details that we're getting, which also included that local law enforcement, there were minutes from when they had spotted this suspect with a weapon and had communicated that. What do you make of all of these details we're getting? Because the Secret Service, the former Secret Service director said yesterday that she believed it had been seconds.",

So they, they got down because they were now at risk. And then very quickly, the shooter took aim and shot at former President Trump in the rally.I just want to read what we've learned from what Paris said. He said that if the first shots rang out at 18:11, 6:11 p.m., the hoisting up of the officer occurred probably no more again. I'm not going to give you a time, but I want to just put in the context of a sequence of events. I would say at most 2.5 to 3 minutes before the first shot rang out. Can you just explain to us the logistics of the officer sees the shooter gets a weapon pointed at him now realizes exactly what's going on. Is there one kind of I mean, on the radio, how are they communicating? Explain to us how this should have flowed.",

It should have gone out just that. Man with a gun at this location. That communication should have been understood by local law enforcement as well as all law enforcement stakeholders off of a unified network.That didn't happen, or it didn't happen to any reporting that we have because that would have been critical. You're talking about, you know, 120 180 seconds going by from the moment that that threat was identified to the moments that shot started being launched towards the former president. You know, that is almost eternity when it comes into the protective realm. There was enough time for that communication to go back and forth. And that's where we have to understand was where was that breakdown? Because if the president wasn't on stage or the president could have been removed quickly upon the initial identification of a threat, we could have avoided this tragic situation, but we didn't. And we have to understand where was that communication breakdown.",

The former president says the two will speak at Mar-a-Lago on Thursday. The Prime Minister is set to address Congress in Washington tomorrow and also meet privately with President Biden and Vice President Harris.Joining us now, CNN political commentator and former Defense Secretary under President Trump, Mark Esper. Secretary Esper, thanks so much for being here with us. Let's start first with this meeting between former President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu. Former President Trump reportedly very upset that Netanyahu had congratulated President Biden on his 2020 victory. What do you think of these two meeting and Trump agreeing to this meeting?",

Both have a political interest in meeting.Bibi Netanyahu, of course, to rebuild a rapport with President Trump in case he gets elected in November. He would have to, of course, deal with President Trump and his and his administration when he comes into power. And he knows he needs to make amends over a number of slights that President Trump has taken or apparently had taken from him. And I think President Trump, likewise, his political interest is to show support for the Israeli people and the country given, you know, the ongoing onslaught by Hamas, the challenges they have on the northern border with Hezbollah, and of course the big bad guy in the region, which is Iran. So, for these reasons, I think it's both in our mutual political interest to meet.",

He's playing the traditional attack dog role of going out there, and they're obviously going after her right now. But I think again for both of them, I think we're in a different situation.Many have been reporting the importance of this visit by Bibi Netanyahu was much more -- was much greater it was a few months ago when it was planned than what it is now. And in fact, the reporting is that many people in Israel think that just now is the time for him to leave the country that he should be back in Israel. So I think this meeting will come and happen. The address to Congress will come and happen. It will be curious, frankly, to see what he says. More importantly, I think politically, Jessica, is what will Kamala Harris say about Israel and its actions in Gaza? And will she strike a different tone or take a different approach than President Biden? She can't go too far. I think she has to, in my view, move more to the center away from the progressive left that wants to see them take a more detached position from Israel. But this is what I will be watching for closely in the coming days is how does she approach a U.S. policy toward Israel now that she's campaigning?",

Just take a look at this. Passengers having to go through this maze of luggage, almost as though they're looking for a lost pair of keys here trying to get reunited with their belongings. It is a frustrating mess.And at the crux of the problem here, Brianna, is Delta is saying that they were very reliant on Microsoft and some of the most delicate systems that they have, including systems for tracking crews where their pilots are, where their flight attendants are deeply intertwined with Microsoft to the point where they're having to repair and rebuild and reboot those systems by hand. And you were just seeing there in the second floor, where my photographer is at, even more luggage just keeps going and going and going. Listen to what passengers are saying. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)",
