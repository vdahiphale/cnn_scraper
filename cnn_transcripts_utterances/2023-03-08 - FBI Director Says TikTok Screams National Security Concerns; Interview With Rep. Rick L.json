I think the biggest concern here at the White House is the fact that this is a threat that isso multifaceted, as you just heard, as Senator Rubio goes down the line of everything from the Chinese government being able to potentially access data on Americans phones through this social media app, being able to also influence through the use of propaganda and the algorithms that the app utilizes basically, overarching, all of that is the concern that this TikTok app is owned by a Chinese company and that in China, there is no real division between the public and the private sector in terms of obtaining information from companies that operate inside of China. But I think what's interesting here, Richard, is what we're really seeing at the White House is a growing shift and a lot of momentum, not only here at the White House, but in Washington generally, towards taking more aggressive action as it relates to TikTok around all of this is the fact that there are rising tensions with China and this administration is coming under increasing pressure to act as it relates to this popular social media app. You know, there's been these ongoing negotiations between TikTok and CFIUS, which is the Committee on Foreign investment in the United States to try and find some kind of accommodation to this broader problem of Chinese ownership of this app, but those talks have yet to yield a deal more than two years later. And so what I'm told is that the White House in recent weeks, began working with bipartisan lawmakers to craft this very piece of legislation, which they then swiftly endorsed. The question now is do they use this as leverage right in those CFIUS talks with TikTok or do they choose to act unilaterally with these new powers that they could get?",

Now, he is the co-chair of the bipartisan US China Working Group and the Congressman is with me now. Sir, you hail from one of the most beautiful parts of the United States, up in the top left, as we might put it, and really at the top left over the border from Canada, but it is absolutely glorious. And if we look at this TikTok debate, I guess, how do you restrict the security threat without throwing the baby out with the bathwater? REP. RICK LARSEN (D-WA):   Well, I do think that the relationship between US and China needs to have some nuance to it, and the administration is right to ask for some flexibility with this legislation, because ultimately, dealing with TikTok is like dealing with China, it is a diplomatic relationship where you need the levers to be able to turn on and to turn off in order to shape behavior, whatever behavior that we might want to try to shape, as well as to use that leverage in order to get a stronger position and stronger advantage for the US. So I think, honestly, I think Congress historically has taken a harder line on China. I think that's a good thing. But I do think still, the relationship needs some nuance, because two largest economies in the world, two largest emitters in the world, two very large countries investing in technology, we're both going to be around a while, and there have to be avenues for diplomacy and discussion, while we're in a strategic competition with China.",

It would be supporting a country that does not respect sovereignty, that's counter to Chinese positions. It is counter to the Chinese position of an independent foreign policy. We need to show them that, so we need to show - - I think, we have the opportunities to show the Chinese government what the costs of actions are, and that is part of why the administration needs nuance -- needs some ability to show nuance, while also being firm about what our values and positions are in the US.",

This was the Georgian Parliament on the day the controversial foreign agent bill was debated. Lawmakers actually slapping each other amid scuffles forcing the session to end.

We are talking about accountability and transparency. CHANCE (voice over):   But Georgia has bitter experience of Moscow's meddling. CHANCE (on camera):   Well, there's been a lot of speculation about where the Russian troops are. Well, here they are, well inside Georgian territory. CHANCE (voice over):   Losing territory in a brief conflict with Russia back in 2008 now seen as a precursor of Russia's Ukrainian war.

Clearly the law, the draft law that has been presented, which I've announced that I would veto is a law that goes against all the principles that the European Union stands for, and that happens at a time when we are waiting for the decision on the candidate status that has been refused to Georgia a few months ago when it was given to Ukraine and Moldova.

So we promised our Ukrainian friends and partners that we will present so- called oral report in the first half of this year.

And currently, I can tell you that we are following very tight time schedule, but we will be ready to go live with our common purchase platform in a couple of weeks and we want to hit the global gas suppliers market in early May. So for the first time in the history of the European Union, we will be purchasing gas together, and I believe that this would increase not only security of supply for the European Union, but of course, what is very important for us, it will also push the energy prices down and gas prices down because we cannot sustain the situation that our economy is performing below its potential because of the high energy prices.",

One of the factors that is consistently pointed to as holding women back from progressing more rapidly in theworkforce is that they tend to, societally, bear a heavier share of family responsibilities. And there are policies that can help to redress the way that impacts their involvement with the labor market. You look at countries where childcare costs are low, where both men and women have access to parental leave on an equal basis, where there's greater flexibility in the workforce, those countries, these have all shown to narrow the gender gaps that we see in the labor market.",
