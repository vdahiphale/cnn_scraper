And that is why they feel that that is relevant. And they feel that that is ground to say that Donald Trump, therefore, is unfit to serve in that office again. But it's challenging for them to say the reason why this case is different, because then they have to go into the facts of that case to try to explain that.

We weren't there that long because it was getting late in the evening. So we just decided, OK, the first thing we're going to do is let's vote now. See how the count was. So we voted and it was six to six. Now, I don't believe that any of them were trying to change their minds or we weren't trying to change anybody's mind.

He did not want to press any charges against Hallie. And another thing that I also thought was they asked him, did you want your gun back? And he said, no, he did not want the gun back. When he said he did not want that gun back, and that gun sat in evidence for almost five years, I think that may have been what led to his downfall. Had he taken possession of that gun, I don't know if we would even have a trial. Because, you know, he may have sold the gun, got rid of the gun, sold it back to a gun shop or whatever. And, you know, it wasn't -- like it was sitting in evidence.

Surely something that's on its face on direct examination will seem to help her father. But prosecutors connected that to Hallie Biden's testimony about how she found the gun alongside drugs and drug paraphernalia on October 23rd.
