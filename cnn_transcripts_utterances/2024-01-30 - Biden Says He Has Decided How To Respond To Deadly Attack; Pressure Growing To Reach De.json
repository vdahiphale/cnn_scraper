He is good at comforting families who have lost a loved one. And so, he is expected to be there on Friday. We -- it remains to be seen whether the U.S. will have responded by then.

The broad strokes are this, a six week pause in the fighting that would see the release of civilian hostages from Gaza, followed by a perhaps a longer pause in the fighting that would also see the release of Israeli soldiers as well as the bodies of hostages who are also being held hostage in Gaza.But those are the broad strokes, the details are what may trip things up as we continue down this process. And officials who are involved in these talks have been cautioning that even though there is this broad framework, there is nonetheless the possibility of details getting in the way as we get forward, a lot of details to resolve. And the main sticking point, of course, is over whether or not this deal will actually lead to the end of the war between Israel and Hamas. So, the Israeli prime minister today making very clear that he will not agree to an end of the war until both objectives of that war have been reached. That is the return -- eliminating the Gaza Strip. Hamas for its part is seeking an end to the war. They say that they're reviewing this latest proposal, but they are doing so within the context of whether or not it will see the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip. So certainly, a lot to still be worked out and key meetings still ongoing.",

The question you're getting at is does you need Congressional authorization to take military action? In my view, right now, this is still very clearly within the self- defense framework. The Houthi specifically to attack U.S. targets, these militias in Iran have specifically attack U.S. targets. So, he's in self-defense mode.

But right now, they're getting all the benefit and no cost. They are attacking U.S. forces, they're, you know, supporting Hezbollah, supporting Hamas with no cost. We have to get them to change that calculation.And another key part of this what Iran wants more than anything is they want the U.S. out of the Middle East. Will we have to make clear to them as these sorts of attacks are going to have the opposite effect. We are going to need to be present, our Arab partners in the region like Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain are going to want us there, if they continue to see Iran as this type of threat.

I mean, look that the answer from former President Trump and others is you just got to hit him and hit him hard. And that'll make them change their mind. And I don't agree with that, because then they have to defend themselves. So, there's multiple things. One, you do have to make it clear that there's a cost for the sort of attacks. But we also have to make it clear that the Middle East is big enough for all of us. If Iran feels existential (INAUDIBLE) threatened, then they're going to hit back even harder. And another piece of this is the conflict in Gaza.If we continue down a path where there is no future for the Palestinians, that empowers Iran, because they argue that the Houthis and all of these other proxies are acting to defend the Palestinians. And that's not true. Iran is trying to exercise domination in the Middle East, that's why they've been messing in Lebanon, they're messing in Syria, they're messing in Yemen. But if they can use the Palestinians, that gives them an argument. So, your previous story about trying to get to some sort of resolution to the conflict in Gaza is crucial. And it's crucial the Prime Minister Netanyahu starts to pat -- and chart a path with the Palestinians have a future, saying that they don't, extends the conflict and empowers Iran.",

But when we talk about whether or not this war spreads, obviously, it has spread in some ways beyond -- beyond Gaza, with the Houthis and others. But understand, it could spread a lot more. And what the Pentagon and others in the White House are talking about is if Hezbollah decides to full on go to war with Israel, or if Iran decides to full on go to war with our forces, if Iran actually starts watching these attacks, instead of having their proxies do it, it could spread a lot wider and become a much bigger war.So, when the administration talks about containing, that's what they're talking about. Yes, this is a very dangerous situation that has spread beyond Gaza already.

We do know that the House, the Judiciary Committee has subpoenaed for documents regarding this investigation that was of course announced on the House floor just yesterday.So, what exactly does that mean, pertaining to this investigation? She's trying to make the case that that she did not misuse taxpayer dollars and that this is about campaign funds that were used to retain her husband's security firm, I guess he's a cute -- he has some security expertise instead appears to retain his services in regards to threats that she had received. She said that he has expertise, she said that it was below market value. It saved money to go this route. But there are still a lot of questions about the nature of all this.

And that it was President Biden who initially raised the issue first. Now that in and of itself would be an important headline. But we are also learning that the same assurance was repeated by China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, to Jake Sullivan, the President's National Security Adviser over the weekend when the two met in Bangkok.So, these are at least two instances we now know of where China is telling the U.S. at the senior most levels that China is not going to meddle in the U.S.'s 2024 presidential election. This is a topic we are told that has come up repeatedly in recent months when U.S. and Chinese officials have met. And I think the context, Brianna of that Biden-Xi meeting, you're showing footage from November, when the two met on the screen there. The context is really important, because that summit came at a moment when tensions between the two countries were historically high. And the reason for that summit was to try to sort of ease those tensions and put in place a sort of reset of sorts between the two countries. Now, we were told before that summit that this issue was likely to come up. So just a reminder that this has been an ongoing concern for U.S. officials, but just really notable that when the President raise it, that's President Biden, President Xi responded with the reassurance that China is not going to interfere rather than giving any kind -- any other kind of response that he could have, including just dismissing that concern from President Biden.",
