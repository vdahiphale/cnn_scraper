The FBI says that a group opened fire on these Americans eventually taking them captain.Now a U.S. official familiar with the investigation tells me this appears to be a case of mistaken identity, that law enforcement believed that group of cartel members mistook these Americans for Haitian drug smugglers. As far as why the Americans were there, a source tells me officials believe that they were there to obtain some type of medical procedure. Of course, it is not uncommon Americans and Canadians to travel to Mexico for example, for a lower cost prescription drugs, for lower cost medical procedures. That source told me that officials found inside the vehicle receipts indicating that there was some type of medical procedure that was planned. Now I want to show you this video. I'll warn our viewers that this is graphic. But you are about to see a source says this is the aftermath of the incident where you see gunmen taking a group of people, putting them in the back of this white truck. CNN cannot independently confirm that those individuals being loaded in the vehicle are indeed the Americans. But again, a source says that this is believed to be related to that incident. As far as where this goes next, the Mexican government says that all agencies within the federal government as well as state authorities are working with their U.S. partners in order to try to locate these Americans. The FBI has announced a $50,000 reward for information leading to the location of these Americans as well as the identification of their captors. Josh Campbell, CNN, Los Angeles.
