Obviously just goes to show how sensitive this matter is. But it is expected and there's a very good chance that the American reporter that gets chosen to ask a question to President Biden will very much ask about this given the gravity of this news.It's important to note that so far the White House has been incredibly careful in steering clear of commenting on the details, given that the DOJ is currently looking into the matter. So, we'll have to see whether the President is more willing to dive into the details and share anything more that we don't know. But again, you know, earlier today, just exemplifying this, the White House Counsel spokesperson said that they're just simply limited in what they can say right now because the DOJ is looking into the matter, but that they do want to handle things correctly and that they may be able to share further details at a later time. So, we'll see what question the President gets. And also, just more broadly speaking, of course, how he addresses the various issues that he has been discussing over the last 48 hours with the leaders of Canada, with the President of Mexico as we've been talking about for the last couple of days, of course, migration and immigration is going to be a top issue that the three leaders have been talking about at this Trilateral meeting.

CNN's Priscilla Alvarez is also in Mexico City for us.And Priscilla, what do we expect President Biden to say about the border and the humanitarian crisis at the border on the U.S. side? PRISCILLA ALVAREZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE REORTER: We expect him to echo the calls of his administration officials, which is that addressing migration requires regional partnership. Do we have seen mass movement of migrants across the Western Hemisphere, and they've landed at the U.S. doorstep, and that has been a growing political vulnerability for President Biden. And so, his administration has said that they need the assistance of regional partners and neighbors like Canada and Mexico, and they are rolling out measures to that effect. That includes, for example, a virtual portal where migrants can apply for legal pathways to the U.S. Mexico or Canada as a one stop shop, as well as a center in southern Mexico in a city that has been a transit city for migrants, where they can also receive services and information. Now, of course, Jake, migrants are often fleeing desperate conditions, and they're doing so urgently. So, it's unclear at this point how viable these options are going to be for them. I spoke to a senior administration official, I asked that question, and the official said it's an experiment, but it is necessary because they are seeing a lot of movement and they are trying to find ways in which migrants can make these pathways and use them in an accessible way. So, of course, we're going to hear from President Biden on this and see what commitments they have made, the three of them, to really address this growing issue in the region. Jake.",

That has been the growing call from the administration, to have migrants stay in place and apply to come to the U.S. from there. Now, I also spoke to an official from the United Nations who said, look, these are great measures, but will they be able to help migrants who are at high risk? And is there going to be a move by the administration to keep migrants from claiming asylum at the U.S. Mexico border as they have always been able to do? So there are still a lot of questions.This is a portal that is still being worked on. It's underway and will take several months to roll out. So a lot of questions still unanswered, but of course, it's just part of that broader effort by the administration to engage all of the region.",

It was discovered, they called the Archives, the Archives retrieved it. That was their part of the picture.On the political front, though, I mean Republicans on the other side are gleeful about this. They say that it kind of inoculates them in some ways from the Trump argument, even though these cases actually really are radically different.

The question becomes, OK, if they're going to apply the law equally to everyone and these policies equally to everyone, what are you going to do about Donald Trump, particularly knowing that there's an ongoing investigation that -- where there's more we may learn.DIAZ-ROSILLO: Jake, I think this issue screams hypocrisy on both sides. Democrats have been very quick to downplay the situation, to say it's not a big deal, to highlight the differences between both cases. But there are a lot of similarities. And while I cannot comment on the legal differences because I'm not a legal expert, on the political side, there are a lot of similarities, and I think you use the right word, inoculate.

You know, George Santos may not even be a member of Congress by the time these investigations conclude. But one thing I do want to point out, the reason that Democratic lawmakers had to kind of directly go or decided to directly go to the House Ethics Committee is that part of the rules package that House Republicans passed this week, it kind of weakens the Office of Congressional Ethics, which performs that preliminary ethics investigation before it's referred to the House Ethics Committee.

I mean, this is just one area that's been impacted. Last night really was Southern California yesterday and last night. Santa Barbara, 4.2 inches. The rainiest, January on record. In fact, the fourth wettest day in history and records go back in 1941. San Luis Obispo, just over 4 inches. The rainiest day in history. Eight days a week ago, last Saturday, we had Oakland with its wettest day in history. But east of Santa Barbara. This is incredible. San Marcos, couldn't believe it when they hit a foot of rainfall in the past. And here in the Valley then about 16.5 inches. If you look at Even Ventura, Jake, Ventura River rose 17 feet in 12 hours, reaching an all-time crest of 25 feet. If you look at the system now, it's spreading into the Central Rockies. They've got problems there as well. But now the next one moves into Northern California, and we're going to see wave after wave of this. 90 percent of the state is under some sort of watch.

This is going to be mainly Wednesday into Thursday central areas to the north. But if you look at the forecast and all the rain and the mountain snows out west, the parade of storms continues. Here's the California coastline. You see the storms spinning to the north. That's where the winds are stronger, but they're lining up. It looks like, to take care of this drought, we need more than weeks of this. We need seasons of this rain. It's a mega drought, but the next ones that move in after tomorrow, I think it's going to be late Friday night and Saturday will be the next real potent one after tomorrow.

There are also satellite images from the outskirts of Beijing, where that crematorium image shows a brand-new parking lot was even constructed on the crematorium grounds. Now, when I visited another crematorium in the city center of Beijing, I did see a long line of cars myself waiting to get in, a very crowded parking lot, and yellow body bags piling up in metal crates and workers loading more of them in.

There is no record of her getting in a car or getting on a plane, and it was not reported missing until January 4th. Brian Walshe is now in custody. He's charged with misleading police.

How to dispose of a 115-pound woman was another. Walshe was also seen on surveillance video on January 2, buying $450 worth of cleaning supplies at a Home Depot.

So the state court would have to request that information from the federal court. Whether or not they do that via a warrant or a request is up to how they do it.
