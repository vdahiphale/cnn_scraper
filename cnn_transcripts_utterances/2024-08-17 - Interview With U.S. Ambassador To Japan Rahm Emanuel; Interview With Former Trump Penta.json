Vice President Kamala Harris ended this week by unveiling her economic vision for the country after appearing with President Biden for the first time since he stepped aside. The president's planned DNC speech won't be just an endorsement of Harris, but rather a passing of the torch. And this matters here overseas as whoever wins in November inherits a checklist of daunting geopolitical dilemmas. Turmoil in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine, and the growing threat from the anti-U.S. axis of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. Would Harris take her lead from Biden or chart a new path for America on the world stage? Known for his tough stance on China, Rahm Emanuel is a career Democrat politician and for the past several years, a diplomat as the U.S. Ambassador to Japan. He was White House chief of staff under President Obama, and he is the former mayor of Chicago. So I asked him to weigh in on the successes and failures of President Biden's foreign policy and what the world could expect of a Kamala Harris presidency. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)",

RAHM EMANUEL, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN: I do believe that -- I mean, Kamala -- Vice President Harris will build -- you don't just continue. You build off of it. And I'll give you one anecdote. She was here for former Prime Minister Abe's funeral, and she had a private meeting with Prime Minister Kishida. Those were the early days when we were beginning to just scratch out this lattice work architecture. There hadn't been yet a trilateral with Korea. There hadn't yet been even the concept of the trilateral with the Philippines. So she has put what I would call sweat equity into something right now that's standing the test of time. Just two weeks ago, Canada, the United States, Australia, the Philippines did a naval exercise in the islands. That is coalition building. China isolated, Philippines standing with allies -- Canada, Australia, and the United States. And she was an early, literally shaper of that clay, shaper of the strategy, and came in and traveled here many times and put the miles. You've got to keep investing in it and strengthening it.

Russia finally proved what we've been saying for decades. True. I do think that the threat to Ukraine, if something were to happen to Ukraine, President Putin would not stop. He would not stop at Georgia. He would not stop at Moldova. He would not stop. Ukraine's sovereignty, Ukraine's independence, Ukraine's desire to be as a people repeatedly have gone to the streets to be part of the West. Their aspiration to be part of something, the economic opportunity, the freedom that the -- that the West offers as a political principle is something that people have sacrificed, not only on the military battles, but also on the political battles they see a future that's more promising to the West. They've also seen, when Poland joined the West, how much economic prosperity has happened to Poland as opposed to what's happened to Ukraine. They want to be a part of that, and that's worth defending. We have defended that repeatedly in our history.

And the reason the United States is for a negotiated agreement. You look at the history of Israel, there's three tracks as it relates. Israel has tried a negotiated track. You've seen that with Egypt. You've seen it with Jordan. You've seen it with the Abraham Accords. The negotiated track has delivered both security, as well as an acceptance for Israel into the wider (ph) region. And those peace agreements with those three, Egypt in the late 70s, Jordan in the early 90s under President Clinton, the Abraham Accords under President Trump have delivered security, delivered economic opportunity, and delivered a regional acceptance. The other option Israel's tried is unilateral, both in Lebanon and in Gaza, and that's led to Hamas and Hezbollah. The other option, the third option, which is divorce, which they've tried with the West Bank. There's only one option that's delivered security and opportunity and a regional acceptance. And that's negotiated. What I find now, which is most promising, and I don't think -- I'm not an optimist usually, I'm kind of cold, kind of pragmatist about this, is that there are many forces now for stability and for regional security that didn't exist. Gulf countries and neighbors to Israel in the Arab Israeli border. They want stability because it's important for their own economic development. Instability, mainly driven by Iran and their surrogates, is the force here. But Israel, for the first time, has partners and allies who are seeking quiet, they're seeking stability, seeking kind of overall strategic alignment so economic growth and political growth can happen. That's a big difference. And one that I think accrues to Israel's historic interests is not only economic growth, but political acceptance in the region.",

But I think I look at two things in particular. One is the record of results, you pointed to a few things.But if you compare President Trump's record from 2017 and 2021 the last four years, I think any sensible person would say things were a lot better under the Trump administration. You've had the largest war in Europe since the Second World War. It's not going well. You've had the largest attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Youve had the Houthis attack. And you mentioned North Korea -- the Biden administration, the situation has gotten a lot worse and the military buildup from China has also gotten worse. What you call Trump-proofing, I call allies kind of getting the memo. I mean what I see from the Biden-Harris administration is a wild disconnect between rhetoric and reality. I mean, endless highfalutin discussion of the rules-based international order and no limits to Americans commitments. And then, you know, a Defense budget that isn't even rising. And on a trajectory to potentially a multi-front war. \"The New York Times\" was just reporting China and Russia's military cooperation is deepening. Avril Haines has said we have to be worried about Russia helping China in the event of a Taiwan conflict. And the Biden administration itself has said, Xi Jinping has ordered the PLA to be ready for an attack on Taiwan by 2027 and a larger war with the United States. So we're heading towards the iceberg and I think if we continue on the current trajectory, we're going to ram right into it.

One, China is clearly our biggest rival so, you know, and the nature of our priority is you've got to -- and it's all relative. We're doing better than we were 5, you know, 10 years ago. But Chinas really -- you know, China's got 200 times the shipbuilding capacity of the United States. They're actively working to improve their military forces for something -- it could be in the coming years, God forbid. So that's -- that's got to be our primary rival.Second Europe -- Asia is now the world's primary theater. It's the primary market area. It's going to be upwards of 50 percent of global GDP. Europe remains important, but its less important. And the European economies, Germany alone is a larger economy than Russia, whereas in Asia there, they're outweighed. So that's -- that's the situation. Russia, I think there's a lot of sort of extreme dialogue or sort of discussion on one side or the other, either that Russia is 1945 Joseph Stalin or it's a joke. I think the Russians are a serious threat. I don't think it would be in our interest for Ukraine to be totally occupied but the Russians are making incremental progress in eastern Ukraine. My solution to this, getting back to what we were just saying, is really letting your Europeans get know and get the memo that you know you've to take the lead in supporting Ukraine. I'm in favor of supporting Ukraine. It's just got to be done by them. We have to fix our situation, which is much more consequential and dangerous in the Western Pacific and we have to recognize the reality of scarcity. And that's what I don't see at all. In fact, if I look at Vice President Harris, I say to myself, it's completely absent from the dialogue. Whereas I think President Trump is saying, we may be on the verge of World War III. I think God Forbid, that's correct. The right way to handle that is strength, yes. But also realism about our situation, and using our military sparingly as the platform says.",

This was high art. When we look at the visual arts, the numbers of great American artists who have simply been erased, who were ignored because gatekeepers deemed their work not worthy of fine art. These are ways in which hierarchical systems more broadly in society manifest in the arts. And the arts are important, Christiane, because they tell us who we are. They are the soundtrack for who we are as a people. And unfortunately, for far too long in American history, that soundtrack has not been full. It has not reflected the rich diversity of our culture of our society.",

Since the U.S. Pulled out August 2021, girls have again been banned from schools beyond sixth grade and barred from universities. They can't play sports or even visit parks. Their movements are restricted and job opportunities are limited. There are no more women in politics or positions of influence. U.N. Women says the most striking trend since the Taliban regained control is the attempt to erase these women from public life, which I witnessed firsthand when I was in Kabul shortly after the takeover, reporting on the devastating impact of the Taliban's rule on women's lives.

You have said they have to wear a face mask if they're on television, women. Why? \"It's advisory from the ministry,\" he says. But what does that mean? Is it compulsory? \"If it is said, they should wear it. It will be implemented as it is in our religion too,\" says Mujahed. \"It is good if it's implemented.\" Afghan women are afraid that this is the beginning of your efforts to erase them from the workspace. They're afraid that, if they wear the mask, the next thing you will say is their voice cannot be heard publicly. What is your response to that? \"Like during COVID,\" he says, \"masks were mandatory. Women would only be wearing hijab or masks and they will continue their work.\" He seems to say that, if women wear this, they can go to work. But the dress code edicts, like saying female university students must now wear black, not colored head scarves, is an escalating war of nerves, and everyone fears where this will lead. Back at TOLOnews, these female anchors are distraught. \"What should we do?\" cries Tahmina. \"We don't know. We were ready to fight to the last to perform our work, but they don't allow us.\" \"We women have been taken hostage,\" says Hilah (ph). \"Women can't get themselves educated or work, like me, who's worked on screen for years and couldn't leave Afghanistan. Due to the fear of the Taliban, I can't go on screen again.\" Since the Taliban takeover, the station has employed even more women than before, because they need a safe space. And as for the actual journalism TOLOnews is Afghanistan's leading independent news channel. But Director Sapai says they will all quit the day the Taliban pressures them to tailor their coverage or lie to a public that's come to trust the truth they have been delivering over 20 years. He's saved the station so far, recruiting a whole new staff, after most employees fled the Taliban's arrival.",
