      "sentences": "Well, this is something that is deeply personal to Prince Harry. He has, of course, been very vocal on wanting to reform media practices, invasion of privacy. And he is now among more than 100 claimants suing the Mirror Group Newspapers over allegations that they published articles between 1991 to 2011, featuring both personal details, personal information solicited through unlawful means and invasion of privacy, mainly through phone hacking.Now Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, has been selected among four representative claimants to give evidence. Now the court here behind me is going to be hearing these claims over the next three days. It's unclear which of these days Prince Harry will appear in the stands to give evidence. But of course, this is something that he has been very vocal about. And we've already heard from the Mirror Group Newspapers. They've contested these allegations. They say that their senior editors were not aware of any wrongdoing at the time of these claims. And in fact, they say that some of these claims have been brought too late to be considered by the court. But this is a case which featured more than 100 claimants. Very notable figures, celebrities, sports stars, other notable high-profile figures including Prince Harry. Who all allege that the Mirror Group Newspapers invaded their privacy in order to publish these details featuring personal information. Now course, Prince Harry has expressed that he wishes to settle this. And of course, he doesn't want to settle, he wants to see this through. He wants to see a reform of media practices for those responsible to be held accountable. He's been very vocal in the past, in his book \"Spare,\" in his Netflix documentary and other interviews about his feelings towards the media and that invasion of privacy. Particularly, of course, over how this has impacted his own mental health, that of his wife Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex. And of course, crucially that of his late mother Princess Diana. So, this is a hugely personal issue. But Prince Harry will be in the stands with a very different environment of what we have seen in the past where he has given interviews to perhaps people he is more familiar with and more comfortable circumstances. He will face questioning and cross- examination during this court hearing. When he does give evidence, the concern, of course, potentially for the royal family there could be revealing of further personal details not only his personal reasons for that, of royal family as well.",
