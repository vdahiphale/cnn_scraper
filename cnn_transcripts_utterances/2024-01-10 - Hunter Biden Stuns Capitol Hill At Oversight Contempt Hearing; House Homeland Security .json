So, this showdown really has been brewing for months between Republicans and Hunter Biden, the President's son.

Listen, Hunter Biden is fighting two criminal cases already that have been filed against him. He certainly doesn't want to have a third for contempt of Congress.And I think perhaps Jamie Raskin set it out best in his five minutes or so of talking during the hearing. He has not failed to comply with this subpoena. Not only did he show up today, but his lawyers have been negotiating in good faith about the appearance since he obtained the subpoena. So it would be completely unprecedented for DOJ to proceed with a criminal case here. And I just think Hunter Biden and his team wanted to really put the nail in that coffin that he should not be criminally charged here no matter what happens, no matter whether DOJ handles this as it normally would, or whether they decide to refer this to Hunter Biden's special counsel, David Weiss for resolution.",

But then when it comes to the question of whether someone can be criminally charged for contempt of Congress, that's not what DOJ will consider.What DOJ will consider is whether there was good faith negotiations, whether the witness completely blew off the subpoena, failed to negotiate at all, just denied it altogether, as in the case of the two people who actually were charged with contempt of Congress, Steve Bannon and -- I'm forgetting his name, Larry, the economic adviser to former president Trump because they just refuse to even negotiate at all. So when you're looking at the criminal standard, it's not quite, well, Congress gets to have it the way they want it. And if you don't comply with their demands, you know, you potentially go to prison. It's a different standard. If you negotiate at all in good faith, at least that's how DOJ has considered it in the past, then you will not be criminally charged. So there's just no basis under this set of facts for Hunter Biden to be charged, but I think DOJ will, as they always do, take a referral from Congress and give it some thought at least before coming forward with their decision.",

Really unusual for someone who's the defendant to do that.And the judge said yes. And at that time, in documents we just got from the court, the judge wrote, he may not seek to introduce new evidence, he may not testify, he may not comment on irrelevant matters. In particular and without limitation, he may not deliver a campaign speech. And then laid out to his attorneys, those are the rules. And if he doesn't follow them, I'll cut him off. I could find him. I could do a bunch of things as the judge presiding in this courtroom. And then in these documents that we just got, there was a back and forth where the attorneys weren't willing to agree to these terms because they said Trump wasn't willing to agree to these terms. They then tried to bring the death of Melania Trump's mother into play into this and postpone the closing arguments. They asked the judge, oh, we're not meeting your deadlines. We don't have an answer for you. Can we postpone the closing arguments? He's not going to be in court tomorrow. And then the judge said, those are the terms. I'm not going to move the closing argument. If he wants to be there, he can. His attorneys came back and said, OK, he will speak tomorrow. And they still wouldn't agree to these terms that the judge is setting. And so at that point, that's when the judge said, that's it. You can either take this offer that I'm giving you as the judge or leave it. You have until noon today -- so that's today -- to tell me if he agrees to this. They never responded according to these documents. And so now the judge is laying it down and saying, it's over. You didn't agree, and so he's not going to speak.",

And they've come to adopt Donald Trump despite and because of some of his troubles.But that's always what we look at in Iowa is where are the evangelical voters going? Because they're the ones who provide the search for Cruz, Santorum, Huckabee. Could that provide a search for somebody like Vivek? And maybe he's the surprise and maybe Haley or Huckabee ends up fourth. I mean, the traditional notion is there are three tickets out of Iowa. So we'll see those three are going to be.",

Someone is going to try to say they are the alternative to Donald Trump. And if Nikki Haley were to finish second, Rick Santorum is basically over. He would likely get out of the race and allow Haley to have her one on one shot.And so, you know, the same, Haley wants to get as close to second as she can. A strong third would be fine because she's betting all of her cards on New Hampshire and then South Carolina. So, you know, momentum really, really matters. And then a bunch of candidates are going to go away the next morning. People like Asa Hutchinson, probably Vivek and other folks who just aren't going to get one of the three golden tickets.",
