So, the idea that he's going to come up short on $500 million is embarrassing to him.And it goes to the point of why he then is lashing out on Truth Social in a way that actually impacts him by saying I do have the cash now or I almost have the cash. Then you see his lawyer stepping in say, no, no, no, we don't have the cash. Remember the argument is that it's impossible to get this kind of money. Now, there is a kernel of truth when you're talking to these financial experts who say it is very difficult to come up with that kind of cash no matter how rich you are. People just aren't that liquid. The other part of this is that it's an unprecedented amount. So, these underwriters are saying, no, not just because it's Donald Trump, but because they've never had to put up that kind of a bond before. They were saying they would do $100 million but not $400 million or $500 million. But again, this all goes to the core of who he is. And you're going to see that today. I assume he'll go to the cameras. I assume he'll start talking about, at some point, that money, that bond, and how he thinks this is unfair.",

So she would move forward to potentially seize either cash assets or buildings and properties.But he has appealed not only the decision itself, but also the amount of bond that he needs to post. We don't expect to get a decision on that today. His lawyers have argued that it shouldn't be this much, right, to secure this verdict while the appeal goes forward. But he has long said, even before the decision came down from the judge, that he would appeal because he believes that there was no victim in the civil fraud case. He argued that it was politically motivated, it's unprecedented and it's unclear how exactly they would prevail. There's no real factual dispute that the appeals court could look at and really glom onto to overturn that. So, it's not expected that he will prevail in that appeal, but he certainly has the right to do so.",

And so the conversations that were being had at a high level were, is somebody going to go on his behalf and say, will you put up this money? How is this going to look? For people who know him and have worked with him before say Donald Trump himself doesn't want to be the one to ever ask for the money. It's embarrassing to him.So, these conversations were having - happening as to how exactly this would come to be, if it came from a wealthy donor. And again, as you said, the morning has come and gone. We have been given no indication that he is pulling a rabbit out of his hat. And what you're starting to see now is online you're seeing all these conservative personalities saying, in part what you said, which is, this is going to help him politically, but also just how unfair this is.

He's got to get past the matador. And every single opening and vulnerability in his character is being poked at by a legal system. He's disrespectful toward women. The defamation case comes in. He's loose with the rules when it comes to documents. OK, you've got the Florida case coming in. You've got, you know, his - you know, frankly, business swindling, for lack of a better term, effect, that's coming into case. Every single aspect of his personality that makes him unfit for office and anybody else would be in jail or broke is now coming down on him. And he's got to face them all at the same time.And so from his point of view, I'm sure it's a nightmare but it's a nightmare of his own making. He's the person that wants to go back into the White House. He's the person that wants to flout all these rules.

I'm going to tell you right now, I've never had a client or anybody who want - who wanted to go to court when they didn't have to go to court. Donald Trump wants to be there because he believes that by presenting himself as a martyr for his own cause, that actually strengthens him. And so far it looks like it's working. And so you literally have two different movies happening at the same time with the same characters. In one movie, whenever you see Donald Trump, its scary movie, like a horror show. In another movie we see Donald Trump it's a heroic movie. Like, you know, he's, you know, a superman for the right. So, this is what we're dealing with.
