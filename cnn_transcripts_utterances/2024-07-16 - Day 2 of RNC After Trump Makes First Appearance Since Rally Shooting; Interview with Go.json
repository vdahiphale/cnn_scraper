It's day two of the RNC, as Republicans rally in support of Donald Trump following an attempted assassination. The theme for night two of the RNC, crime and security, a theme that obviously takes on added meaning less than 72 hours after Trump was nearly killed.Joining us now from the Republican National Convention is the Republican governor of Georgia. Governor, a pleasure to have you with us. One of the themes for tonight, the second night of the RNC, is going to be party unity. You're going to have folks like former Governor Nikki Haley, Governor Ron DeSantis, folks that have disparaged President Trump during the primary process, go up there and essentially say that he deserves to be president once more. You personally have had a fraught relationship with former President Trump. He vowed at one point to end your political career. I'm wondering if you've spoken to him recently. GOV. BRIAN KEMP (R-GA): No, I haven't spoken to him recently, but listen, I do think people are unifying in the party. I think you'll see a lot of that tonight. I think you've seen a lot of that since Saturday. But I've told a lot of people, too, I've been seeing that really over the last several weeks or months and certainly since the debate in Atlanta. I think everybody, the closer you get, the more, but really both parties normally unify. We're certainly seeing a big split on the Democratic side right now, but I think Republicans are unifying for one reason. We can't afford four more years of Joe Biden.",

It really shows the true fabric of our country. And I hope as the campaign moves on, you know, we'll continue to see that that spirit and, you know, fight hard and campaign hard and go to the ballot box with, you know, vigor for your candidate.

And I think it's incumbent on all of us to really be careful about what we're saying, but also be graceful and forgiving to people.You know, if they have a slip of the tongue and say something like it's going to be a blood bath or, you know, we need to put them in the crosshairs, meaning we need to focus on them, not shoot them. You know, we got to be realistic too in this world that, you know, everybody's fighting for their position hard. Let's just be respectful and let's make this election about policy. I personally think if Donald Trump does that, if he speaks to the future and tells people what we're for the chairman of the party, Mike Whatley said the same thing. It's an opportunity for Republicans this week to tell people that are undecided why they should vote for us on policy issues. Now is the time to do that.",

BOB MENENDEZ (D-NJ): Obviously, I'm deeply, deeply disappointed by the jury's decision. I have every faith that the law and the facts did not sustain that decision and that we will be successful upon appeal. I have never violated my public oath. I have never been anything but a patriot of my country and for my country. I have never, ever been a foreign agent.

We found guilty as well as helping the government of Egypt all while he was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Certainly significant. Now, this won't automatically remove Senator Menendez from the Senate. That is something the Senate would have to choose to do.

He's also expected to frame Trump as a candidate who can best unite the country during his speech at the RNC.We're joined now by Dr. Ben Carson. He served as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development during the Trump administration. Dr. Carson, a pleasure to have you on. Thanks for joining us. There were a lot of folks in those groups that Vivek Ramaswamy wants to address tonight. Black voters, younger voters, immigrants that in the first Trump administration felt alienated and felt attacked. What do you think the former president needs to do to bring those voters in and to better address their concerns in a potential second Trump administration? DR. BEN CARSON, FORMER HUD SECRETARY DURING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION: Well, I think one of the reasons that you see a lot of minority people moving toward Trump is because they saw in the Trump administration that he tended to believe that a rising tide floats all boats and he didn't necessarily pick one group and pick them against another group in terms of benefits for them. So I think people are starting to appreciate that. And I'm very hopeful that people on all sides will begin to realize that we're all Americans and stop trying to divide us on the basis of race, age, income, gender, political affiliation, religion.
