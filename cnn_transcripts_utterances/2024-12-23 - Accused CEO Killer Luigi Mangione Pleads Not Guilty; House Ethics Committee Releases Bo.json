And the press knew he was coming into the heliport because when they asked, they were told. The NYPD policy is you neither encourage nor discourage the photographing of defendants in public areas.As for today's perp walk, so to speak, that was because they had to go get him from federal courthouse and bring him into the courthouse, into the courtroom. Normally, if he had been in state custody, they would have had him in the cell block. He would have come in from the side door. You wouldn't have seen any of that outside the courtroom. So today was much more about logistics than last week's. And last week's did have a purpose. And it was to show if you commit allegedly an assassination on the streets of New York City, you will be found and you will be brought to justice. And I think that's why the mayor and so many others were there, to show that this case was being brought to justice.",

That is the bottom line where they are able to say then they believe through witness testimony that they've taken, through text messages, through tracing payments that they believe Matt Gaetz engaged in commercial sex.So paying for sex, engaged in statutory rape, having sex with a then girl, a 17-year-old heading into her senior year of high school, having sex with her twice at a party in July of 2017 and then her receiving $400 in cash. They believe that that's statutory rape under Florida law. And then also that Matt Gaetz, while he was a sitting member of Congress, was taking illicit drugs. One of the things that the Committee writes is they document how many women spoke to them, how many people testified, including that alleged 17-year-old victim, quote, \"Many of the women interviewed by the Committee were clear that there was a general expectation of sex. One woman who was paid more than $5,000 by Representative Gaetz between 2018 and 2019 told the Committee that 99% of the time that they were hanging out there was sex involved. So all of this is being put together. The details here are quite specific. Not just about that party in July of 2017 where Gaetz was having sex with the 17-year-old, but also a trip to the Bahamas he was taking with adult women who were being reimbursed for traveling with him. So all of this is being put together. And Gaetz in response has went to court this morning. His lawyers and he had been denying the allegations against him that the Committee was finding. He tried to stop the release of the report that was unsuccessful. And we're waiting to hear if he has anything else to say in court to a judge who is now looking at this as well.",

Indeed, nearly every woman that the Committee spoke with could not remember the details of at least one or more of the events they attended with Representative Gaetz and attributed that to drug or alcohol consumption. Now, a very important reminder here. Gaetz was investigated by the Justice Department for sex trafficking. He was not charged. The Justice Department did not charge him with any crime. He has not been charged with any crime in the state of Florida.

In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted. The three inmates who will remain on death row are Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Dylann Roof and Robert Bowers, the men who are respectively behind the Boston Marathon bombing, the shooting at Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston and also the shooting at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. Now Biden, in the first year of his term, suspended federal executions. And activists have been warning the White House of a potential spree of executions once President Elect Donald Trump retakes office. The move also, though, represents an evolution of Biden's own views on the death penalty as well as the party's more broadly. Biden staunchly supported the death penalty at earlier points in his career. But the Democratic Party is not universally supportive of this move, some criticizing the President for appearing soft on crime and also appearing to challenge the authority of the judicial system. Here is one of those critics, House Democrat Mike Quigley earlier today on CNN. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. MIKE QUIGLEY, (D) ILLINOIS: It's concerned with how presidents handle pardons and how they handle commutations for their own reasons, their own personal reasons. And back to the pardoning of his own son, I heard people say, well, it's the love of a father, I get that.

I really appreciate it. I want to start here because I know this is an issue you're passionate about. Why did you praise this decision by the President today?REP. AYANNA PRESLEY, (D) MASSACHUSETTS: Well, mass incarceration is a crisis in this country. It has been for decades. Clemency -- our broken clemency process is one of the reasons why we have a mass incarceration crisis. We have in the office of the parting attorneys a backlog of some 10,000 individuals. That's 10,000 families. And so I've commended the President for having the authority and using it, using it in the 39 pardons and the 1,500 commutations for those on home confinement. And today, this decision to commute the sentences of those on death row to life sentences without parole. State sanctioned murder is not justice. It is not a deterrent for crime. It does not -- it is not support healing. It is not compassionate of our peer nations. We are an anomaly when it comes to the inhumane and barbaric practice of the death penalty. And moreover, in Trump's first administration, he executed more people in the final days of his presidency than have been executed in the last six decades. So we have every reason to believe that that's what he would do for those that in an expedited way, those currently on death row. So President Biden's action today is in keeping with the promise he made when he was pursuing the presidency. He's long been opposed to the federal death penalty. He gave me his word that he would not execute anyone on his watch. He honored that, and today he took it a step further.",

Every victim that's been impacted by violence deserves a pathway to healing, to justice and to accountability.And in fact, I have a bill that was signed into law by President Biden that supports survivors that have been impacted by domestic terrorism and other such crises to be able to access behavioral and mental health services. Again, the death penalty has been -- has not been proven to be a deterrent of crime. State sanctioned murder is not justice. And today what President Biden did demonstrated moral leadership, compassionate leadership informed by his own faith, and a position that held for a very long time. And again, when it comes to our pure nations, we are an anomaly in this inhumane and barbaric practice which is fundamentally flawed. This broad and diverse coalition momentum has continued to grow to abolish the federal death penalty throughout this country. Interfaith groups, activists, advocates and survivors of families that have been impacted. I've also met many exonerees who are part of this movement. Death row exonerees, because one in 25 on death row are innocent. So wherever you fall on the issue of the death penalty, one thing is for sure is that whether or not people think it's fair or unfair, it has not been applied fairly.
