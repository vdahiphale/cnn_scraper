In a way that we really haven't seen since the end of Title 42.In an interview with a dozen or so migrants here in the El Paso area today, they gave us a variety of reasons for why they were choosing to cross this way. Some were clearly victims of disinformation, being told that it was safe and OK to cross. Others say that they were just simply desperate and tired of waiting on the Mexican side of the border.

As CNN's Fareed Zakaria spoke exclusively with the Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi about the deal with the U.S. and here's part of their conversation.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) EBRAHIM RAISI, IRANIAN PRESIDENT (through translator): We did something that was prompted by humanitarian motives and those individuals who were imprisoned in the United States, whom up to the point that we were informed, our information indicated that they were unjustly imprisoned. But the folks who were imprisoned in Iran, they had committed crimes and their complaints had gone through the legal system and there were condemned. And there was an opportunity for this exchange to take place. And this exchange was, as I said, prompted by purely humanitarian motives. (END VIDEO CLIP)",

And yet, it's emerging as a key transit point for supplies to the rapid support forces in Sudan, part of an expansion of Russia's influence in Africa.ELBAGIR (voice-over): Cross-referencing testimony from intelligence and military sources active in the region with satellite imagery, CNN has uncovered evidence that Wagner arms crossed through Chad within the last two weeks to get to an RSF military base in Sudan. If you look closely, you can see over a hundred vehicles including scores of trucks at the base, proof the supplies provided by Russia, Wagner, continue. A strike on Wagner-backed forces in Sudan would constitute a blow to Moscow. If it is Ukraine, they will have raised the stakes for those willing to accept Wagner's backing in the future, a lesson illustrating the price they could be forced to pay for cooperating with Russia.
