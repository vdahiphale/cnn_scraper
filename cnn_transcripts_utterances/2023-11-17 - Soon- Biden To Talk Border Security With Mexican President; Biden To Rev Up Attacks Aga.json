And we have new CNN reporting this hour about the Biden reelection campaign strategy as they prepare for the probability of another race against Donald Trump.Plus, George Santos's days on Capitol Hill may be numbered. A growing number of his fellow Republicans say they're ready to expel him. And it's a list that now includes the chairman of the House Ethics Committee, which investigated him. So, will Santos stay or fight or call it quits. And the IDF says it has proved that Hamas was operating underneath a hospital complex. Israeli forces are raiding in northern Gaza. We're going to go to Israel for reporting on that. I'm Dana Bash. Let's go behind the headlines at INSIDE POLITICS. We start with President Biden heading home today from the Asia-Pacific economic summit. He's got one big meeting left with the Mexican president. And it's a meeting that could have some major domestic political implications. CNN Senior White House Correspondent MJ Lee is in San Francisco. Obviously, the crisis at America southern border -- at the U.S. southern border is going to be key, MJ?",

And needless to say there are going to be a number of urgent issues for the two presidents to discuss. A chief among them is going to be the migrant situation at the U.S. southern border.Obviously, this is an issue that has been incredibly politically fraught for the president back in Washington D.C. with Republicans and even some Democrats expressing concerns about the administration's handling of this issue. We also expect the two leaders to discuss the fentanyl crisis as well. And that in the context of what we saw happen over the last few days is particularly notable because of course, this was a major issue that came up between President Biden and Chinese President Xi, with that major announcement on efforts to crack down on chemicals used to make fentanyl. So, we expect this is going to be an issue that these two leaders discussed today as well. Now just this morning, Dana, the president did sign the government funding bill. This was flown out to California for him to sign but not included and that of course was funding for Israel and Ukraine. So, this is just one major issue and one of many issues that the president is now returning home to in Washington, D.C. Dana?",

And here we have a group of excellent reporters to discuss all of it and more CNN's David Chalian, CNN's Audie Cornish, CNN's Gloria Borger. Hello. Nice to see you wonderful humans on this Friday.Let's start with the New Hampshire numbers. So yesterday, you revealed on the show, the Republican side of new CNN reporting of what's going on in New Hampshire. That is, I think, a more robust race. I had to say that well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't. But what was revealed or released today were Democrats in New Hampshire and how they feel. And you'll explain why it's not actually a straight question because it's complicated about how there will be a primary or whether it'll be a primary. So, it's asked about a Biden write-in 65 percent, Dean Phillips 10 percent, Marianne Williamson 9 percent. Let's just start with that sort of topline of how Democrats in New Hampshire feel, particularly about Joe Biden.",

I mean, I'd say Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson is not getting so much traction on the guy who actually won't even be on the ballot, as you know, Biden changed the rules of the game for the Democrats. He wanted South Carolina to go first in the process and not New Hampshire, and therefore New Hampshire's primary, which they said, no. Our state law says we have to go first is in violation of DNC rules.So, Biden is not appearing on the ballot to be in accordance with DNC rules. That's the little complication. But nearly two thirds of likely Democratic voters are still willing to write in his name. I don't think he has real concerns here about a damaging Democratic primary in the first in the nation state.",

I mean, recently it's not so much been that much of a question, but every state matters and you never know enthusiasm. Again, this is just a New Hampshire, this is among Democrats for Joe Biden.26 percent, only 26 percent say they're enthusiastic, satisfied 46 percent, dissatisfied and angry 21 and 4 percent. But if you look deeper, Audie Cornish, into this poll and you look at it by age, it's really striking. 10 percent say that they're enthusiastic. And when I say they, that's people under 50. And then over 50 is 41 percent. These are Democrats. AUDIE CORNISH, CNN ANCHOR &amp; CORRESPONDENT: I mean, nobody to be clear is enthusiastic about their choice right now. I feel like on either side of the ticket, like this is not a matchup, anybody really wanted to see again. And now, as it's getting closer people are paying closer attention. And they want to register their dismay in these kinds of surveys, you're going to see these numbers. For me, it's sort of hard to tease out given what's going on internationally and the generational divide within the Democratic Party on Israel and the war in Gaza. That is really striking. It's really pronounced, and I do think it can have an effect in these kinds of conversations in a way that often foreign policy numbers do not. I don't know, anyone else?",

Now it is a high bar. There is a two thirds majority required for something like expulsion, and as you noted, past efforts have failed. But now having the chairman of the House Ethics Committee behind this is significant. And meanwhile, the new Speaker Mike Johnson, he's essentially giving members the green light to vote their conscience. I want to read you part of the statement from his spokesman Raj Shah. He said, the speaker has reviewed the report and its very troubling findings. As members from both parties, members of the ethics committee and Representative Santos return to Congress after the Thanksgiving break. Speaker Johnson encourages all involved to consider the best interests of the institution as this matter is addressed further. So, we are expecting action at some point after the Thanksgiving break. And meanwhile, Santos put out a new tweet yesterday where he continued to bash this ethics report, continued to be defined it -- defiant here, continued to claim his innocence.
