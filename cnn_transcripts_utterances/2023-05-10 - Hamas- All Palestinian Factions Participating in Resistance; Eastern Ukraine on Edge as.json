Turkey's struggling economy has eroded incumbent Recep Tayyip Erdogan's popularity and allowed opposition candidate Kemal Kilicdaroglu to put up a strong fight. But despite domestic challenges during his time, President Erdogan became very assertive in strengthening Turkey's role on the world stage and expanding its foreign policy and influence beyond the region, launching military interventions in Libya and Syria, and renewing ties with Gulf nations while courting Russia and China that can sometimes come at the cost of jeopardizing Turkish relations with other countries. Jomana Karadsheh has more. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) JOMANA KARADSHEH, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice over): Turkey closed down this waterway to Russian warships when the war in Ukraine started. And it is through here the Bosphorus Strait that Ukrainian grain now flows to the world. It was Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ultimate balancing act, a stamp some describe as Pro Ukrainian without being anti-Russian that allowed him to play mediator and help broker a key grain deal between turkeys warring Black Sea neighbors, unlocking Ukrainian grain exports and helping to avert a global hunger crisis. Over the years Turkish foreign policy has come to resemble the country's president. It's combative with a personal touch. Erdogan has carved out a central role for himself and his country on the world stage. He meted out soft power with Turkish soap operas and launched a spree of diplomatic missions in capitals long ignored by the West. Erdogan back that with large investments in a growing defense industry that's made Turkey one of the world's top drone manufacturers. This key NATO member has had an uneasy alliance with its western partners Erdogan's leverage NATO membership for domestically important issues. Most recently, he's held up Sweden's accession to NATO in an attempt to secure cooperation from the Nordic nation on groups Turkey considers terrorists. Turkey's ongoing economic crisis has forced some diplomatic U-turns that were once unthinkable. Erdogan mended ties with oil rich regional foes, bringing in billions of dollars of investment and much needed hot currency. Turkish foreign policy under Erdogan has been full of dramatic twists and turns, crises that may at times have been exacerbated by the president's personality. But at the heart of these disagreements with allies, our national interest that will remain unchanged, no matter that emerges victorious in these most consequential of elections for a country that wields power and influence far beyond its borders.

The calculus in Ankara has been that this ultimately proved to inimical to Turkey's interest in the region. It has created tension with many of the countries in the region. And therefore there was a need to redress the situation and would therefore since the start of 2021, efforts to normalize relations, and some of this has succeeded, particularly with the United Arab Emirates, to a lesser extent with Saudi with Israel. And now there's an effort to do the same with Egypt and even with Syria. That's the first reason.

And more and more people are coming here to experience the region and it's culture for themselves. GIOKOS (on camera): I'm Eleni Giokos, and this month we're coming to you from the Arabian travel markets in Dubai. And this is \"Marketplace Middle East\". GIOKOS (voice over): For 30 years, the Arabian Travel Market has brought together travel professionals from around the world to discuss trends and innovation in the industry. The event hosted 7000 visitors in its first year. Fast forward to 2022, it attracted more than three times that number. It's just one example of the growth in the region's tourism sector. In the last decades, the Middle East has seen the opening of the iconic Burj Al Arab in Dubai, the Kingdom center in Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, the Museum of Islamic art in Qatar and Bahrain's World Trade Center, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the National Museum of Oman, and the Israel building in Saudi. The number of international arrivals to the region nearly doubled between 2004 and 2019.",

GIOKOS (voice over): Bahrain is one of the country's surpassing expectations. GIOKOS (on camera): This is beautiful. GIOKOS (voice over): Tourism revenues reached nearly $4 billion in 2022, 50 percent more than the original targets. GIOKOS (on camera): And look at that.

And one ofthe key things that we did differently in Bahrain is we started promoting Bahrain and the countries in the region as one destination. So when you have travelers that sail from Europe visiting behind, they also have an opportunity through Bahrain to visit other countries in the GCC as well. So ideally, they spend three or four days in Bahrain, and they move on to their journey to visit Saudi as well, which enriches their experience. And we found out that when we adopted that strategy, we found out that there's more interest from tourists to actually visit the region so it kind of gives you the idea how countries are actually interdependent when it comes to increasing the tourism numbers. (END VIDEOTAPE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) GIOKOS (on camera): Welcome back. As we delve into the region's tourism sector, it's hard not to think about the Middle East, the archaeological and historical sites. So let's take a look to see how the region is not only building skyscrapers, but also tapping into its heritage. GIOKOS (voice over): From the pyramids of Egypt, to Petra and Al Ula. Arab countries are home to nearly 8 percent of UNESCO's heritage sites.",

They want to know the cultural heritage of the country, which in the region also has an immense potential to grow and expand. GIOKOS (voice over): Jordan is home to one of the region's most famous monuments, the rose city of Petra; nearly 200,000 people visited the site in January and February. That's about 20 percent of the total number of visitors to the kingdom, with tourism increased by 135 percent in the first two months of 2023, compared to the same period last year.",

We already had all the natural beauty, we had the natural assets, we had to build the manmade assets. And so that's what we've done is we developing the tourism ecosystem. We also have a program called Hamaya, which we're training about 2500 locals to be ambassadors for the destination in a way that is, you know, authentic, but also allowing them to preserve and protect their heritage and to then to share it with a global audience. And then we're opening a hospitality school in a little bit to make sure we are preparing the young Saudi men and women for jobs in the tourism industry for the next generation. GIOKOS (voice over): And the next generation will also have plenty of jobs to choose from at the Diriyah project servicing around the 18th century district of --. The $17 billion mixed use development includes residences, retail, restaurants, and cultural attractions, more than 38 hotel operators are participating in the project.

And with that you see this new city that's being developed, but it's not a new city with skyscrapers. It's a new city that's paying homage to nudge the architecture. It's mud brick construction, it's human scale. GIOKOS (voice over): So whether it's diversifying their tourism offerings, involving the local community or being mindful of authentic construction, there are many ways the Middle East can ensure that sites of the past attract visitors of the future, ensuring that an already burgeoning sector continues to thrive.
